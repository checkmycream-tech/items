            <li>Good price, fast delivery, packed sufficiently to survive the trip, love the Tea Tree smell!</li>
            <li>She has oily hair and tried many products.</li>
            <li>and  it was a tad better</li>
            <li>One of my favorite &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; shampoos.</li>
            <li>I love tea tree oil</li>
            <li>and I love the product.  </li>
            <li>after using the shampoo for 4 weeks, it just made my dandruff more visible than usual.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I also tried it as well, and love how it makes my hair feel.  </li>
            <li>The smell is refreshing and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>

            <li>I love not having all the chemicals.</li>

            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Great for body wash, too.&lt;br /&gt;Great service and fast shipping by provider.</li>
            <li>First, I knew that tea tree oil is good for oily skin.</li>
            <li>As is becoming the norm with most tea tree soaps and shampoos these days...</li>
            <li>Pretty satisfied with this!</li>
            <li>If you want something that leaves your hair refreshed and clean give this a try. :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this shampoo is great for others, but it made my scalp break out after only two uses.</li>
            <li>, it was a bit strong.</li>
            <li>It has a nice tea tree/menthol smell and lathers up pretty well.  </li>
            <li>smells good, works great, not ingredient heavy!</li>
            <li>I like this shampoo, the smell is not too strong and once the hair is dry, you can&#x27;t smell the tea tree oil; it tingles nicely on the scalp and my hair looks good after using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>This is the best shampoo I have tried in a long time.... feels fresh and clean on my hair.</li>
            <li>Fantastic smell--minty and fresh.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fantastic stuff.</li>
            <li>I tried it till the last drop so about a month to be fair and be able to give a review.</li>
            <li>This is a nice tea tree oil shampoo; wish the old version hadn&#x27;t been changed, the added peppermint is ok.</li>
            <li>A fine, clean result, though not long-lasting.</li>
            <li>Pretty sure that any good reviews you find of this product are for the old version, which was fabulous.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if it does anything fabulous for my hair/scalp, but it gets it clean...</li>
            <li>I find this shampoo very refreshing, and it soothe my sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>I wish I could have tried the old formula, because the new formula is pretty awesome.  </li>
            <li>I used it for about a week, and noticed my hair was oily, and didn&#x27;t feel clean at all.</li>
            <li>Desert Essence is great for what hair is left making it feel fresh.</li>
            <li>I have tried numerous shampoos and this one is by far the very best.</li>
            <li>It does what I need it to do, which is keep my hair clean.</li>
            <li>Natures Gate a bit better than whole foods brand, but still not</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t put into words how much I love this shampoo, and it lasts forever.</li>
            <li>Because it isn&#x27;t very foamy, I find that it take a greater amount to coat my hair while washing.</li>
            <li>It virtually eliminated my dandruff and it did eliminate my mild eczema.</li>
            <li>this is a great product leaves the hair clean and kills little things that shouldn&#x27;t grow there.</li>
            <li>The list of ingredients was very good, it did not contain harsh chemicals and seemed pretty non-toxic from what I could tell.</li>
            <li>It smells terrific and my hair has never felt better!</li>
            <li>To me it is worth it.</li>
            <li>Tea tree oil, for those of us that are familiar with it, has a very pungent smell...</li>
            <li>hair would be smooth and soft after using this, more so than the other products :) So far I am hooked on this one unless I find a better vegan one.</li>
            <li>After the very first time I used it, I could easily tell it left my hair clean.</li>
            <li>Some of the reviews say that this shampoo was reformulated within the last couple of years and the new formula with menthol isn&#x27;t as good.  </li>
            <li>At first she didn&#x27;t like the smell</li>
            <li>and I really can&#x27;t wait!</li>
            <li>Great shampoo -- especially for anyone with a dry, itchy scalp.  </li>
            <li>It was also pretty reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>As to my husbands acne, he rotates between this shampoo and head and shoulders Shampoo and for the first time in ten years, is free of acne on his scalp.</li>
            <li>I can buy my own shampoo and add tea tree oil for less.  </li>
            <li>But when her hair was dry, the smell was gone and she loves her hair fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I have tried Whole Foods 365 and Nature&#x27;s Gate Shampoos.</li>
            <li>after I started using this problem, my hair stopped falling out as much.</li>
            <li>So I try to lather as much as I can</li>
            <li>Also shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li>It can&#x27;t really be masked.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle on the skin and has a very mellow scent.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast, arrived fast.</li>
            <li>I have naturally (very) curly hair</li>
            <li>Works as good as those typical drugstore chemical-filled shampoos, the only thing is it does not foam up too much.</li>
            <li>I definitely will not order again because it&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is if I skip a day of washing, my hair gets super greasy and I have never had that problem otherwise</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this shampoo,after reading the 5 stars reviews.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Be careful not to use to much at once, very very foamy.</li>
            <li>WOW I can tell the difference, if you have sensitive skin try instead &amp;</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was the strange odor when I began to lather.</li>
            <li>I bought this at my local whole foods.</li>
            <li>No issues so far.</li>
            <li>So far I like this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this was going to be good, so I bought 2 bottles, but I bet wrong.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a tea tree shampoo lately that will calm an itchy/dandruff scalp, and this one works very well for that.  </li>
            <li>kept using it to give it a chance and the first week I washed every other day</li>
            <li>#34;Nature&#x27;s Gate Organics Shampoo,Tea Tree Oil &amp; Blue Cypress, 12-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)&amp;#34; with just one wash and WOW</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;m not a huge fan of this shampoo, I buy it because it is responsibly sourced (or at least it seems to be) and the ingredients are more natural than other shampoos.</li>
            <li>The tea tree oil and other essential oils have reduced how much my hair sheds, because they stimulate the scalp and promote skin renewal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other tea tree shampoos without an issue, so I was very surprised by my reaction.</li>

            <li> Only shampoo for dry itchy scalp period.</li>
            <li> I usually have normal hair.</li>
            <li> I use it once a week in addition to my Rahua shampoo (which I use daily or sometimes every other day) and my Rahua conditioner (which I use once a week, too).</li>
            <li> I use this regularly alternately with other shampoos I have.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner dry my hair out quite a lot.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 months and my scalp is getting dry and itchy.  </li>
            <li> Unless your hair is really really dry.</li>

            <li> My hair didn&#x27;t dry out like it does with other shampoos.</li>
            <li> and I find that it works about as well as any other standard varieties you find at a typical drugstore.</li>

            <li> It irritated it and made more dandruff than what I had :(&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> Good: Fantastic smell--minty and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad: Doesn&#x27;t lather well; I end up using about the size of 3 quarters of shampoo to make it foam while I lather my hair. Pretty expensive considering this product only lasted me a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t seem to make any difference in my hair compared to a nonorganic product. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is good, we use it as dog shampoo.  One of our dogs has severs skin issues and is allergic to everything, she get bald spots and what looks like mange, after a month of using this her hair is growing back and she has almost stopped itching all together.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product. She has oily hair and tried many products.She told me this is the best she has ever used so far. At first she didn&#x27;t like the smell, it was a bit strong. But when her hair was dry, the smell was gone and she loves her hair fresh and clean. Nice product and she knows she will continue using it.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo, the smell is not too strong and once the hair is dry, you can&#x27;t smell the tea tree oil; it tingles nicely on the scalp and my hair looks good after using this shampoo. I use it once a week in addition to my Rahua shampoo (which I use daily or sometimes every other day) and my Rahua conditioner (which I use once a week, too).</li>
            <li> I have tried Whole Foods 365 and Nature&#x27;s Gate Shampoos. None of those worked out well for me I think. Natures Gate a bit better than whole foods brand, but still not quite what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon after I started using this problem, my hair stopped falling out as much. Not sure if it&#x27;s related...but maybe. It also smells amazing and makes you scalp tingle!! You can feel the tea tree on your head!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair would be smooth and soft after using this, more so than the other products :) So far I am hooked on this one unless I find a better vegan one.</li>
            <li> this is a great product leaves the hair clean and kills little things that shouldn&#x27;t grow there.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo I have tried in a long time.... feels fresh and clean on my hair.</li>
            <li> I was very, very disappointed to discover that this shampoo contained wheat!!!!! I have purchased this same shampoo in a smaller container and it did not have wheat. Having Celiac Disease, I cannot use this shampoo. I wasted my money! Why would they have wheat as an ingredient in shampoo? Ridiculous!!!</li>
            <li> Smells great! I use the shampoo/conditioner. Don&#x27;t know if it does anything fabulous for my hair/scalp, but it gets it clean...</li>
            <li> Great value. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  Does have a smell of Tea Tree, but I like that! Not perfummy...</li>
            <li> I was looking for a shampoo without all the chemicals and additives of commercial products. This is it. I like it and plan to buy it again.</li>
            <li> So I bought this &amp;#34;Desert Essence Daily Replenishing Shampoo with Tea Tree and Lavender Oil&lt;br /&gt;by Desert Essence&amp;#34; and it broke my skin scalp! It irritated it and made more dandruff than what I had :(&lt;br /&gt;I kept using it to give it a chance and the first week I washed every other day my hair and the result was the same. Then one week every day and  it was a tad better but my scalp was SO irritated, red, and my poor scalp breaking up. I tried it till the last drop so about a month to be fair and be able to give a review. Then I bought a differnt brand and WOW I can tell the difference, if you have sensitive skin try instead &amp;#34;Nature&#x27;s Gate Organics Shampoo,Tea Tree Oil &amp; Blue Cypress, 12-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)&amp;#34; with just one wash and WOW this second brand was WAY better, sad that not so for Dessert Essence brand.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I find this shampoo very refreshing, and it soothe my sensitive scalp. (Great delivery -- No spilling!  I always appreciate that).</li>
            <li> One of my favorite &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; shampoos. Does the trick without all the nasty additives and chemicals.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this was going to be good, so I bought 2 bottles, but I bet wrong.  The shampoo and conditioner dry my hair out quite a lot.  Even after using a lot of the tea tree oil conditioner, it&#x27;s not doing a lot to nourish my hair.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 months and my scalp is getting dry and itchy.  I usually have normal hair.</li>
            <li> Great hair shampoo.  I love tea tree oil and I love the product.  Just what I expect from all Desert Essence products.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this shampoo,after reading the 5 stars reviews.&lt;br /&gt;But after using the shampoo for 4 weeks, it just made my dandruff more visible than usual.&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo did not help my scalp at all.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get away from the shampoos that are not so good for my hair, so I thought to give this one a try. The first thing I noticed was the strange odor when I began to lather. It was a peppermint smell with something else behind it, but I couldn&#x27;t put my finger on it. I used it for about a week, and noticed my hair was oily, and didn&#x27;t feel clean at all. I went back to my other shampoo, and sadly, this one I won&#x27;t ever use again. It might work for someone else, but not for me.</li>
            <li> Good, genuine product.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on reviews for my husband who has a problem with acne on his scalp. I also tried it as well, and love how it makes my hair feel.  The smell is refreshing and not overpowering. As to my husbands acne, he rotates between this shampoo and head and shoulders Shampoo and for the first time in ten years, is free of acne on his scalp. Fantastic stuff.</li>
            <li> Smells great, washes great, glad I bought it. Be careful not to use to much at once, very very foamy.</li>
            <li> smells good, works great, not ingredient heavy!</li>
            <li> I use this regularly alternately with other shampoos I have.  Desert Essence is great for what hair is left making it feel fresh.</li>
            <li> Pretty sure that any good reviews you find of this product are for the old version, which was fabulous.  The new version is awful, and is what you will get, since the old version is not available anymore.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo -- especially for anyone with a dry, itchy scalp.  Love it.  I have tried numerous shampoos and this one is by far the very best.</li>
            <li> I bought this at my local whole foods. I was looking for a shampoo for oily hair. After spending a hour reading all the labels, I chose this for several reasons. First, I knew that tea tree oil is good for oily skin. It was also pretty reasonably priced. The list of ingredients was very good, it did not contain harsh chemicals and seemed pretty non-toxic from what I could tell. After the very first time I used it, I could easily tell it left my hair clean. Works as good as those typical drugstore chemical-filled shampoos, the only thing is it does not foam up too much. So I try to lather as much as I can so I don&#x27;t waste product. I mean what do you expect from a natural non-toxic shampoo. To me it is worth it. Pretty satisfied with this! I&#x27;d say it would work for any hair type, not just oily. Unless your hair is really really dry. If you want something that leaves your hair refreshed and clean give this a try. :)</li>
            <li> Sellers were great and shipped fast. Product contains wheat. Had to throw away.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. The best tea tree shampoo I have tried. My hair didn&#x27;t dry out like it does with other shampoos. Also shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Only shampoo for dry itchy scalp period.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t put into words how much I love this shampoo, and it lasts forever. I find that I need less of it than cheaper alternatives. I just use a quarter-sized amount, work into a lather, and rinse and repeat. The tea tree oil has made my hair softer and shinier than it&#x27;s ever been. I have never tried the conditioner, but I just ordered a bottle and I really can&#x27;t wait!</li>
            <li> This shampoo has helped improve my dry scalp.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo. I love not having all the chemicals. After trying tons of dandruff/dry scalp shampoos, this has worked the best so far. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is if I skip a day of washing, my hair gets super greasy and I have never had that problem otherwise</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews on this product from both this listing and others here on Amazon.  Some of the reviews say that this shampoo was reformulated within the last couple of years and the new formula with menthol isn&#x27;t as good.  I wish I could have tried the old formula, because the new formula is pretty awesome.  I&#x27;ve been searching for a tea tree shampoo lately that will calm an itchy/dandruff scalp, and this one works very well for that.  It is also not as drying as some of the other tea tree shampoos I have tried.  It has a nice tea tree/menthol smell and lathers up pretty well.  Itch is greatly reduced, and dandruff is all but gone!  Think I&#x27;ll order the 3 pack next time to save some $$$.</li>
            <li> Good price, fast delivery, packed sufficiently to survive the trip, love the Tea Tree smell! Rinses well with no residue. No issues so far. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is just okay.  I definitely will not order again because it&#x27;s nothing special. It does lather well though.</li>
            <li> A fine, clean result, though not long-lasting.</li>
            <li> As is becoming the norm with most tea tree soaps and shampoos these days...there is hardly any tea tree oil in this.  Tea tree oil, for those of us that are familiar with it, has a very pungent smell...even when diluted.  It can&#x27;t really be masked.  I can buy my own shampoo and add tea tree oil for less.  Probably what I will do next time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this shampoo is great for others, but it made my scalp break out after only two uses. I went back to my previous shampoo for now until I find something else I like. I&#x27;ve used other tea tree shampoos without an issue, so I was very surprised by my reaction.</li>
            <li> GREAT FOR HAIR AND SCALP PROBLEMS.</li>
            <li> This is a safe shampoo, which I buy for itchy scalp, because it contains tea tree oil, and it&#x27;s very good.</li>
            <li> This is very good for my hair. It virtually eliminated my dandruff and it did eliminate my mild eczema. It is gentle on the skin and has a very mellow scent. Give it a try!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent shampoo, it gets your hair really clean without leaving unwanted residues.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. Great for body wash, too.&lt;br /&gt;Great service and fast shipping by provider.</li>
            <li> This is a really great shampoo!  It smells terrific and my hair has never felt better!</li>
            <li> Great product, gret seller!!! Shipped fast, arrived fast. Product works great and smell wonderful! Thx!</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m not a huge fan of this shampoo, I buy it because it is responsibly sourced (or at least it seems to be) and the ingredients are more natural than other shampoos. It does what I need it to do, which is keep my hair clean. Because it isn&#x27;t very foamy, I find that it take a greater amount to coat my hair while washing. I have naturally (very) curly hair and I find that it works about as well as any other standard varieties you find at a typical drugstore.</li>
            <li> This is a nice tea tree oil shampoo; wish the old version hadn&#x27;t been changed, the added peppermint is ok.</li>
            <li> Smells good. Helps control flaky scalp. No complaints</li>
            <li> So far I like this shampoo. The tea tree oil and other essential oils have reduced how much my hair sheds, because they stimulate the scalp and promote skin renewal. I do not much like the menthol, however. It irritates my scalp a bit. I can&#x27;t use this shampoo every day.</li>
