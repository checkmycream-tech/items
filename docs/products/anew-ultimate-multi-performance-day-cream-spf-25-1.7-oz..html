            <li>I think it would be good for anyone no matter age or skin type.  </li>

            <li>I love this cream and the value!</li>

            <li>This is the best price I have found for this product here on Amazon, and it really does make a difference..</li>

            <li>I have used this product for over 10 years and it is wonderful for mature skin.  </li>

            <li>More than satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Not saying that it will do so to most people</li>
            <li>and none are better than this.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite Avon product.</li>
            <li>I just love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I love everything I have ever used in this line.  </li>
            <li>for me: not sticky, SPF great, just like it, cannot always reach Avon representative, and a reasonable price here..</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>love all the Anew products.</li>
            <li>either way work for me. :)</li>
            <li>I love this product would recommend to anyone, have been using it for many years now.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, more lines would appear.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>How lovely my skin looked.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite skin cream EVER.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what makes it so silky-smooth, but I wish there were more creams like it.</li>
            <li>I found the Avon Anew Genics, though and like it better.</li>
            <li>Love this face cream.</li>
            <li>Love both day and night cream.  </li>
            <li>USE THIS EXCLUSIVELY FOR MANY YEARS.  </li>
            <li>Got a better price on Amazon</li>
            <li>I Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different face creams over the years and for my aging skin (I am 56), it is the best!</li>
            <li>Many sunscreens irritate my eyes, but this one does not.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Gives skin a healthy appearance.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s spring or summer I need to add some powder on top to prevent oily shine.</li>
            <li>I bought it for her, she&#x27;s in love.</li>
            <li>Have been using Anew for more than 10 years and would never use another product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>though I can&#x27;t know for sure if it made the difference, this has been my preferred moisturizer for years.</li>
            <li>My husband is buying me this product for more than a decade now</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying the 7s night cream as we speak :)</li>
            <li>Both of my daughters now use this, too, and also love it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love the feel of this cream on my face.  </li>
            <li>Wife&#x27;s very  pleased with product, priced just right</li>
            <li>Most important it has an SPF of 25 which helps to keep sun spots from showing up on your face.</li>
            <li>Always a favorite, keeps skin smooth.</li>
            <li>and it was shipped very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff, make my dry face feel great.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and makes my skin feel great...helps with fine lines and over all glow..</li>
            <li>or I have a huge case of denial....</li>
            <li>It is non-greasy and fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>skin is smooth and creamy.  </li>
            <li>Goes on with great coverage and only need to use sparingly.  </li>
            <li>This is the third jar of this I&#x27;ve had and it is a great product.  </li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and wrinkle free and</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the feel and the smell.</li>
            <li>Product wise it does not increase my adult acne</li>
            <li>It feels good on my skin and has a soft fragrance to it.</li>
            <li>Switched from &amp;#34;Ultimate Anew Day Cream&amp;#34; and am enjoying the improvement I&#x27;ve seen on my complexion to even smoother and more evenly toned, plus the fragrance is much softer and pleasing so that it&#x27;s not assulting your sinus&#x27;s as well as clashing with any perfumes you may wear...</li>
            <li>I can tell the difference right after I apply it, and last throughout the day, and on a fairly seldom mentioned note, I must point out that it also has an amazing SPF 15 that really lasts!!  </li>
            <li>The cream is rich.  </li>
            <li>I have been using anew for the past year and it works great!</li>
            <li>It is great for dry skin and provides a sunscreen as well.</li>
            <li>It is light, but not greasy and absorbs quickly into my skin.</li>
            <li>Both work very well and as good as any of the high price creams.</li>
            <li>stuff makes my skin look sooooooooooo good and it instantly takes</li>
            <li>I use this as my day lotion to wear under my full makeup each morning.  </li>
            <li>Avon facial products are superior.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny of its cost.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that my wrinkles are more smooth and my face is just brighter overall!</li>
            <li>Not crazy about the fragrance of this product.  </li>
            <li>Under the cream I use Hauschka Rose cream for extra moisturizing and glow.</li>
            <li>My skin looks wonderful, wrinkles are decreased and it has even tone and is well moisturized.</li>
            <li>Tried it right away</li>
            <li>It is the right price and there is no other better product out there.  </li>
            <li>Avon&#x27;s Anew Ultimate 7s Cream is hands down the best, and my skin has never felt so nourished and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Compared to drugstore anti-aging products like L&#x27;oreal, Olay, Garnier, I think it works a little bit better for moisturizing and for a better skin tone.</li>
            <li>Keeps the skin smooth and young!</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This definitely has a rich texture but the fragrance is way too strong, and I didn&#x27;t really notice any benefits.</li>
            <li>Maybe I should say better than all moisturizers I personally have tried.</li>
            <li>Love it, especially as it is cheaper here than Avon!</li>
            <li>have used many products and they either did not work or worked for a short time and then, stopped.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That was the first thing I noticed.  </li>
            <li>Lovely product, been using for two years and look younger now (I think).</li>
            <li>This has always been my favorite moisturizer/sunscreen, and I&#x27;m just coming back to it.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m a 37 year old male, and proud to say most think I&#x27;m 30 or less)  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the new fragrance, which is a bit strong, but it doesn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
            <li>Delivered quickly and better than most expensive brands in dept. stores.</li>
            <li>I usually like Avon&#x27;s products, in fact I used to be a representative some years ago and loved Anew, but must admit that this particular one did not agree with my skin</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It really made a difference.</li>
            <li>, I really did not have much for lines or anything until about a year ago.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really like this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This Ultimate 7s does have a light scent to it.</li>
            <li>This cream is smooth and and helps my skin look younger.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Avon and my mom&#x27;s genes @46</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li>Being over 50, it&#x27;s really made a difference in smoothing over the crinkles.  </li>
            <li>and my whole face looks oily and shiny.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t express how much trust I have in each product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 44 so definitely need something rich.</li>
            <li>A good fairly inexpensive face cream that isn&#x27;t thick and makes a nice base for foundation.  </li>
            <li>As I get older, I am noticing that it is not as helpful as it once was.</li>
            <li>I mainly have used it in the winter when skin is a bit drier</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this lotion, I have using this for over 5 years now.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, as it keeps your face moisturized and helps with the elasticity in your skin.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>In December 2013 I decided to try anew ultimate \\&quot;try-it\\&quot; size on a experimental basis as I needed something inexpensive and quick as i had ran out of my Clinique moisturizer and with Christmas around the bend really could not spare 30.00 plus dollars on a moisturizer when there were gifts to be bought.  </li>
            <li>one of my best friends and my college roomate came to see me this past week, the last time we saw each other was in the summer (2013),when she saw me, she said what are doing?  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for a little over one year and love the way it makes your skin feel.</li>
            <li>I use all the anew products and I feel, as a mature woman they have improved the quality of my skin!!</li>
            <li>Has a little more oil than needed, but I blot it with tissue paper.</li>
            <li>I love the product, but for some reason I got 4 small jars instead of one large jar...</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I&#x27;m out the cost of the product but made my friend happy....</li>
            <li>Really enjoy that the lotion is a very thick/creamy consistency while somehow not feeling greasy or heavy on my skin, especially considering that I put on full makeup over it and have oily skin.  </li>
            <li>I normally use the drugstore brands but wanted to give this a try.</li>
            <li>New ones are not popping up like before.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>They have worked for me and they keep coming up with something new.</li>
            <li>I have been using Avon since I was a very young.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Avon skin care since I was 11 yrs old, and at 51 , people are surprised to find out how old I really am.</li>
            <li>and my gosh there was a big difference in my deep wrinkles and the over all look of my skin right away!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need very much so lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>SKIN SEEMS BETTER SECONDARY TO FAITHFUL APPLICATION OF 7&#x27;S DAY AND NIGHT CREAM.</li>
            <li>Why do you look so young</li>
            <li>and I look so old?</li>
            <li>This cream makes your skin so soft and dewy.  </li>
            <li>Either I look young for my age</li>
            <li>I always use this.keeps skin soft.</li>
            <li>This is an old standby product.</li>
            <li>I spend a lot of time outdoors and this cream keeps my skin hydrated and soft.  </li>
            <li>This cream is a perfect base for make-up.</li>
            <li>I try new products every now &amp; then just to see what&#x27;s out there, but I always come back to this product.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t mind getting older as long as I don&#x27;t have to look it.</li>
            <li>While I would run out pretty quick with Olay, I am using much much less of the anew per jar.&lt;br /&gt;Along with the serum, I find my skin improving everyday.</li>
            <li>I am 56.9 years old with very dry, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I like this so much that I compare all other moisturizers against it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using for too long to see long term results but currently I find this product a little lacking because it doesn&#x27;t seem to be absorbed into the skin</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love the Anew products and Amazon pricing can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> Love Avon products!</li>
            <li> I love this cream and the value!</li>
            <li> The price is good, on Amazon, better than the Avon webiste.</li>
            <li> it works so good on most skin types..  </li>
            <li> This is the best price I have found for this product here on Amazon, and it really does make a difference..</li>
            <li> Best day cream I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 10 years and it is wonderful for mature skin.  </li>
            <li> Is one of the most effective cream on the market for the price.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this cream!  </li>
            <li> More than satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Not saying that it will do so to most people</li>
            <li> and none are better than this.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Avon product.</li>
            <li> I just love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love everything I have ever used in this line.  </li>
            <li> for me: not sticky, SPF great, just like it, cannot always reach Avon representative, and a reasonable price here..</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> love all the Anew products.</li>
            <li> either way work for me. :)</li>
            <li> I love this product would recommend to anyone, have been using it for many years now.</li>
            <li> In the meantime, more lines would appear.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> How lovely my skin looked.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite skin cream EVER.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what makes it so silky-smooth, but I wish there were more creams like it.</li>
            <li> I found the Avon Anew Genics, though and like it better.</li>
            <li> Love this face cream.</li>
            <li> Love both day and night cream.  </li>
            <li> USE THIS EXCLUSIVELY FOR MANY YEARS.  </li>
            <li> Got a better price on Amazon</li>
            <li> I Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many different face creams over the years and for my aging skin (I am 56), it is the best!</li>
            <li> Many sunscreens irritate my eyes, but this one does not.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Gives skin a healthy appearance.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s spring or summer I need to add some powder on top to prevent oily shine.</li>
            <li> I bought it for her, she&#x27;s in love.</li>
            <li> Have been using Anew for more than 10 years and would never use another product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love.</li>
            <li> though I can&#x27;t know for sure if it made the difference, this has been my preferred moisturizer for years.</li>
            <li> My husband is buying me this product for more than a decade now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying the 7s night cream as we speak :)</li>
            <li> Both of my daughters now use this, too, and also love it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this cream on my face.  </li>
            <li> Wife&#x27;s very  pleased with product, priced just right</li>
            <li> Most important it has an SPF of 25 which helps to keep sun spots from showing up on your face.</li>
            <li> Always a favorite, keeps skin smooth.</li>
            <li> and it was shipped very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff, make my dry face feel great.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and makes my skin feel great...helps with fine lines and over all glow..</li>
            <li> or I have a huge case of denial....</li>
            <li> It is non-greasy and fragrance free.  </li>
            <li> skin is smooth and creamy.  </li>
            <li> Goes on with great coverage and only need to use sparingly.  </li>
            <li> This is the third jar of this I&#x27;ve had and it is a great product.  </li>
            <li> My skin is smooth and wrinkle free and</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the feel and the smell.</li>
            <li> Product wise it does not increase my adult acne</li>
            <li> It feels good on my skin and has a soft fragrance to it.</li>
            <li> Switched from &amp;#34;Ultimate Anew Day Cream&amp;#34; and am enjoying the improvement I&#x27;ve seen on my complexion to even smoother and more evenly toned, plus the fragrance is much softer and pleasing so that it&#x27;s not assulting your sinus&#x27;s as well as clashing with any perfumes you may wear...</li>
            <li> I can tell the difference right after I apply it, and last throughout the day, and on a fairly seldom mentioned note, I must point out that it also has an amazing SPF 15 that really lasts!!  </li>
            <li> The cream is rich.  </li>
            <li> I have been using anew for the past year and it works great!</li>
            <li> It is great for dry skin and provides a sunscreen as well.</li>
            <li> It is light, but not greasy and absorbs quickly into my skin.</li>
            <li> Both work very well and as good as any of the high price creams.</li>
            <li> stuff makes my skin look sooooooooooo good and it instantly takes</li>
            <li> I use this as my day lotion to wear under my full makeup each morning.  </li>
            <li> Avon facial products are superior.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny of its cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that my wrinkles are more smooth and my face is just brighter overall!</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the fragrance of this product.  </li>
            <li> Under the cream I use Hauschka Rose cream for extra moisturizing and glow.</li>
            <li> My skin looks wonderful, wrinkles are decreased and it has even tone and is well moisturized.</li>
            <li> Tried it right away</li>
            <li> It is the right price and there is no other better product out there.  </li>
            <li> Avon&#x27;s Anew Ultimate 7s Cream is hands down the best, and my skin has never felt so nourished and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Compared to drugstore anti-aging products like L&#x27;oreal, Olay, Garnier, I think it works a little bit better for moisturizing and for a better skin tone.</li>
            <li> Keeps the skin smooth and young!</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This definitely has a rich texture but the fragrance is way too strong, and I didn&#x27;t really notice any benefits.</li>
            <li> Maybe I should say better than all moisturizers I personally have tried.</li>
            <li> Love it, especially as it is cheaper here than Avon!</li>
            <li> have used many products and they either did not work or worked for a short time and then, stopped.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That was the first thing I noticed.  </li>
            <li> Lovely product, been using for two years and look younger now (I think).</li>
            <li> This has always been my favorite moisturizer/sunscreen, and I&#x27;m just coming back to it.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m a 37 year old male, and proud to say most think I&#x27;m 30 or less)  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the new fragrance, which is a bit strong, but it doesn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly and better than most expensive brands in dept. stores.</li>
            <li> I usually like Avon&#x27;s products, in fact I used to be a representative some years ago and loved Anew, but must admit that this particular one did not agree with my skin</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> It really made a difference.</li>
            <li> , I really did not have much for lines or anything until about a year ago.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This Ultimate 7s does have a light scent to it.</li>
            <li> This cream is smooth and and helps my skin look younger.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Avon and my mom&#x27;s genes @46</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> Being over 50, it&#x27;s really made a difference in smoothing over the crinkles.  </li>
            <li> and my whole face looks oily and shiny.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t express how much trust I have in each product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 44 so definitely need something rich.</li>
            <li> A good fairly inexpensive face cream that isn&#x27;t thick and makes a nice base for foundation.  </li>
            <li> As I get older, I am noticing that it is not as helpful as it once was.</li>
            <li> I mainly have used it in the winter when skin is a bit drier</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this lotion, I have using this for over 5 years now.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, as it keeps your face moisturized and helps with the elasticity in your skin.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> In December 2013 I decided to try anew ultimate \\&quot;try-it\\&quot; size on a experimental basis as I needed something inexpensive and quick as i had ran out of my Clinique moisturizer and with Christmas around the bend really could not spare 30.00 plus dollars on a moisturizer when there were gifts to be bought.  </li>
            <li> one of my best friends and my college roomate came to see me this past week, the last time we saw each other was in the summer (2013),when she saw me, she said what are doing?  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for a little over one year and love the way it makes your skin feel.</li>
            <li> I use all the anew products and I feel, as a mature woman they have improved the quality of my skin!!</li>
            <li> Has a little more oil than needed, but I blot it with tissue paper.</li>
            <li> I love the product, but for some reason I got 4 small jars instead of one large jar...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I&#x27;m out the cost of the product but made my friend happy....</li>
            <li> Really enjoy that the lotion is a very thick/creamy consistency while somehow not feeling greasy or heavy on my skin, especially considering that I put on full makeup over it and have oily skin.  </li>
            <li> I normally use the drugstore brands but wanted to give this a try.</li>
            <li> New ones are not popping up like before.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> They have worked for me and they keep coming up with something new.</li>
            <li> I have been using Avon since I was a very young.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Avon skin care since I was 11 yrs old, and at 51 , people are surprised to find out how old I really am.</li>
            <li> and my gosh there was a big difference in my deep wrinkles and the over all look of my skin right away!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need very much so lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> SKIN SEEMS BETTER SECONDARY TO FAITHFUL APPLICATION OF 7&#x27;S DAY AND NIGHT CREAM.</li>
            <li> Why do you look so young</li>
            <li> and I look so old?</li>
            <li> This cream makes your skin so soft and dewy.  </li>
            <li> Either I look young for my age</li>
            <li> I always use this.keeps skin soft.</li>
            <li> This is an old standby product.</li>
            <li> I spend a lot of time outdoors and this cream keeps my skin hydrated and soft.  </li>
            <li> This cream is a perfect base for make-up.</li>
            <li> I try new products every now &amp; then just to see what&#x27;s out there, but I always come back to this product.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t mind getting older as long as I don&#x27;t have to look it.</li>
            <li> While I would run out pretty quick with Olay, I am using much much less of the anew per jar.&lt;br /&gt;Along with the serum, I find my skin improving everyday.</li>
            <li> I am 56.9 years old with very dry, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I like this so much that I compare all other moisturizers against it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using for too long to see long term results but currently I find this product a little lacking because it doesn&#x27;t seem to be absorbed into the skin</li>
            <li> recommend the Avon Anew Ultimate to anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> then some of my alarming lines that deepened over the last year have smoothed out and lessened.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels firm and soft.</li>
            <li> I like the packaging of the lotion as well, since I feel you can get every last bit of lotion out of the jar with the wide mouth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll have to see what it does long term.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t used and didn&#x27;t take a long time to get to me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products but always come back to this.</li>
            <li> it took a couple of tried but the ultimate is the closest to what i was using and i am not allergic like i am with some of the other anews.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m switching my moisturizer as long as it&#x27;s not discontinued!</li>
            <li> Even blotting only helps slightly.  </li>
            <li> However, because of the strong chemicals in sunscreen, I wouldn&#x27;t plan on using this as a night cream unless you are desperate.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> but it had a different feel than the Reversalist i tried using a few years ago.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other pricier products and found they did not do for my skin what this does.</li>
            <li> Have been using this and other Avon moisturizers for a while now</li>
            <li> I have use this everyday for a very long time, it seems to work well for me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Another thing I noticed is how much less I use.  </li>
            <li> like a slight scent</li>
            <li> I was beginning to accept my wrinkles and dried up skin until I tried this face cream.</li>
            <li> The Anew Day cream is a must for anyone wanting  youthful and firm looking skin.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I do not know why they even bother with the other lines...</li>
            <li> Other creams make me break out, this one does not-- love it!</li>
            <li> either i still get my acne around that time of the month, but i would say, that here lately i have noticed it is slowing down somewhat</li>
            <li> Avon does it again, I look 20 years younger, serious!!</li>
            <li> am using this combined with the  Anew clinical concentrate and can hardly wait to see my face in a week!!!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> It is very thick, yet not sticky or too heavy.</li>
            <li> I swear by this cream and have used Anew for at least 25 years.  </li>
            <li> LESS EXPENSIVE WOULD HELP.</li>
            <li> SERIOUSLY....</li>
            <li> The brand is a little expensive to me</li>
            <li> those annoying lines around your mouth, jowls and low cheeks have lessened so much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus, the prices on Amazon are hard to beat!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used some very expensive face creams (including GM Colin Native Gel @$60+ for 1.7 oz.)</li>
            <li> A man at my son&#x27;s basketball game thought my husband&#x27;s ex wife was my mother in law!!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed it was basically sunscreen cream.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My wife uses this every day.</li>
            <li> I find this product is all it professes to be.  It is the right price and there is no other better product out there.  I have tried other pricier products and found they did not do for my skin what this does.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a bout 10 years. As I get older, I am noticing that it is not as helpful as it once was. The price is good, on Amazon, better than the Avon webiste. I just think  might have to find something else soon as I am noticing a lot of changes in my skin now that I am over 60.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. The cream is rich.  It only takes a litte for my face and neck.  My face feels softer and smoother.  I like the SPF too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what I wanted, but I guess they don&#x27;t sell what I had anymore cause I can&#x27;t find it.  It&#x27;s good tho</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this lotion, I have using this for over 5 years now. Keeps the skin smooth and young!</li>
            <li> delivery in excellent conditions packaging and on time, perfect product (new) as described. Thank you!</li>
            <li> More than satisfied.  The results are astounding!</li>
            <li> I like this product, it works well.</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly and better than most expensive brands in dept. stores. Maybe I should say better than all moisturizers I personally have tried.</li>
            <li> I have tried every product out there including ones that were well over $100 for a smaller bottle.  Avon&#x27;s Anew Ultimate 7s Cream is hands down the best, and my skin has never felt so nourished and moisturized. I am in my mid-40&#x27;s and I have no wrinkles.  I attribute it to this product. Plus, the prices on Amazon are hard to beat!!</li>
            <li> I have use this everyday for a very long time, it seems to work well for me.  I plan to continue using it.</li>
            <li> Avon does it again, I look 20 years younger, serious!! I was beginning to accept my wrinkles and dried up skin until I tried this face cream. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in it, but it is AWESOME!!!</li>
            <li> Wife&#x27;s very  pleased with product, priced just right</li>
            <li> SKIN SEEMS BETTER SECONDARY TO FAITHFUL APPLICATION OF 7&#x27;S DAY AND NIGHT CREAM. I FIND GENEROUS APPLICATIONS ARE NECESSARY. LESS EXPENSIVE WOULD HELP.</li>
            <li> I usually like Avon&#x27;s products, in fact I used to be a representative some years ago and loved Anew, but must admit that this particular one did not agree with my skin and I did not care for its scent.  I tend to get migraines from different scents and this one gave me a migraine and also broke my face out.  Not saying that it will do so to most people but it is what happened with me.  I gave it to a friend of mine and she loves it.  Unfortunately I&#x27;m out the cost of the product but made my friend happy....so there&#x27;s an upside to the downside I guess lol</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used some very expensive face creams (including GM Colin Native Gel @$60+ for 1.7 oz.) and none are better than this. Use it every morning and don&#x27;t need additional sunscreen, get lots of compliments on my skin. Other creams make me break out, this one does not-- love it! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> In December 2013 I decided to try anew ultimate \\&quot;try-it\\&quot; size on a experimental basis as I needed something inexpensive and quick as i had ran out of my Clinique moisturizer and with Christmas around the bend really could not spare 30.00 plus dollars on a moisturizer when there were gifts to be bought.  So I tried and peooooooooppllllllllllllleeeeeeee!!!! let me TELL YOU!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff makes my skin look sooooooooooo good and it instantly takes I would say about 5-7 years off, that I DO NOT EITHER BOTHER TO WHERE MAKE UP anymore when I am going out for a night on the town!!!! SERIOUSLY....I have to choose do I want to look \\&quot;FIERCE\\&quot; and where make up, or do I want to look 23-25 (i turned 38 today). I do not know what it is in this stuff but it had a different feel than the Reversalist i tried using a few years ago. It immediatley just makes you glow!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO lie, one of my best friends and my college roomate came to see me this past week, the last time we saw each other was in the summer (2013),when she saw me, she said what are doing?  Why do you look so young and I look so old? She said, its looks like there is 10 year plus difference in our ages!!!!  Product wise it does not increase my adult acne but it does not aid it either i still get my acne around that time of the month, but i would say, that here lately i have noticed it is slowing down somewhat and it is not as CYSTIC as it used to be. So I would . recommmend this product. Honestly, I do not know why they even bother with the other lines...ULTIMATE is definetley the ULTIMATE!!!! out of the Anew lines NO MATTER what your age.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Avon product.</li>
            <li> I just love this moisturizer. It is so silky and keeps my face hydrated without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I use this every day.  It has the perfect weight to nourish and not make me feel smothered.  I appreciate the spf quality too.  It is worth every penny of its cost.</li>
            <li> Love this product!! Goes on smoothly and makes my skin feel great...helps with fine lines and over all glow.. Don&#x27;t need very much so lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for a number of years.  Great product!  I would compare results of Avon Anew to a ceramide day cream by Elizabeth Arden that I used to use.</li>
            <li> Love it, especially as it is cheaper here than Avon!</li>
            <li> The Avon Anew brand is so good.  I love everything I have ever used in this line.  This cream makes your skin so soft and dewy.  It feels good all day. It is non-greasy and fragrance free.  I think it would be good for anyone no matter age or skin type.  Try it!  The brand is a little expensive to me but I do splurge on moisturizer and eye cream from this line.</li>
            <li> for me: not sticky, SPF great, just like it, cannot always reach Avon representative, and a reasonable price here..thumbs up</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ll use. I&#x27;ve noticed that my wrinkles are more smooth and my face is just brighter overall!</li>
            <li> I have been using Avon since I was a very young. My grandma sold Avon so we always got tons for it for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mind getting older as long as I don&#x27;t have to look it. lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love all the Anew products. Either I look young for my age or I have a huge case of denial....either way work for me. :)</li>
            <li> A good fairly inexpensive face cream that isn&#x27;t thick and makes a nice base for foundation.  Works well with the night cream.</li>
            <li> I love this product would recommend to anyone, have been using it for many years now. It really made a difference.</li>
            <li> I finally found something that works for me.&lt;br /&gt;At 56, I really did not have much for lines or anything until about a year ago.&lt;br /&gt;I have used many products and they either did not work or worked for a short time and then, stopped.  In the meantime, more lines would appear.&lt;br /&gt;I have used anew products as samples a couple times but, back then, it did not matter that much.&lt;br /&gt;Now, it does.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Ultimate 7s, the day, night and serum for about a month.  It has not stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is smooth and creamy.  Not greasy.  creamy.&lt;br /&gt;That was the first thing I noticed.  How lovely my skin looked.  then some of my alarming lines that deepened over the last year have smoothed out and lessened.  New ones are not popping up like before.&lt;br /&gt;Even those annoying lines around your mouth, jowls and low cheeks have lessened so much.&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I noticed is how much less I use.  While I would run out pretty quick with Olay, I am using much much less of the anew per jar.&lt;br /&gt;Along with the serum, I find my skin improving everyday.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite skin cream EVER. I like this so much that I compare all other moisturizers against it. I don&#x27;t know what makes it so silky-smooth, but I wish there were more creams like it. One of the things that makes it so good is the way it sort of melts onto your skin, then disappears. It does not leave a shiny sheen, and it takes nothing for your skin to just soak it up. It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer. Although it is meant for aging skin, it works well if you are younger and trying to prevent aging (I&#x27;m 29). It is very thick, yet not sticky or too heavy. It gives me a nice dewy look and provides great sun protection. However, because of the strong chemicals in sunscreen, I wouldn&#x27;t plan on using this as a night cream unless you are desperate.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this cream! I found it here on Amazon and got it yesterday! Tried it right away and my gosh there was a big difference in my deep wrinkles and the over all look of my skin right away! I got my youthful glow back!!!&lt;br /&gt;Avon products were my life for over 20 years but lost my avon rep so was using box store stuff and my face was showing it:(&lt;br /&gt;Back now to avon and will stay with it since I can find it here on Amazon!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I am using this combined with the  Anew clinical concentrate and can hardly wait to see my face in a week!!!&lt;br /&gt;Love-Love Love it!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Does what it says it will, feels good on the skin.. I found the Avon Anew Genics, though and like it better. This Ultimate 7s does have a light scent to it. Compared to drugstore anti-aging products like L&#x27;oreal, Olay, Garnier, I think it works a little bit better for moisturizing and for a better skin tone.</li>
            <li> i gave this a 5 star...i been using this product for years and i love it...not greasy ...and make your face feel great...</li>
            <li> I have used this before and I would use it again it works so good on most skin types..  Thank you</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a little over one year and love the way it makes your skin feel.</li>
            <li> i have been using the Avon Anew Ultimate Day Cream for a number of years now.  It is a great product for my face, creamy - not oily.&lt;br /&gt;Blends into my skin nicely, and helps keep the wrinkles away!</li>
            <li> Love this face cream. I once sold Avon and I can say that I got the best price right here on Amazon!!</li>
            <li> I have been using Avon Anew since it was introduced.  It moisturizes but isn&#x27;t oily or cause my skin to breakout.  I&#x27;ve tried other products but always come back to this.</li>
            <li> Love both day and night cream.  Both work very well and as good as any of the high price creams.</li>
            <li> The price is great, product excellent</li>
            <li> USE THIS EXCLUSIVELY FOR MANY YEARS.  PRICE POINT IS THE BEST ANYWHERE. DON&#x27;T HESITATE TO BUY.  I AM OVER 50 AND WOULDN&#x27;T BE WITHOUT THIS.</li>
            <li> I always use this.keeps skin soft. doesn&#x27;t feel greasy</li>
            <li> Lovely product, been using for two years and look younger now (I think).</li>
            <li> I have used Anew products since they have been around. I&#x27;am always happy with the results. They have worked for me and they keep coming up with something new. This cream is smooth and and helps my skin look younger.It feels good on my skin and has a soft fragrance to it. It does work for me and I stick to what I know that I can count on....Thank You</li>
            <li> Used forever. Got a better price on Amazon</li>
            <li> Good Product and good price!  This was the product I needed and it was a very good price and it was shipped very quickly.  It is very good for keeping skin supple and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love the product, but for some reason I got 4 small jars instead of one large jar... What for??? Just wondering.....</li>
            <li> I am an Avon Anew devotee. I&#x27;ve been using Avon skin care since I was 11 yrs old, and at 51 , people are surprised to find out how old I really am. When people 1st meet me, they assume I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s. All the Anew products are so great, that I refuse to use anything else. The Anew Day cream is a must for anyone wanting  youthful and firm looking skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using anew for the past year and it works great! I am 52 and have senseitive skin and have to watch what I put on my face. I use this together with the night cream and eye cream. I always get my puchase earlier than it says it will arrive and you can&#x27;t beat the price you get on amazon!</li>
            <li> Cheaper at Amazon.com than dept. stores, same quality.</li>
            <li> I Love this stuff.  They discontinued my anew i had been using for years and years it took a couple of tried but the ultimate is the closest to what i was using and i am not allergic like i am with some of the other anews.  Thanks to Avon and my mom&#x27;s genes @46 i have almost no wrinkles!</li>
            <li> This definitely has a rich texture but the fragrance is way too strong, and I didn&#x27;t really notice any benefits.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this cream!  I have tried many different face creams over the years and for my aging skin (I am 56), it is the best! Moisturizes beautifully and stays on. Would highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> Goes on with great coverage and only need to use sparingly.  Has a great texture.  Would definitely recommend this product</li>
            <li> This has always been my favorite moisturizer/sunscreen, and I&#x27;m just coming back to it. I don&#x27;t really like the new fragrance, which is a bit strong, but it doesn&#x27;t really bother me. Many sunscreens irritate my eyes, but this one does not. Love the price also!</li>
            <li> Great product. So glad I can get it thru Amazon!</li>
            <li> Best day cream I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> I use it every day. My skin feels firm and soft. No one believes me when I reveal my age.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, make my dry face feel great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Avon Anew Ultimate for years.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer!  Have been using it for years.  Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the product for two reasons:  used in the morning, it leaves a greasy residue on my skin. I made the mistake of trying it as a night cream and the next morning, my pillowcases had stain marks from the product.  Which have not washed out even after treating them with Zout.  Bummer.</li>
            <li> Day Age Repair cream 1.7 oz. I can see the difference in my skin. My skin is tighter and glows. What are you waiting for? Try day age repair cream and see the difference.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for several years.  Not greasy and blends in nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Gives skin a healthy appearance.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the fragrance of this product.  Also, the SPF tend to irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> arrived on time, great product!</li>
            <li> This is an old standby product. I&#x27;ve tried many others &amp; found Avon Anew to be the best all in one product! Forget having 10 different things to apply &amp; clutter up you cabinet when one product works as well as this one.</li>
            <li> I buy this product for my mother to use as a day cream and she asks me to re-order it regularly so I suppose that&#x27;s as good an endorsement as any!</li>
            <li> Very good for my skin</li>
            <li> This is the third jar of this I&#x27;ve had and it is a great product.  Being over 50, it&#x27;s really made a difference in smoothing over the crinkles.  I mainly have used it in the winter when skin is a bit drier (it moisturizes a lot).  If it&#x27;s spring or summer I need to add some powder on top to prevent oily shine.</li>
            <li> I have used this product  a month but won&#x27;t order it again. I wear it under my make up and my whole face looks oily and shiny. Even blotting only helps slightly.  I have seen no improvement in my skin.  Avon Anew Thermafirm is still the best in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I use this as my day lotion to wear under my full makeup each morning.  Really enjoy that the lotion is a very thick/creamy consistency while somehow not feeling greasy or heavy on my skin, especially considering that I put on full makeup over it and have oily skin.  A little goes a long way.  I like the packaging of the lotion as well, since I feel you can get every last bit of lotion out of the jar with the wide mouth.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Switched from &amp;#34;Ultimate Anew Day Cream&amp;#34; and am enjoying the improvement I&#x27;ve seen on my complexion to even smoother and more evenly toned, plus the fragrance is much softer and pleasing so that it&#x27;s not assulting your sinus&#x27;s as well as clashing with any perfumes you may wear... Glad I made the switch!</li>
            <li> I bought it for her, she&#x27;s in love. She&#x27;s been using it for years and keeps buying it. I guess that means it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> I swear by this cream and have used Anew for at least 25 years.  They make the nighttime cream as well</li>
            <li> Have been using Anew for more than 10 years and would never use another product. I&#x27;m 56 and my lines have diminished. Drastically.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin.  This moisturizer feels like silk on my face.  Love it!</li>
            <li> The face cream is awesome,,&amp; loved the free shipping</li>
            <li> Excellent service recommended!&lt;br /&gt;Avon productos number 1! and Anew line  A1!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I feel it does the job</li>
            <li> I use all the anew products and I feel, as a mature woman they have improved the quality of my skin!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, as it keeps your face moisturized and helps with the elasticity in your skin. I&#x27;ve been using Anew for years and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 10 years and it is wonderful for mature skin.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> bought this for my mom as a gift. She swears by it. I have never used it but I know she loves it.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years.  Love. It.</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth and wrinkle free and though I can&#x27;t know for sure if it made the difference, this has been my preferred moisturizer for years.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;DOESN&#x27;T WORK  NO STARS ARE WARNED</li>
            <li> Have been using this and other Avon moisturizers for a while now and I can&#x27;t express how much trust I have in each product. Suggestion...try them , you will be sold on the quality too.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly. Has a little more oil than needed, but I blot it with tissue paper. Most important it has an SPF of 25 which helps to keep sun spots from showing up on your face.</li>
            <li> This is the best price I have found for this product here on Amazon, and it really does make a difference.. (I&#x27;m a 37 year old male, and proud to say most think I&#x27;m 30 or less)  I can tell the difference right after I apply it, and last throughout the day, and on a fairly seldom mentioned note, I must point out that it also has an amazing SPF 15 that really lasts!!  I religiously take the day cream with me to Florida when I travel, apply it in the morning, and it lasts through the afternoon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never use another face cream! People think I&#x27;m 10-15 years younger than I am. I&#x27;m 45! Many ladies in thier 50 &#x27; s ask me what I use! A man at my son&#x27;s basketball game thought my husband&#x27;s ex wife was my mother in law!!! YES!!! LOVE this cream!!! :-)</li>
            <li> Is one of the most effective cream on the market for the price. My husband is buying me this product for more than a decade now</li>
            <li> I love the Anew products and Amazon pricing can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> Love Avon products! Cheaper to purchase through Amazon than an Avon dealer.</li>
            <li> I love this cream and the value! I normally use the drugstore brands but wanted to give this a try. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m switching my moisturizer as long as it&#x27;s not discontinued! I&#x27;m 44 so definitely need something rich. This one gives my skin the all day softness without the heaviness and pore clogging. I&#x27;m buying the 7s night cream as we speak :)</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a number of years now. It is great for dry skin and provides a sunscreen as well. I would not be without it.. This price is really great...</li>
            <li> I just received them very nice I might add.</li>
            <li> The picture is what I wanted but recieved the product of the replacement  of this product. Very disappointed it was basically sunscreen cream.</li>
            <li> This cream is a perfect base for make-up. I enjoy the feel and the smell. I have used this for years and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> I am 56.9 years old with very dry, sensitive skin.  I spend a lot of time outdoors and this cream keeps my skin hydrated and soft.  I have used it for several years now.  I try new products every now &amp; then just to see what&#x27;s out there, but I always come back to this product.  Both of my daughters now use this, too, and also love it.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the Avon Anew Ultimate to anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Always a favorite, keeps skin smooth. Avon facial products are superior.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using for too long to see long term results but currently I find this product a little lacking because it doesn&#x27;t seem to be absorbed into the skin but instead seems to be just covering the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like a slight scent but this one doesn&#x27;t seem to have any but of course that doesn&#x27;t impact the quality of the product, just a personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll have to see what it does long term.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this cream on my face.  It is light, but not greasy and absorbs quickly into my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great product by Avon, I also have the night cream, both are very effective against signs of wrinkles. Under the cream I use Hauschka Rose cream for extra moisturizing and glow. My skin looks wonderful, wrinkles are decreased and it has even tone and is well moisturized.</li>
            <li> The 7 day  cream was great for the price!!!  It wasn&#x27;t used and didn&#x27;t take a long time to get to me</li>
            <li> Great price, much better than the price you have to pay to Avon.</li>
            <li> Ok. Don&#x27;t like smell.</li>
    </ol>
