            <li>Also if you can&#x27;t read korean, good luck with the instructions and packaging.     </li>
            <li>Really good glue.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found a good method to remove it yet.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, it stayed on for 2 days if I dont use oil to wash my face.</li>
            <li>anyone know an easy way to take it off, please share! :P</li>
            <li>Couldnt ask for more!</li>

            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>You will love it!</li>
            <li>Favorite glue!</li>
            <li>Great price and the delivery was very quick.</li>
            <li>This had amazing staying power, i can sleep with it on and it&#x27;ll still hold.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>So I got home and ordered a tube of my own.  </li>
            <li>honestly seems almost water proof.</li>
            <li>It attached to my lid but as suspected, one corner kind of came undone.</li>
            <li>Probably just my own insecurities shining through!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>Since this is very strong, it will hurt if you try to remove them by peeling/pulling it off.</li>
            <li>I think this is the best glue that I&#x27;ve bought online, but this glue cracks too easily and the one I bought in a nearby store is much for stickier.</li>
            <li>and if you miss a corner, dabbing the brush on the end of your lash (when already applied) makes it extremely easy to do!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not claiming that this is waterproof by any means, but I will say that it is strong!</li>
            <li>also great for creating the double eyelid, once again, just the right amount of stick to hold things together but not hurt when removing...  all at a great price!</li>
            <li>it kind of seems TOO strong, but with some make up remover</li>
            <li>Suffice to say, I&#x27;ll be looking for better options.</li>
            <li>I love this glue.</li>
            <li>I love using it.</li>
            <li>This product last me up to 8 hours which is great!</li>
            <li>one of the best products to use a double eyelid</li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>Better off buying eyelid tape.</li>
            <li>In fact is even better</li>
            <li>I actually paid with my own money and am giving 100% my own review so girls out there know the truth in makeup lol.</li>
            <li>hold a lot better than Koji Eye Talk and Darkness</li>
            <li>Is better than store brand eyelash glie</li>
            <li>so mabey just try it? :)</li>
            <li>I love being able to just paint the lash glue on.  </li>
            <li>received this product with mini samples which i did not expect :)  </li>
            <li>It lasts for all day wear, but if you&#x27;re looking for something that will hold for more than a day, I suggest you look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>It is one of the stickiest and most stubborn glue to get off.</li>
            <li>I would recommend soaking a cloth and putting it over your eye for a while before you rub it off and take off the lashes, or use a product that is more oily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying from them more often</li>
            <li>Love this glue.</li>
            <li>Maybe you will have better luck but have to give it 1 star</li>
            <li>You can continue to re-adjust lashes if you miss your lash-line without having to apply more glue.</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t have to keep ordering more</li>
            <li>I love using this.</li>
            <li>I am now going to order more just to keep on</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of eyelash glue in my time and can say that this is my all time favorite.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several eye lash glues and they are not as good as this one!!!</li>
            <li>I had both eyes under hot cloths for a good 20 minutes so that the glue would be able to rub off.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply with applicator which I love better than tubes.  </li>
            <li>I have never been able to keep lashes on but this helped me keep huge costume lashes on all day and night.</li>
            <li>BTW shipping was fast and it arrived in good conditions.</li>
            <li>It shiped really fast and works really good.</li>
            <li>Darkness is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>it should come off quite easily.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;+ easy to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It comes off easily with make up remover</li>
            <li>Its easy to apply and the glue is transparent when applied.</li>
            <li>but gets sticky very quickly.</li>
            <li>The brush tip also make application easy</li>
            <li>The glue isn&#x27;t as strong as it used to be.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a strong glue.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used all kinds of eye lash glue over the years and this is hands down the best.</li>
            <li>Very strong and good glue for eyelashes or double eyelid.</li>
            <li>Just lightly pull them off from the sides and it&#x27;s as easy as that.</li>
            <li>AND they send you free gifts of shampoo and conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li>However it would be a great product for that doesn&#x27;t have the same issue as I.</li>
            <li>No this is not sponsored or paid for or given for free.</li>
            <li>Overall I give it four stars because it works great, but even after you get rid of it, it still leaves a gummy residue on your skin that you sort of have to manually peel off.</li>
            <li>Works great last all day.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve ever had trouble finding a great glue, give this one a shot!</li>
            <li>It dries clear which is good.</li>
            <li>Thank u so much!!!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t put too many for the first line apply, otherwise it might stick somewhere thicker somewhere thinner.</li>
            <li>The first time I took the bottle with me because i wasn&#x27;t sure if one side was going to hold up</li>
            <li>I ordered this product thinking it looked like a clean and efficient way to apply lash adhesive because of the mascara-like tube it comes in.  </li>
            <li>I feel like its faje or something...not as good quality as the last one i have purchased on ebay.</li>
            <li>However, this glue is only good for an hour or so and needs to be reapplied often.</li>
            <li>I was definitely a bit hesitant to purchase it but read all the good reviews about it</li>
            <li>I wore the lashes in my picture for a full 48 hours</li>
            <li>It gives you much more control over how much glue is on the lash, plus</li>
            <li>This was shipped fast and I love that you can apply the glue with a brush.</li>
            <li>Dries clean and quick, but not so quickly that you can&#x27;t adjust position a pinch when applying.</li>
            <li>seriously the best eyelash glue ever...</li>
            <li>super duper sticky.  </li>
            <li>I needed this quickly because I was going to a wedding</li>
            <li>It takes practice to get your creases to look perfect but the glue is extra sticky and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using my first one!</li>
            <li>I wore the glue all day at work (hot and humid climate, no AC) and it didnt run or clump, and I could wear eyeliner!    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the glue for the last month and have really enjoyed it!</li>
            <li>i chose 3 because first the product sticks well!</li>
            <li>This is the first Korean beauty product that I&#x27;ve bought, Its great, has a fine-tipped paint brush for the glue for extreme accuracy and precision for glue placement.</li>
            <li>Be sure and keep the top of the tube free of glue and screw the brush in tightly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through every kind of adhesive you could try and at last my search is over.</li>
            <li>It was worth it to reorder without making them refund me.  </li>
            <li>the top came completely off from the wand.</li>
            <li>I expected a bit more but the glue is OK.</li>
            <li>I have to say, i think darkness glue is best for putting on false lashes.</li>
            <li>Applying lashes is tricky, it sometimes takes me a try or two before I get it right.</li>
            <li>it was just right)  </li>
            <li>my only beef with this product though is that after continuous use, the glue dries out kind of quickly and gets VERY tacky.</li>
            <li>This is great for false eyelashes, and it&#x27;s easy application.</li>
            <li>The glue is unscented and a fluorescent color but dries quickly and sticks for the whole day.  </li>
            <li>When I look my eyelashes off they pealed easily and did not pull my natural lashes out.</li>
            <li>this is a very strong glue, good for gluing fake eyelashes.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take off your real lashes when you remove your falsies which is a bonus!</li>
            <li>I definitely love it or the faux eyelashes and not for the purpose of double eyelids.  </li>
            <li>comes with a tool, but not too sure as what the heck it is used for, not in English</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too, will buy again!</li>
            <li>It will start to turn white and you&#x27;ll have to peel it off and put the glue on again, which won&#x27;t take more than 2 minutes anyway.</li>
            <li>Vendor should do a quality check first before shipping.</li>
            <li>&quot; the glue itself works pretty well.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was a mistake</li>
            <li>really hope this helped!  </li>
            <li>This is my first experience with Darkness products</li>
            <li>removing the glue, use a q tip dipped in makeup remover and move the q tip back and forth on top of the lashes to remove (do NOT pull off or</li>
            <li>You might find it tricky at first</li>
            <li>My favorite to use, my lashes last all day!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>if a storm is coming, you wouldnt need to worry about your lashes falling out ;)</li>
            <li>But whatever it&#x27;s the first time I buy something like this.</li>
            <li>Really sticks n keeps lashes on for days!</li>
            <li>, it gets tacky in about 30 to 40 seconds depend on how much you put on, and once i stick them on it stays, and it&#x27;s easy to remove them, i personally didn&#x27;t need any special products to help the removal.</li>
            <li>its not dark like it says, it is really white that when it dries becomes clear, well that is great and all, but it still shows when you put your make-up on.</li>
            <li>It holds amazingly well, lasts all day with absolutely no worries!</li>
            <li>I was looking for a good double eyelid glue to use, and this one was definitely the product i was looking for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s good if you have oily eyelids but.</li>
            <li>but like the other one I ordered, guess it is the same as most, but I do know this is better then the tube type.</li>
            <li>If theres some left it will &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; off quite easy.</li>
            <li>This glue works okay, but takes awhile to dry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product, strong but not too difficult to remove.</li>
            <li>The only problem with this glue is that it is a bit hard to get off, I have to apply make up remover, the oil based ones help remove it better for me with warm water.  </li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it to my friends!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s very noticeable.</li>
            <li>but it seemed like it works really well.   </li>
            <li>, it arrived a few days before expected and the trial kit was fun (and works great, I might add).    </li>
            <li>lasts the whole day and no need to wash off and reapply.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not 100% if that&#x27;s the real reason.</li>
            <li>So I just pulled the whole thing off, reput the glue on and stuck it in my eye in about 20 seconds.&lt;br</li>
            <li>thing I would like to warn anyone who buys this product is that it can, overtime, cause your eyelids to swell and become VERY saggy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then, GENTLY rub your eyelid glue off.  </li>
            <li>color change to indicate when the product is ready to adhere</li>
            <li>+ fast shipping, stayed 12 hours for me, can wear makeup, can use it as eyelash glue, it prefect in that way.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s alright, doesn&#x27;t really apply well.</li>
            <li>I really like this glue.  </li>
            <li>Well...this stuff is ready as soon as it&#x27;s applied.  </li>
            <li>it holds really well all day.  </li>
            <li>haha.  </li>
            <li>I can put my lashes on with NO cover up eyeliner, and they look natural and fresh.</li>
            <li>but it hold REALLY</li>
            <li>Lashes did not adhere very well at all.  </li>
            <li>Changes to a bluish hue when it&#x27;s ready to attach, and stays on until you want to remove.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>It sticks really well.</li>
            <li>fast srevice and delivery, just product</li>
            <li>I love to wear false eyelashes, but I never really had a great glue that would hold them all day.</li>
            <li>Great eyelash glue, really keeps the false lashes in place all day.</li>
            <li>but when the tube is new, it works very well!</li>
            <li>so easy to apply/use and lasted all night long with comfort</li>
            <li>If you are like me a beginner in putting fake lashes and pretty much don&#x27;t have that much experience this glue is great.</li>
            <li>other than that, I love this product.</li>
            <li>Holds up very long, so it&#x27;s great for false lash users who want their lash to stay in place for a good amount of time and for people who wants to create that double eyelid effect that would last for the whole day/night.  </li>
            <li>Hands down, this is my favorite lash glue ever.</li>
            <li>saying all this though, I think that we should live in a society where we don&#x27;t have t apply false eye lashes to be defined as beautiful by heteronormative cultural standards.</li>
            <li>Put the glue layer by layer after each time your skin stick forward a little, until you feel satisfied about how much space of your eyelid skin have been sticked together.</li>
            <li>cant live without it!</li>
            <li>Peels away easy and with minimal discomfort.</li>
            <li>It used to be able to last me the entire day, now it won&#x27;t even keep my lashes in tact for an hour.</li>
            <li>The double sided tape from BN or wonder eyelid works much much better for double eyelid formation.  </li>
            <li>Loved it for both my eyelash glue (not so sticky it hurt to remove them and not so weak that they fell off...</li>
            <li>works well, will definitely be getting more of this glue, but as for the price, i  heard you can buy these at a few chinese/korean super markets for $4</li>
            <li>And I am so glad that my little sister&#x27;s friend let me borrow some when my eyelashes were coming off one night out.  </li>
            <li>Shipping is a little overpriced, so I recommend ordering more than one at a time.</li>
            <li>would be 5 stars if the glue didn&#x27;t dry out so fast, but overall i would definitely repurchase and i love this product!</li>
            <li>so u know when the lashes are ready to be put on and product also dries clear.  </li>
            <li>I put double eyelids on my right eye and after removing with make up remover as well as washing it, there were still residue of the product.</li>
            <li>The title is deceptive, the double eyelid stick is cheap and plastic, and the eyelash glue, its only redeeming feature, DRIED UP.</li>
            <li>my money or send me a new one.&lt;br /&gt;this product doesn&#x27;t even need to be returned</li>
            <li>I still haven&#x27;t gotten a new type of lash adhesive to try them out with yet</li>
            <li>and I live in California, so</li>
            <li>It goes on as a vibrant greenish color but dries clear.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it was kept in inhospitable temperatures or if it was just very very old...</li>
            <li>The Duo would have completely unstuck immediately!  </li>
            <li>It holds on fine, but not for an extra long time--maybe 3 hrs?</li>
            <li>turns clear</li>
            <li>I like the applicator tip and the fact that the glue comes out white and when ready it becomes clear.</li>
            <li>This goes on in almost a glowing color so you can see where the glue is...then dries clear and not crusty</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it as a double eye lid glue though, it stretches skin too much.</li>
            <li>My eyelid was very red and itchy after using it for two days, so I have decided to give the whole thing to one of my friends.</li>
            <li>this glue holds double eyelids very well</li>
            <li>I give this a low rating because the glue is very watery and seems to remain that way all day.  </li>
            <li>I received something far different:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has an applicator brush like the old eye liners in the tube</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s absolutely no waste.</li>
            <li>It might be a good product for eyelash glue, but poor product for double eyelid glue.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s your first time purchasing this product, buy only one even though shipping is kind of expensive.    </li>
            <li>It also dries fast enough so that you don&#x27;t have to worry about it slipping from the position you put it in, but too fast so that you can&#x27;t adjust it.</li>
            <li>way to much comes out of those with little control on how much you use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cut my lash prepping time by 75% and it dry uber fast.</li>
            <li>The glue doesn&#x27;t dry that fast-</li>
            <li>It is strong and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I also discovered I can use the fine brush included and apply a little dab on the inside and outside corner of my eye for that extra hold I need</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s white but dries clear.</li>
            <li>It goes on in an iridescent blue and then turns clear.</li>
            <li>After using it for only 3 days on my lids i developed lots of tiny wrinkles on them, which made me look old.</li>
            <li>The following day I put the glue on and didn&#x27;t wait for it to turn transparent and just put it directly on my lid</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s super easy to apply thanks to the wand applicator (something American eyelash glues should take note of, because using a squeeze tube is messy and difficult).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not the only false lash lover that has this problem.</li>
            <li>Just be patient: it will make the double eyelid more natual by apply little by little.</li>
            <li>Absolutely stellar hold, even on a humid 90-degree day and a little cry.</li>
            <li>The smell is a little off putting at first</li>
            <li>Stays on pretty well, but if you have oily skin or powder over the product, expect to touch up a little but through the day.</li>
            <li>easy to use, takes a little while to dry, sticks on pretty well, hard to remove</li>
            <li>You know how sometimes you squeeze a little bit too much of glue into your eyelashes?</li>
            <li>It is strong enough, made my false double eyelids look natural although it wasn&#x27;t harsh on my sensitive skin.</li>

            <li> Also if you can&#x27;t read korean, good luck with the instructions and packaging.     </li>
            <li> Really good glue.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found a good method to remove it yet.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, it stayed on for 2 days if I dont use oil to wash my face.</li>
            <li> anyone know an easy way to take it off, please share! :P</li>
            <li> Couldnt ask for more!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> You will love it!</li>
            <li> Favorite glue!</li>
            <li> Great price and the delivery was very quick.</li>
            <li> This had amazing staying power, i can sleep with it on and it&#x27;ll still hold.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> So I got home and ordered a tube of my own.  </li>
            <li> honestly seems almost water proof.</li>
            <li> It attached to my lid but as suspected, one corner kind of came undone.</li>
            <li> Probably just my own insecurities shining through!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> Since this is very strong, it will hurt if you try to remove them by peeling/pulling it off.</li>
            <li> I think this is the best glue that I&#x27;ve bought online, but this glue cracks too easily and the one I bought in a nearby store is much for stickier.</li>
            <li> and if you miss a corner, dabbing the brush on the end of your lash (when already applied) makes it extremely easy to do!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not claiming that this is waterproof by any means, but I will say that it is strong!</li>
            <li> also great for creating the double eyelid, once again, just the right amount of stick to hold things together but not hurt when removing...  all at a great price!</li>
            <li> it kind of seems TOO strong, but with some make up remover</li>
            <li> Suffice to say, I&#x27;ll be looking for better options.</li>
            <li> I love this glue.</li>
            <li> I love using it.</li>
            <li> This product last me up to 8 hours which is great!</li>
            <li> one of the best products to use a double eyelid</li>
            <li> and i love it.</li>
            <li> Better off buying eyelid tape.</li>
            <li> In fact is even better</li>
            <li> I actually paid with my own money and am giving 100% my own review so girls out there know the truth in makeup lol.</li>
            <li> hold a lot better than Koji Eye Talk and Darkness</li>
            <li> Is better than store brand eyelash glie</li>
            <li> so mabey just try it? :)</li>
            <li> I love being able to just paint the lash glue on.  </li>
            <li> received this product with mini samples which i did not expect :)  </li>
            <li> It lasts for all day wear, but if you&#x27;re looking for something that will hold for more than a day, I suggest you look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> It is one of the stickiest and most stubborn glue to get off.</li>
            <li> I would recommend soaking a cloth and putting it over your eye for a while before you rub it off and take off the lashes, or use a product that is more oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying from them more often</li>
            <li> Love this glue.</li>
            <li> Maybe you will have better luck but have to give it 1 star</li>
            <li> You can continue to re-adjust lashes if you miss your lash-line without having to apply more glue.</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t have to keep ordering more</li>
            <li> I love using this.</li>
            <li> I am now going to order more just to keep on</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of eyelash glue in my time and can say that this is my all time favorite.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several eye lash glues and they are not as good as this one!!!</li>
            <li> I had both eyes under hot cloths for a good 20 minutes so that the glue would be able to rub off.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply with applicator which I love better than tubes.  </li>
            <li> I have never been able to keep lashes on but this helped me keep huge costume lashes on all day and night.</li>
            <li> BTW shipping was fast and it arrived in good conditions.</li>
            <li> It shiped really fast and works really good.</li>
            <li> Darkness is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> it should come off quite easily.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;+ easy to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It comes off easily with make up remover</li>
            <li> Its easy to apply and the glue is transparent when applied.</li>
            <li> but gets sticky very quickly.</li>
            <li> The brush tip also make application easy</li>
            <li> The glue isn&#x27;t as strong as it used to be.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a strong glue.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all kinds of eye lash glue over the years and this is hands down the best.</li>
            <li> Very strong and good glue for eyelashes or double eyelid.</li>
            <li> Just lightly pull them off from the sides and it&#x27;s as easy as that.</li>
            <li> AND they send you free gifts of shampoo and conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li> However it would be a great product for that doesn&#x27;t have the same issue as I.</li>
            <li> No this is not sponsored or paid for or given for free.</li>
            <li> Overall I give it four stars because it works great, but even after you get rid of it, it still leaves a gummy residue on your skin that you sort of have to manually peel off.</li>
            <li> Works great last all day.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever had trouble finding a great glue, give this one a shot!</li>
            <li> It dries clear which is good.</li>
            <li> Thank u so much!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t put too many for the first line apply, otherwise it might stick somewhere thicker somewhere thinner.</li>
            <li> The first time I took the bottle with me because i wasn&#x27;t sure if one side was going to hold up</li>
            <li> I ordered this product thinking it looked like a clean and efficient way to apply lash adhesive because of the mascara-like tube it comes in.  </li>
            <li> I feel like its faje or something...not as good quality as the last one i have purchased on ebay.</li>
            <li> However, this glue is only good for an hour or so and needs to be reapplied often.</li>
            <li> I was definitely a bit hesitant to purchase it but read all the good reviews about it</li>
            <li> I wore the lashes in my picture for a full 48 hours</li>
            <li> It gives you much more control over how much glue is on the lash, plus</li>
            <li> This was shipped fast and I love that you can apply the glue with a brush.</li>
            <li> Dries clean and quick, but not so quickly that you can&#x27;t adjust position a pinch when applying.</li>
            <li> seriously the best eyelash glue ever...</li>
            <li> super duper sticky.  </li>
            <li> I needed this quickly because I was going to a wedding</li>
            <li> It takes practice to get your creases to look perfect but the glue is extra sticky and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using my first one!</li>
            <li> I wore the glue all day at work (hot and humid climate, no AC) and it didnt run or clump, and I could wear eyeliner!    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the glue for the last month and have really enjoyed it!</li>
            <li> i chose 3 because first the product sticks well!</li>
            <li> This is the first Korean beauty product that I&#x27;ve bought, Its great, has a fine-tipped paint brush for the glue for extreme accuracy and precision for glue placement.</li>
            <li> Be sure and keep the top of the tube free of glue and screw the brush in tightly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through every kind of adhesive you could try and at last my search is over.</li>
            <li> It was worth it to reorder without making them refund me.  </li>
            <li> the top came completely off from the wand.</li>
            <li> I expected a bit more but the glue is OK.</li>
            <li> I have to say, i think darkness glue is best for putting on false lashes.</li>
            <li> Applying lashes is tricky, it sometimes takes me a try or two before I get it right.</li>
            <li> it was just right)  </li>
            <li> my only beef with this product though is that after continuous use, the glue dries out kind of quickly and gets VERY tacky.</li>
            <li> This is great for false eyelashes, and it&#x27;s easy application.</li>
            <li> The glue is unscented and a fluorescent color but dries quickly and sticks for the whole day.  </li>
            <li> When I look my eyelashes off they pealed easily and did not pull my natural lashes out.</li>
            <li> this is a very strong glue, good for gluing fake eyelashes.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take off your real lashes when you remove your falsies which is a bonus!</li>
            <li> I definitely love it or the faux eyelashes and not for the purpose of double eyelids.  </li>
            <li> comes with a tool, but not too sure as what the heck it is used for, not in English</li>
            <li> Fast shipping too, will buy again!</li>
            <li> It will start to turn white and you&#x27;ll have to peel it off and put the glue on again, which won&#x27;t take more than 2 minutes anyway.</li>
            <li> Vendor should do a quality check first before shipping.</li>
            <li> &quot; the glue itself works pretty well.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was a mistake</li>
            <li> really hope this helped!  </li>
            <li> This is my first experience with Darkness products</li>
            <li> removing the glue, use a q tip dipped in makeup remover and move the q tip back and forth on top of the lashes to remove (do NOT pull off or</li>
            <li> You might find it tricky at first</li>
            <li> My favorite to use, my lashes last all day!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> if a storm is coming, you wouldnt need to worry about your lashes falling out ;)</li>
            <li> But whatever it&#x27;s the first time I buy something like this.</li>
            <li> Really sticks n keeps lashes on for days!</li>
            <li> , it gets tacky in about 30 to 40 seconds depend on how much you put on, and once i stick them on it stays, and it&#x27;s easy to remove them, i personally didn&#x27;t need any special products to help the removal.</li>
            <li> its not dark like it says, it is really white that when it dries becomes clear, well that is great and all, but it still shows when you put your make-up on.</li>
            <li> It holds amazingly well, lasts all day with absolutely no worries!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good double eyelid glue to use, and this one was definitely the product i was looking for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s good if you have oily eyelids but.</li>
            <li> but like the other one I ordered, guess it is the same as most, but I do know this is better then the tube type.</li>
            <li> If theres some left it will &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; off quite easy.</li>
            <li> This glue works okay, but takes awhile to dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product, strong but not too difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> The only problem with this glue is that it is a bit hard to get off, I have to apply make up remover, the oil based ones help remove it better for me with warm water.  </li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it to my friends!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s very noticeable.</li>
            <li> but it seemed like it works really well.   </li>
            <li> , it arrived a few days before expected and the trial kit was fun (and works great, I might add).    </li>
            <li> lasts the whole day and no need to wash off and reapply.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not 100% if that&#x27;s the real reason.</li>
            <li> So I just pulled the whole thing off, reput the glue on and stuck it in my eye in about 20 seconds.&lt;br</li>
            <li> thing I would like to warn anyone who buys this product is that it can, overtime, cause your eyelids to swell and become VERY saggy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then, GENTLY rub your eyelid glue off.  </li>
            <li> color change to indicate when the product is ready to adhere</li>
            <li> + fast shipping, stayed 12 hours for me, can wear makeup, can use it as eyelash glue, it prefect in that way.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright, doesn&#x27;t really apply well.</li>
            <li> I really like this glue.  </li>
            <li> Well...this stuff is ready as soon as it&#x27;s applied.  </li>
            <li> it holds really well all day.  </li>
            <li> haha.  </li>
            <li> I can put my lashes on with NO cover up eyeliner, and they look natural and fresh.</li>
            <li> but it hold REALLY</li>
            <li> Lashes did not adhere very well at all.  </li>
            <li> Changes to a bluish hue when it&#x27;s ready to attach, and stays on until you want to remove.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> It sticks really well.</li>
            <li> fast srevice and delivery, just product</li>
            <li> I love to wear false eyelashes, but I never really had a great glue that would hold them all day.</li>
            <li> Great eyelash glue, really keeps the false lashes in place all day.</li>
            <li> but when the tube is new, it works very well!</li>
            <li> so easy to apply/use and lasted all night long with comfort</li>
            <li> If you are like me a beginner in putting fake lashes and pretty much don&#x27;t have that much experience this glue is great.</li>
            <li> other than that, I love this product.</li>
            <li> Holds up very long, so it&#x27;s great for false lash users who want their lash to stay in place for a good amount of time and for people who wants to create that double eyelid effect that would last for the whole day/night.  </li>
            <li> Hands down, this is my favorite lash glue ever.</li>
            <li> saying all this though, I think that we should live in a society where we don&#x27;t have t apply false eye lashes to be defined as beautiful by heteronormative cultural standards.</li>
            <li> Put the glue layer by layer after each time your skin stick forward a little, until you feel satisfied about how much space of your eyelid skin have been sticked together.</li>
            <li> cant live without it!</li>
            <li> Peels away easy and with minimal discomfort.</li>
            <li> It used to be able to last me the entire day, now it won&#x27;t even keep my lashes in tact for an hour.</li>
            <li> The double sided tape from BN or wonder eyelid works much much better for double eyelid formation.  </li>
            <li> Loved it for both my eyelash glue (not so sticky it hurt to remove them and not so weak that they fell off...</li>
            <li> works well, will definitely be getting more of this glue, but as for the price, i  heard you can buy these at a few chinese/korean super markets for $4</li>
            <li> And I am so glad that my little sister&#x27;s friend let me borrow some when my eyelashes were coming off one night out.  </li>
            <li> Shipping is a little overpriced, so I recommend ordering more than one at a time.</li>
            <li> would be 5 stars if the glue didn&#x27;t dry out so fast, but overall i would definitely repurchase and i love this product!</li>
            <li> so u know when the lashes are ready to be put on and product also dries clear.  </li>
            <li> I put double eyelids on my right eye and after removing with make up remover as well as washing it, there were still residue of the product.</li>
            <li> The title is deceptive, the double eyelid stick is cheap and plastic, and the eyelash glue, its only redeeming feature, DRIED UP.</li>
            <li> my money or send me a new one.&lt;br /&gt;this product doesn&#x27;t even need to be returned</li>
            <li> I still haven&#x27;t gotten a new type of lash adhesive to try them out with yet</li>
            <li> and I live in California, so</li>
            <li> It goes on as a vibrant greenish color but dries clear.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was kept in inhospitable temperatures or if it was just very very old...</li>
            <li> The Duo would have completely unstuck immediately!  </li>
            <li> It holds on fine, but not for an extra long time--maybe 3 hrs?</li>
            <li> turns clear</li>
            <li> I like the applicator tip and the fact that the glue comes out white and when ready it becomes clear.</li>
            <li> This goes on in almost a glowing color so you can see where the glue is...then dries clear and not crusty</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it as a double eye lid glue though, it stretches skin too much.</li>
            <li> My eyelid was very red and itchy after using it for two days, so I have decided to give the whole thing to one of my friends.</li>
            <li> this glue holds double eyelids very well</li>
            <li> I give this a low rating because the glue is very watery and seems to remain that way all day.  </li>
            <li> I received something far different:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has an applicator brush like the old eye liners in the tube</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s absolutely no waste.</li>
            <li> It might be a good product for eyelash glue, but poor product for double eyelid glue.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s your first time purchasing this product, buy only one even though shipping is kind of expensive.    </li>
            <li> It also dries fast enough so that you don&#x27;t have to worry about it slipping from the position you put it in, but too fast so that you can&#x27;t adjust it.</li>
            <li> way to much comes out of those with little control on how much you use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cut my lash prepping time by 75% and it dry uber fast.</li>
            <li> The glue doesn&#x27;t dry that fast-</li>
            <li> It is strong and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I also discovered I can use the fine brush included and apply a little dab on the inside and outside corner of my eye for that extra hold I need</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s white but dries clear.</li>
            <li> It goes on in an iridescent blue and then turns clear.</li>
            <li> After using it for only 3 days on my lids i developed lots of tiny wrinkles on them, which made me look old.</li>
            <li> The following day I put the glue on and didn&#x27;t wait for it to turn transparent and just put it directly on my lid</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s super easy to apply thanks to the wand applicator (something American eyelash glues should take note of, because using a squeeze tube is messy and difficult).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not the only false lash lover that has this problem.</li>
            <li> Just be patient: it will make the double eyelid more natual by apply little by little.</li>
            <li> Absolutely stellar hold, even on a humid 90-degree day and a little cry.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little off putting at first</li>
            <li> Stays on pretty well, but if you have oily skin or powder over the product, expect to touch up a little but through the day.</li>
            <li> easy to use, takes a little while to dry, sticks on pretty well, hard to remove</li>
            <li> You know how sometimes you squeeze a little bit too much of glue into your eyelashes?</li>
            <li> It is strong enough, made my false double eyelids look natural although it wasn&#x27;t harsh on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The thin brush is great to touch up on any missed spot once the false eyelashes are on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a long lasting glue for both double eyelids and eyelashes, and I finally found it!</li>
            <li> When you first apply it on, it will turn blue, which I was confused about, but it dries on clear.</li>
            <li> The only thing is, it&#x27;s pretty hard to remove.  </li>
            <li> product holds all day (and all night - accidently slept with them on) and it&#x27;s lasted me about 30 hours one time with no re-application and a late night and mid-day lunch haha!</li>
            <li> I got this as a last straw and was amazed by how long it held.</li>
            <li> I have tried Koji Eye talk, but it doesn&#x27;t last long after 4 hours.</li>
            <li> Also the glue does not last as long as I would like.</li>
            <li> I make a pretty thick layer and sleep with it.  </li>
            <li> Keep in mind though that I always make sure to put on extra glue on the corners every time I apply false lashes, and I didn&#x27;t go swimming in the pool but just dunked a few times.</li>
            <li> like i said before, and the skin gets red and dry.   </li>
            <li> the liquid is pearl white, it becomes invisible when dry so it doesn&#x27;t leave any suspicions XD anywayz.</li>
            <li> only con to this product (versus the Duo which is the only other product I have been using consistently) is the bottle is hard to handle versus a squeeze tube.</li>
            <li> It takes time to learn how to make eyelid from single to double in a neat way.</li>
            <li> Helps with the application process since you have to wait for glue to dry up some before applying, you can see when its starting to dry up and become tacky!</li>
            <li> it can be used for a long time since everytime</li>
            <li> only thing to be careful is not to get water or sweat on the glue.</li>
            <li> careful when putting the brush back in the bottle to make opening it easier in the future&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing lashes for a long, long time.  </li>
            <li> And it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Stays on long, I&#x27;m trying to see how long....</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been wanting to try eyelid glue for a long time and decided to order it from here.  </li>
            <li> The product was still in the box, but was completely and utterly dried up and unusable.</li>
            <li> .... will keep using this for a long time</li>
            <li> The packaging was good but the only thing is it has very bad English Translation</li>
            <li> You have to wait a long time for the glue to harden before applying your eyelashes and sometimes if you put too much glue on it&#x27;ll turn a white substance that shows on your false eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i dont know, i might be using it wrong, but it is actually kind of hard to use....</li>
            <li> when the lash comes off in the corner you can use the tiny brush to stick it back down!</li>
            <li> it just takes longer to dry.</li>
            <li> I apply the glue, then let it dry for a bit, then apply the lash.</li>
            <li> Then after removing the cap, I found that the glue are completely dry</li>
            <li> Plus, it turns a dark color the next day</li>
            <li> The Darkness False Eyelashes Glue and Gel is exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> I also have one eye that periodically waters so my lashes on that eye were always coming loose.  </li>
            <li> When I first used this as an eyelash glue, I thought it was the most terrible glue I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> , I can only guess it is to hold the ends of the lashes down and in place, I tried to do that, but not very usefull</li>
            <li> when i put it on my eyelid, i wait till the glue on my eyelid starts to get a little tacky, and thats when i use the eyelid wand to create my double eyelid.</li>
            <li> Also the glue was not very sticky.  </li>
            <li> but in an case it was dried up &amp; I sent it back</li>
            <li> It was completely empty.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased three of them, but when i opened them it was all dried.</li>
            <li> Even if you ARE just looking for eyelash glue and a double eyelid stick, this product is STILL a waste of time.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m furious that I spent my money on something that has no use to me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> its like when u get bubble gum on your skin, kind of annoying to remove.</li>
            <li> When I twisted the cap I knew right away</li>
            <li> when i tried to open the bottle it was really hard to open because the inside of it was all dried up.&lt;br /&gt;i paid about 6dollars for unusable eyelash glue.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a lot stronger than other kinds that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This product works really well in adhering your eyelashes and eyelids, however, it is  VERY HARD to remove!</li>
            <li> The only problem i have with this glue is that its hard to wash off the glue, so i end up peeling the glue off.</li>
            <li> the only con to it is that it&#x27;s hard to take off when applied.</li>
            <li> but i only give it a 4 because of how hard it is to take off.</li>
            <li> The only problem was that the glue was hard to take off.  </li>
            <li> But anyways, I like this product because of the skinny brush that comes with it, makes application on to the fake eyelash strip very convenient,</li>
            <li> it doesnt work that well and is really gooey and dries weird on eyelids.</li>
            <li> I bought this glue because I thought maybe it would make my striplashes last at least a weekend</li>
            <li> I will buy this again if that store closes down though.</li>
            <li> I kept thinking that maybe the glue would be different with the next order, but I thought wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also have had this for a month and a half</li>
            <li> So sensible and less mess.</li>
            <li> I bought both Koji Eyetalk and Darkness and Darkness is way easier to use, it&#x27;s less messy and seems stronger.  </li>
            <li> so it doesnt get thick or dry up.</li>
            <li> I like the little brush that is included, instead of having to squeeze the glue onto a toothpick.</li>
            <li> you just need a little bit of it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the little fork thing - don&#x27;t need it.  </li>
            <li> Even after cleansing the face and the use of a makeup remover, it still leaves some residue making the eye a little sticky still.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t allergic to Duo but found my eyes would burn a little when applying my lashes and soon they would be bloodshot, which lasted all day.</li>
            <li> The only thing I absolutely hate about it is that it&#x27;s super hard to remove.</li>
            <li> Also if you accidentely put some on your lashes, its hard to take off so be careful</li>
            <li> Only negative is - hard to get off.      </li>
            <li> Also, one of the bottles I ordered were completely dried up on the inside.</li>
            <li> In the trial kit, it has a toner, emulsion, cream, serum, trouble adieu enhancer, and eye serum.</li>
            <li> I use Darkness Glue everyday and it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Turns out it was completely dried out.</li>
            <li> I received this product all dried up.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a garbage.&lt;br /&gt;total waste of money</li>
            <li> the glue dried up.</li>
            <li> waste of money</li>
            <li> I wear lashes EVERYDAY, and have been doing so for about three years.</li>
            <li> whenever u try to remove it, or even after a few minutes/hours.</li>
            <li> The glue was completely dried out.</li>
            <li> The glue was all dried up, I am retuning it and probably not going to re-order again.</li>
            <li> It arrived dried.</li>
            <li> Product was completely dried up when I opened it.</li>
            <li> but all three of them, the glue was already dried up in the bottle</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Because the eyelash glue COMPLETELY DRIED UP by the time I opened it.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money like I did -__-&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> and it was all dried up.  </li>
            <li> it also has a gluey smell, but you get used to it and its not strong enough to make you vomit.  </li>
            <li> I have to peel it off and it&#x27;ll stay there for a few days usually.</li>
            <li> Does however leave behind  sticky residue, you have to work a little harder to remove the glue from your eyelids.</li>
            <li> Too bad it doesn&#x27;t have a bigger size or else i would buy the bigger size to use it longer  </li>
            <li> Cap it tight after use or it will start getting thick</li>
            <li> I have also not had any problems with my lashes coming off, and it does not stay on too much that removal is painful</li>
            <li> They give a small 3 piece moisturizer samples (Koream ISA KNOX) per order.</li>
            <li> and i use it everyday!</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Even if you use a few layers of glue, it won&#x27;t be too thick.</li>
            <li> It was just tacky and was not able to hold the eyelids in place for any amount of time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if its because of the way my eyes are shaped</li>
            <li> overall, i like this product and it works well with fake eyelashes</li>
            <li> and i was not able to close my eyes when i applied the glue on my eyelids.</li>
            <li> The manual of this product says that it can also works as double eyelid glue, but it totally failed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little difficult to get off, but that&#x27;s not much of a problem for me.</li>
            <li> i love eyelashes but hate how difficult applying them can be.  </li>
            <li> cause i was afraid that this product wouldnt last long, i was wrong.</li>
            <li> The downside to its super-holding power IS the fact that its really hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t hardly get it off.  </li>
            <li> hard to take off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- moderately hard to remove&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For me, I found it really hard to get off</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works for everyone, but since everyone thinks it&#x27;s hard to get off, i figured i&#x27;d share my method with you.</li>
            <li> Once I got a bottle that was totally hard, but what the heck.  </li>
            <li> i do admit it is bit hard to remove..</li>
            <li> - you can still use it thick</li>
            <li> I have a really thick lotion</li>
            <li> I have been wearing strip lashes for the past 50 years and NEVER before found a lash glue that held so well!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always afraid I&#x27;m going to knock it over or the glue inside is going to dry out</li>
            <li> it is also very hard to remove.</li>
            <li> I discovered that the glue product inside the tube had turned hard and gummy and was completely useless.</li>
            <li> I hate waiting for the glue to get tacky enough to hold the lash.  </li>
            <li> Bought this item to use with my false laashes.</li>
            <li> This is the strongest glue for false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I had false eyelashes on</li>
            <li> It does work however since it is also false eyelash glue</li>
            <li> It worked well as a false eyelash glue, but my preferred usage is for my eyelids.</li>
            <li> It came in completely dried out and is impossible to use.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed as I had ordered false eyelashes around the same time and had been hoping to try them out.</li>
            <li> The last three bottles have been awful.</li>
            <li> unfortunately i ordered 3 of them to save on shipping and don&#x27;t know what to do with thwm since i&#x27;m not a fan of fake eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Needless to say this product didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Difficult to get the eyelid folds correct with the tool given (it kept sticking to the glue).  </li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> been using this product for about a year now, and it fails to stop working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for over 10 years and it hasn&#x27;t fail me yet.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing false eyelashes for the longest time!  </li>
            <li> The false eyelashes never came unglued!</li>
            <li> something was wrong because it was very difficult pulling the cap off.</li>
            <li> So disappointing.</li>
            <li> I thought it might have been the freezing cold weather here in Chicago</li>
            <li> Was horrible the tube was all dried up and there was no glue in the tube when I opened it</li>
            <li> Very difficult to remove though.</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> Highly disappointed customer.</li>
            <li> This crap is like superglue.</li>
            <li> This is a crap buy, and the seller should be ashamed of themselves.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very unhappy about it!</li>
            <li> If you are terrible at applying lashes like I am, then this is the glue for you.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I feel like its faje or something...not as good quality as the last one i have purchased on ebay.</li>
            <li> The glue isn&#x27;t as strong as it used to be. It used to be able to last me the entire day, now it won&#x27;t even keep my lashes in tact for an hour. It seems as though they changed their formula and diluted it with water or something. The last three bottles have been awful. I kept thinking that maybe the glue would be different with the next order, but I thought wrong. Also, one of the bottles I ordered were completely dried up on the inside. Suffice to say, I&#x27;ll be looking for better options.</li>
            <li> I love to wear false eyelashes, but I never really had a great glue that would hold them all day. I got this as a last straw and was amazed by how long it held. It held all day and night and I had no problems with it what so ever. The best eyelash glue I have ever used and I would highly recommend it to my friends!</li>
            <li> I love this glue. It&#x27;s white but dries clear. This glue will hold all day/night. I&#x27;ve slept with falsies on and they are as if I just put them on the next morning. It doesn&#x27;t take off your real lashes when you remove your falsies which is a bonus! Cap it tight after use or it will start getting thick - you can still use it thick it just takes longer to dry. A must have tool in your beauty bag.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product, strong but not too difficult to remove. It takes time to learn how to make eyelid from single to double in a neat way. Just be patient: it will make the double eyelid more natual by apply little by little. Don&#x27;t put too many for the first line apply, otherwise it might stick somewhere thicker somewhere thinner. Put the glue layer by layer after each time your skin stick forward a little, until you feel satisfied about how much space of your eyelid skin have been sticked together. Good luck to you!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great AND they send you free gifts of shampoo and conditioning treatment. Couldnt ask for more!</li>
            <li> lunabeauty is great seller. Bought this item twice already.  I definitely love it or the faux eyelashes and not for the purpose of double eyelids.  The double sided tape from BN or wonder eyelid works much much better for double eyelid formation.  But anyways, I like this product because of the skinny brush that comes with it, makes application on to the fake eyelash strip very convenient, turns clear so u know when the lashes are ready to be put on and product also dries clear.  I would buy for eyelash glue purpose!</li>
            <li> I love using it. I tried eyelid tape before and people will notice it. Eyelid tape also falls off. Darkness is easy to apply. I have tried Koji Eye talk, but it doesn&#x27;t last long after 4 hours. This product last me up to 8 hours which is great! When I bought this, it also came with a mini bag of a trial kit! In the trial kit, it has a toner, emulsion, cream, serum, trouble adieu enhancer, and eye serum.</li>
            <li> one of the best products to use a double eyelid glue!&lt;br /&gt;a lot of koreans use this in fact</li>
            <li> this is a very strong glue, good for gluing fake eyelashes. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it as a double eye lid glue though, it stretches skin too much. After using it for only 3 days on my lids i developed lots of tiny wrinkles on them, which made me look old. Recovering them with Shiseido&#x27;s bioperformance creams now ..    unfortunately i ordered 3 of them to save on shipping and don&#x27;t know what to do with thwm since i&#x27;m not a fan of fake eyelashes. If it&#x27;s your first time purchasing this product, buy only one even though shipping is kind of expensive.    They give a small 3 piece moisturizer samples (Koream ISA KNOX) per order.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright for a double eyelid glue. It holds on fine, but not for an extra long time--maybe 3 hrs? The only thing I absolutely hate about it is that it&#x27;s super hard to remove. I tried water, soap, makeup remover, but it still won&#x27;t come off. You can&#x27;t even peel it off, too. You have to scratch and rub it off and it hurts your eyelids. Plus, it turns a dark color the next day so it&#x27;s very noticeable. My advice is probably get Eyetalk rather than Darkness because it&#x27;s easier to remove.</li>
            <li> its not dark like it says, it is really white that when it dries becomes clear, well that is great and all, but it still shows when you put your make-up on. but like the other one I ordered, guess it is the same as most, but I do know this is better then the tube type. way to much comes out of those with little control on how much you use. So yea this is the best of the adhesives. comes with a tool, but not too sure as what the heck it is used for, not in English or it just doesn&#x27;t tell you what it is for, I can only guess it is to hold the ends of the lashes down and in place, I tried to do that, but not very usefull</li>
            <li> I have been wearing false eyelashes for the longest time!  And I am so glad that my little sister&#x27;s friend let me borrow some when my eyelashes were coming off one night out.  This is a miracle product!  So I got home and ordered a tube of my own.  The thin brush is great to touch up on any missed spot once the false eyelashes are on.  It is strong and a little goes a long way.  I would not be using anything else!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looking for a eyelash glue that does cause a allergic reaction. Needless to say this product didn&#x27;t work for me. However it would be a great product for that doesn&#x27;t have the same issue as I. The false eyelashes never came unglued!</li>
            <li> This glue does what it&#x27;s suppose to do. It dries clear which is good. But there are cheaper alternatives out there you can get from Ebay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for quite sometime and i love it. I use Darkness Glue everyday and it works like a charm. I have to say, i think darkness glue is best for putting on false lashes. The only problem i have with this glue is that its hard to wash off the glue, so i end up peeling the glue off. Overall i still prefer the darkness glue over the Koji eyetalk glue.      -I bought 3 cause i was afraid that this product wouldnt last long, i was wrong. Suprisenly its last 2-4 months and i use it everyday! I&#x27;m still using my first one! I would definately recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product is not working for me at all. I already have double eyelids and just want to make it wider. However, this glue is only good for an hour or so and needs to be reapplied often. it is also very hard to remove. My eyelid was very red and itchy after using it for two days, so I have decided to give the whole thing to one of my friends. What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> This product worked like it was suppose to. I know Korean so i read the directions on how to use this glue. There was everything but one. How to take it off. I had no idea how to so i tried washing it off like 10 times.. Also if you accidentely put some on your lashes, its hard to take off so be careful</li>
            <li> This crap is like superglue. I&#x27;ve used all kinds of eye lash glue over the years and this is hands down the best. Not only does it make your lashes stay put all day, it&#x27;s super easy to apply thanks to the wand applicator (something American eyelash glues should take note of, because using a squeeze tube is messy and difficult). Fast shipping too, will buy again!</li>
            <li> Hands down, this is my favorite lash glue ever. I like the little brush that is included, instead of having to squeeze the glue onto a toothpick. I apply the glue, then let it dry for a bit, then apply the lash. Applying lashes is tricky, it sometimes takes me a try or two before I get it right. Even if you use a few layers of glue, it won&#x27;t be too thick. Love it!</li>
            <li> i just tried it once since i get it. but it seemed like it works really well.   it can be used for a long time since everytime you just need a little bit of it.  good price and good quality.:D</li>
            <li> Bought this to use instead of eyelid tape but it didn&#x27;t work.  Difficult to get the eyelid folds correct with the tool given (it kept sticking to the glue).  Also the glue was not very sticky.  It was just tacky and was not able to hold the eyelids in place for any amount of time.  Haven&#x27;t tried it as an eyelash glue.  Better off buying eyelid tape.</li>
            <li> And I know you will too. If you are like me a beginner in putting fake lashes and pretty much don&#x27;t have that much experience this glue is great. In fact is even better then DUO glue and I&#x27;ve had that one too. Trust me I know what I&#x27;m talking about. You know how sometimes you squeeze a little bit too much of glue into your eyelashes? Well you won&#x27;t have a problem with this one since it has a wand to apply it (like liquid liner). No this is not sponsored or paid for or given for free. I actually paid with my own money and am giving 100% my own review so girls out there know the truth in makeup lol. BTW shipping was fast and it arrived in good conditions. I&#x27;ve also have had this for a month and a half so felt entitled to give my review.</li>
            <li> I bought both Koji Eyetalk and Darkness and Darkness is way easier to use, it&#x27;s less messy and seems stronger.  The glue is unscented and a fluorescent color but dries quickly and sticks for the whole day.  I would definitely buy it again over the more expensive Koji Eyetalk.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good double eyelid glue to use, and this one was definitely the product i was looking for. when i put it on my eyelid, i wait till the glue on my eyelid starts to get a little tacky, and thats when i use the eyelid wand to create my double eyelid. It holds amazingly well, lasts all day with absolutely no worries! only thing to be careful is not to get water or sweat on the glue. It will start to turn white and you&#x27;ll have to peel it off and put the glue on again, which won&#x27;t take more than 2 minutes anyway. This had amazing staying power, i can sleep with it on and it&#x27;ll still hold. great product!!</li>
            <li> Wish I could give this product zero stars. When I twisted the cap I knew right away something was wrong because it was very difficult pulling the cap off. Turns out it was completely dried out. Vendor should do a quality check first before shipping. So disappointing.</li>
            <li> This glue works well, it gets tacky in about 30 to 40 seconds depend on how much you put on, and once i stick them on it stays, and it&#x27;s easy to remove them, i personally didn&#x27;t need any special products to help the removal. Just lightly pull them off from the sides and it&#x27;s as easy as that. The brush that&#x27;s inside the bottle is great for applying the glue on by itself.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. It works great, it arrived a few days before expected and the trial kit was fun (and works great, I might add).    After you apply the glue, you DO have to wait about 30 seconds before trying to get anything to hold, but once it sets, it holds. I wore the glue all day at work (hot and humid climate, no AC) and it didnt run or clump, and I could wear eyeliner!    The downside to its super-holding power IS the fact that its really hard to wash off. I tried a makeup remover, and a \\&quot;tear free\\&quot; skin cleanser, it still didnt come off. In the end, I sort of had to peel the glue. Oh well.    Also if you can&#x27;t read korean, good luck with the instructions and packaging.     Overall I give it four stars because it works great, but even after you get rid of it, it still leaves a gummy residue on your skin that you sort of have to manually peel off.</li>
            <li> this glue holds double eyelids very well (: my only beef with this product though is that after continuous use, the glue dries out kind of quickly and gets VERY tacky. to the point there it&#x27;s unusable. but when the tube is new, it works very well! hold a lot better than Koji Eye Talk and Darkness honestly seems almost water proof. lasts the whole day and no need to wash off and reapply. it kind of seems TOO strong, but with some make up remover it should come off quite easily. would be 5 stars if the glue didn&#x27;t dry out so fast, but overall i would definitely repurchase and i love this product!</li>
            <li> Very strong and good glue for eyelashes or double eyelid. Have been using this brand for the longest, nothing compares.</li>
            <li> Best eyelash glue out there!!!</li>
            <li> I received this product all dried up. I thought it might have been the freezing cold weather here in Chicago but I&#x27;m not 100% if that&#x27;s the real reason. That&#x27;s why I gave it 2 stars. I&#x27;m not satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li> held my eyelashes even when i went to sleep in them during an intoxicated night. however i wouldnt use these to give yourself eyelids. it doesnt work that well and is really gooey and dries weird on eyelids.</li>
            <li> super duper sticky.  Can&#x27;t hardly get it off.  Works well.</li>
            <li> I finally found eyelash glue that works! I have never been able to keep lashes on but this helped me keep huge costume lashes on all day and night.</li>
            <li> I bought this glue because I thought maybe it would make my striplashes last at least a weekend..I was wrong. The glue works well for a day, then the lashes will come off. I could of purchased a $3.00 adhesive to do that..</li>
            <li> This product was in unusable condition when I received it.  I don&#x27;t know if it was kept in inhospitable temperatures or if it was just very very old... but in an case it was dried up &amp; I sent it back</li>
            <li> best lash glue there is out there, and I&#x27;ve tried many. I hope they never stop selling it</li>
            <li> Bought this item to use with my false laashes. I was definitely a bit hesitant to purchase it but read all the good reviews about it so I thought, \\&quot;what the heck?\\&quot; the glue itself works pretty well. It does leave a a sticky residue after you have taken off your lashes. However, I did not have any problems removing the residue with my eye makeup remover. My eyelids kept getting stuck together. I&#x27;m not sure if its because of the way my eyes are shaped (I&#x27;m Asian) or my oily skin. I definitely prefer this glue over the drugstore Duo brand glue. I like the applicator tip and the fact that the glue comes out white and when ready it becomes clear. I say, give it a try. {purchased this under my husband&#x27;s Amazon account}</li>
            <li> This tube had nothing in it. It was completely empty. I&#x27;m going to stick with ebay from now on. At first I thought it was a mistake but no product was in there. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is great for false eyelashes, and it&#x27;s easy application. Shipping is a little overpriced, so I recommend ordering more than one at a time.</li>
            <li> Dries clean and quick, but not so quickly that you can&#x27;t adjust position a pinch when applying. When the gel is a pastel purple I apply, tweak the position a pinch and voila! Perfection. Absolutely stellar hold, even on a humid 90-degree day and a little cry. Even in my sleep! I wore the lashes in my picture for a full 48 hours and they didn&#x27;t budge a bit. And these are the ones passing the hot/humid/tearful test. I&#x27;ve been through every kind of adhesive you could try and at last my search is over. No white-out look or gloppy residue. This is the only brand I&#x27;ll purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the glue for the last month and have really enjoyed it! It&#x27;s cut my lash prepping time by 75% and it dry uber fast. The first time I took the bottle with me because i wasn&#x27;t sure if one side was going to hold up (I was blowing on the lash glue which is not necessary). It attached to my lid but as suspected, one corner kind of came undone. So I just pulled the whole thing off, reput the glue on and stuck it in my eye in about 20 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con to this product (versus the Duo which is the only other product I have been using consistently) is the bottle is hard to handle versus a squeeze tube. I&#x27;m always afraid I&#x27;m going to knock it over or the glue inside is going to dry out so I keep closing it for each lid. Probably just my own insecurities shining through!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product holds all day (and all night - accidently slept with them on) and it&#x27;s lasted me about 30 hours one time with no re-application and a late night and mid-day lunch haha!</li>
            <li> Pros: not noticeable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons: hard to take off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if anyone know an easy way to take it off, please share! :P</li>
            <li> Anyone that buys this product, you&#x27;re not going to be disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year now, and it fails to stop working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I would like to warn anyone who buys this product is that it can, overtime, cause your eyelids to swell and become VERY saggy.&lt;br /&gt;If you would like to see before and after pictures, you can email me at priscillarhym@gmail.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW TO PROPERLY TAKE THE EYELID GLUE OFF WITHOUT CAUSING SAGGY EYES:&lt;br /&gt;1. Take you makeup remover (I use Chanel eye makeup remover) and just place it on your eyelids for about 15-20 seconds or so to dampen your eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;2. Then, GENTLY rub your eyelid glue off.  It should come up easily.&lt;br /&gt;3.  I would recommend using eye lotion (you can buy it online or at walmart) and apply it on your eyes after removing the makeup.  It&#x27;ll keep it moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really hope this helped!  Good luck on your eyes!(:</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with Darkness products but I&#x27;m very happy with the experience. The smell is a little off putting at first but overall I&#x27;d recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+ color change to indicate when the product is ready to adhere&lt;br /&gt;+ great applicator brush&lt;br /&gt;+ stays all day&lt;br /&gt;+ easy to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- smell, which dissipates after about 10 minutes&lt;br /&gt;- all korean packaging and instructions&lt;br /&gt;- the glue often sticks the cap to the rest of the bottle&lt;br /&gt;- moderately hard to remove&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Protips: I&#x27;d check youtube to tutorials on how to apply (the instructions aren&#x27;t in English)&lt;br /&gt;Be careful when putting the brush back in the bottle to make opening it easier in the future&lt;br /&gt;Use makeup remover to remove the sticky residue (I use makeup wipes and peel off the glue in a clump)</li>
            <li> when i tried to open the bottle it was really hard to open because the inside of it was all dried up.&lt;br /&gt;i paid about 6dollars for unusable eyelash glue.&lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;t even contact the seller.&lt;br /&gt;refund my money or send me a new one.&lt;br /&gt;this product doesn&#x27;t even need to be returned it&#x27;s a garbage.&lt;br /&gt;total waste of money</li>
            <li> Works great last all day. This is my second time buying the item. Will continue to buy. Is better than store brand eyelash glie</li>
            <li> Best product ever. I&#x27;ve been using it for over 10 years and it hasn&#x27;t fail me yet. Definitely for those that have sagging eyes or no eyelids. It works.</li>
            <li> + fast shipping, stayed 12 hours for me, can wear makeup, can use it as eyelash glue, it prefect in that way.  Only negative is - hard to get off.      UPDATE! UPDATE! UPDATE! UPDATE! UPDATE! UPDATE!    For me, I found it really hard to get off like i said before, and the skin gets red and dry.   Bur now i have a solution that may work for some of you.   When i&#x27;m washing it off on the evening i just try to scratch it off as much as possible. It doesn&#x27;t matter if i leave some parts of the glue during the night.  Here comes the trick.    I have a really thick lotion -Repair, that i put on my lids. I make a pretty thick layer and sleep with it.  On the morning i can go and wash away the left pices of the glue from yesterday, and my lids are as usuall, not at all sensitve, just as nothing has happend!     I don&#x27;t know if it works for everyone, but since everyone thinks it&#x27;s hard to get off, i figured i&#x27;d share my method with you. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s good if you have oily eyelids but. for those like me it might work.  I have no idea so mabey just try it? :)</li>
            <li> Loved it for both my eyelash glue (not so sticky it hurt to remove them and not so weak that they fell off... it was just right)  also great for creating the double eyelid, once again, just the right amount of stick to hold things together but not hurt when removing...  all at a great price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright, doesn&#x27;t really apply well.</li>
            <li> This is the strongest glue for false eyelashes. It&#x27;s very similar to the Revlon one but this one actually came before that. I&#x27;ve used this one for over 6 years! I personally believe that it&#x27;s stronger. Why? Believe it or not, I was pushed into the pool by friends at a BBQ/party this summer. I had false eyelashes on (I didn&#x27;t plan on going in the pool) but I ended up in the pool anyway (face, hair, and all). To my surprise though, my eyelashes were still intact. I actually ended up getting pushed in three times and my eyelashes still were not falling off on the corners! I&#x27;m not claiming that this is waterproof by any means, but I will say that it is strong! Keep in mind though that I always make sure to put on extra glue on the corners every time I apply false lashes, and I didn&#x27;t go swimming in the pool but just dunked a few times. Since this is very strong, it will hurt if you try to remove them by peeling/pulling it off. It comes off easily with make up remover so do not just yank them off with out it! Holy grail glue.</li>
            <li> I really like this glue.  Keeps my lashes in place all day even through snow storms, and horseback riding (so sweat had no effect on it). Its easy to apply and the glue is transparent when applied. You do need to wait about 20 seconds before applying to get it to stay. The only problem with this glue is that it is a bit hard to get off, I have to apply make up remover, the oil based ones help remove it better for me with warm water.  If theres some left it will &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; off quite easy.</li>
            <li> i find out i am allergic with glue that has latex in it. and this one has latex in it</li>
            <li> love it!! will buy forever!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing lashes for a long, long time.  I hate waiting for the glue to get tacky enough to hold the lash.  Well...this stuff is ready as soon as it&#x27;s applied.  it holds really well all day.  I don&#x27;t use the little fork thing - don&#x27;t need it.  Once I got a bottle that was totally hard, but what the heck.  It was worth it to reorder without making them refund me.  I love being able to just paint the lash glue on.  It gives you much more control over how much glue is on the lash, plus when the lash comes off in the corner you can use the tiny brush to stick it back down!</li>
            <li> received this product with mini samples which i did not expect :)  but this product works well! the only con to it is that it&#x27;s hard to take off when applied. so i sometimes use a makeup remover and when i forget to take off the glue and go to sleep, i wake up with no glue on my eyelids. haha.  it also has a gluey smell, but you get used to it and its not strong enough to make you vomit.  overall, i like this product and it works well with fake eyelashes but i only give it a 4 because of how hard it is to take off. i almost have to scratch and pick them off of my eyelids.</li>
            <li> It shiped really fast and works really good. A tip you can use to remove the glue is baby oil or olive oil.  I use baby oil on mine and it comes off without a problem.</li>
            <li> love it! works well, will definitely be getting more of this glue, but as for the price, i  heard you can buy these at a few chinese/korean super markets for $4</li>
            <li> the glue dried up. I could not even open the cap. Then after removing the cap, I found that the glue are completely dry</li>
            <li> This was shipped fast and I love that you can apply the glue with a brush. So sensible and less mess. It lasts for all day wear, but if you&#x27;re looking for something that will hold for more than a day, I suggest you look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Great eyelash glue, really keeps the false lashes in place all day. Does however leave behind  sticky residue, you have to work a little harder to remove the glue from your eyelids.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased three of them, but when i opened them it was all dried. waste of money so i returned it hoping i get my money back</li>
            <li> I wear lashes EVERYDAY, and have been doing so for about three years. Trust me ladies, leave the DUO brand alone, it pales in comparison to this stuff. When I wore DUO, and my lashes would start to come off within a couple of hours. I can wear this brand ALL DAY, and the glue doesn&#x27;t clump, nor does it show (you know, when you accidentally put too much on the lash, so you have to put on a layer of eyeliner to cover up the dried up glue). I can put my lashes on with NO cover up eyeliner, and they look natural and fresh. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This stuff is AWESOME!!  i love eyelashes but hate how difficult applying them can be.  This product makes everything FASTER and easier! a MUST HAVE.</li>
            <li> The Darkness False Eyelashes Glue and Gel is exactly what I needed.  It&#x27;s a bit stubborn when trying to take it off but all you need is some eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T BUY THIS!!! if I could give this product a ZERO star I would!! it does not work as an eyelid glue because it would show the glue and i was not able to close my eyes when i applied the glue on my eyelids. It is one of the stickiest and most stubborn glue to get off. i used makeup remover, baby oil, eyelash glue remover and it doesnt come off!! PLEASE DONT BUY THIS, you are wasting your money and hurting yourself if you use this as an eyelid glue!!</li>
            <li> Really good glue. Stays put all night! Very difficult to remove though. I would recommend soaking a cloth and putting it over your eye for a while before you rub it off and take off the lashes, or use a product that is more oily.</li>
            <li> i chose 3 because first the product sticks well! maybe too well.&lt;br /&gt;The CON is it turns black/grey whenever u try to remove it, or even after a few minutes/hours. its like when u get bubble gum on your skin, kind of annoying to remove.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I&#x27;ve been searching for a long lasting glue for both double eyelids and eyelashes, and I finally found it! When you first apply it on, it will turn blue, which I was confused about, but it dries on clear. It also dries fast enough so that you don&#x27;t have to worry about it slipping from the position you put it in, but too fast so that you can&#x27;t adjust it. It&#x27;s a little difficult to get off, but that&#x27;s not much of a problem for me. I&#x27;ll be buying from them more often</li>
            <li> I ordered this product thinking it looked like a clean and efficient way to apply lash adhesive because of the mascara-like tube it comes in.  But when it arrived and I tried to open the tube the top came completely off from the wand. At that point I had to try and tweezer-out the end of the wand. It wouldn&#x27;t come out. I discovered that the glue product inside the tube had turned hard and gummy and was completely useless. I was very disappointed as I had ordered false eyelashes around the same time and had been hoping to try them out. I still haven&#x27;t gotten a new type of lash adhesive to try them out with yet as I thought this product would work. Highly disappointed customer.</li>
            <li> When I first used this as an eyelash glue, I thought it was the most terrible glue I&#x27;ve ever used. The product says to wait until the glue turns transparent before putting it on your lid so that&#x27;s what I did. This caused my lashes to fall off shortly after and didn&#x27;t hold at all. The following day I put the glue on and didn&#x27;t wait for it to turn transparent and just put it directly on my lid and it worked like a charm! It lasts throughout the day, through gym time, through tears, and it would probably last through an apocalypse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When removing the glue, use a q tip dipped in makeup remover and move the q tip back and forth on top of the lashes to remove (do NOT pull off or you will end up with bald eyelids).</li>
            <li> You might find it tricky at first but once you get hang of it.. this is just amazing product!! tho the liquid is pearl white, it becomes invisible when dry so it doesn&#x27;t leave any suspicions XD anywayz. i do admit it is bit hard to remove.. but it hold REALLY well EVEN IN THE WATER!!! i think i could even go swimming with this (tho i wouldn&#x27;t try)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a strong glue.  Holds up very long, so it&#x27;s great for false lash users who want their lash to stay in place for a good amount of time and for people who wants to create that double eyelid effect that would last for the whole day/night.  The only thing is, it&#x27;s pretty hard to remove.  Even after cleansing the face and the use of a makeup remover, it still leaves some residue making the eye a little sticky still. 5 star because the strength is what I&#x27;m looking for. Great price and the delivery was very quick.</li>
            <li> After gluing my eyelashes on I wore them for over 16 hours and even showered with them on and didn&#x27;t have any lift. When I look my eyelashes off they pealed easily and did not pull my natural lashes out. I will continue to purchase this product as needed.</li>
            <li> My favorite to use, my lashes last all day!&lt;br /&gt;I cant live without it! i have been using this for years!</li>
            <li> This glue works okay, but takes awhile to dry. I prefer a faster setting glue. Also the glue does not last as long as I would like. It tends to wear off before the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Love this glue. Easy to apply with applicator which I love better than tubes.  And it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> If I could, I would rate NO star. The glue was completely dried out. Never ordering from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I received a defective bottle. The glue was all dried up, I am retuning it and probably not going to re-order again.</li>
            <li> It arrived dried. Not usable.. Had to return it. Maybe you will have better luck but have to give it 1 star</li>
            <li> I give this a low rating because the glue is very watery and seems to remain that way all day.  Lashes did not adhere very well at all.  I did like the idea of brushing the glue on tho.</li>
            <li> The manual of this product says that it can also works as double eyelid glue, but it totally failed. It might be a good product for eyelash glue, but poor product for double eyelid glue.</li>
            <li> If you are terrible at applying lashes like I am, then this is the glue for you.  Changes to a bluish hue when it&#x27;s ready to attach, and stays on until you want to remove.  Glue is a bit of a pain to remove later, but if you apply lotion to your lids before bed, it will wash off in the morning no problems.</li>
            <li> This is the first Korean beauty product that I&#x27;ve bought, Its great, has a fine-tipped paint brush for the glue for extreme accuracy and precision for glue placement. Comes with basic instructions and a plastic wishbone looking tool. The glue doesn&#x27;t dry that fast- but gets sticky very quickly. You can continue to re-adjust lashes if you miss your lash-line without having to apply more glue. Peels away easy and with minimal discomfort. Stays on long, I&#x27;m trying to see how long.... it&#x27;s an ongoing process.</li>
            <li> Product was completely dried up when I opened it.</li>
            <li> I received this product on time. The packaging was good but the only thing is it has very bad English Translation and so reading the instructions would be a pain. This product works really well in adhering your eyelashes and eyelids, however, it is  VERY HARD to remove! I put double eyelids on my right eye and after removing with make up remover as well as washing it, there were still residue of the product. The same thing happens when I use it as an eyelash glue. It is very difficult to remove. I haven&#x27;t found a good method to remove it yet. I have to peel it off and it&#x27;ll stay there for a few days usually.</li>
            <li> Can someone please look at the ingredients and post whether this is latex based or not? The listing doesn&#x27;t say and since I have a latex allergy it&#x27;s information I need before ordering.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not the only false lash lover that has this problem. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I ordered three all at once so I wouldn&#x27;t have to keep ordering more but all three of them, the glue was already dried up in the bottle and I can&#x27;t even contact the seller about this. Waste of money. Buy from the brand Ipum instead!!</li>
            <li> This is the best eyelash glue ever.  Surprisingly, it stayed on for 2 days if I dont use oil to wash my face. Great product!!</li>
            <li> Beyond incredible. Finally a glue that will hold up all day and beyond. Can finally rock lashes with no worries!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been wanting to try eyelid glue for a long time and decided to order it from here.  This is the BEST glue I have tried.  It takes practice to get your creases to look perfect but the glue is extra sticky and lasts a long time.  The only problem was that the glue was hard to take off.  I had both eyes under hot cloths for a good 20 minutes so that the glue would be able to rub off.  The instructions are also in Japanese so I don&#x27;t even know if that&#x27;s how your supposed to remove it.  But otherwise, awesome product!</li>
            <li> It is strong enough, made my false double eyelids look natural although it wasn&#x27;t harsh on my sensitive skin. I really like it.</li>
            <li> It does work however since it is also false eyelash glue it is excruciating to remove from the eye, so it will take time</li>
            <li> I love using this. This is a lot stronger than other kinds that I&#x27;ve used. Too bad it doesn&#x27;t have a bigger size or else i would buy the bigger size to use it longer  then I won&#x27;t have to keep ordering and ordering. other than that, I love this product.</li>
            <li> This goes on in almost a glowing color so you can see where the glue is...then dries clear and not crusty so your eyes don&#x27;t itch! Holds great and you get TONS of uses out of it!</li>
            <li> I needed this quickly because I was going to a wedding and I wanted something nicer than you could buy at the grocery store. I actually paid for 1-day shipping. This was a big mistake. The product was still in the box, but was completely and utterly dried up and unusable. Now I have to go through the process of sending it back just to get my money back. I will never buy something from this seller ever again.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a pair of simple eyelashes, along with eyelash glue. I received something far different:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, there&#x27;s a device in this box that lets you get double eyelids, but that was no use to me. Even though the title deceptively makes it seem like there&#x27;s a pair of eyelashes that come with this product (maybe it was just me), but this is ONLY the double eyelid stick and the glue...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT WAIT. Even if you ARE just looking for eyelash glue and a double eyelid stick, this product is STILL a waste of time. Because the eyelash glue COMPLETELY DRIED UP by the time I opened it. It&#x27;s winter and I live in California, so maybe it&#x27;s just my location.. but I&#x27;m furious that I spent my money on something that has no use to me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is definitely a *don&#x27;t buy* for me. The title is deceptive, the double eyelid stick is cheap and plastic, and the eyelash glue, its only redeeming feature, DRIED UP. Please don&#x27;t waste your money like I did -__-&amp;#34;. This is a crap buy, and the seller should be ashamed of themselves.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  I hope they never stop making it!  I have been wearing strip lashes for the past 50 years and NEVER before found a lash glue that held so well!  Especially at the corners.  It even held up when I got sprayed with water on a boat trip!  The Duo would have completely unstuck immediately!  I also have one eye that periodically waters so my lashes on that eye were always coming loose.  Not with this glue!!  This is a keeper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read some comments about people receiving their Darkness glue tube and it was all dried up.  Not mine!  It was perfect!  I have been using it for over a month now and it&#x27;s still very fluid in the container!  I am now going to order more just to keep on hand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it!  You will love it!</li>
            <li> It came in completely dried out and is impossible to use. I am very unhappy about it! Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of eyelash glue in my time and can say that this is my all time favorite.  It holds and i never worry about the lashes coming undone.</li>
            <li> Probably best eyelid glue I&#x27;ve tried. Fellow monolids or girls who want to enhance their eyelid folds should give it a try. It worked well as a false eyelash glue, but my preferred usage is for my eyelids. Stays on pretty well, but if you have oily skin or powder over the product, expect to touch up a little but through the day.</li>
            <li> easy to use, takes a little while to dry, sticks on pretty well, hard to remove</li>
            <li> It sticks really well. I bought this to do makeup on some friends that were modeling for me at my college&#x27;s fashion show.</li>
            <li> Was horrible the tube was all dried up and there was no glue in the tube when I opened it</li>
            <li> if a storm is coming, you wouldnt need to worry about your lashes falling out ;)</li>
            <li> You have to wait a long time for the glue to harden before applying your eyelashes and sometimes if you put too much glue on it&#x27;ll turn a white substance that shows on your false eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after playing around with it you will get the hang of it. It&#x27;s a nice product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After saying all this though, I think that we should live in a society where we don&#x27;t have t apply false eye lashes to be defined as beautiful by heteronormative cultural standards.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t help my eyelashes stay on and wasn&#x27;t sticky enough, I wore them for Thanksgiving and they came off when it didn&#x27;t need to. fast srevice and delivery, just product not what I could use again.</li>
            <li> seriously the best eyelash glue ever... so easy to apply/use and lasted all night long with comfort.... will keep using this for a long time</li>
            <li> i dont know, i might be using it wrong, but it is actually kind of hard to use.... but im still working on it...idk....</li>
            <li> I expected a bit more but the glue is OK. I have oily skins so I did read the reviews before I bought this.  It sometimes doesn&#x27;t stick well. But whatever it&#x27;s the first time I buy something like this.</li>
            <li> This eye lash glue is fabulous!!! I&#x27;ve tried several eye lash glues and they are not as good as this one!!! In a quickness the glue drys!!! I&#x27;m going to be buying this again! Thank u so much!!!</li>
            <li> Best Eyelash glue I have ever used!!! Will buy again and again! It goes on as a vibrant greenish color but dries clear. Helps with the application process since you have to wait for glue to dry up some before applying, you can see when its starting to dry up and become tacky! I have also not had any problems with my lashes coming off, and it does not stay on too much that removal is painful (yes I have had glues do that to me before). The brush tip also make application easy and if you miss a corner, dabbing the brush on the end of your lash (when already applied) makes it extremely easy to do!</li>
            <li> Favorite glue! Really sticks n keeps lashes on for days!</li>
            <li> I wear strip lashes daily and have tried every eyelash glue known to man. I have oily skin and the glue would either not hold or my eyes would be red. I wasn&#x27;t allergic to Duo but found my eyes would burn a little when applying my lashes and soon they would be bloodshot, which lasted all day. I tried this Darkness on a whim and am absolutely delighted with it! It has an applicator brush like the old eye liners in the tube so it&#x27;s a snap to spread across the scrip. There&#x27;s absolutely no waste. I also discovered I can use the fine brush included and apply a little dab on the inside and outside corner of my eye for that extra hold I need so my edges don&#x27;t lift.  It goes on in an iridescent blue and then turns clear. Be sure and keep the top of the tube free of glue and screw the brush in tightly so it doesnt get thick or dry up. If you&#x27;ve ever had trouble finding a great glue, give this one a shot!</li>
            <li> I think this is the best glue that I&#x27;ve bought online, but this glue cracks too easily and the one I bought in a nearby store is much for stickier. I will buy this again if that store closes down though.</li>
