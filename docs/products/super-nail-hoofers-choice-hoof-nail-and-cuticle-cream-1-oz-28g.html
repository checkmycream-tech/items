            <li>Did not see any real results.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t perfumed, so it doesn&#x27;t smell nice, but it&#x27;s not a strong smell, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  </li>

            <li> My nails had been peeling terribly for years.  Nothing I tried was working.  I found this hoofer&#x27;s choice cream and started massaging it into my nails and cuticles before I go to sleep at night, and again in the morning.  After a couple weeks, no more peeling nails!  I just love this stuff.  It isn&#x27;t perfumed, so it doesn&#x27;t smell nice, but it&#x27;s not a strong smell, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  It&#x27;s a very rich cream.  After trying all the nail hardening treatments out there, I&#x27;m happy I finally found something that works!</li>
            <li> For years I have struggled with extremely dry nails and cuticles. I have tried everything to no avail. One day I came across this little jar of Hoofer&#x27;s Choice Nail and Cuticle Cream. It cought my attention....and thought...\\&quot;why not, I&#x27;ll give it one more try\\&quot;. I brought it home and applied it to my nails and cuticles and the results were amazing. The cream is so rich and emolient and my cuticles felt better immediately. The next day....they were even better.     I have since used it for dry heels, extremely dry winter skin on hands and face and legs....and it has been the most amazing product I have ever purchased and my skin feels baby soft. I highly recommend this product. It does everything it promises....and more.</li>
            <li> *Look at my Before &amp; After Photos of my Middle &amp; Ring finger cuticles*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I&#x27;m a male &amp; don&#x27;t care how my finger nails look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently moved places &amp; had to do a ton of cleaning &amp; lifting for days.  My hands got destroyed &amp; so did my cuticles - resulting in painful deep cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neosporen wasn&#x27;t be effective enough so after many Amazon reviews I tried this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Literally after 2 days, I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast my cuticles healed.  I applied a thin layer of cream with a cotton swap along the edges of my nails in the morning, afternoon &amp; before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream has a light fragrance - reminds me of Vicks Vapor rub, not very strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended...  If you find my review helpful please click yes or no &amp; any questions just ask me.</li>
            <li> Using this on my toes as I had laser treatment for fungus a year ago and now nails look great.  This product is great!</li>
            <li> All together great product.  Pure and simple.</li>
            <li> This is an extremely good product for dry hands and cuticles.  Lasts forever!</li>
            <li> Works great on my nails, but it does not have a nice smell. I wish it did, but still, it seems to help my dry cuticles.</li>
            <li> I did not get the results I expected from this product.  It felt too thick and appeared to stay on the surface of the skin and not to penetrate into the skin.  It washes off easily when I wash my hands as if there was no moisture barrier left on my cuticles.  I would rather have a cuticle conditioner which exfoliates dead skin also around the cuticles.  I purchased this to improve my cuticles which are dry and splitting and this cream did not improve my cuticles.</li>
            <li> Not very happy with it. Improved my cuticles but my nails still have the deep ridges and are still brittle. Would not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> 25 years my hands have cracked, pealed, broken out, red nasty and sore on and off all too often.  This is the ONLY cream that has not stung and softens my hands to let me use them.  Best stuff ever!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I have been using this cream for a year and the results have been great.</li>
            <li> This is truly a wonderful product.  My nephew uses it on his psoriasis affected finger nails and new is growing out healthy and looking good!!  Miracle Cream it is!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Does temporarily improve my nails.  They are very dry and frequently crack or peel.  It&#x27;s not a cure because if I forget a day the same dry and cracked nails return.  Compared to what I&#x27;ve bought over the counter this product works much better and doesn&#x27;t damage my nails further.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, feet and cuticles.  This is absolutely the best product I have found to add moisture.  I have tried every fancy cream and oil and nothing compares!  I have super crusty feet, I apply this before bed and it is magic!  I have a jar by my bed and a jar at my desk so I am never caught with dry cracked skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had nail problems from the nervous habit of picking at my cuticles to my nails splitting. In college I was able to stop picking at my nails and began to take better care of them with hardening nail polish. After college I started working full time in an office with lots of paper, which in turn dried out nails and my cuticles, and then I was back to picky at my cuticles because they were so dry. At my other job I&#x27;m around water with bathing dogs and grooming them (also very drying). I&#x27;ve oils and more nail hardeners only to watch as the tops of the tips of my nails begin to split causing them to be weak again. Desperate for relief I finally turned to Sally&#x27;s Beauty where I found Hoofer&#x27;s Choice. So I tried it. It works like a miracle. My nails look and feel fantastic! They&#x27;re stronger and even if and when they split at top, what&#x27;s left is still strong and doesn&#x27;t split my nail the rest of the way to the nail bed.</li>
            <li> Have only been using it for a few days and my nails seem to be less dry, hopefully with continued use my nails will get&lt;br /&gt;even better.</li>
            <li> Did not see any real results.</li>
            <li> love it...  this stuff really works!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this a few days for my thin nails and I love it. The smell is soothing and my nails look so much better than they did 3 days ago. Great product.</li>
            <li> MY NAILS AND CUTICLES ARE LOOKS GREAT! HIGHLY RECOMMENED FOR WOMEN,MEN AND TEENS THAT DESIRES BEAUTIFUL NAILS AND CUTICLES. SK OF PHL</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it makes my nails harder or yada yada.  But I do use it several times a week, and my cuticules look so much better, and my nails have a healthy pink glow.  :)  Satisfied.</li>
            <li> Very good but have not used it much. Would recommend it on a limited use by me! This is a good product.</li>
            <li> This cream is the perfect solution to , not only dry hands and cuticles, but scaly, cracked heels and feet as well.  You will not believe the difference.</li>
            <li> Less expensive than other cuticle creams, works just as well</li>
            <li> Nail regime completely changed after this product. My nails are no longer splitting or peeling. Great product and my cuticles are also much healthier.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product.  A little goes a long way.  I use it on my feet and fingernail and toenail cuticles.  I noticed an improvement after the first application.</li>
            <li> For anyone who has dry cuticles, this is the best thing since Vaseline (for anyone who can remember Vaseline).  Dancers use it; why shouldn&#x27;t the rest of us?</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I had hoped to find.  It is already taking care of the problem with my nails!</li>
            <li> This I purchased before the shield top coat. I like the smell and the texture and how it seems to help my nails. I will purchase again</li>
            <li> Really love this stuff. It&#x27;s made a noticeable difference in only a couple of nights it does leave a sticky residue but bot overly so. Definitely recommend this product.</li>
