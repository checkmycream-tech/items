            <li>This is the best CPAP mask I&#x27;ve used, bar none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perfect.  </li>
            <li>Very good quality and very good price.</li>
            <li>Great to know I can get this without inflated doctors office pricing.  </li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>the mask and strap fit perfect.</li>
            <li>It is a great fit!</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li>I get the idea that they might be consumable items but 8 months seems kind of soon.</li>
            <li>and the WISP is by far the best.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best cpap mask that I have used.</li>
            <li>good quality, reasonable price, and good service.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to write a review of this product, except I didn&#x27;t get it.  </li>
            <li>and i now sleep much better.</li>
            <li>I have tried many types of masks, cannulas, etc.</li>
            <li>If the straps were fitting fine</li>
            <li>The wisp mask design is excellent and more tolerable for sleeping than other models I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I like the fact that is light weight and packable.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t fathom a mask that could fit comfortably without leaking until I tried the wisp-</li>
            <li>The quality is like my original frame.</li>
            <li>I replaced the original frame in September of 14 and the replacement broke in May of 15.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, great experience.</li>
            <li>Came quickly, and the price couldn&#x27;t be beat from EVERYWHERE</li>
            <li>I had it on for the 4 hour a day requirement only before i ripped it off my face to get a better sleep.</li>
            <li>I wanted to be able to wear my glasses and read, not have anything hard over my nose, nothing touching my forehead.  </li>
            <li>Thanks....</li>
            <li>but the problem was really with their nose piece rather than the frame or head gear.  </li>
            <li>I think you will really like it.</li>
            <li>Also, it is SOOO much cheaper here than what I was paying through my sleep doc and clinic&#x27;s providers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It would be one thing if the frame cost a couple bucks to replace, but at $72, I might as well try out some other brands and designs to see if there is something better.</li>
            <li>highly recommend that NOBODY buy one of these unless you know for certain you can return it....</li>
            <li>I actually use it for the full 8 hours of sleep.</li>
            <li>They have been very responsive since I posted the review,  will update after I receive the new materials</li>
            <li>This is much better than nasal pillow masks and less restrictive to use.</li>
            <li>I tried more than a few masks with my bi-pap therapy.</li>
            <li>And, the area in contact with the nose and lip area is soft!</li>
            <li>The full face masks were all simply too big.</li>
            <li>It clearly says this is the frame WITHOUT the headgear</li>
            <li>My only &amp;#34;issue&amp;#34; is that I&#x27;ve been used to the silicone version and it was much smoother to clip in.</li>
            <li>and yet I received the exact opposite in the box which is obviously not the part I needed.</li>
            <li>is the one the woman at the store fit me with, because I have a small face/nose.  </li>
            <li>My face is relatively petite when measured, and I started loose and tightened gradually, I padded various parts of the headgear, made the rounds through chin straps, too, and I could not tolerate any mask, full face or nasal, until I tried the wisp.</li>
            <li>After I became rather agitated, the woman finally gave me a larger nose cup, but that one never did lay against my skin, no matter how much I tightened the headstrap, so the air was flying over my face, and up into my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I had a little difficulty with the first seller, but once in place, this headgear has no issues!  </li>
            <li>It actually works and fits as recommended- not tight.</li>

            <li> I paid $150.00 for it in a store (not on Amazon...big mistake), and from the first night, the very hard plastic piece that fits around the cheeks squeezed my face unbearably.  </li>
            <li> It was super uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> It squeezed my nostrils to where I couldn&#x27;t breathe, and my CPAP machine couldn&#x27;t pump air hard enough to force my nostrils open.  </li>
            <li> My insurance wouldn&#x27;t cover any other options, so I endured this for three years.  </li>
            <li> Finally, I could take no more, so stopped using the cpap.  </li>
            <li> No doubt the least expensive, and quality exactly the same as the supplier I&#x27;d used before.</li>
            <li> told her about the hard plastic nose cup holder, and the new nose cup, and how uncomfortable it was, and she said they couldn&#x27;t take it back because it had already been used!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Have gone thru 3 of these in less than a year.  </li>
            <li> If i put it tight, it would hurt my nose</li>
            <li> Why they would make that piece out of very hard plastic, I&#x27;ll never know.  </li>
            <li> In some ways I think they could improve the connection points where the headgear and frame come together but what they have isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> I hated it!  </li>
            <li> I tried to get accustomed to it, but after 30 plus days of awful sleep, i bought the resmed airfit p10 nose pillow</li>

    <ol>
            <li> The wisp mask design is excellent and more tolerable for sleeping than other models I&#x27;ve tried.  The big however here is that the frame is made of thin plastic covered by cheap foam under a glued fabric.  At 5 months of use, the plastic core broke causing the foam to delaminate and the outer fabric to separate.  I understand that some CPAP parts are supposed to be changed regularly, but the frame and head gear aren&#x27;t those parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be one thing if the frame cost a couple bucks to replace, but at $72, I might as well try out some other brands and designs to see if there is something better.</li>
            <li> good quality, reasonable price, and good service. the mask and strap fit perfect. [[ASIN:B007FV92QU PAP FLASK]]follow the link for other smart ideas for you equipment</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to write a review of this product, except I didn&#x27;t get it.  It clearly says this is the frame WITHOUT the headgear and yet I received the exact opposite in the box which is obviously not the part I needed. Thanks....</li>
            <li> Very good quality and very good price.</li>
            <li> I used the nasal pads before this?  They seemed to blow my nose up like a balloon, and lose the seal.  I hated it!  My insurance wouldn&#x27;t cover any other options, so I endured this for three years.  Finally, I could take no more, so stopped using the cpap.  After a month, with renewed issues from lack of quality sleep, migraines, I ordered this headgear option.  I wanted to be able to wear my glasses and read, not have anything hard over my nose, nothing touching my forehead.  I had a little difficulty with the first seller, but once in place, this headgear has no issues!  It keeps the seal all night, doesn&#x27;t inflate my nose like a balloon.  And, the area in contact with the nose and lip area is soft!</li>
            <li> I initially reviewed and gave this product a 2* but the problem was really with their nose piece rather than the frame or head gear.  For that reason I wanted to change my review in fairness to the company.  I still take some exception with their nose pieces, specifically their sizing but there you can read mine one others review on that elsewhere on amazon.  I like the fact that is light weight and packable.  In some ways I think they could improve the connection points where the headgear and frame come together but what they have isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> I never did sleep through one night with it.  I paid $150.00 for it in a store (not on Amazon...big mistake), and from the first night, the very hard plastic piece that fits around the cheeks squeezed my face unbearably.  Why they would make that piece out of very hard plastic, I&#x27;ll never know.  Something that fits across your face should be flexible.&lt;br /&gt;The smallest nose cup that came with it is the one the woman at the store fit me with, because I have a small face/nose.  It squeezed my nostrils to where I couldn&#x27;t breathe, and my CPAP machine couldn&#x27;t pump air hard enough to force my nostrils open.  So I went back to the store the next day, and they wouldn&#x27;t take it back.  After I became rather agitated, the woman finally gave me a larger nose cup, but that one never did lay against my skin, no matter how much I tightened the headstrap, so the air was flying over my face, and up into my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I told her about the hard plastic nose cup holder, and the new nose cup, and how uncomfortable it was, and she said they couldn&#x27;t take it back because it had already been used!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend that NOBODY buy one of these unless you know for certain you can return it....because you&#x27;ll likely want to do just that.</li>
            <li> My insurance company provided me with this. It was super uncomfortable.  I had it on for the 4 hour a day requirement only before i ripped it off my face to get a better sleep. It bothers me around my nose. If the straps were fitting fine the it would leak air everytime i move. If i put it tight, it would hurt my nose but it would not leak. I tried to get accustomed to it, but after 30 plus days of awful sleep, i bought the resmed airfit p10 nose pillow and i now sleep much better. I actually use it for the full 8 hours of sleep.</li>
            <li> This is much better than nasal pillow masks and less restrictive to use. I think you will really like it.</li>
            <li> I tried more than a few masks with my bi-pap therapy. The full face masks were all simply too big. My face is relatively petite when measured, and I started loose and tightened gradually, I padded various parts of the headgear, made the rounds through chin straps, too, and I could not tolerate any mask, full face or nasal, until I tried the wisp. It doesn&#x27;t smash my lip, doesn&#x27;t leak into my eyes, and doesn&#x27;t leave pressure sores on my nasal bridge. It actually works and fits as recommended- not tight. I couldn&#x27;t fathom a mask that could fit comfortably without leaking until I tried the wisp- and I am not about give it up. Also, it is SOOO much cheaper here than what I was paying through my sleep doc and clinic&#x27;s providers. From the mask &amp; chin strap to the filters and tubing. No doubt the least expensive, and quality exactly the same as the supplier I&#x27;d used before.</li>
            <li> The quality is like my original frame. In fact, same mode,l name and construction. I will reorder again in the future.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t come with a hose adapter piece, so it is unusable.  They have been very responsive since I posted the review,  will update after I receive the new materials</li>
            <li> I have tried many types of masks, cannulas, etc. and the WISP is by far the best. I don&#x27;t feel like I am being suffocated, and I have no leak problems.</li>
            <li> Great to know I can get this without inflated doctors office pricing.  Was actually cheaper than my co-pay!!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best cpap mask that I have used. It allows me to change positions at night with out the mask braking the seal and waking me up. It is a great fit!</li>
            <li> Been using the Wisp for over a year now, the frame broke and I ordered this one.  This is the best CPAP mask I&#x27;ve used, bar none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated.  I replaced the original frame in September of 14 and the replacement broke in May of 15.  I get the idea that they might be consumable items but 8 months seems kind of soon.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li> Came quickly, and the price couldn&#x27;t be beat from EVERYWHERE I looked. My only &amp;#34;issue&amp;#34; is that I&#x27;ve been used to the silicone version and it was much smoother to clip in. But, that&#x27;s a manufacturer&#x27;s problem rather than this seller&#x27;s. Other than that, great experience.</li>
            <li> It works great. Cheaper than othr places.</li>
            <li> Have gone thru 3 of these in less than a year.  The plastic breaks next to the nose piece every time.</li>
            <li> Perfect.  As advertised.</li>
