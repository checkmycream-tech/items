            <li>great for using with lotion to help soften the skin on the heels</li>
            <li>and they work great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great concept but they cut off the circulation to my feet when I sleep with them on</li>
            <li>The socks felt great when I had them on.  </li>
            <li>these are great...</li>

            <li>good value and service</li>
            <li>I just loved this product</li>
            <li>I suffer from eczema and it did a good job holding for keeping medicine and moisturizer on foot.</li>
            <li>These feel like there is nothing gel wise in the heels.</li>
            <li>Both my husband and I wore them and laughed afterwards as there is nothing in these socks to do anything for your heels.  </li>
            <li>I loved the way they felt on but didn&#x27;t like that the gel cam away from the sock itself and all balled up.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>so good alone or with lotion size</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>boo good idea</li>
            <li>Good buy for the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for slathering Vaseline on heels and putting on the heel socks.</li>
            <li>Fortunately I can sew, so I repaired the damage best</li>
            <li>These socks are good, does the job</li>
            <li>I loved it.</li>
            <li>feels good on the crack heels, and helps them heal with out having to wear socks.</li>
            <li>The best and thoughtful product I have ever</li>
            <li>I guess they are good for wearing to bed with our heels slathered with cream.</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>which is why I thought these would be a good choice.</li>

            <li>For the price, they are OK.</li>
            <li>Is okay</li>
            <li>I am unsure if I will reorder the gel socks since I also purchased an electric foot file that is making more of an improvement for my heels than the socks.</li>
            <li>The silicone ones are much better anyways</li>
            <li>Sure, they are not looking their best by now, but they definitely stay in one piece.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to wear my Gel Heel Socks yet because the gel part smells like pesticide.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to wear these.</li>

            <li>Love these gel socks.</li>
            <li>might have liked it if it fit.....</li>
            <li>These are like using a pair of socks with the appropriate parts trimmed off.</li>
            <li>I will NEVER be able to use them.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to review this product, but i can&#x27;t because I ordered the Gel Socks on 3/29</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I love these things.</li>
            <li>love them..</li>
            <li>Item arrived on time and was satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>and I Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be able to use them.</li>
            <li>Will order more</li>
            <li>At first it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li>GEL socks from first order were good product.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get these socks!  </li>
            <li>great to wear at night, toes open helps me to not overheat in the warm weather.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re okay - comfortable, however, not detecting the &#x27;gel&#x27; -</li>
            <li>Loved it so much I ordered two.</li>
            <li>The cuffs unravel easily</li>
            <li>and they can easily be washed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They slide on easily, and stay put.</li>
            <li>But these particular socks are not any good.</li>
            <li>They feel so cool and enjoyable on my feet.</li>
            <li>the other fit perfectly</li>
            <li>Comfortable and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I gave them to my daughter and she likes them fine.</li>
            <li>My Daughter seems to like them fine.</li>
            <li>They do work fine if you put on cream or lotion and wear them around or to bed.  </li>
            <li>The socks are comfortable and love the cool gel feeling.  </li>
            <li>size 8 and fit fine overnight.  </li>
            <li>and they fit me fine</li>
            <li>/&gt;Oh, and I am a woman&#x27;s size eight, medium width, and they fit perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>These little socks are awesome.  </li>
            <li>I do not have huge feet</li>
            <li>My mom has a huge crack in her heel, and she said that this helps take it away.</li>
            <li>It is cheaply manufactured.</li>
            <li>and they barely fit me.  </li>
            <li>This is the second pair I have purchased, great for keeping heels moist.  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;PediFix&amp;#34; pair is fantastic and has the gel in the heel area as promised.</li>
            <li>These seem cheaply made.</li>
            <li>One size doesn&#x27;t fit all.</li>
            <li>I am another who received a cheap pair of toeless socks without the &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Basically just cheap polyester socks with the ends cut off.</li>
            <li>I am not so sure these were worth the wait or the money.</li>
            <li>didnt like it, cheap, gimmick</li>
            <li>her feet looks great now that she uses this thanxx selker looking 4ward for future purchases</li>
            <li>Price is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Cheap</li>
            <li>There was no gel cushion in the heel at all, and the socklet was made of cheap poly material.</li>
            <li>Works great but hand wash only</li>
            <li>Cheap look and feel.</li>
            <li>the moisturize my whole foot if they&#x27;re supposed to just be a cover for your own moisturizermoisturizer.</li>
            <li>They fit well</li>
            <li>They feel like cheap compression socks.</li>
            <li>Comfortable while holding call us cream or softener to heels.</li>
            <li>This product is comfortable to wear and is moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>They fit snugly on my feet - an important aspect of socks like this.</li>
            <li>While they were cheap, they will not create the moisture needed to soften the heel.</li>
            <li>Makes heels of feet feel smooth when you wear them overnight...</li>
            <li>They are comfortable and work.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable, perfect fit for small feet.</li>
            <li>Great but a long time to get</li>
            <li>I am amazingly surprised and very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Makes heals better after the first day.  </li>
            <li>So, Mom doesn&#x27;t have to share, and she probably considers that worth 5 stars!</li>
            <li>Great for dry and cracked heels.</li>
            <li>They have worked great on my dry heel skin.</li>
            <li>love these, can be worn many times and makes my heels soft</li>
            <li>I put them on at night and my feet are super smooth in the am..</li>
            <li>I can easily slip them on when I am hanging out the house watching TV and right before I climb into bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t see anything special about it</li>
            <li>Do the trick with the right foot cream!</li>
            <li>great item, worked as expected.</li>
            <li>I had purchased another set of very similar-looking socks on Amazon a year ago for significantly more.  </li>
            <li>I was think nice soft gel</li>
            <li>Gel felt good, but think I will look for something locally.</li>
            <li>Makes your feet feel cool when you are wearing them.</li>
            <li>Some reviews said these were good for men to wear, but they are not unless you wear a size 8 or smaller.</li>
            <li>Cool and soothing.</li>
            <li>I finally got it on my foot, but cut off circulation.&lt;br /&gt;Not a good buy.</li>
            <li>I wish they made a full foot sock.  </li>
            <li>I COVERED MY HEEL IN A SWEET CREAM AND PUT THE SOCK OVER IT..</li>
            <li>stay nice and soft.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s cool.</li>
            <li>Took more than a month to arrive and doesnt do much for me.</li>
            <li>I can feel the band around my instep, but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>Feel good on your feet, but they are made for tiny feet, thus I can&#x27;t get the full benefits from them.  </li>
            <li>The fit is right, the color is nice, the texture is soft - but one of them unraveled in the wash.</li>
            <li>The socks felt comfortable, but began to unravel at the top after first gentle washing.</li>
            <li>, you only get so many uses out of them and will want more.</li>
            <li>By nights end, the Vaseline has completely absorbed and my heels are nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Interesting idea that would have worked if they actually fit an adult foot.  </li>
            <li>The odor is pleasant but very powerful, have to store under other clothing to mask the odor.</li>
            <li>It is pretty comfortable in the summer time</li>
            <li>Thank so very much! :</li>
            <li>and I use them after a long day and the gel feels good.</li>
            <li>As it is, if I notice some more unraveling, I will just put them in the trash, and knit myself a new pair.</li>
            <li>Work great but not sure if will fit after wash/dry.</li>
            <li>and frankly i am pretty pissed!</li>
            <li>so yea you could about imagine that i am pretty upset!</li>
            <li>These work great on my heels but the problem I have is that they are so tight they cut my circulation off</li>
            <li>Purchase another set from the drugstore which have lasted a month now, work great, and are a little thicker which also contributes to the durability.</li>
            <li>Great little heel socks.</li>
            <li>Socks fit VERY snug...</li>
            <li>They stayed on, was comfortable and it really works.</li>
            <li>They were finally starting to fall apart, so I thought I would see if these much cheaper alternatives were any good.  </li>
            <li>You are better off using a soft pair of socks.</li>
            <li>worth</li>
            <li>Your better off just getting some old torn up socks and trim them to your foot.</li>
            <li>The drugstore variety also came in different sizes, unlike these, so they are more comfortable.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t worth paying for.</li>
            <li>I read only the verified purchase reviews and liked what I read.  </li>
            <li>They honestly work cause her feet aren&#x27;t nearly as gross now as they were.</li>
            <li>socks from other vendors, and have nothing but good things to say...</li>
            <li>price ws right.</li>
            <li>but then just like any piece of clothing or something that you use for a while they have to be washed right?</li>
            <li>with right oinntment  andpersonal pedi mom&#x27;s circulation has already improved</li>
            <li>, hey, that&#x27;s a positive!</li>
            <li>The socks are great for the first few wearings, but soon after the that the gel pad starts to roll away from the fabric and curl.  </li>
            <li>These tiny gel heel socks are better than full size heel socks in that they don&#x27;t make your feet sweat.</li>
            <li>After a week I noticed my heels were super smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>i received these for my wife and they were very nice for the first few uses</li>
            <li>I have used them a few times, but the first night I used them I noticed a remarkable difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>SUPER FAST SHIPPING.</li>
            <li>I was able to file most of the dead skin away</li>
            <li>,that&#x27;s how much they are super.</li>
            <li>The sock fits very snuggly, it didn&#x27;t really stretch to fit.</li>
            <li>They are very nice to have if you&#x27;ve been working on your feet at home and there is no one to rub them for you but as far as doing anything for dry, cracked feet... nothing!</li>
            <li>They  are comfortable and very soft.</li>
            <li>Granted I was informed of the delay when I first ordered them but of everything I&#x27;ve ordered from Amazon, this is the first time I&#x27;ve really had to wait the full time.  </li>
            <li>Works good for cracked heels but they are a tight.</li>
            <li>Very reasonable through Amazon but take time to get from China.</li>
            <li>Good product, as a guy who wears a 10.5 shoe they are a little snug but still work.</li>
            <li>but they wore out very fast and the stitching came apart after about 2 wears.. would reorder but it took forever for them to come in the first time..</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised in the huge difference they made to my heels.</li>
            <li>The first time I put them on, they ripped.</li>
            <li>In the morning my heels are slippery soft and smooth-</li>
            <li>First sanding heels and putting ointment then using these my heels have smothed out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really irrated at these socks!</li>
            <li>First of all, the material is cheap, there&#x27;s no gel pad in the sock to help keep your foot soft, and they seem like they are made for kids</li>
            <li>These were toght and fell apart the first time they were used.</li>
            <li>Horrible....threw them away first day.</li>
            <li>Fell apart first time it was washed</li>
            <li>After a couple days, one edge started to flay, so I decided to order 2 more pairs as spares, which I didn&#x27;t start using till months later.  </li>
            <li>This is my first try at these socks.  </li>
            <li>I have not washed them yet, first time to put them on.  </li>
            <li>The first pair fell apart.</li>
            <li>They have made my heels into baby soft smooth skin.</li>
            <li>I just received two pair that I had ordered the first part of the month.  </li>
            <li>They came and looked exactly like the photo here, but there was no gel at all in the heels</li>
            <li>Probably OK for smaller feet.</li>
            <li>Socks raveled at the edges even before the first time they were washed.</li>
            <li>The first time I hand washed them they started unraveling.</li>
            <li>I will most likely throw them away.</li>
            <li>After first time (sleep in socks) gel dismounted from the material.</li>
            <li>I have really dry heels, these socks are great to keep my heels protected while still giving me the comfort of open toes</li>
            <li>It does not have plastic layer right on the heel to prevent the cream from absorbing by the socks</li>
            <li>I wear a women&#x27;s size 10.5 shoe, have somewhat wide feet and the socks I received fit fine.</li>
            <li>Nice comfy  and due June 5 got may 10 order may 1</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find that they really moisture my feet any more than wearing regular socks, but it let my toes breathe</li>
            <li>they pretty much hurt my feet</li>
            <li>the 1st order was from &amp;#34;blue lake&amp;#34; and the 2nd order was from &amp;#34;fashion-store.&amp;#34;  &amp;#34;Fashion-store&amp;#34;, apparently, needs to practice better quality control!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty much destroyed my feet.</li>
            <li>These are very very cozy, my heels have never felt so good.</li>
            <li>Feels very good on the feet, but I would not recommended for diabetics because they fit tight (unless you have very skinny, small feet).  </li>
            <li>I order the large, but my blood in my foot got cut off and caused severe pain and caused pins and needles. .</li>
            <li>Do not have large feet</li>
            <li>If you have large ankles they are not for you.  </li>
            <li>The only positive is that it did fit my feet</li>
            <li>They are OK..works a little to make smoother but not enough for it to feel great.</li>
            <li>I put another sock over to protect the rest of the foot as I wake up in the morning and my whole foot is soft, worth the price, But I would not call it a Gel Booty, as there is no Gel in it.</li>
            <li>really helps relieve dryness and aches.</li>
            <li>(I have walked around a bit in them and they are very squishy and make you feel like you might fall).</li>
            <li>(haha).</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t notice the gel in the socks</li>
            <li>I have bought real &amp;#34;GEL&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I just wish you offered a whole sock.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much&lt;</li>
            <li>Much to my delight,they really make a difference in protecting my heel and relieving some pain.</li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>Christmas gift for my mother was greatly appreciated n</li>
            <li>My wife said she really likes them and they do relieve her heels</li>
            <li>Not getting very again.</li>
            <li>These are too tiny to fit my size 8 1/2 foot into.</li>
            <li>but these are a real pain to get on.</li>
            <li>Cannot tell if the &#x27;gel solution&#x27; is really there when wearing them.  </li>
            <li>Like it and use it very often.</li>
            <li>I have used gel heels before and they really do work</li>
            <li>My parents lived them thanks so much</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t do much by themselves.</li>
            <li>Everyone wants  them, gave them the info.</li>
            <li>I very foolishly ordered them again..</li>
            <li>I use this along with my Amope and moisturizing cream to keep my feet ready for my scandals.</li>
            <li>These really work.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really get what these things are supposed to do yet</li>
            <li>really recommended</li>
            <li>Product description is very deceiving as if your buying real GEL SOCKS.</li>
            <li>I have very skinny, bony feet (size 6 Womens)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried absolutely everything to no avail.</li>
            <li>These really do work well.  </li>
            <li>have purchased before really helps</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>and my heels come out much smoother.</li>
            <li>I need some for toes also, or whole feet.</li>
            <li>it did work very well....</li>
            <li>I have a size 9, wide foot and had no issues with these socks fitting.</li>
            <li>Yes they are cheap but might as well spend the extra $10 and get what you&#x27;re promised.</li>
            <li>As described fast shipping</li>
            <li>I thought the whole sock would be gel</li>
            <li>I wore them all day around the house the the rubber inside really started to peel.</li>
            <li>These really do help, even without creams/lotions.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t think they are doing anything to me, I wasted my money on this.</li>
            <li>Returning them is more trouble then they are worth.</li>
            <li>I now use an old sock, it does a much better job and covers the entire foot.</li>
            <li>Extremely slow to ship, good product,if you don&#x27;t mind waiting 2 months to use it.</li>
            <li>Other than that - my heels are looking fine baby!</li>
            <li>They work well but one of my pairs unraveled in he wash and caused a huge mess for me to clean up but Amazon customer service handled it well.</li>
            <li>Love these hard to wash though the gel sticks to each other but good for your heals</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure these are imitation and not the real Gel Socks.  </li>
            <li>Simply wearing these to bed have significantly softened my heels.  </li>
            <li>Now tell me, what is the point of these socks if there is no gel in the heels?&lt;br /&gt;There are other makers of these socks that are a buck or two more....</li>
            <li>SO FAR IT HAS HELP EVEN AFTER THE FIRST TREATMENT.</li>
            <li>These worked great for helping heal my cracked soles, but the stiching came loose after a few wears.</li>
            <li>Makes me wonder if they were actually new?!</li>
            <li>They are comfortable, so one can slather up the dry, cracked skin these supposedly help heal, but basically you are just wearing a sock over whatever foot cream you prefer.</li>
            <li>The blue and white is a cute color combo, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>but thats what you&#x27;d want for these particular socks</li>
            <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t waste much money on them</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re better off paying for the more expensive ones...</li>
            <li>too tight at top of sock, causes ankles to swell.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>you get what you pay for now nothing special and they take a long time to arrive</li>
            <li>really helped cure my first and only</li>
            <li>but they look and feel like normal socks going to give them to my mom</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d return them but why waste any more money?  </li>
            <li>because I thought they were only worth what I paid for them</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even worn them under my normal socks during the day.</li>
            <li>For the price, we didn&#x27;t think it was worth it to send them back, especially since she found them useful anyway.  </li>
            <li>I wear them to bed and by the next morning my dry heels are much better.  </li>
            <li>Will probably keep buying new as needed.</li>
            <li>Very right on wide feet.</li>
            <li>Very cool little sock.</li>
            <li>Does not make foot softer and is a better fit for size 8 or less if you want to waste your money and wait for it to arrive</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know I was supposed to be able to feel the gel until I got the pink ones a couple of days later.  </li>
            <li>The first is that the gel heel has been pulling away from the sock since the first time I put them on, and I put them on carefully to avoid this.</li>
            <li>I ordered 4 pair because everyone&#x27;s ratings were so high and they have no aloe or gel or anything soft</li>
            <li>However, if you get a more expensive brand, you will find that there is a significant difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased socks like this several times and this is the first time that I&#x27;ve encountered anything like this.</li>
            <li>There is no gel in the socks as other reviews mentioned and they actually made my heels more scratchy after using them.</li>
            <li>The white trim, however, began to unravel after first wash.  </li>
            <li>first of all do not know where the GEL is and second</li>
            <li>It should NOT have unraveled, especially after the first wash.</li>
            <li>Wow, put lotion on...put socks on and be amazed!</li>
            <li>I ordered 2 pair but only received 1 pair and they ripped the first time my daughter wore them.</li>
            <li>I could actually tell a difference after the first overnight wear.</li>
            <li>but this was a lesson to pay attention to the seller because clearly the quality of the product you get depends on the seller (even though it appears to be the exact same product).</li>
            <li>The gel inside got very sticky and liquidy after wearing for a night but went back to a normal consistency when cooled.  </li>
            <li>These work well to keep dry and cracked heels comfortable and moisturized not only in the daytime but also at night.</li>
            <li>I have purchased similar in the last and these are not even worthy of being called knockoffs.</li>
            <li>They came in a clear plastic bag with no writing or anything.  </li>
            <li>After a few days my heels were soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>There were no instructions, no packaging information, just clear plastic bags.  </li>
            <li>This came in a clear &amp;#34;baggie&amp;#34; - the picture you see on the product description was not at all the packaging I received.  </li>
            <li>One was clearly for a child</li>
            <li>This product offers NOTHING.</li>
            <li>I am sure they would survive a hand wash at least.</li>
            <li>The photo shows what is presumably an adult wearing the gel heel socks.</li>
            <li>The socks unraveled completely after one wash.</li>
            <li>Three nights of use and heels all soft.  </li>
            <li>and they feel much softer after only a couple of nights wearing them while she sleeps.</li>
            <li>It had long tear lines the first night I put it on.</li>
            <li>These took nearly 2.5 weeks to come from China and had NO gel in the heels.</li>
            <li>or so it healed completely.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.  </li>
            <li>MY HEEL FELT SOFT AND WITHOUT PAIN.</li>
            <li>Just take an old pair of socks &amp; cut the toe portion off.</li>
            <li>Since the picture looked just like my old ones, and they said gel</li>
            <li>the Sox suck they are nothing like I thought they would be really want my money back.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an adult these gel heel socks was for a child</li>
            <li>use these frequently to keep feet from &amp;#34;getting ugly&amp;#34;between pedicures.&lt;br /&gt;Feet</li>
            <li>My feet feel soft again.</li>
            <li>These do zero moisturizing - they&#x27;re just soft.</li>
            <li>cost too much to ship back!</li>
            <li>use these last night with my cream and they really softened my heels....</li>
            <li>Do not waste your time or your money.</li>
            <li>I mean, sure you can...</li>
            <li>have Bought several Pair for Holiday Stocking Stuffers if They had passed The Muster!&lt;br /&gt;Maybe better Luck for Ladies with Small Feet and Ankles.</li>
            <li>spend the extra money, because when you get a pair that actually have the gel, they work pretty well.</li>
            <li>Nice, but a tight fit and I have thin feet!</li>
            <li>the next morning it&#x27;s like you shed the old and have new skin.</li>
            <li>And they&#x27;re super tight.</li>
            <li>These came quickly but were just too tight for my swelling feet.</li>
            <li>Unless you have a small foot, they won&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>These items were really too small for me, but I stretched them to make them fit my oversized feet.  </li>
            <li>I did buy some from another company on Amazon (pink ones) and they were exactly what was in the description...</li>
            <li>The same product fulfilled by another firm was fine.</li>
            <li>fit just a little snug for people with big arches</li>
            <li>The gel area is larger than other socks like this I have had, they seem of good quality, thick.  </li>
            <li>The heel part inside of the sock is a ice cool stiff jelly lining.</li>
            <li>Within a few days the dry scratchy part of my heels weren&#x27;t dry and scratchy anymore, and it feels amazing.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much for my dry, cracked heels.  </li>
            <li>Have really helped keep the lotion on the feet to treat dry skin.</li>
            <li>It really helped my dry feet</li>
            <li>These would only fit a child or extremely small adult.  </li>
            <li>The heal socks have really worked on my dry heel skin!</li>
            <li>I have full gel socks that have gotten a little gross</li>
            <li>It was clear what was to come next and what was going on here.</li>
            <li>Feels weird at first, got to get use to the feeling when walking but when just resting or sleeping, it&#x27;s feels really comfortable</li>
            <li>third reason for the rating is that my socks arrived in just a clear plastic bag without any type of care or laundering instructions.</li>
            <li>Shipping took awhile as they apparently ship from China.</li>
            <li>I have a medium-sized foot--7.5 medium and I could barely get them on.</li>
            <li>As time went on and several uses the socks were not helping the healing nor making his feet soft.  </li>
            <li>Could barely get my toes in.</li>
            <li>I used similar to these gel socks before,make heels soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom, not kidding,it&#x27;s a fact,bought 3pairs</li>
            <li>It wouldn&#x27;t even be worth the trouble to return them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it is a good product, but the inconsistency between sellers is disappointing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So if you need them fast for those gross brittle dry heels</li>
            <li>These socks simply *look* like the other real products out there, but are complete knock offs.</li>
            <li>The description is intentionally misleading and the picture looks exactly like other socks that actually have gel inside.</li>
            <li>Runs super small, could not put on with arthritic hands.</li>
            <li>They work OK for my size 9.5M feet, but if you wear bigger than about a 10, they will be very hard to get on.  </li>
            <li>One other thing, they were not sewn together very well.  </li>
            <li>I had another similar pair, clearly these aren&#x27;t the same.</li>
            <li>GEL socks received in 2nd order were nothing more than a &amp;#34;much smaller&amp;#34; poor quality cloth sock...</li>
            <li>Luckily, Mom has tiny feet, so it works, but my big ol&#x27; clod-hopper feet would never fit in there.</li>
            <li>I first applied heel ointment then wore the socks around the house for a few hours.</li>
            <li>, the Gel lining is just a small spot on heal and it is rubbing off, fresh out of the package .</li>
            <li>It was a disappointment, but my mom still liked that they were pretty tight and helped with her arthritis pain.  </li>
            <li>I wore them for over a day and a half straight.</li>
            <li>As far as helping with my dry skin, they have not helped.  </li>
            <li>, my heels felt great in the morning, however the next night when i tried to put them on the white edges started unraveling :(</li>
            <li>It is also very tight...too tight to sleep with them on.</li>
            <li>they are very restrictive to the ankles to tight.</li>
            <li>It looks good but too tight and uncomfortable.</li>

            <li> and they work great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great concept but they cut off the circulation to my feet when I sleep with them on</li>

            <li> I just loved this product</li>

            <li> These feel like there is nothing gel wise in the heels.</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I wore them and laughed afterwards as there is nothing in these socks to do anything for your heels.  </li>
            <li> I loved the way they felt on but didn&#x27;t like that the gel cam away from the sock itself and all balled up.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> so good alone or with lotion size</li>

            <li> Good buy for the price.</li>

            <li> These socks are good, does the job</li>
            <li> I loved it.</li>

            <li> The best and thoughtful product I have ever</li>
            <li> I guess they are good for wearing to bed with our heels slathered with cream.</li>
            <li> Good quality.</li>
            <li> which is why I thought these would be a good choice.</li>

            <li> For the price, they are OK.</li>
            <li> Is okay</li>
            <li> I am unsure if I will reorder the gel socks since I also purchased an electric foot file that is making more of an improvement for my heels than the socks.</li>
            <li> The silicone ones are much better anyways</li>
            <li> Sure, they are not looking their best by now, but they definitely stay in one piece.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to wear my Gel Heel Socks yet because the gel part smells like pesticide.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to wear these.</li>

            <li> I was expecting a much better quality product.</li>
            <li> Love these gel socks.</li>
            <li> might have liked it if it fit.....</li>
            <li> These are like using a pair of socks with the appropriate parts trimmed off.</li>
            <li> I will NEVER be able to use them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to review this product, but i can&#x27;t because I ordered the Gel Socks on 3/29</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I love these things.</li>
            <li> love them..</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and was satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> and I Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be able to use them.</li>
            <li> Will order more</li>
            <li> At first it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> GEL socks from first order were good product.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get these socks!  </li>
            <li> great to wear at night, toes open helps me to not overheat in the warm weather.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re okay - comfortable, however, not detecting the &#x27;gel&#x27; -</li>
            <li> Loved it so much I ordered two.</li>
            <li> The cuffs unravel easily</li>
            <li> and they can easily be washed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They slide on easily, and stay put.</li>
            <li> But these particular socks are not any good.</li>
            <li> They feel so cool and enjoyable on my feet.</li>
            <li> the other fit perfectly</li>
            <li> Comfortable and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I gave them to my daughter and she likes them fine.</li>
            <li> My Daughter seems to like them fine.</li>
            <li> They do work fine if you put on cream or lotion and wear them around or to bed.  </li>
            <li> The socks are comfortable and love the cool gel feeling.  </li>
            <li> size 8 and fit fine overnight.  </li>
            <li> and they fit me fine</li>
            <li> /&gt;Oh, and I am a woman&#x27;s size eight, medium width, and they fit perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> These little socks are awesome.  </li>
            <li> I do not have huge feet</li>
            <li> My mom has a huge crack in her heel, and she said that this helps take it away.</li>
            <li> It is cheaply manufactured.</li>
            <li> and they barely fit me.  </li>
            <li> This is the second pair I have purchased, great for keeping heels moist.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;PediFix&amp;#34; pair is fantastic and has the gel in the heel area as promised.</li>
            <li> These seem cheaply made.</li>
            <li> One size doesn&#x27;t fit all.</li>
            <li> I am another who received a cheap pair of toeless socks without the &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Basically just cheap polyester socks with the ends cut off.</li>
            <li> I am not so sure these were worth the wait or the money.</li>
            <li> didnt like it, cheap, gimmick</li>
            <li> her feet looks great now that she uses this thanxx selker looking 4ward for future purchases</li>
            <li> Price is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Cheap</li>
            <li> There was no gel cushion in the heel at all, and the socklet was made of cheap poly material.</li>
            <li> Works great but hand wash only</li>
            <li> Cheap look and feel.</li>
            <li> the moisturize my whole foot if they&#x27;re supposed to just be a cover for your own moisturizermoisturizer.</li>
            <li> They fit well</li>
            <li> They feel like cheap compression socks.</li>
            <li> Comfortable while holding call us cream or softener to heels.</li>
            <li> This product is comfortable to wear and is moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> They fit snugly on my feet - an important aspect of socks like this.</li>
            <li> While they were cheap, they will not create the moisture needed to soften the heel.</li>
            <li> Makes heels of feet feel smooth when you wear them overnight...</li>
            <li> They are comfortable and work.  </li>
            <li> Comfortable, perfect fit for small feet.</li>
            <li> Great but a long time to get</li>
            <li> I am amazingly surprised and very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Makes heals better after the first day.  </li>
            <li> So, Mom doesn&#x27;t have to share, and she probably considers that worth 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Great for dry and cracked heels.</li>
            <li> They have worked great on my dry heel skin.</li>
            <li> love these, can be worn many times and makes my heels soft</li>
            <li> I put them on at night and my feet are super smooth in the am..</li>
            <li> I can easily slip them on when I am hanging out the house watching TV and right before I climb into bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t see anything special about it</li>
            <li> Do the trick with the right foot cream!</li>
            <li> great item, worked as expected.</li>
            <li> I had purchased another set of very similar-looking socks on Amazon a year ago for significantly more.  </li>
            <li> I was think nice soft gel</li>
            <li> Gel felt good, but think I will look for something locally.</li>
            <li> Makes your feet feel cool when you are wearing them.</li>
            <li> Some reviews said these were good for men to wear, but they are not unless you wear a size 8 or smaller.</li>
            <li> Cool and soothing.</li>
            <li> I finally got it on my foot, but cut off circulation.&lt;br /&gt;Not a good buy.</li>
            <li> I wish they made a full foot sock.  </li>
            <li> I COVERED MY HEEL IN A SWEET CREAM AND PUT THE SOCK OVER IT..</li>
            <li> stay nice and soft.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s cool.</li>
            <li> Took more than a month to arrive and doesnt do much for me.</li>
            <li> I can feel the band around my instep, but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> Feel good on your feet, but they are made for tiny feet, thus I can&#x27;t get the full benefits from them.  </li>
            <li> The fit is right, the color is nice, the texture is soft - but one of them unraveled in the wash.</li>
            <li> The socks felt comfortable, but began to unravel at the top after first gentle washing.</li>
            <li> , you only get so many uses out of them and will want more.</li>
            <li> By nights end, the Vaseline has completely absorbed and my heels are nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Interesting idea that would have worked if they actually fit an adult foot.  </li>
            <li> The odor is pleasant but very powerful, have to store under other clothing to mask the odor.</li>
            <li> It is pretty comfortable in the summer time</li>
            <li> Thank so very much! :</li>
            <li> and I use them after a long day and the gel feels good.</li>
            <li> As it is, if I notice some more unraveling, I will just put them in the trash, and knit myself a new pair.</li>
            <li> Work great but not sure if will fit after wash/dry.</li>
            <li> and frankly i am pretty pissed!</li>
            <li> so yea you could about imagine that i am pretty upset!</li>
            <li> These work great on my heels but the problem I have is that they are so tight they cut my circulation off</li>
            <li> Purchase another set from the drugstore which have lasted a month now, work great, and are a little thicker which also contributes to the durability.</li>
            <li> Great little heel socks.</li>
            <li> Socks fit VERY snug...</li>
            <li> They stayed on, was comfortable and it really works.</li>
            <li> They were finally starting to fall apart, so I thought I would see if these much cheaper alternatives were any good.  </li>
            <li> You are better off using a soft pair of socks.</li>
            <li> worth</li>
            <li> Your better off just getting some old torn up socks and trim them to your foot.</li>
            <li> The drugstore variety also came in different sizes, unlike these, so they are more comfortable.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t worth paying for.</li>
            <li> I read only the verified purchase reviews and liked what I read.  </li>
            <li> They honestly work cause her feet aren&#x27;t nearly as gross now as they were.</li>
            <li> socks from other vendors, and have nothing but good things to say...</li>
            <li> price ws right.</li>
            <li> but then just like any piece of clothing or something that you use for a while they have to be washed right?</li>
            <li> with right oinntment  andpersonal pedi mom&#x27;s circulation has already improved</li>
            <li> , hey, that&#x27;s a positive!</li>
            <li> The socks are great for the first few wearings, but soon after the that the gel pad starts to roll away from the fabric and curl.  </li>
            <li> These tiny gel heel socks are better than full size heel socks in that they don&#x27;t make your feet sweat.</li>
            <li> After a week I noticed my heels were super smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> i received these for my wife and they were very nice for the first few uses</li>
            <li> I have used them a few times, but the first night I used them I noticed a remarkable difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> SUPER FAST SHIPPING.</li>
            <li> I was able to file most of the dead skin away</li>
            <li> ,that&#x27;s how much they are super.</li>
            <li> The sock fits very snuggly, it didn&#x27;t really stretch to fit.</li>
            <li> They are very nice to have if you&#x27;ve been working on your feet at home and there is no one to rub them for you but as far as doing anything for dry, cracked feet... nothing!</li>
            <li> They  are comfortable and very soft.</li>
            <li> Granted I was informed of the delay when I first ordered them but of everything I&#x27;ve ordered from Amazon, this is the first time I&#x27;ve really had to wait the full time.  </li>
            <li> Works good for cracked heels but they are a tight.</li>
            <li> Very reasonable through Amazon but take time to get from China.</li>
            <li> Good product, as a guy who wears a 10.5 shoe they are a little snug but still work.</li>
            <li> but they wore out very fast and the stitching came apart after about 2 wears.. would reorder but it took forever for them to come in the first time..</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised in the huge difference they made to my heels.</li>
            <li> The first time I put them on, they ripped.</li>
            <li> In the morning my heels are slippery soft and smooth-</li>
            <li> First sanding heels and putting ointment then using these my heels have smothed out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really irrated at these socks!</li>
            <li> First of all, the material is cheap, there&#x27;s no gel pad in the sock to help keep your foot soft, and they seem like they are made for kids</li>
            <li> These were toght and fell apart the first time they were used.</li>
            <li> Horrible....threw them away first day.</li>
            <li> Fell apart first time it was washed</li>
            <li> After a couple days, one edge started to flay, so I decided to order 2 more pairs as spares, which I didn&#x27;t start using till months later.  </li>
            <li> This is my first try at these socks.  </li>
            <li> I have not washed them yet, first time to put them on.  </li>
            <li> The first pair fell apart.</li>
            <li> They have made my heels into baby soft smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I just received two pair that I had ordered the first part of the month.  </li>
            <li> They came and looked exactly like the photo here, but there was no gel at all in the heels</li>
            <li> Probably OK for smaller feet.</li>
            <li> Socks raveled at the edges even before the first time they were washed.</li>
            <li> The first time I hand washed them they started unraveling.</li>
            <li> I will most likely throw them away.</li>
            <li> After first time (sleep in socks) gel dismounted from the material.</li>
            <li> I have really dry heels, these socks are great to keep my heels protected while still giving me the comfort of open toes</li>
            <li> It does not have plastic layer right on the heel to prevent the cream from absorbing by the socks</li>
            <li> I wear a women&#x27;s size 10.5 shoe, have somewhat wide feet and the socks I received fit fine.</li>
            <li> Nice comfy  and due June 5 got may 10 order may 1</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find that they really moisture my feet any more than wearing regular socks, but it let my toes breathe</li>
            <li> they pretty much hurt my feet</li>
            <li> the 1st order was from &amp;#34;blue lake&amp;#34; and the 2nd order was from &amp;#34;fashion-store.&amp;#34;  &amp;#34;Fashion-store&amp;#34;, apparently, needs to practice better quality control!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty much destroyed my feet.</li>
            <li> These are very very cozy, my heels have never felt so good.</li>
            <li> Feels very good on the feet, but I would not recommended for diabetics because they fit tight (unless you have very skinny, small feet).  </li>
            <li> I order the large, but my blood in my foot got cut off and caused severe pain and caused pins and needles. .</li>
            <li> Do not have large feet</li>
            <li> If you have large ankles they are not for you.  </li>
            <li> The only positive is that it did fit my feet</li>
            <li> They are OK..works a little to make smoother but not enough for it to feel great.</li>
            <li> I put another sock over to protect the rest of the foot as I wake up in the morning and my whole foot is soft, worth the price, But I would not call it a Gel Booty, as there is no Gel in it.</li>
            <li> really helps relieve dryness and aches.</li>
            <li> (I have walked around a bit in them and they are very squishy and make you feel like you might fall).</li>
            <li> (haha).</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice the gel in the socks</li>
            <li> I have bought real &amp;#34;GEL&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I just wish you offered a whole sock.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much&lt;</li>
            <li> Much to my delight,they really make a difference in protecting my heel and relieving some pain.</li>
            <li> Very well made.</li>
            <li> Christmas gift for my mother was greatly appreciated n</li>
            <li> My wife said she really likes them and they do relieve her heels</li>
            <li> Not getting very again.</li>
            <li> These are too tiny to fit my size 8 1/2 foot into.</li>
            <li> but these are a real pain to get on.</li>
            <li> Cannot tell if the &#x27;gel solution&#x27; is really there when wearing them.  </li>
            <li> Like it and use it very often.</li>
            <li> I have used gel heels before and they really do work</li>
            <li> My parents lived them thanks so much</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t do much by themselves.</li>
            <li> Everyone wants  them, gave them the info.</li>
            <li> I very foolishly ordered them again..</li>
            <li> I use this along with my Amope and moisturizing cream to keep my feet ready for my scandals.</li>
            <li> These really work.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really get what these things are supposed to do yet</li>
            <li> really recommended</li>
            <li> Product description is very deceiving as if your buying real GEL SOCKS.</li>
            <li> I have very skinny, bony feet (size 6 Womens)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried absolutely everything to no avail.</li>
            <li> These really do work well.  </li>
            <li> have purchased before really helps</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> and my heels come out much smoother.</li>
            <li> I need some for toes also, or whole feet.</li>
            <li> it did work very well....</li>
            <li> I have a size 9, wide foot and had no issues with these socks fitting.</li>
            <li> Yes they are cheap but might as well spend the extra $10 and get what you&#x27;re promised.</li>
            <li> As described fast shipping</li>
            <li> I thought the whole sock would be gel</li>
            <li> I wore them all day around the house the the rubber inside really started to peel.</li>
            <li> These really do help, even without creams/lotions.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t think they are doing anything to me, I wasted my money on this.</li>
            <li> Returning them is more trouble then they are worth.</li>
            <li> I now use an old sock, it does a much better job and covers the entire foot.</li>
            <li> Extremely slow to ship, good product,if you don&#x27;t mind waiting 2 months to use it.</li>
            <li> Other than that - my heels are looking fine baby!</li>
            <li> They work well but one of my pairs unraveled in he wash and caused a huge mess for me to clean up but Amazon customer service handled it well.</li>
            <li> Love these hard to wash though the gel sticks to each other but good for your heals</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure these are imitation and not the real Gel Socks.  </li>
            <li> Simply wearing these to bed have significantly softened my heels.  </li>
            <li> Now tell me, what is the point of these socks if there is no gel in the heels?&lt;br /&gt;There are other makers of these socks that are a buck or two more....</li>
            <li> SO FAR IT HAS HELP EVEN AFTER THE FIRST TREATMENT.</li>
            <li> These worked great for helping heal my cracked soles, but the stiching came loose after a few wears.</li>
            <li> Makes me wonder if they were actually new?!</li>
            <li> They are comfortable, so one can slather up the dry, cracked skin these supposedly help heal, but basically you are just wearing a sock over whatever foot cream you prefer.</li>
            <li> The blue and white is a cute color combo, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> but thats what you&#x27;d want for these particular socks</li>
            <li> Glad I didn&#x27;t waste much money on them</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re better off paying for the more expensive ones...</li>
            <li> too tight at top of sock, causes ankles to swell.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> you get what you pay for now nothing special and they take a long time to arrive</li>
            <li> really helped cure my first and only</li>
            <li> but they look and feel like normal socks going to give them to my mom</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d return them but why waste any more money?  </li>
            <li> because I thought they were only worth what I paid for them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even worn them under my normal socks during the day.</li>
            <li> For the price, we didn&#x27;t think it was worth it to send them back, especially since she found them useful anyway.  </li>
            <li> I wear them to bed and by the next morning my dry heels are much better.  </li>
            <li> Will probably keep buying new as needed.</li>
            <li> Very right on wide feet.</li>
            <li> Very cool little sock.</li>
            <li> Does not make foot softer and is a better fit for size 8 or less if you want to waste your money and wait for it to arrive</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know I was supposed to be able to feel the gel until I got the pink ones a couple of days later.  </li>
            <li> The first is that the gel heel has been pulling away from the sock since the first time I put them on, and I put them on carefully to avoid this.</li>
            <li> I ordered 4 pair because everyone&#x27;s ratings were so high and they have no aloe or gel or anything soft</li>
            <li> However, if you get a more expensive brand, you will find that there is a significant difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased socks like this several times and this is the first time that I&#x27;ve encountered anything like this.</li>
            <li> There is no gel in the socks as other reviews mentioned and they actually made my heels more scratchy after using them.</li>
            <li> The white trim, however, began to unravel after first wash.  </li>
            <li> first of all do not know where the GEL is and second</li>
            <li> It should NOT have unraveled, especially after the first wash.</li>
            <li> Wow, put lotion on...put socks on and be amazed!</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 pair but only received 1 pair and they ripped the first time my daughter wore them.</li>
            <li> I could actually tell a difference after the first overnight wear.</li>
            <li> but this was a lesson to pay attention to the seller because clearly the quality of the product you get depends on the seller (even though it appears to be the exact same product).</li>
            <li> The gel inside got very sticky and liquidy after wearing for a night but went back to a normal consistency when cooled.  </li>
            <li> These work well to keep dry and cracked heels comfortable and moisturized not only in the daytime but also at night.</li>
            <li> I have purchased similar in the last and these are not even worthy of being called knockoffs.</li>
            <li> They came in a clear plastic bag with no writing or anything.  </li>
            <li> After a few days my heels were soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> There were no instructions, no packaging information, just clear plastic bags.  </li>
            <li> This came in a clear &amp;#34;baggie&amp;#34; - the picture you see on the product description was not at all the packaging I received.  </li>
            <li> One was clearly for a child</li>
            <li> This product offers NOTHING.</li>
            <li> I am sure they would survive a hand wash at least.</li>
            <li> The photo shows what is presumably an adult wearing the gel heel socks.</li>
            <li> The socks unraveled completely after one wash.</li>
            <li> Three nights of use and heels all soft.  </li>
            <li> and they feel much softer after only a couple of nights wearing them while she sleeps.</li>
            <li> It had long tear lines the first night I put it on.</li>
            <li> These took nearly 2.5 weeks to come from China and had NO gel in the heels.</li>
            <li> or so it healed completely.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.  </li>
            <li> MY HEEL FELT SOFT AND WITHOUT PAIN.</li>
            <li> Just take an old pair of socks &amp; cut the toe portion off.</li>
            <li> Since the picture looked just like my old ones, and they said gel</li>
            <li> the Sox suck they are nothing like I thought they would be really want my money back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an adult these gel heel socks was for a child</li>
            <li> use these frequently to keep feet from &amp;#34;getting ugly&amp;#34;between pedicures.&lt;br /&gt;Feet</li>
            <li> My feet feel soft again.</li>
            <li> These do zero moisturizing - they&#x27;re just soft.</li>
            <li> cost too much to ship back!</li>
            <li> use these last night with my cream and they really softened my heels....</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time or your money.</li>
            <li> I mean, sure you can...</li>
            <li> have Bought several Pair for Holiday Stocking Stuffers if They had passed The Muster!&lt;br /&gt;Maybe better Luck for Ladies with Small Feet and Ankles.</li>
            <li> spend the extra money, because when you get a pair that actually have the gel, they work pretty well.</li>
            <li> Nice, but a tight fit and I have thin feet!</li>
            <li> the next morning it&#x27;s like you shed the old and have new skin.</li>
            <li> And they&#x27;re super tight.</li>
            <li> These came quickly but were just too tight for my swelling feet.</li>
            <li> Unless you have a small foot, they won&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> These items were really too small for me, but I stretched them to make them fit my oversized feet.  </li>
            <li> I did buy some from another company on Amazon (pink ones) and they were exactly what was in the description...</li>
            <li> The same product fulfilled by another firm was fine.</li>
            <li> fit just a little snug for people with big arches</li>
            <li> The gel area is larger than other socks like this I have had, they seem of good quality, thick.  </li>
            <li> The heel part inside of the sock is a ice cool stiff jelly lining.</li>
            <li> Within a few days the dry scratchy part of my heels weren&#x27;t dry and scratchy anymore, and it feels amazing.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for my dry, cracked heels.  </li>
            <li> Have really helped keep the lotion on the feet to treat dry skin.</li>
            <li> It really helped my dry feet</li>
            <li> These would only fit a child or extremely small adult.  </li>
            <li> The heal socks have really worked on my dry heel skin!</li>
            <li> I have full gel socks that have gotten a little gross</li>
            <li> It was clear what was to come next and what was going on here.</li>
            <li> Feels weird at first, got to get use to the feeling when walking but when just resting or sleeping, it&#x27;s feels really comfortable</li>
            <li> third reason for the rating is that my socks arrived in just a clear plastic bag without any type of care or laundering instructions.</li>
            <li> Shipping took awhile as they apparently ship from China.</li>
            <li> I have a medium-sized foot--7.5 medium and I could barely get them on.</li>
            <li> As time went on and several uses the socks were not helping the healing nor making his feet soft.  </li>
            <li> Could barely get my toes in.</li>
            <li> I used similar to these gel socks before,make heels soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom, not kidding,it&#x27;s a fact,bought 3pairs</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t even be worth the trouble to return them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it is a good product, but the inconsistency between sellers is disappointing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So if you need them fast for those gross brittle dry heels</li>
            <li> These socks simply *look* like the other real products out there, but are complete knock offs.</li>
            <li> The description is intentionally misleading and the picture looks exactly like other socks that actually have gel inside.</li>
            <li> Runs super small, could not put on with arthritic hands.</li>
            <li> They work OK for my size 9.5M feet, but if you wear bigger than about a 10, they will be very hard to get on.  </li>
            <li> One other thing, they were not sewn together very well.  </li>
            <li> I had another similar pair, clearly these aren&#x27;t the same.</li>
            <li> GEL socks received in 2nd order were nothing more than a &amp;#34;much smaller&amp;#34; poor quality cloth sock...</li>
            <li> Luckily, Mom has tiny feet, so it works, but my big ol&#x27; clod-hopper feet would never fit in there.</li>
            <li> I first applied heel ointment then wore the socks around the house for a few hours.</li>
            <li> , the Gel lining is just a small spot on heal and it is rubbing off, fresh out of the package .</li>
            <li> It was a disappointment, but my mom still liked that they were pretty tight and helped with her arthritis pain.  </li>
            <li> I wore them for over a day and a half straight.</li>
            <li> As far as helping with my dry skin, they have not helped.  </li>
            <li> , my heels felt great in the morning, however the next night when i tried to put them on the white edges started unraveling :(</li>
            <li> It is also very tight...too tight to sleep with them on.</li>
            <li> they are very restrictive to the ankles to tight.</li>
            <li> It looks good but too tight and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I have size 8 feet (normal sized feet, and they are narrow feet, not wide.)</li>
            <li> I threw them in the washer where one disintegrated in long stretchy fibers that ensnared several of my regular socks.</li>
            <li> number two is that after only one use the stitching on the end started coming undone and leaving several long strings inside of the sock which needed cut.</li>
            <li> I have had gel heel socks in the past and the gel was so much more thick.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t wear them long enough to tell a difference.</li>
            <li> Did not last long before they started to unravel</li>
            <li> How long are they supposed to last?  </li>
            <li> its like a normal plain sock...</li>
            <li> I tend to get extremely dry &amp; cracked heels if I don&#x27;t tend to them daily.  </li>
            <li> I have small feet, a size 5, and these were so small they wouldn&#x27;t even fit over my toes, let alone</li>
            <li> My heels were so dry that they would stick to our short carpet when I walked across them, like Velcro.</li>
            <li> Other than they are really tight, I really like these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not sure why two are super little and no gel.  </li>
            <li> I wear a size 10 and have no trouble with them feeling tight.</li>
            <li> Foot care is very important for diabetics and I am afraid they will cause an infection.</li>
            <li> truly only expect the socks to last maybe a week before needing replaced due to the gel pulling away and rolling up and the stitching coming undone.</li>
            <li> Used with a little lotion and my heels were butter soft.  </li>
            <li> They were so small they would only fit someone with very small feet.  </li>
            <li> they are too small and they are just socks nothing special about them, had to wait until they came from China - a waste of money!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and cheesy.</li>
            <li> Be careful when you order from 3rd party sellers on Amazon!  </li>
            <li> you wouldn&#x27;t want them slipping off in middle of night and not have that gel on tour heels.</li>
            <li> Waited almost a month for my 3 pair to come, if I had known it would take that long, I wouldn&#x27;t have bought to begin with.  </li>
            <li> I ordered these in blue, and I also ordered an identical pair in pink from another seller.  </li>
            <li> Normal, small socks</li>
            <li> The gel coating on the inside of the socks feels like heaven on your feet after a long day.</li>
            <li> A complete waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why they describe them as gel socks because they feel like normal nylon socks.  </li>
            <li> Do be careful walking around if you put extra lotion in them, the inside can be slippery!</li>
            <li> Strangely, there was no gel in the heel of the sock.  </li>
            <li> Took long time to get , [ for me ] , it helps on on my heels .</li>
            <li> and I would have expected that clicking on it would take me to the same seller.  </li>
            <li> They were just plain old socks without toes....</li>
            <li> No different to any other socks.</li>
            <li> Be aware that they run a little small.  </li>
            <li> You do a treatment to your dry feet put these on and</li>
            <li> Without the gel, there is no way to get rid of cracked and dry heels.</li>
            <li> I was suprised to see a difference in my dry feet.  </li>
            <li> For dry, cracked feet?...</li>
            <li> I brought these to keep my heels being so dry in the morning</li>
            <li> It is nothing but a dry sock - no gel in it at all.  </li>
            <li> My heels were so dry</li>
            <li> Sometimes I add tea tree oil or another heel lotion in addition to the socks and the dry skin</li>
            <li> However, I can wear them for about an hour, and they do help with dry heals.  </li>
            <li> these socks work well for my son&#x27;s dry cracked heels.</li>
            <li> Chemo is making my heels dry &amp; cracked.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with dry and cracked heels for years.</li>
            <li> and they did nothing for my dry cracked heels.</li>
            <li> I bought a pair for my sister , who has really dry heels, for Christmas and when my mom saw them she wanted them.  </li>
            <li> I have no reports from my sister on whether the gel (which her socks did come with) has helped with her dry heels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Socks are too small for adult feet.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s not worth the effort to send it back.</li>
            <li> will check with amazon what to do, it does not worth to ship back</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried various creams, lotions and preparations with no success.  </li>
            <li> Received and was surprised at how small they are.</li>
            <li> I waited a long time and it was not what I expected do not buy this product</li>
            <li> They arrived loose in a shipping bag, no label, brand packaging or care instructions.</li>
            <li> Sewing was all off threads all loose.</li>
            <li> Helps really dry heals!  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s a diabetic and her heels get so dry!</li>
            <li> Seems so odd to get two different products.</li>
            <li> About half of the white end was gone, and I had everything in the washer tied up with the gossamery thread.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend these for ladies that wear smaller than a 8 1/2 size shoe or men that wear less than a 9.</li>
            <li> ordered 2 pair of these thinking how can you mess this product up, and at this price, I can get several pair....</li>
            <li> Only offered in one size but too tight for me</li>
            <li> Have to take them off after a short period because they are just too tight.</li>
            <li> I put Flexitol Heel Balm on my heels and then these little blue socks overnight.</li>
            <li> The only problem I had with these socks were that my foot is wide so these pinched a little bit.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husbands feet as he has a hard time with keeping his feet soft.  </li>
            <li> These socks were a total waste, I ordered several pairs and there is no gel in the heels, not as advertised, useless, who wants a pair of half-socks?</li>
            <li> Total waste.</li>
            <li> Be careful walking, as the will produce a slippery feeling while on.</li>
            <li> Waste of Money on Several Levels.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s to keep Them from slipping off, and to generate Heat.&lt;br /&gt;No packaging or washing instructions.</li>
            <li> However, this pair of socks had absolutely no gel.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no gel in the heal</li>
            <li> Helps with the rough heals to soften them</li>
            <li> My heels are softer than the were, as well as the rough spots on the tops of my feet.</li>
            <li> If you have wide feet, do not purchase this item</li>
            <li> I run a lot and my feet get rough.</li>
            <li> but although the gel layer is minimal</li>
            <li> absolutely not at all as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Before using these (only a few days ago) my heels were severely cracked and embarrassing.</li>
            <li> Total waste of time and money.  </li>
            <li> When my heals start looking and feeling rough, I lotion them up and wear these overnight</li>
            <li> What a waste only wore it 12x...  </li>
            <li> My heels are so rough that I thought it would it would break through the material or just ruin them.  </li>
            <li> But, it didn&#x27;t, and after a few days, my heels are vastly improved!  </li>
            <li> reviewer mentioned being careful as they can be</li>
            <li> I wear a size nine wide shoe</li>
            <li> Not much gel in the socks I got.  </li>
            <li> Not much gel on heel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been plagued with rough callouses on my feet for years.  </li>
            <li> They are what I expected</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this for anyone that has wide feet.  </li>
            <li> I had to remove them after a very short time due to being too tight and made my feet</li>
            <li> We ordered the socks along with a few other products but the socks were back</li>
            <li> If you are looking for toe less socks with snazzy medical coloring, don&#x27;t need anytime soon, want to make half a sock puppet, by all means order away.</li>
            <li> Too tight and took too long to receive</li>
            <li> Also the tread came completely loose with in less than 24 hrs.</li>
            <li> i like these, helps my heels but are a little tight, can&#x27;t wear all night and i only wear a 6.</li>
            <li> I have extremely cracked heels.</li>
            <li> Maybe other customers suffer from Edema.</li>
            <li> I am a small person but cannot wear theses to bed which is the only time I would wear them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen other posts stating for their height</li>
            <li> I read other reviews, and mine don&#x27;t have gel in them either, but they work well with the Okeefe Foot Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Please see other reviews where the socks have no gel at all.</li>
            <li> This is the most disappointing purchase I have made from Amazon!  </li>
            <li> BIG WASTE OF MONEY!</li>
            <li> All other gel socks I have purchased had a layer of gel material inside.  </li>
            <li> I have other gel socks</li>
            <li> This was the only thing that ever worked on my hard, rough and cracked heels.</li>
            <li> The material is kinda thin, which could be a good thing and a bad thing.</li>
            <li> but, alas that is different vendors and a different review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few kids over the last few years</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m have wide feet so this was too tight.  </li>
            <li> these were not what I expected - they were so tight that it drove me batty</li>
            <li> the one I finally did get on was so tight I had to take it off because my foot began to swell!!  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Given the extremely low cost, and a morbid fascination, I let the order go, knowing that at least for my 2 dollars I can write a valid review....</li>
            <li> Not worth it the 1.49 plus shipping its a pair of socks with the toes cut out ...</li>
            <li> They are inexpensive, yes, but they are not worth even that--especially considering that you have to wait for them to arrive from china.</li>
            <li> Not worth the effort</li>
            <li> Nothing but material, there is no gel in these socks and are not worth a nickel</li>
            <li> Contrary to blurb, does not fit larger than a small &amp;#34;medium.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Not worth the wait.</li>
            <li> After I waited forever they are extremely too tight.</li>
            <li> They are cut extra small and contain no gel at all!</li>
            <li> Very small socks..good for Japanese girl.  </li>
            <li> I wear them at night and apply a &amp;#34;heel stick&amp;#34; to my feet as well and wake up in the morning to them feeling significantly smoother and less painful.</li>
            <li> I am average size and do not find these to be tight or bothersome in any way.</li>
            <li> Not worth the small amount of money spent on this.</li>
            <li> and although they have slightly improved they still smell like pesticide.</li>
            <li> Seriously, take a pair of socks, cut off to the ends and you have the same product.</li>
            <li> they are so tight and when I seen gel</li>
            <li> So I think they were too tight.</li>
            <li> My wife claims they were too tight and caused sores on one heal.</li>
            <li> They are really tight on my feet.</li>
            <li> They are just tight, support-type socks that do nothing for cracked heels or soles.</li>
            <li> I wear an 11 in women&#x27;s shoes and these were just way too tight.</li>
            <li> it was too tight, I&#x27;m 5&#x27; 11&amp;#34; and wear shoe size 9 in women&#x27;s</li>
            <li> but they were so tight I had to peel them off my swollen feet.</li>
            <li> Way too tight.  </li>
            <li> Regardless, WAY too tight for me.  </li>
            <li> Way to tight threw them away.  </li>
            <li> Too tight.</li>
            <li> and they were a bit tight and could not leave them on for prolonged periods.</li>
            <li> They are extremely tight.</li>
            <li> They are a bit tight on him, he is a size 12.5.</li>
            <li> and they are tight on my feet.  </li>
            <li> They are tight so they don&#x27;t slip off  </li>
            <li> Plus, I am wearing them now and they are so tight I can feel the pulse in my foot.</li>
            <li> They were a bit too tight for my husband who wears a size 9 shoe.  </li>
            <li> GEL Heel Socks for Dry Hard Cracked Skin...</li>
            <li> They do soften the callouses and moisturize the hard dry skin so you can easier remove it.</li>
            <li> I wear them to bed and they have improved the dry, hard skin on my heels.</li>
            <li> Not worth even one dollar!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit upset, regardless of how little I paid for them.</li>
            <li> I rubbed a little coconut oil on my feet before bed and put these on</li>
            <li> but fabric feels a little scratchy like when you put them on.  </li>
            <li> but they are still a little slick due to the gel cushion.</li>
            <li> Does not work, has a little bit of gel cushion in heel area and that is it.</li>
            <li> Must be socks for a little girl.  </li>
            <li> The gel part of the socks worked but they were so tight on my (narrow) feet that I had to cut the edges so they wouldn&#x27;t dig into my ankles and instep.</li>
            <li> I tried them on last night and they are way too small!!  </li>
            <li> Cutting the strings only takes a second, but I don&#x27;t think this should have been an issue after just using them for one night.&lt;br</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T waste  your money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> I like to apply a heavy moisturizer and then put these over it to keep the oil off my sheets.</li>
            <li> A waste of money....washed them ONCE and the threads came out.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money buying or your time waiting for this item.  </li>
            <li> My poor feet turned blue.</li>
            <li> Whatever, think I wasted my $.</li>
            <li> and it a waste of money</li>
            <li> Waste of money don&#x27;t buy it...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money....</li>
            <li> did not fit lost my  money</li>
            <li> Even keeping on a few hours improves.  </li>
            <li> I ordered these for my spouse who was having trouble with cracking calous&#x27;s on her heels.</li>
            <li> The is made for people with narrow feet.  </li>
            <li> PLEASE don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> On e size does not fit all.</li>
            <li> waste of my money</li>
            <li> Not worth the trouble ordering!</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Then 2x washes and it&#x27;s all messy.  </li>
            <li> waste</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste you money.</li>
            <li> no GEL benefits -- a fraud and waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with these socks.</li>
            <li> Fell apart after a few wears.</li>
            <li> and they keep my heavy foot lotion from getting all over the sheets.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> I did wear them one day-they were not comfortable</li>
            <li> Total scam and false advertising.</li>
            <li> so I only gave them 3 stars for false advertising.</li>
            <li> Description is not accurate.</li>
            <li> It got so bad that the thread would wrap around other clothes in the wash that I had to unravel the whole wash.</li>
            <li> These were way too small maybe half the size they advertised, they were a gift so it was embarrassing.</li>
            <li> However, you must use it at least every other night to maintain the softness.  </li>
            <li> these do not have gel in the socks as advertised, just plain socks without toes</li>
            <li> These are just plain ankle socks.  </li>
            <li> I threw them away because they were so small and tight.</li>
            <li> These sox are too small for an average foot and there is NO gel!  </li>
            <li> Item is so tight and itchy!</li>
            <li> Too bad its not a full gel sock for my whole foot</li>
            <li> and it is so small that not fit for me</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see that these worked any differently on my feet then regular socks with Vaseline or heavy foot cream, I was a little disappointed.  </li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t always make it through the night, very tight and my feet tend to swell.  </li>
            <li> Very tight.</li>
            <li> They felt very tight on my foot.</li>
            <li> They are just very tightly knitted heel socks.  </li>
            <li> They are also very tight and small.  </li>
            <li> Very little moisturizing gel.  </li>
            <li> Does NOT fit all sizes unless you stretch these socks and very tight on size 12 !</li>
            <li> work as advertised but really hard to Wash after a few washes the gel inside of the heel  deteriorates .</li>
            <li> It really wasn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me and the size runs small.</li>
            <li> Not Gel-lined, don&#x27;t waste your time and money!</li>
            <li> wish I would have kept reading to see they run small</li>
            <li> she has freakishly small feet</li>
            <li> Usually wear running around the house or relaxing.</li>
            <li> Additionally, because they are so small, they made my foot swell.</li>
            <li> WAY too small to use</li>
            <li> They are a waste of money, and I would complain to the manufacturer if I could!</li>
            <li> Too small for my swollen feet.  </li>
            <li> They were wayyyy too small.</li>

            <li> Cannot say how these work as they were to small.</li>
            <li> I tried to get them on and they are sooooo small</li>
            <li> I could not even get them past my foot.  </li>

            <li> Size runs really small.</li>
            <li> They run small.  </li>
            <li> way too small, cuts off circulation</li>
            <li> They did not come with any instructions, so I was not sure how often to wear them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure these even deserve one star, but I wanted to get a review out there for this one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I have small feet.</li>
            <li> Made for small feet.</li>

            <li> I had purchased gel heel socks that looked like this in the past.</li>
            <li> Way too small for my feet</li>
            <li> Now no more snagging.</li>
            <li> Wayyyyyyyyyyyy tooooooo small, and I wear a size 7 shoe.</li>
            <li> Too small</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is NO gel on them, and they are too small even for me; I wear a size 7 1/2 shoe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon should not carry this product.</li>
            <li> If you have medium to small feet they may work for you.</li>
            <li> these heel socks are so tight and very small, not for adults</li>
            <li> Very small &amp; tight.</li>
            <li> Just a Zip Lock Baggie not suitable for Gift Giving.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; is very thin, and only covers a very small area around the heel.  </li>
            <li> Just very thin tight half pair of socks.</li>
            <li> not happy - too tight</li>
            <li> I recommend these to anyone who has hard calluses on their heels.  </li>
            <li> I hardly wear them because I don&#x27;t like the feel on my skin.</li>
            <li> and these socks were almost too hard to pull on.  </li>
            <li> Socks were too hard to get on</li>
            <li> they work but are hard to put on and take off</li>
            <li> and it makes it hard to walk</li>
            <li> Not worth buying again!!!</li>
            <li> common sense is all you need when it comes to socks.</li>
            <li> Fake item, not a real gel heel socks.  </li>
            <li> Big disappointment.  </li>
            <li> The seams came apart when I washed them on the delicate cycle of my washing machine.  </li>
            <li> I recommend the thick lotion or thick Vaseline then put the booty over ur heel,</li>
            <li> they are so small!</li>
            <li> A waste of money!!</li>
            <li> I need these so badly but they are way to small for my big feet.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my second unpleasant experience</li>
            <li> Also very small.</li>
            <li> The socks themselves are very small.  </li>
            <li> Also, they are very small.</li>
            <li> Run very small, and I thought the heal had a gel insert in it or something?</li>
            <li> And very very small.</li>
            <li> No gel and very small</li>
            <li> Very small.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous.</li>
            <li> They unfortunately they did not work and they are extremely tight on my foot.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re rough and the seam is so tight it makes my foot numb!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about these</li>
            <li> Was not a good purchase for me.</li>
            <li> Not good for 5&amp;#34;8 USA woman.</li>
            <li> The only time I get to myself is when I sleep :(</li>
            <li> Too small therefore uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> I found them very hard to get on my foot.  </li>
            <li> (I wear a size 7 1/2 in womens) and they are too tight to wear all night without cutting into my feet.</li>
            <li> Shipped very late compared to products purchased at the time.</li>
            <li> what so ever and are poorly crafted.</li>
            <li> I was hoping they would have the thin rubbery heel inside that doesn&#x27;t soak the cream into the fabric.</li>
            <li> poor quality - no gel - just sock</li>
            <li> Just what my poor heels needed.  </li>
            <li> This truly was false advertising.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Consistent wear has shown DRAMATIC improvements in my skin on my heels</li>
            <li> to walk around in, so not ideal for wearing while putsing around the house</li>
            <li> There are two pair so small, they are impossible to wear.  </li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed that there wasn&#x27;t any gel on the heels, but gave them a try anyways.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to wear it overnight, but it was too uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> These were useless.  </li>
            <li> Uncomfortable</li>
            <li> these socks were uncomfortable</li>
            <li> Without the gel they are useless.</li>
            <li> Terrible, misleading, Chinese foot binding torture.</li>
            <li> Perhaps they are paid reviews our people from the company that sells them but they are virtually useless.</li>
            <li> Thin, no gel at all!</li>
            <li> totally useless.  </li>
            <li> Not a happy camper here!!!</li>
            <li> I was roaming on amazon and randomly came across this product.  </li>
            <li> I was wrong</li>
            <li> This product is a rip-off!</li>
            <li> sorry to say no gel heels.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> and these felt like they were cutting off circulation in my feet.</li>
            <li> I have diabetes and am afraid to wear them.</li>
            <li> I ordered them because my heels were cracking from the cold winter.</li>
            <li> Yes, they do work, they keep my heels from painfully cracking, but no, I would not recommend them to anyone for the reason of very poor workmanship.</li>
            <li> I think they have fake people writing reviews because ALL four pair are like sandpaper!</li>
            <li> WRONG!</li>
            <li> My Heels aren&#x27;t that bad, but I&#x27;m reluctant to use a Pumice Stone, so I opted for these Socks instead.&lt;br /&gt;Would</li>
            <li> Bad idea</li>
            <li> tried to wash them, bad idea.</li>
            <li> bad product</li>
            <li> For the price though I suppose a week isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> These socks are a bad  joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love these socks. You do a treatment to your dry feet put these on and the next morning it&#x27;s like you shed the old and have new skin.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me and the size runs small.</li>
            <li> No gel in them.  I waited a month for them. Total waste.</li>
            <li> work as advertised but really hard to Wash after a few washes the gel inside of the heel  deteriorates . can find better at burlington or ross</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re okay - comfortable, however, not detecting the &#x27;gel&#x27; -</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see that these worked any differently on my feet then regular socks with Vaseline or heavy foot cream, I was a little disappointed.  Edited Dec., 2015 These things totally unraveled after multiple washes in the washing machine. I definitely would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I would give this product zero stars if it was an option. It took forever to arrive. It is cheaply manufactured. The first time I put them on, they ripped. DON&#x27;T waste  your money. Use a sports sock instead. Incidently, there was no gel or mineral oil in the socks.  This product offers NOTHING.</li>
            <li> Not gel lined as advertised. Also very small. I have purchased similar in the last and these are not even worthy of being called knockoffs. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> I ordered 10 pairs and not 1 pair had the gel on the heel as stated in the ad!!!! Buyer beware!!</li>
            <li> Love them!  The tend to move the gel area off the heel if you move around a lot. I like to wear all day.  They stay in place while I sleep, but not when walking around.</li>
            <li> Socks are too small for adult feet.  Waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> size 8 and fit fine overnight.  love the product even though it didn&#x27;t come with cleaning instructions.  really helps relieve dryness and aches.</li>
            <li> Does NOT fit all sizes unless you stretch these socks and very tight on size 12 !</li>
            <li> I bought 3 pair of GEL heel socks, but what I received were socks without gel. They were packaged separately. The socks could be sold for 50cents each. I will never buy these again.</li>
            <li> These little socks are awesome.  you can feel the gel on the heels.  Having diabetes  I need to keep my feet in tip top shape. My heels have never looked or felt better!</li>
            <li> I wish that these were longer and covered my feet more. Be careful walking, as the will produce a slippery feeling while on.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t think they are doing anything to me, I wasted my money on this. They are just regular socks.</li>
            <li> still waiting for results.</li>
            <li> these do not have gel in the socks as advertised, just plain socks without toes</li>
            <li> these work! I read some complaints about them falling apart when you wash them- as of now, I wash my feet before bed then put these on. Have not felt like I need to wash them yet as I take them off just as I wake up. I am sure they would survive a hand wash at least. (I have walked around a bit in them and they are very squishy and make you feel like you might fall). In the morning my heels are slippery soft and smooth- really helped cure my first and only crack- yikes! I am average size and do not find these to be tight or bothersome in any way.</li>
            <li> I have really dry heels, these socks are great to keep my heels protected while still giving me the comfort of open toes (haha). However, I don&#x27;t understand why these are called gel socks? I thought the texture of it would be gel material inside, (you know like those you would find in some spa gloves), its not. It&#x27;s just regular socks that protects your heels. That&#x27;s all. The material is kinda thin, which could be a good thing and a bad thing. It is pretty comfortable in the summer time but I can see it not being so durable at the same time. Shipping took awhile as they apparently ship from China.</li>
            <li> These socks were a total waste, I ordered several pairs and there is no gel in the heels, not as advertised, useless, who wants a pair of half-socks?</li>
            <li> These did not have the gel in them as advertised.</li>
            <li> Not Gel-lined, don&#x27;t waste your time and money!</li>
            <li> Gel socks?  No gel of any kind here.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Bought these because they looked just like the gel socks I bought last year, but they are definitely not the same. I should have read the reviews. Not the same gel. Not worth the money. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> A very big help to my feet thanks</li>
            <li> Feel great and should have bought them, sooner.</li>
            <li> I had purchased another set of very similar-looking socks on Amazon a year ago for significantly more.  They were finally starting to fall apart, so I thought I would see if these much cheaper alternatives were any good.  The difference is striking.  The &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; is very thin, and only covers a very small area around the heel.  The socks themselves are very small.  I am a size 10.5 mens shoe and they barely fit me.  I can&#x27;t get the heel fully over my foot to where I want it.  So, I still gave it 3 stars because for what I paid for it, they are OK.  However, if you get a more expensive brand, you will find that there is a significant difference.</li>
            <li> They are cut extra small and contain no gel at all!</li>
            <li> Purchased  in combo with electronic foot file and lotion. System for foot care is working.</li>
            <li> wish I would have kept reading to see they run small they pretty much hurt my feet they are so tight and when I seen gel I was think nice soft gel but they look and feel like normal socks going to give them to my mom she has freakishly small feet maybe they will work for her.</li>
            <li> my girlfriend loves these.  she uses them after a shower and before bed, but not on a daily basis - maybe 2-3x/week.  The internal gel lasted her about a month for a pair.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and I use them after a long day and the gel feels good.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get them on. Supposedly one size fits all, but it doesn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> I got them for my daughter who is a nurse, she said it was one of the best things she&#x27;s ever had on her feet, can&#x27;t say it any better than that!</li>
            <li> What a JOKE!!  If you are a size 4 shoe -- then great!  These things are made for tiny feet!  &amp;#34;One size fits all&amp;#34; is WAY misleading !!</li>
            <li> Feels very good on the feet, but I would not recommended for diabetics because they fit tight (unless you have very skinny, small feet).  Use with a foot cream for extra moisture.</li>
            <li> I have extremely cracked heels. First sanding heels and putting ointment then using these my heels have smothed out. No pain anymore. Bought one pair and they were so good, I bought 13 that&#x27;s how well they helped my heels.</li>
            <li> Waste of Money on Several Levels.&lt;br /&gt;I read many Reviews, but took The Gamble anyway. Socks fit VERY snug...I guess it&#x27;s to keep Them from slipping off, and to generate Heat.&lt;br /&gt;No packaging or washing instructions. Just a Zip Lock Baggie not suitable for Gift Giving.&lt;br /&gt;The product didn&#x27;t work at all. My Heels aren&#x27;t that bad, but I&#x27;m reluctant to use a Pumice Stone, so I opted for these Socks instead.&lt;br /&gt;Would have Bought several Pair for Holiday Stocking Stuffers if They had passed The Muster!&lt;br /&gt;Maybe better Luck for Ladies with Small Feet and Ankles.</li>
            <li> No gel whatsoever. Glorified pair of toe-less stretchy socks. Waste of money</li>
            <li> Neither of the socks had gel in the heel. Very disappointing. I&#x27;ve purchased socks like this several times and this is the first time that I&#x27;ve encountered anything like this.</li>
            <li> They work well but one of my pairs unraveled in he wash and caused a huge mess for me to clean up but Amazon customer service handled it well.</li>
            <li> This is the second pair I have purchased, great for keeping heels moist.  Usually wear running around the house or relaxing.</li>
            <li> Not same as described no Gel and it is so small that not fit for me</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. Very good product.</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
            <li> I would take the gel off the wording you have to apply I recommend the thick lotion or thick Vaseline then put the booty over ur heel, n I put another sock over to protect the rest of the foot as I wake up in the morning and my whole foot is soft, worth the price, But I would not call it a Gel Booty, as there is no Gel in it. N does not come with any Gel..S.I.N.Y.LADYRIDER</li>
            <li> Seem to work well.  ~T, 05-19-2015</li>
            <li> These have no gel in the heels and are very tiny. Just remember this if you order. They are made for baby feet. It&#x27;s like a baby sock with the toe cut off.</li>
            <li> The photo shows what is presumably an adult wearing the gel heel socks. I have a medium-sized foot--7.5 medium and I could barely get them on. When I did, the heel portion did not cover my heel. Additionally, because they are so small, they made my foot swell. I threw them away because they were so small and tight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really irrated at these socks! First of all, the material is cheap, there&#x27;s no gel pad in the sock to help keep your foot soft, and they seem like they are made for kids they are so small! This should get No starts..but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Love these things. I like to apply a heavy moisturizer and then put these over it to keep the oil off my sheets. Works and feels great.</li>
            <li> I received these socks today, and there is no gel anywhere in the socks.  They look the same on the outside, but the inside has no gel lining anywhere.</li>
            <li> These are very very cozy, my heels have never felt so good.</li>
            <li> not happy - too tight</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husbands feet as he has a hard time with keeping his feet soft.  For the time use the socks were good.  Comfortable and easy to use.  As time went on and several uses the socks were not helping the healing nor making his feet soft.  The skin was turning a chalky white.  I would not recommend these socks for every day use or extended periods of use.  One time application and throw away.</li>
            <li> I just received these today and decided to wear them at work after applying a foot cream. My feet are terrible and toniggt after work I was pleasantly surprised in the huge difference they made to my heels. Too bad its not a full gel sock for my whole foot lol</li>
            <li> I love them!!! I wear a size 10 and have no trouble with them feeling tight. Maybe other customers suffer from Edema. I would recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> WAY too small to use and I wear a size 8 shoe...</li>
            <li> I bought a pair of these socks as well as the &amp;#34;PediFix Visco-GEL Heel-So-Smooth Heel Sleeves&amp;#34; when I saw that these socks would take over a month to be delivered. The &amp;#34;PediFix&amp;#34; pair is fantastic and has the gel in the heel area as promised. However, this pair of socks had absolutely no gel. They are a waste of money, and I would complain to the manufacturer if I could!</li>
            <li> These are ok, but I prefer the gel socks I have purchased elsewhere.  These seem cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Too small for my swollen feet.  One size doesn&#x27;t fit all.</li>
            <li> I am another who received a cheap pair of toeless socks without the &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34;. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using these heel socks with the O&amp;#34;keeffe&#x27;s healthy feet that I ordered</li>
            <li> It took awhile to get here. I think it&#x27;s the same as my regular socks</li>
            <li> these are reat the seller did a great job</li>
            <li> They actually worked somewhat for cracked skin.  But I tried wearing them overnight and I woke up in the middle of the night and my feet had lost feeling and had cramps.  So I think they were too tight.</li>
            <li> If I could, I would give this no stars.  These heel socks were advertised as GEL heel socks and there was no gel in the heels of any of the items and I ordered 7 pairs.  Without the gel, there is no way to get rid of cracked and dry heels.</li>
            <li> If you have larger than a size 10 US foot. Don&#x27;t bother. Elastic unravelled immediately. Gel felt good, but think I will look for something locally.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love these gel socks.  I tend to get extremely dry &amp; cracked heels if I don&#x27;t tend to them daily.  Simply wearing these to bed have significantly softened my heels.  Greatly reduces the time I have to spend on them and I&#x27;ll be able to wear sandals in no time without any embarrassment.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My wife claims they were too tight and caused sores on one heal.</li>
            <li> After using it the gel came off</li>
            <li> Where is the gel? These socks suck! And they&#x27;re super tight.</li>
            <li> A waste of money....washed them ONCE and the threads came out. It also took over a month to receive. SAVE YO U R MONEY!</li>
            <li> These were toght and fell apart the first time they were used.</li>
            <li> I gave them as a gift and they are so confortable and really help my mother in law, its a great accesory</li>
            <li> NEEDED TO KNOW THE SIZE  NOT KNOWN</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used yet so I can&#x27;t give an honest review, although they look and feel great</li>
            <li> Already fraying. I havent even washed them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned &amp;#34;gel heeled&amp;#34; socks before, and there was actually a gel pad on the heel.  This product does not have a gel pad.  It is also very tight...too tight to sleep with them on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this 2 stars because it was too snug around my foot.  I&#x27;m have wide feet so this was too tight.  I was hoping to wear it overnight, but it was too uncomfortable.  I hope they will offer different sizes in the future.  The concept is there, it just needs additional sizes.</li>
            <li> They are really tight on my feet. Don&#x27;t care for them.</li>
            <li> Works great, and very comfortable.</li>
            <li> There is no gel-lining in these. You must pay shipping to return them and you&#x27;re shipping them to China. DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> These were useless.  They came in a clear plastic bag with no writing or anything.  The &amp;#34;gel socks&amp;#34; had no gel whatsoever on the inside.  I can use lotion and then put them on which is what I will do. It wouldn&#x27;t even be worth the trouble to return them.</li>
            <li> I am a small person but cannot wear theses to bed which is the only time I would wear them they are very restrictive to the ankles to tight.</li>
            <li> My feet feel so good with these on get you a pair</li>
            <li> good value and service</li>
            <li> Terrible product, took 2 months to arrive from China and they are not as described. There is no gel in the socks as other reviews mentioned and they actually made my heels more scratchy after using them. You are better off using a soft pair of socks.</li>
            <li> Just received them love softness of heels</li>
            <li> Constricts your foot. Uncomfortable</li>
            <li> after opening the package I noticed they were not jel socks they were just socks. I would not buy them again or tell people to buy them.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money buying or your time waiting for this item.  The socks unraveled completely after one wash.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice the gel in the socks</li>
            <li> Very cool little sock. Works well with lotion.</li>
            <li> They were okay.  Nothing outstanding about them.</li>
            <li> These are ok. I wasn&#x27;t too pleased but price ws right.</li>
            <li> Bought 3 pairs and none of them contained the gel as advertised. Basically just cheap polyester socks with the ends cut off. Not worth even one dollar!</li>
            <li> Once you get used to the tightness of the socks they can be worn to bed and for all night! After awhile you&#x27;ll notice your heels are softer, smoother.</li>
            <li> Horrible....threw them away first day. They were wayyyy too small.</li>
            <li> I love these gel socks.  They feel so cool and enjoyable on my feet.</li>
            <li> The socks are great for the first few wearings, but soon after the that the gel pad starts to roll away from the fabric and curl.  I only wore them in bed and didn&#x27;t walk around in them.  They did soften my heels as advertised.</li>
            <li> Great idea but... I have an 8M foot and these cut off my circulation.  My poor feet turned blue.</li>
            <li> These socks are in no way as described. There is absolutely no gel in the heal what so ever and are poorly crafted. These socks simply *look* like the other real products out there, but are complete knock offs. The socks were packaged in plastic bags with no indication of the manufacturer nor standard packaging of a legit product. Albeit a very low price, I wasn&#x27;t concerned until I saw the 2-6 week delivery time frame. It was clear what was to come next and what was going on here. Given the extremely low cost, and a morbid fascination, I let the order go, knowing that at least for my 2 dollars I can write a valid review....well, here is that review. If you are looking for toe less socks with snazzy medical coloring, don&#x27;t need anytime soon, want to make half a sock puppet, by all means order away. If you are looking for a product as describe by this vendor, best to go find a legit product elsewhere. I have bought real &amp;#34;GEL&amp;#34; socks from other vendors, and have nothing but good things to say...but, alas that is different vendors and a different review.</li>
            <li> No instructions at all, would have been helpful when and if time comes to wash them</li>
            <li> Gav as gift.  recipient liked</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why they call them GEL heel as there is no gel whatsoever; you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> These are junk, I ordered 1/2 a dozen pair. None of them have any gel anything on the inside. I do have another brand that do. These are just socklets. Thankfully, very cheap price, I&#x27;m throwing them away.</li>
            <li> Fell apart first time it was washed</li>
            <li> I was under the impression these HAD the gel heels, but THEY DON&#x27;T. I&#x27;m a bit upset, regardless of how little I paid for them. It&#x27;s the principle.</li>
            <li> This socks have no gel in the heel. Product is not as advertised.</li>
            <li> These are the worst items I have ever bought.  They are sized for a child&#x27;s feet.</li>
            <li> Helps with the rough heals to soften them</li>
            <li> Great but a long time to get</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS!! There is no gel in the socks! This is a rip off so don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Be careful when you order from 3rd party sellers on Amazon!  My 1st pair of gel heel socks worked quite well.  After a couple days, one edge started to flay, so I decided to order 2 more pairs as spares, which I didn&#x27;t start using till months later.  Then I found out the 2 newer pairs do not have gel heels at all!  These are just plain ankle socks.  It turned out they were actually from 2 different stores-- the 1st order was from &amp;#34;blue lake&amp;#34; and the 2nd order was from &amp;#34;fashion-store.&amp;#34;  &amp;#34;Fashion-store&amp;#34;, apparently, needs to practice better quality control!</li>
            <li> Not what I thought they&#x27;d be. Disappointed</li>
            <li> I just loved this product</li>
            <li> too small I wear a 9.5 shoe these socks were uncomfortable</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about these but figured what the hell? I&#x27;ve had a few kids over the last few years and it&#x27;s pretty much destroyed my feet. The only time I get to myself is when I sleep :( I can&#x27;t stand wearing socks to bed but thought maybe I could handle it because the toes were cut out. It really wasn&#x27;t that bad. I rubbed a little coconut oil on my feet before bed and put these on and my feet came out feeling amazing. Within a few days the dry scratchy part of my heels weren&#x27;t dry and scratchy anymore, and it feels amazing.</li>
            <li> it is not what it said it would be theres no gel in  the socks  it would cost more to return them then there worth I just said oh will</li>
            <li> The socks did the job of moisturizing my feet.  I suffer from eczema and it did a good job holding for keeping medicine and moisturizer on foot. The white trim, however, began to unravel after first wash.  I purchased two and it happened with all 4 socks.  It got so bad that the thread would wrap around other clothes in the wash that I had to unravel the whole wash.</li>
            <li> there was no gel on the heels they were only a pair of toeless socks</li>
            <li> Great for dry and cracked heels. I just wish you offered a whole sock.</li>
            <li> Cheap you can make your own</li>
            <li> Whatever, think I wasted my $.</li>
            <li> The socks have no gel in the heel which is the point. The gel helps to soften heels. Without the gel they are useless. Total scam and false advertising.</li>
            <li> I order the large, but my blood in my foot got cut off and caused severe pain and caused pins and needles. . Also the tread came completely loose with in less than 24 hrs. I had to throw them out.</li>
            <li> Works great and I like my toes being out.</li>
            <li> Great product and excellent seller</li>
            <li> Love them! Do the trick with the right foot cream!</li>
            <li> no gel in the heels?...its like a normal plain sock...</li>
            <li> They make your heels feel awesome!!!!!</li>
            <li> Got these for my mother for Christmas. She loves them!</li>
            <li> I am amazingly surprised and very pleased with this product. The heal socks have really worked on my dry heel skin! Very satisfied! Thank you very much&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am surprising pleased with the heel socks! They have worked great on my dry heel skin. I have used them a few times, but the first night I used them I noticed a remarkable difference in my skin. My skin was softer and they keep improving with wear! Thank so very much! :o)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;!</li>
            <li> I was suprised to see a difference in my dry feet.  Not sure about washing instructions as I did not see any.</li>
            <li> first of all do not know where the GEL is and second it took like a month to get it and it a waste of money</li>
            <li> great item, worked as expected.</li>
            <li> Good product, as a guy who wears a 10.5 shoe they are a little snug but still work.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and packaged well. I wear rhea at night after I put the foot cream ok. My heels are softer than the were, as well as the rough spots on the tops of my feet.</li>
            <li> Too small for a man&#x27;s foot. Material will tear when you put your foot through it. Don&#x27;t buy. Your better off just getting some old torn up socks and trim them to your foot. Saved a lot of money going this route. Should have thought of this before.</li>
            <li> these heel socks are so tight and very small, not for adults</li>
            <li> These socks did NOT have any gel on the heel portion at all.  They are just tight, support-type socks that do nothing for cracked heels or soles. Would not recommend these to anyone unless this is all they wanted.  The blue and white is a cute color combo, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> The pair I received had no gel lining! Was not a good purchase for me. Wouldn&#x27;t give even one star!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this item. The socks I recieved had no gel in them at all. I have used this type of sock before so I know what it should feel like. Returning them is more trouble then they are worth.</li>
            <li> I ordered 4 pair because everyone&#x27;s ratings were so high and they have no aloe or gel or anything soft what so ever! They&#x27;re rough and the seam is so tight it makes my foot numb! Ugh I&#x27;m so upset! I think they have fake people writing reviews because ALL four pair are like sandpaper!</li>
            <li> I am not so sure these were worth the wait or the money. I have had gel heel socks in the past and the gel was so much more thick. These feel like there is nothing gel wise in the heels. So I slather on foot pedicure lotion and wear them to bed.</li>
            <li> helps heels stay ore suple.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing for my feet. Threw them away.</li>
            <li> Definitely helped my heels</li>
            <li> These actually worked!  They worked!  Three nights of use and heels all soft.  I do add some cream also when I put them on.&lt;br /&gt;They  get grungy after a while, I am fortunate that my feet don&#x27;t sweat or they might be worse.  Will probably keep buying new as needed.</li>
            <li> Love these and they work great,</li>
            <li> didnt like it, cheap, gimmick</li>
            <li> I like them but uh there is no gel in the heels so I only gave them 3 stars for false advertising.</li>
            <li> Description is not accurate. Waste of money don&#x27;t buy it...</li>
            <li> I recommend these to anyone who has hard calluses on their heels.  Used with a little lotion and my heels were butter soft.  However, you must use it at least every other night to maintain the softness.  Can&#x27;t wait till summertime and sandals.</li>
            <li> i received these for my wife and they were very nice for the first few uses but then just like any piece of clothing or something that you use for a while they have to be washed right? Well i washed them and my socks are done! The seam fell apart at the ankles and frankly i am pretty pissed! I didn&#x27;t know that these couldn&#x27;t be washed so yea you could about imagine that i am pretty upset!</li>
            <li> Much to my delight,they really make a difference in protecting my heel and relieving some pain.</li>
            <li> Socks did not have the gel inside.</li>
            <li> The are very good to wear to keep ur feet nice and soft after a pedicure</li>
            <li> Very well made. Excellent product</li>
            <li> OK, I fell for this.  But there is nothing &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; about these socks.  They are comfortable, so one can slather up the dry, cracked skin these supposedly help heal, but basically you are just wearing a sock over whatever foot cream you prefer.</li>
            <li> I am not that thrilled about these socks. I wore them for several hours and to me, the skin on my heels did not get any softer. I even rubbed heel balm on my heels and then put on the socks. And nothing.</li>
            <li> I wear an 11 in women&#x27;s shoes and these were just way too tight.</li>
            <li> Christmas gift for my mother was greatly appreciated n it does what it&#x27;s supposed yo her feet looks great now that she uses this thanxx selker looking 4ward for future purchases😉☺👏👏👏👌👍👍👍</li>
            <li> The are ok.  I didn&#x27;t find that they really moisture my feet any more than wearing regular socks, but it let my toes breathe I guess.  Don&#x27;t waste your money....just wear what you have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen other posts stating for their height it was too tight, I&#x27;m 5&#x27; 11&amp;#34; and wear shoe size 9 in women&#x27;s and they fit me fine yes they are snug but thats what you&#x27;d want for these particular socks you wouldn&#x27;t want them slipping off in middle of night and not have that gel on tour heels. My husband has a pair as well hes 5&#x27; 6&amp;#34; wears shoe size 9 1/2. They did take a month to arrive no there&#x27;s no instructions but common sense is all you need when it comes to socks.</li>
            <li> GEL Heel Socks for Dry Hard Cracked Skin...work nice,i love it.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t have gel, but  it work</li>
            <li> did not fit lost my  money</li>
            <li> The gel heel socks had no gel, and it took forever to arrive. Worthless junk</li>
            <li> These are great, have recommended to many.  I have size 10 feet so don&#x27;t always make it through the night, very tight and my feet tend to swell.  Am diabetic so this is improving my feet health.  Even keeping on a few hours improves.  If you wear sandals, this product is perfect.  Price is fantastic.</li>
            <li> .waste of money only wear one week then wash the pair of socks,one wash tore apart</li>
            <li> Too tight and took too long to receive</li>
            <li> cut off my circulation doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> there is NO gel in these heel socks.</li>
            <li> Um... What&#x27;s the purpose? Very tight. Noted nothing after use</li>
            <li> Love them ,works good</li>
            <li> you get what you pay for now nothing special and they take a long time to arrive</li>
            <li> they are too small and they are just socks nothing special about them, had to wait until they came from China - a waste of money!</li>
            <li> There was no gel lining in these socks.  They arrive from China with no box or paperworks. I bought 5 pairs and they are all the same.  Just tighter socks. I&#x27;m sure these are imitation and not the real Gel Socks.  Both my husband and I wore them and laughed afterwards as there is nothing in these socks to do anything for your heels.  Yes you can put your own moisturizer in them but you can do that for the dollar socks at the 99 Cent store as well.</li>
            <li> Ugh, gel? For dry, cracked feet?... NO! They are very nice to have if you&#x27;ve been working on your feet at home and there is no one to rub them for you but as far as doing anything for dry, cracked feet... nothing!</li>
            <li> I like it but fabric feels a little scratchy like when you put them on.  I hardly wear them because I don&#x27;t like the feel on my skin.</li>
            <li> Wife loves these socks..AWESOME PURCHASE!!</li>
            <li> The only problem I had with these socks were that my foot is wide so these pinched a little bit.</li>
            <li> The price should have warned me.  These sox are too small for an average foot and there is NO gel!  I&#x27;d return them but why waste any more money?  Ignore the one star.  That&#x27;s way too generous.</li>
            <li> not what they were advertised to be.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my spouse who was having trouble with cracking calous&#x27;s on her heels. We ordered the socks along with a few other products but the socks were back ordered.&lt;br /&gt;They did come on the dates Amazon said they would but we had to have my sister mail them to us because we were visiting her when we ordered them.  My wife said she really likes them and they do relieve her heels and they feel much softer after only a couple of nights wearing them while she sleeps.</li>
            <li> The is made for people with narrow feet.  If you have wide feet, do not purchase this item</li>
            <li> PLEASE don&#x27;t waste your money. Unless you have a small foot, they won&#x27;t fit. I wear a women&#x27;s size 6 1/2 - 7 and they cut off the circulation in both feet.</li>
            <li> SUPER FAST SHIPPING. PERFECT !!!!!</li>
            <li> They were so small they would only fit someone with very small feet.  Bad idea</li>
            <li> They look like regular socks. No different to any other socks.</li>
            <li> Not GEL at all! Very disappointed. Not getting very again.</li>
            <li> Cheap but I guess it is what I paid for.</li>
            <li> love these, can be worn many times and makes my heels soft</li>
            <li> great to wear at night, toes open helps me to not overheat in the warm weather.  would buy several pairs though, you only get so many uses out of them and will want more.</li>
            <li> cheap, good, and prompt delivery. Does the job.</li>
            <li> Terrible, misleading, Chinese foot binding torture. These are too tiny to fit my size 8 1/2 foot into. There was no gel cushion in the heel at all, and the socklet was made of cheap poly material. I tried to wear them one night but they were so tight I had to peel them off my swollen feet. I threw them in the washer where one disintegrated in long stretchy fibers that ensnared several of my regular socks. They are horrible. I threw them away. I wish I could give them zero stars but this system doesn&#x27;t allow that.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for my dry, cracked heels.  Started falling apart after I washed them.</li>
            <li> Works great but hand wash only</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work like ones I got from doctor.  Guess get what pay for.</li>
            <li> I love these.. I put them on at night and my feet are super smooth in the am.. becareful trying to walk in them though-almost broke my neck on a middle of the night bathroom trip</li>
            <li> No instructions or info with packaging</li>
            <li> Love these hard to wash though the gel sticks to each other but good for your heals</li>
            <li> Have never been able to get them on my feet. Do not have large feet but these are a real pain to get on. May try again when it gets cooler outside.</li>
            <li> Fell apart after one use. Very poor quality. Purchase another set from the drugstore which have lasted a month now, work great, and are a little thicker which also contributes to the durability. The drugstore variety also came in different sizes, unlike these, so they are more comfortable.</li>
            <li> They arrived loose in a shipping bag, no label, brand packaging or care instructions. Cannot tell if the &#x27;gel solution&#x27; is really there when wearing them.  Cheap look and feel.</li>
            <li> I totally love these. But don&#x27;t think you will be wearing them all day while you are up on your feet... I mean, sure you can... but the gel pads just slide off your heel and bunch up and don&#x27;t serve the purpose they are made for... So wear them to bed at night when you are off your feet for many hours. Other than that - my heels are looking fine baby!</li>
            <li> These Work of course you have to wear them. I like to wear them they make my feet feel great.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews, and mine don&#x27;t have gel in them either, but they work well with the Okeefe Foot Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and I am a woman&#x27;s size eight, medium width, and they fit perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> These socks don&#x27;t have gel at all! The description is intentionally misleading and the picture looks exactly like other socks that actually have gel inside. Also, they are very small.</li>
            <li> Like it and use it very often. Does the job. Use it on the elbow as well</li>
            <li> Great for my heels! I run a lot and my feet get rough. Put some lotion on my heels, those hinge over, good to go!</li>
            <li> These socks do not have a gel heel!! They are just regular socks. What the...?  Too inexpensive to bother returning, but they are not what they claim to be. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> The product came from China, indeed it was law price but there is no Gel. I had to spend the same amount of the purchase to ship it back in otder to get $10 refund. If I knew that it is coming from China, would never buy it. It&#x27;s my second unpleasant experience</li>
            <li> Waited almost a month for my 3 pair to come, if I had known it would take that long, I wouldn&#x27;t have bought to begin with.  And when they did I was very disappointed to see that none of them had the gel in them. Pointless.</li>
            <li> Love these.  Very comfortable, great price and work well.  Makes your feet feel cool when you are wearing them.</li>
            <li> They are ok wish they had oil for your feet.</li>
            <li> Just doesn&#x27;t seemed to do the job</li>
            <li> I would give the a zero if I could. The pair I received had no gel in them anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;This is a total misrepresentation of the product. The gel heel product, like others I have used before, are what is described and what people talk about in the reviews. Perhaps they are paid reviews our people from the company that sells them but they are virtually useless. I can just wear socks and the moisturize my whole foot if they&#x27;re supposed to just be a cover for your own moisturizermoisturizer. Ridiculous. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Cannot say how these work as they were to small. Put they seem like they would work well.</li>
            <li> Work great but not sure if will fit after wash/dry.</li>
            <li> I ordered these in blue, and I also ordered an identical pair in pink from another seller.  The blue from this order had no gel at all in the heels.  I didn&#x27;t know I was supposed to be able to feel the gel until I got the pink ones a couple of days later.  Also, these are pretty small.  They work OK for my size 9.5M feet, but if you wear bigger than about a 10, they will be very hard to get on.  So - no gel in these socks means one star from me.</li>
            <li> The are shipped from China so they took awhile to get to me.  I tried to get them on and they are sooooo small I could not even get them past my foot.  I do not have huge feet so I&#x27;m not sure what the deal is on them but I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> On e size does not fit all. Could barely get my toes in. Also it took sp lomg to arrive, I almost forgot I ordered it. It that this ppont&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s not worth the effort to send it back.</li>
            <li> This is a joke .... Not worth it the 1.49 plus shipping its a pair of socks with the toes cut out ...</li>
            <li> I have used gel heels before and they really do work but these do not seem to have the gel part.</li>
            <li> My parents lived them thanks so much</li>
            <li> Some reviews said these were good for men to wear, but they are not unless you wear a size 8 or smaller. Shipping takes forever since they are mailed from China.</li>
            <li> this gel heel socks are real cheap. I will not buy it from them again.</li>
            <li> It doesnt have any gel at all. Normal, small socks</li>
            <li> Toke forever and they still was to small.</li>
            <li> Used these socks once, and they fell apart after the second wash.</li>
            <li> I bought 4 pair and they didn&#x27;t have any jel in them as advertized.  Very unhappy</li>
            <li> If you use an instrument to file your heels and apply lotions, the socks are okay. They don&#x27;t do much by themselves.</li>
            <li> The pair I got ripped the 1st time I wore them</li>
            <li> Love these! Cool and soothing. I apply moisturizer first then put on for best results.</li>
            <li> These things actually healed my heels. I first applied heel ointment then wore the socks around the house for a few hours. When I removed the socks I saw an instant improvement. After a few days my heels were soft and smooth. Definitely would buy again.</li>
            <li> I was totally disappointed with these. the sticky gel stuck to my feet when I took them off. I loved the way they felt on but didn&#x27;t like that the gel cam away from the sock itself and all balled up. waste of my money</li>
            <li> This is my first try at these socks.  They  are comfortable and very soft.</li>
            <li> It had long tear lines the first night I put it on. Not worth buying again!!!</li>
            <li> They fit well but although the gel layer is minimal</li>
            <li> I ordered three of these and two came with no gel inside. I had them put away until my heels needed some tlc.  I just took them out this weekend.  It was a surprise when I opened the plastic bags and found two different items.  There are two pair so small, they are impossible to wear.  I do like the one pair that has the gel. They are big enough for my size 9.5~10 feet.  I have not washed them yet, first time to put them on.  But probably will hand wash. There were no instructions, no packaging information, just clear plastic bags.  I wore out  the ones I bought from Avon years ago. So it was nice to find these.  I&#x27;m just not sure why two are super little and no gel.  I don&#x27;t think I would order these again though.  No guarantees what I would get.  Seems so odd to get two different products.</li>
            <li> use with amlactin foot cream, works like magic.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable. Works great. Everyone wants  them, gave them the info. on how to order them. Hopefully they will order.</li>
            <li> Way too tight.  I finally got it on my foot, but cut off circulation.&lt;br /&gt;Not a good buy.</li>
            <li> Quality very bad ... I thought the price was too good to be true .... You get what you pay for ....</li>
            <li> There was NO gel lining in either pair I ordered. Disappointing. I have full gel socks that have gotten a little gross and I bought these to replace. These Suck.</li>
            <li> Helps really dry heals!  I wish they made a full foot sock.  Makes heals better after the first day.  Ordering more.</li>
            <li> I have bought 4 pairs of these gel heel socks. The first pair fell apart. I very foolishly ordered them again..3 pairs because I thought they were only worth what I paid for them but I needed something. I just opened the 3 pairs &amp; none of them have gel in the heels. Now, I&#x27;m returning them for a refund..don&#x27;t buy these socks!!!</li>
            <li> Size runs really small. Good product.</li>
            <li> If you have large ankles they are not for you.  They run small.  I brought these to keep my heels being so dry in the morning so at night I put them on with some Vaseline or cream for feet and they do look better in the morning.  I use this along with my Amope and moisturizing cream to keep my feet ready for my scandals.</li>
            <li> way too small, cuts off circulation</li>
            <li> They feel like cheap compression socks. Once you wash them, they stretch. I honestly can&#x27;t find a pro for the socks. I guess the price is great but you get what you pay for. Also, took over a month to get here.</li>
            <li> Great for the heels.  Sleep with them on</li>
            <li> These items were really too small for me, but I stretched them to make them fit my oversized feet.  They did not come with any instructions, so I was not sure how often to wear them.  I did wear them for more than a week and hoped to see some difference, but no luck.  I have continued their use on and off for over a month, and do notice a bit of healing,  I was probably expecting more, but my feet had alot of healing to deal with</li>
            <li> There is NO GEL at all, its just regular socks. stay away its not as described.&lt;br /&gt;i sent an e.mail to the seller and no feed back.&lt;br /&gt;hopefully amazon will take action.&lt;br /&gt;will keep you updated</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure these even deserve one star, but I wanted to get a review out there for this one.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered 2 pair of these thinking how can you mess this product up, and at this price, I can get several pair....awesome! WRONG! I waited for these for weeks, and when they finally did show up, THERE WAS NO GEL IN THE HEELS! Now tell me, what is the point of these socks if there is no gel in the heels?&lt;br /&gt;There are other makers of these socks that are a buck or two more....spend the extra money, because when you get a pair that actually have the gel, they work pretty well.</li>
            <li> I wear a mens size 9 shoe.  I bought the gel heel socks as &amp;#34;one size fits all&amp;#34;.  Regardless, WAY too tight for me.  I just threw them away.</li>
            <li> Nice, but a tight fit and I have thin feet!</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly! Completely satisfied!</li>
            <li> These took nearly 2.5 weeks to come from China and had NO gel in the heels. I had another similar pair, clearly these aren&#x27;t the same. AWFUL!</li>
            <li> Feels weird at first, got to get use to the feeling when walking but when just resting or sleeping, it&#x27;s feels really comfortable</li>
            <li> did not feel like gel was in it</li>
            <li> absolutely not at all as advertised.  There is no Gel in the socks, they are simply very cheap toe-less socks.  They are also very tight and small.  They are sized more for a child.  I have size 8 feet (normal sized feet, and they are narrow feet, not wide.) and these socks were almost too hard to pull on.  Do not buy these.  They are inexpensive, yes, but they are not worth even that--especially considering that you have to wait for them to arrive from china.</li>
            <li> Thin, no gel at all! Very small &amp; tight.</li>
            <li> After waiting two months for these socks to arrive, they do NOT have any gel lining the heel s whatsoever!!! Just nylon knit socks. Not worth the effort - you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> These really work. I put Flexitol Heel Balm on my heels and then these little blue socks overnight. Within 3 or 4 days my heels have improved dramatically. I had a very deep crack on one heel that I thought would never heal, but after a month or so it healed completely. They seem to last forever, too.</li>
            <li> with right oinntment  andpersonal pedi mom&#x27;s circulation has already improved</li>
            <li> Socks were too hard to get on and I have small feet.</li>
            <li> This came in a clear &amp;#34;baggie&amp;#34; - the picture you see on the product description was not at all the packaging I received.  It is nothing but a dry sock - no gel in it at all.  Do not waste your money.  PLUS, it ships from China so takes weeks to get to you.</li>
            <li> SO FAR IT HAS HELP EVEN AFTER THE FIRST TREATMENT. I COVERED MY HEEL IN A SWEET CREAM AND PUT THE SOCK OVER IT.. THE NEXT MORNING MY HEEL FELT SOFT AND WITHOUT PAIN. WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYBODY</li>
            <li> Way to tight threw them away.  Made for small feet.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really get what these things are supposed to do yet my feet feel softer so, hey, that&#x27;s a positive! Try &#x27;em</li>
            <li> Had no gel in them, will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Nothing but material, there is no gel in these socks and are not worth a nickel</li>
            <li> Terrible quality! Sewing was all off threads all loose. Not worth the trouble ordering!</li>
            <li> very nice. really recommended</li>
            <li> Item is so tight and itchy! Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Love these heel socks and wear them every night.  Be sure to get the &amp;#34;Blue Goo Cracked Heel Foot Softner&amp;#34; to use with them.  They have made my heels into baby soft smooth skin.</li>
            <li> These tiny gel heel socks are better than full size heel socks in that they don&#x27;t make your feet sweat. By nights end, the Vaseline has completely absorbed and my heels are nice and soft. Before using these (only a few days ago) my heels were severely cracked and embarrassing.</li>
            <li> Just badly made socks, with no gel!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see the difference</li>
            <li> Product description is very deceiving as if your buying real GEL SOCKS. Fake item, not a real gel heel socks.  There is NO GEL on the heels as it was supposed to be.</li>
            <li> Nice comfy  and due June 5 got may 10 order may 1 so good alone or with lotion size 7/1/2 fits nice</li>
            <li> The gel part of the socks worked but they were so tight on my (narrow) feet that I had to cut the edges so they wouldn&#x27;t dig into my ankles and instep.</li>
            <li> Cheap! Cheap!, the Gel lining is just a small spot on heal and it is rubbing off, fresh out of the package .</li>
            <li> The socks delivered had no GEL in the heels.  Total waste of time and money.  The same product fulfilled by another firm was fine.</li>
            <li> One time use. tried to wash them, bad idea.</li>
            <li> These worked for me. When my heals start looking and feeling rough, I lotion them up and wear these overnight and my heals are nice and smooth in the morning.</li>
            <li> Item as described. Quick delivery. A+</li>
            <li> Good product.  Both socks are not the same size.  But quality is great, the gel that brings inside only last about 2 months before it starts rolling off.</li>
            <li> Extremely slow to ship, good product,if you don&#x27;t mind waiting 2 months to use it.</li>
            <li> Helps with foot issues for wife as she&#x27;s on her feet a lot at work</li>
            <li> These worked great for helping heal my cracked soles, but the stiching came loose after a few wears.</li>
            <li> received today and found no gel/silicone at all inside, just regular socks without toe, nothing like that i saw in the store. totally useless.  will check with amazon what to do, it does not worth to ship back</li>
            <li> At first it&#x27;s good but then the gel peals and gets gummy.  Then 2x washes and it&#x27;s all messy.  What a waste only wore it 12x...  boo good idea bad product</li>
            <li> Shipped very late compared to products purchased at the time. Very cheap, give to the cat to play with.</li>
            <li> Just received these socks - there is NO GEL IN THEM!</li>
            <li> Too tight. Can cut off the circulation above and below.</li>
            <li> Took over a month to arrive from China.  No gel in the heel at all.  Socks don&#x27;t work.  Please see other reviews where the socks have no gel at all.</li>
            <li> There was NO gel in them at all!  They were just plain old socks without toes....</li>
            <li> I just received two pair that I had ordered the first part of the month.  They have no gel in the heels.  I threw them away.  I was so disgusted.</li>
            <li> Run very small, and I thought the heal had a gel insert in it or something? But it didn&#x27;t.  For the price, they are OK.</li>
            <li> Not worth the small amount of money spent on this. It doesn&#x27;t do anything. Just take an old pair of socks &amp; cut the toe portion off. This isn&#x27;t worth paying for.</li>
            <li> I have very skinny, bony feet (size 6 Womens) and these felt like they were cutting off circulation in my feet. Couldn&#x27;t wear them long enough to tell a difference.</li>
            <li> These work great with or without lotion.  I sleep with them on and it has made a big difference.</li>
            <li> This truly was false advertising. They came and looked exactly like the photo here, but there was no gel at all in the heels so I thought... well, perhaps the heels were treated with something to keep the medication in place. Nope, put the medication on my heels and the socks over that and it bled right through!!!! Then when I put them through the wash, they began to fall apart. When I brought it to the company&#x27;s attention (mind you, I didn&#x27;t ask for a replacement)... they wouldn&#x27;t take my word for it that the product WAS NOT what was advertised and made me take a photo to show them proof! Not a happy camper here!!! I did buy some from another company on Amazon (pink ones) and they were exactly what was in the description... gel heels and all!</li>
            <li> they help my feet in all ways as I have very bad foot</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  My heels are so rough that I thought it would it would break through the material or just ruin them.  But, it didn&#x27;t, and after a few days, my heels are vastly improved!  I rubbed Vaseline on my heels, put the gel sock on and kept them on all night.  They stayed on, was comfortable and it really works. This was the only thing that ever worked on my hard, rough and cracked heels. Very impressed.</li>
            <li> Got these for my mom. The heel part inside of the sock is a ice cool stiff jelly lining. My mom has a huge crack in her heel, and she said that this helps take it away. She likes to put lotion inside the sock too for extra moisturizerization.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried absolutely everything to no avail. My heels were so dry I&#x27;d actually scratch my legs with them while sleeping!! I can&#x27;t believe how awesome these socks are-- they transformed my heels in just one day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer mentioned being careful as they can be slippery-- I didn&#x27;t even use cream but they are still a little slick due to the gel cushion. I resolved that issue by wearing them with flip flops around the house. I wish they made gloves and socks with individual fingers and toes too!</li>
            <li> Very nice!  The sock do unravel.  Very comfortable and heels are softer.</li>
            <li> They keep my moisturizer on and let my toes breath</li>
            <li> Very good.  Comfortable while holding call us cream or softener to heels.</li>
            <li> Great product, great e-bay seller!</li>
            <li> great for the feet. Loved it so much I ordered two.</li>
            <li> These are just socks with no toes. Does NOTHING extra for your heels.</li>
            <li> These really do work well.  I wear a size nine wide shoe and they were a bit tight and could not leave them on for prolonged periods. They do soften the callouses and moisturize the hard dry skin so you can easier remove it.</li>
            <li> Only offered in one size but too tight for me and I have small feet - size 6. Can&#x27;t feel the gel.</li>
            <li> Too small for my feet (size 12) Probably OK for smaller feet.</li>
            <li> Big disappointment.  I have small feet, a size 5, and these were so small they wouldn&#x27;t even fit over my toes, let alone go onto my foot.  Interesting idea that would have worked if they actually fit an adult foot.  As they are now, totally worthless</li>
            <li> Socks raveled at the edges even before the first time they were washed.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t feet men&#x27;s feet</li>
            <li> It was a Christmas gift...haven&#x27;t heard from the recipient.</li>
            <li> This product is comfortable to wear and is moisturizing.  I wear them to bed and they have improved the dry, hard skin on my heels.</li>
            <li> pro&#x27;s: works well, feet feel softer in the moring, the socks do not cut of circulatiion.&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s: The odor is pleasant but very powerful, have to store under other clothing to mask the odor.</li>
            <li> These work well to keep dry and cracked heels comfortable and moisturized not only in the daytime but also at night.</li>
            <li> Is okay mom isnt too Happy</li>
            <li> The socks felt comfortable, but began to unravel at the top after first gentle washing.</li>
            <li> I think the idea of a GEL Heel Sock is brilliant. But these particular socks are not any good. The first time I hand washed them they started unraveling. I now use an old sock, it does a much better job and covers the entire foot.</li>
            <li> This was a happy accident.  I was roaming on amazon and randomly came across this product.  I read only the verified purchase reviews and liked what I read.  I ordered it and use it every night.  Before I put the socks on I apply some Eucerin Aquaphor healing ointment which can be purchased here or at the store.  I am in the process of seeing my heal change and I like it.  You need to do this faithfully every night.  In the shower I do use a pumice rock.</li>
            <li> I wear a women&#x27;s size 10.5 shoe, have somewhat wide feet and the socks I received fit fine. By morning my heels would feel softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three reasons for my rating only being three stars. The first is that the gel heel has been pulling away from the sock since the first time I put them on, and I put them on carefully to avoid this. The gel pulls away and then rolls up at the edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reason number two is that after only one use the stitching on the end started coming undone and leaving several long strings inside of the sock which needed cut. Cutting the strings only takes a second, but I don&#x27;t think this should have been an issue after just using them for one night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The third reason for the rating is that my socks arrived in just a clear plastic bag without any type of care or laundering instructions. They say the socks are washable and reusable, but without knowing how they are to be properly washed I risk ruining the socks further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I truly only expect the socks to last maybe a week before needing replaced due to the gel pulling away and rolling up and the stitching coming undone. For the price though I suppose a week isn&#x27;t too bad. I am unsure if I will reorder the gel socks since I also purchased an electric foot file that is making more of an improvement for my heels than the socks.</li>
            <li> Wore them on and off for 2 days, then washed...totally uravaels and knotted all my clothes..had to cut apart the sock threads to get the clothes unknotted...terrible product..also no gel heels...waste&lt;br /&gt;of money</li>
            <li> they work but are hard to put on and take off</li>
            <li> Does not work, has a little bit of gel cushion in heel area and that is it. Does not make foot softer and is a better fit for size 8 or less if you want to waste your money and wait for it to arrive</li>
            <li> have purchased before really helps</li>
            <li> Very right on wide feet. The silicone ones are much better anyways</li>
            <li> These came quickly but were just too tight for my swelling feet. I gave them to my daughter and she likes them fine. Good buy for the price.</li>
            <li> Fits like a sock, but allows toes to wiggle.  It&#x27;s good for slathering Vaseline on heels and putting on the heel socks.</li>
            <li> Too small therefore uncomfortable.  Very little moisturizing gel.  Don&#x27;t waste you money.</li>
            <li> Heals even the toughest skin.</li>
            <li> The fit is right, the color is nice, the texture is soft - but one of them unraveled in the wash. About half of the white end was gone, and I had everything in the washer tied up with the gossamery thread. Yes, they do work, they keep my heels from painfully cracking, but no, I would not recommend them to anyone for the reason of very poor workmanship. Fortunately I can sew, so I repaired the damage best I could, but this is beside the point. It should NOT have unraveled, especially after the first wash. Or - ever. I have regular socks that I&#x27;ve had for last 10 years or so. Sure, they are not looking their best by now, but they definitely stay in one piece. And that&#x27;s all I ask. These heel socks were not worn during the day. I put them on at night, after I apply foot cream. So nobody can say they were abused in any way. They should have stayed in perfect condition for months, if not years. As it is, if I notice some more unraveling, I will just put them in the trash, and knit myself a new pair.</li>
            <li> These were way too small maybe half the size they advertised, they were a gift so it was embarrassing.</li>
            <li> My Daughter seems to like them fine.</li>
            <li> They unfortunately they did not work and they are extremely tight on my foot.  I wear a size 7 shoe and they feel like they should go to a 5 size.  I am very disappointed with this product and would like to return it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> I have not been able to wear my Gel Heel Socks yet because the gel part smells like pesticide. I have hand washed them twice and have soaked them and although they have slightly improved they still smell like pesticide. I have diabetes and am afraid to wear them. Foot care is very important for diabetics and I am afraid they will cause an infection. I will most likely throw them away.</li>
            <li> I wear a medium shoe width.  I haven&#x27;t been able to wear these. They don&#x27;t stretch like socks, so  I found them very hard to get on my foot.  They felt very tight on my foot.</li>
            <li> These socks work wonders!  I wear them to bed and by the next morning my dry heels are much better.  Sometimes I add tea tree oil or another heel lotion in addition to the socks and the dry skin just rubs off.  Highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> They are OK..works a little to make smoother but not enough for it to feel great.</li>
            <li> too tight at top of sock, causes ankles to swell.  I cut off tops....</li>
            <li> They fall apart in a short period of time. The cuffs unravel easily The gel starts to disintegrate after a couple uses.</li>
            <li> These socks are good, does the job</li>
            <li> Will buy powercord  again it is strong knots good and strethcy  without losing it strength. I loved it.</li>
            <li> Be aware that they run a little small.  I have small feet (I wear a size 7 1/2 in womens) and they are too tight to wear all night without cutting into my feet. However, I can wear them for about an hour, and they do help with dry heals.  One other thing, they were not sewn together very well.  When I received them the hem was already coming unraveled.  They are still usable without the hem.</li>
            <li> Lovvvvve them...Wow, put lotion on...put socks on and be amazed! Highly recommended! I will order more.</li>
            <li> I have had lots of types of gel socks, but like these a lot.  The gel area is larger than other socks like this I have had, they seem of good quality, thick.  They fit snugly on my feet - an important aspect of socks like this.</li>
            <li> these socks work well for my son&#x27;s dry cracked heels. His feet feel better when he gets up in the am.</li>
            <li> Did not last long before they started to unravel</li>
            <li> Not much gel in the socks I got.  They do work fine if you put on cream or lotion and wear them around or to bed.  A bit pricey for not having the gel in them though....</li>
            <li> Do not purchase this product. Just received my second order of this product. GEL socks from first order were good product. GEL socks received in 2nd order were nothing more than a &amp;#34;much smaller&amp;#34; poor quality cloth sock...no GEL benefits -- a fraud and waste of money.  Am in process of returning 2nd order product..</li>
            <li> these work great to soften your heels. I use it with bath and body works lotion or with coconut oil</li>
            <li> It seemed to take forever to get this product. I ordered them as gifts for several people and needed them before thanksgiving to take out of town. I didn&#x27;t get them for two more weeks. Then I realized they were coming from China. They are all cloth, so the heel cream will soak into the fabric. I was hoping they would have the thin rubbery heel inside that doesn&#x27;t soak the cream into the fabric. That way, in the morning, after all night, you still have cream treating your heels.</li>
            <li> these were not what I expected - they were so tight that it drove me batty and I had to take them off!</li>
            <li> No gel in my pair of socks. Just very thin tight half pair of socks.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed that there wasn&#x27;t any gel on the heels, but gave them a try anyways. Chemo is making my heels dry &amp; cracked. They even bleed sometimes. I put on lotion and/or ointment before putting on these socks. In the morning, my feet were moisturized and there wasn&#x27;t any left on the socks. With cotton socks there is always a coating of the ointment left on the socks. I&#x27;ve even worn them under my normal socks during the day. I can feel the band around my instep, but it&#x27;s not bad. My feet sure were happy!</li>
            <li> These work great for their intended purpose. I wear them at night and apply a &amp;#34;heel stick&amp;#34; to my feet as well and wake up in the morning to them feeling significantly smoother and less painful. The gel coating on the inside of the socks feels like heaven on your feet after a long day. I don&#x27;t like sleeping with socks on because it makes my feet feel confined and sweaty, these are the perfect remedy! Will definitly buy again!</li>
            <li> Great little heel socks. I sleep with them on or just walk around the house with them for a bit and my heels come out much smoother. I ordered them because my heels were cracking from the cold winter. I wore them for over a day and a half straight. Afterwards my heels weren&#x27;t as cracked and calloused. I was able to file most of the dead skin away, that I couldn&#x27;t file away before wearing them. Love them.</li>
            <li> poor quality - no gel - just sock</li>
            <li> I ordered two pair. There is no gel of any kind in any of the heels.... They are extremely tight.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with these socks. There is no Gel at all. They look just like ones I have owned that worked great. Since the picture looked just like my old ones, and they said gel I was expecting a much better quality product.</li>
            <li> the Sox suck they are nothing like I thought they would be really want my money back. I waited a long time and it was not what I expected do not buy this product</li>
            <li> Not gel socks at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an adult these gel heel socks was for a child</li>
            <li> Work good - I suppose it depends upon what kind of lotion you use.  Wish they covered my bunions though!</li>
            <li> These are cool and they work best when you add cream to your feet right before putting the socks on!!</li>
            <li> They started fraying and unraveling on the third wearing</li>
            <li> After I waited forever they are extremely too tight. A complete waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> feels good on the crack heels, and helps them heal with out having to wear socks.</li>
            <li> I like them. I need some for toes also, or whole feet.</li>
            <li> My socks came with no gel in them. Fell apart after a few wears.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 pair but only received 1 pair and they ripped the first time my daughter wore them. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> No gel item not as described.</li>
            <li> Love these gel socks. Hate cracked heels.&lt;br /&gt;I use these frequently to keep feet from &amp;#34;getting ugly&amp;#34;between pedicures.&lt;br /&gt;Feet stay nice and soft. Very reasonable through Amazon but take time to get from China.</li>
            <li> My heels were so dry that they would stick to our short carpet when I walked across them, like Velcro. Also they would snag when I put my nylons on. Before I go to bed I put lotion on my feet and then slip these heel Gel socks on. After a week I noticed my heels were super smooth and soft. I don&#x27;t have to use these every night now, once or twice a week does the trick.</li>
            <li> it did work very well....</li>
            <li> Runs super small, could not put on with arthritic hands. Not much gel on heel.</li>
            <li> The worked well, my heels felt great in the morning, however the next night when i tried to put them on the white edges started unraveling :(</li>
            <li> Great socks!! My feet feel soft again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been plagued with rough callouses on my feet for years.  I&#x27;ve tried various creams, lotions and preparations with no success.  I bought these socks hoping they would help.  I used them at night with lotion and after a month, I have not noticed any improvement plus the seams are beginning to unravel.  I give up.</li>
            <li> Received and was surprised at how small they are. Since there was no size when ordering I thought they would stretch.  These would only fit a child or extremely small adult.  Glad I didn&#x27;t waste much money on them</li>
            <li> might have liked it if it fit.....no feet over a childs 12</li>
            <li> Comfortable, perfect fit for small feet.</li>
            <li> I would give it another star if you would have put this on the market earlier , I&#x27;m going to buy saddles thus Summer what&#x27;s that tell you. The best and thoughtful product I have ever bought.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You Tim (ugly feet no more) Goolsby&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I didn&#x27;t take pics because I hade no confidence in any feet product. I was wrong</li>
            <li> Works awesome.  Use them on my husband&#x27;s feet as we have to keep Vaseline on them at night.  They are a bit tight on him, he is a size 12.5.</li>
            <li> The socks come in one size only and they are for very tiny feet.  I wear a women&#x27;s size 7 and they are tight on my feet.  I can get them on, but it is a bit of a struggle and sometimes I rub a lot of lotion off my feet just trying to get these socks on!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why they describe them as gel socks because they feel like normal nylon socks.  But they do what I need so it&#x27;s cool. They are tight so they don&#x27;t slip off  and they keep my heavy foot lotion from getting all over the sheets.</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t gel socks like they were advertised</li>
            <li> Kind of concerned that they were in a zip loc bag with no instructions or tags. Makes me wonder if they were actually new?!</li>
            <li> Helped my heels a lot</li>
            <li> These work great on my heels but the problem I have is that they are so tight they cut my circulation off so I can only wear them for a short time before having to take them off.  If they came in different sizes so I could order a larger size, I&#x27;d give them 5 stars.  They took quite a while to get here too since they come from China.</li>
            <li> I had purchased gel heel socks that looked like this in the past. They had gel IN the socks. I was dissapointed that these did not.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband, who had terrible cracks in both heels. He puts some lotion on his feet first,then covers with the sock and wears overnight. They have healed up quite nicely. Do be careful walking around if you put extra lotion in them, the inside can be slippery!</li>
            <li> ripped as soon as I put them on. asking for refund</li>
            <li> I would not buy again.  The seams came apart when I washed them on the delicate cycle of my washing machine.  Inexpensive - yes.  Bargain - no.</li>
            <li> These are like using a pair of socks with the appropriate parts trimmed off. I thought the blue parts would protect from the moisture product from leaking out. It does not. Seriously, take a pair of socks, cut off to the ends and you have the same product. Plus, I am wearing them now and they are so tight I can feel the pulse in my foot.</li>
            <li> Took more than a month to arrive and doesnt do much for me.</li>
            <li> It looks good but too tight and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> great for using with lotion to help soften the skin on the heels</li>
            <li> Other than they are really tight, I really like these.</li>
            <li> The socks came in two different sizes! One was clearly for a child and I couldn&#x27;t even put it on my foot- the other fit perfectly -- Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and cushiony.  Nice to sleep in.</li>
            <li> Men need not apply unless you have tiny girl-feet.</li>
            <li> My Wife and i realy loves  this heel socks Thank You</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t appear to have any &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; benefits associated with them.  I guess they are good for wearing to bed with our heels slathered with cream.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get these socks!  I tried them on last night and they are way too small!!  I will NEVER be able to use them.  It is like they were made for a baby! This is the most disappointing purchase I have made from Amazon!  I couldn&#x27;t even get them both on and the one I finally did get on was so tight I had to take it off because my foot began to swell!!  I DO NOT RECOMEND THESE SOCKS AT ALL!  BIG WASTE OF MONEY!</li>
            <li> I wear these with my flip flop s....</li>
            <li> I have a size 9, wide foot and had no issues with these socks fitting.</li>
            <li> Contrary to blurb, does not fit larger than a small &amp;#34;medium.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Must be socks for a little girl.  Way too small for my feet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to review this product, but i can&#x27;t because I ordered the Gel Socks on 3/29 and they were supposed to arrive no later than 5/8/15.  hmmm, where could they be?&lt;br /&gt;So if you need them fast for those gross brittle dry heels you&#x27;re better off paying for the more expensive ones...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll let you know if they come and what they are like, cuz my &#x27;dogs&#x27; need some healin&#x27;</li>
            <li> These are nothing but socks!</li>
            <li> These are not gel lined. Yes they are cheap but might as well spend the extra $10 and get what you&#x27;re promised. They don&#x27;t do anything on yheir own you have to use cream, I could do that with any socks. The ones that really do have gel lining are awesome though</li>
            <li> i like these, helps my heels but are a little tight, can&#x27;t wear all night and i only wear a 6.</li>
            <li> As described fast shipping</li>
            <li> I just bought these a week ago.  I have used them about 4 nights and I have a noticeable difference in the cracks on my heels.  The socks are comfortable and love the cool gel feeling.  Before using them, by heels would snag on the sheets.  Now no more snagging.</li>
            <li> Made for people with tiny feet. There&#x27;s no \\&quot;gel\\&quot; in the heel either. This product is a rip-off!</li>
            <li> I used similar to these gel socks before,make heels soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom, not kidding,it&#x27;s a fact,bought 3pairs ,that&#x27;s how much they are super.</li>
            <li> Wayyyyyyyyyyyy tooooooo small, and I wear a size 7 shoe.</li>
            <li> Low quality but works as addvartising</li>
            <li> To me it cuts off circulation in my feet. It does not seem like it is helping the dryness. I thought the whole sock would be gel but like the name says- it is HEEL and def. heel only for the gel. i wore it once and haven&#x27;t since. I do not like it!</li>
            <li> They are NOT gel line - just a cotton heel of a sock.  Plus had to wait for it to be shipped from China- go to your local dollar store</li>
            <li> Good quality. I recommend to buy.</li>
            <li> Strangely, there was no gel in the heel of the sock.  They are just very tightly knitted heel socks.  All other gel socks I have purchased had a layer of gel material inside.  While they were cheap, they will not create the moisture needed to soften the heel.</li>
            <li> They are what I expected</li>
            <li> Have really helped keep the lotion on the feet to treat dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with dry and cracked heels for years. I am also a terrible example of responsibility for putting lotion on my heels before I go to bed at night. Here is the answer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These socklets have been the best thing since sliced bread for my feet. I can easily slip them on when I am hanging out the house watching TV and right before I climb into bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to slide on and off&lt;br /&gt;-Keep them by the bed, you won&#x27;t forget to wear them&lt;br /&gt;-Consistent wear has shown DRAMATIC improvements in my skin on my heels&lt;br /&gt;-No smell and they can easily be washed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-They fit just a little snug for people with big arches&lt;br /&gt;-Hard to walk around in, so not ideal for wearing while putsing around the house&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love these things. I bought three pairs just so I have them on hand.</li>
            <li> Too small and I don&#x27;t see anything special about it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s socks with the toes cut out...no gel heel, no gel any where!!</li>
            <li> I have one and my husband has a pair. We use them once a week and they work great.</li>
            <li> The only positive is that it did fit my feet and I wear a size 10. However, it did not work at all. It was the same as putting lotion on your feet and using a pair of socks. A waste of money!!</li>
            <li> the product does not hold up.</li>
            <li> Worked great! Heels feel awesome</li>
            <li> Not worth the wait. It is almost like you cut your own socks. I Thought there will be jelly padding, but there isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> i bought these for this girl I know who has nasty feet. They honestly work cause her feet aren&#x27;t nearly as gross now as they were.</li>
            <li> As soon as I put these in the wash they came apart. I do not recommend this product to anyone. It&#x27;s cheap and cheesy.</li>
            <li> suitable size and keeps my foot mosturized, in the morning it feels so silky</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great concept but they cut off the circulation to my feet when I sleep with them on and they did nothing for my dry cracked heels.</li>
            <li> After first time (sleep in socks) gel dismounted from the material. And that smell of roses - ughhhh</li>
            <li> No gel was inside this product. Horrible</li>
            <li> I could actually tell a difference after the first overnight wear.</li>
            <li> It really helped my dry feet</li>
            <li> love them.. but they wore out very fast and the stitching came apart after about 2 wears.. would reorder but it took forever for them to come in the first time..</li>
            <li> Works good for cracked heels but they are a tight.</li>
            <li> as advertised, and they work</li>
            <li> Makes heels of feet feel smooth when you wear them overnight...does nothing for the rest of the foot.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Fell apart when washed by hand</li>
            <li> it was the worst thing I ever purchase.  just a cut off sock!!!!!</li>
            <li> These do zero moisturizing - they&#x27;re just soft.</li>
            <li> The socks felt great when I had them on.  As far as helping with my dry skin, they have not helped.  Also, one of the socks came apart in the washer.</li>
            <li> Very small socks..good for Japanese girl.  Not good for 5&amp;#34;8 USA woman. Plus I paid $3.60 for a $2.60 item</li>
            <li> sorry to say no gel heels. And very very small. cost too much to ship back!</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and was satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> these are great...make my feet feel nice...</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift and I Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> use these last night with my cream and they really softened my heels....</li>
            <li> Took long time to get , [ for me ] , it helps on on my heels .</li>
            <li> No gel and very small</li>
            <li> I had to wait almost two months for these &amp;#34;socklets&amp;#34;. Granted I was informed of the delay when I first ordered them but of everything I&#x27;ve ordered from Amazon, this is the first time I&#x27;ve really had to wait the full time.  There were no wearing suggestions or cleaning tips included.  Are you supposed too wear at night?  Or during the day with shoes ?  How do I wash them?  How long are they supposed to last?  I did wear them one day-they were not comfortable and I did not notice them helping my heels. I will stick with &amp;#34;Baby&#x27;s Feet&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Very small. I won&#x27;t be able to use them.</li>
            <li> No gel whatsoever in these socks. Do not waste your time or your money.</li>
            <li> I think these are only to be worn at night. I wore them all day around the house the the rubber inside really started to peel. I have other gel socks but the gel is all over and it makes it hard to walk which is why I thought these would be a good choice. I think I would buy them again I would just limit the wear and tear and only wear them to bed if you can handle that.</li>
            <li> These socks are a bad  joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is NO gel on them, and they are too small even for me; I wear a size 7 1/2 shoe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon should not carry this product.</li>
            <li> These along with some Healtastic will change your life! Do it!</li>
            <li> It does not have plastic layer right on the heel to prevent the cream from absorbing by the socks</li>
            <li> Got these for my Mom. She&#x27;s a diabetic and her heels get so dry! These really do help, even without creams/lotions. They slide on easily, and stay put. She wears them as she sleeps, since she says she can feel the &amp;#34;line&amp;#34; where they stop before her toes if she&#x27;s wearing shoes.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give them 5 stars, but they are TINY. Luckily, Mom has tiny feet, so it works, but my big ol&#x27; clod-hopper feet would never fit in there. So, Mom doesn&#x27;t have to share, and she probably considers that worth 5 stars!</li>
            <li> No point to this product.  Does not cover the entire foot with leaving the toes exposed.</li>
            <li> I bought a pair for my sister , who has really dry heels, for Christmas and when my mom saw them she wanted them.  I promptly ordered another pair but when they came in they had NO GEL whatsoever.  Nothing.  Nada.  I then realized that the orders had been fulfilled by different sellers.  It was a disappointment, but my mom still liked that they were pretty tight and helped with her arthritis pain.  She uses her own moisturizer.  For the price, we didn&#x27;t think it was worth it to send them back, especially since she found them useful anyway.  I have no reports from my sister on whether the gel (which her socks did come with) has helped with her dry heels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is a good product, but the inconsistency between sellers is disappointing.  I clicked on the &amp;#34;Buy it again&amp;#34; button on My Orders page and I would have expected that clicking on it would take me to the same seller.  It doesn&#x27;t.  Even now it takes me to a different seller.  I don&#x27;t know how Amazon chooses the seller it is going to show you (by price?) but this was a lesson to pay attention to the seller because clearly the quality of the product you get depends on the seller (even though it appears to be the exact same product).</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this for anyone that has wide feet.  The sock fits very snuggly, it didn&#x27;t really stretch to fit. I had to remove them after a very short time due to being too tight and made my feet/ankles swell.</li>
            <li> Feel good on your feet, but they are made for tiny feet, thus I can&#x27;t get the full benefits from them.  Have to take them off after a short period because they are just too tight.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully on my heels!  And very comfortable to sleep in.  Will order more</li>
            <li> Perfect for after buffing</li>
            <li> They work!!! They are comfortable and work.  The heal cushion is so squishy and comfy.  Just what my poor heels needed.  Awwwwww</li>
            <li> I need these so badly but they are way to small for my big feet.  If you have medium to small feet they may work for you.</li>
            <li> They were a bit too tight for my husband who wears a size 9 shoe.  They did well for moisturizing.  The gel inside got very sticky and liquidy after wearing for a night but went back to a normal consistency when cooled.  I&#x27;d recommend these for ladies that wear smaller than a 8 1/2 size shoe or men that wear less than a 9.</li>
