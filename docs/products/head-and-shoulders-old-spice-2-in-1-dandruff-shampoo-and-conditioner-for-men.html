            <li>Even my girlfriend said she loved the smell.  </li>
            <li>Kind of the best of both worlds - the effectiveness of Head &amp; Shoulders combined with the delicious scent of Old Spice.</li>
            <li>Since using this shampoo, I&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;ve experienced fewer episodes of itchy scalp, and my hair looks and feels very clean.</li>
            <li>They smell quite good, far and away the best scented dandruff shampoos on the market, in my opinion.  </li>

            <li>This is no exception, but the combination of the shampoo and the Old Spice scent makes this perfect for guys of all ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and does a great job of keeping hair clean and free of dandruff.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is a great fit if you want your hair to be flake-free and smell fantastic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great fusion of two great brands that are sure to be popular for a long time.</li>
            <li>The Old Spice fragrance, by the way, is not in any way overwhelming, but muted and very pleasant.  </li>
            <li>top of that</li>
            <li>, I did try it out twice, mostly to see if it works.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly a more manly scent, so do keep that in mind.&lt;br</li>
            <li>4 star rated with 1 star removed because I don&#x27;t love the smell of it.</li>
            <li>My favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>My hair feels healthy and radiant after each use</li>
            <li>Many compliments of the spice, and really keeps my hair looking great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought this more than once.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>My kids love it.</li>
            <li>And, even better...</li>
            <li>No review is going to top the line: &amp;</li>
            <li>It really does smell great, the stuff works.  </li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s got my wife sniffing me a bit more these days...</li>
            <li>My husband is definitely enjoying washing with this product.</li>
            <li>All have smelled nice and do the job, clean hair with no flakes.</li>
            <li>Why it is that almost all shampoo makers now days think it&#x27;s appropriate to put strong perfumes in their shampoos is beyond me.  </li>
            <li>Bottom line - if you love the scent of Old Spice and needs some help with dandruff, this is a great option.</li>
            <li>Great shamoo with a old spice scent!  </li>
            <li>The smell is excellent, pure Old Spice, always my favorite.  </li>
            <li>None are offensive, and when the kids use it, or when I pilfer some for my hair, we&#x27;re all pretty happy in our mildly smelling flake free scalps.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>This Head &amp; Shoulders Old Spice is really very nice.  </li>
            <li>I would love to see this product in original scent as a 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li>The product is easy to use, though I did not do any tests to determine if it would stop dandruff.</li>
            <li>This is too strong.  </li>
            <li>Even my wife remarked how strong the odor was after I&#x27;d used it</li>
            <li>Some people react strongly to strong odors.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasant fragrance of Old Spice.&lt;br /&gt;5)</li>
            <li>This stuff is worth more than it&#x27;s weight in gold.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing sexy about this scent for me, it just brings a smile.</li>
            <li>My hair not only smells great</li>
            <li>but it feels clean too, light and manageable, not dried-out or flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works as well as normal Head and Shoulders with a nice scent.</li>
            <li>Five USEFUL Stars!</li>
            <li>Afterwards, I was very pleased with my hair - soft and manageable as one expects with a quality shampoo and</li>
            <li>Brilliant idea, marrying the functionality of Head and Shoulders with the epic manly scent of Old Spice.</li>
            <li>a shampoo product, I found this product to deliver rich, thick lather, rinses clean, and smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair looking great (or at least as good as it possibly can, good enough that my wife notices the difference), keeps my moderate to severe dandruff in check (no flakes and greatly reduces dryness and itching) and makes me smell more manly than ever before (and I&#x27;m already an Old Spice, original stick formula kind of guy).</li>
            <li>When I saw this on the Vine program, it was a good opportunity to try it again without the hassle of buying it in a store, trying it out, and having to go back to return it if dissatisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The claims are true; I don&#x27;t have dandruff anymore.</li>
            <li>Satisfaction guarantee: full refund with the return of the product and proof of purchase.)</li>
            <li>Second, it leaves the scalp feeling good -</li>
            <li>and he is currently loving this Old Spice scented formulation.</li>
            <li>First, the scent is right on so many levels - so pleasing.</li>
            <li>It smells nice for a short time, it does the work my husband has come to expect as a dandruff shampoo, it lathers up nicely but not to an extreme, and he is very satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>This new Head and Shoulders Old Spice scented dandruff shampoo is a great idea and really wins me</li>
            <li>And, even better it&#x27;s not an overpowering or overwhelming scent, regardless of it&#x27;s current incarnation, (deodorant, body wash, aftershave, etc.), or as I&#x27;ve picked up here, shampoo.</li>
            <li>shampoo seemed as effective as regular Head and Shoulders in controlling light dandruff.</li>
            <li>I recommend if you&#x27;re looking for a fast and easy solution to flakes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be the first to admit that I love the scent of old spice, it&#x27;s classic, clean, spicy, and just for lack of a better descriptive word, manly.</li>
            <li>Head and Shoulders gives me relief from itching, and love the old spice smell...great buy!</li>
            <li>I don’t know what caused that unexpected good benefit, but it’s certainly another positive.  </li>
            <li>The same great head and shoulders product with a slightly more masculine, yet subtle and pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>HEAD &amp; SHOULDERS OLD SPICE shampoo comes in a flask having a stylish shape.  </li>
            <li>Head &amp; Shoulders Men Old Spice Dandruff Shampoo is the latest in the H&amp;S line of products.</li>
            <li>and I have to say it put a smile on my face.</li>
            <li>It claims it &amp;#34;removes flakes, calms itching, relieves irritation reduces redness, fights dryness&amp;#34; and after 3 weeks of using this product, it appears this H&amp;S shampoo works as a dandruff shampoo, which was my only problem, and the Old Spice scent is very nice.</li>
            <li>In contrast, a round shampoo flask would not be able to fit so easily.  </li>
            <li>shampoo is sudsy and one of those that REALLY gets you hair clean.</li>
            <li>It smells great, leaves his hair feeling soft, and he doesn&#x27;t have to worry about flakes or dry scalp.</li>
            <li>It has some of what I remember as the old &amp;#34;Old Spice&amp;#34; fragrance to it, but it&#x27;s also got what seems to be the strong perfume odor I stopped using it because of.  </li>
            <li>Also, the price is very reasonable, as you would expect.</li>
            <li>First, a disclaimer.  </li>
            <li>This product is great if you don&#x27;t condition or use a secondary conditioner.  </li>
            <li>However, what is the point when the scent only hangs around for about an hour at the most?  </li>
            <li>Our family has used Head and Shoulders shampoos of various types for many years.</li>
            <li>The cap is large, so that it can be easily grasped easily when wet.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like Old Spice, Head &amp; Shoulders has other scents that may be more appealing to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li>Instead, it has the familiar scent associated with the Old Spice products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fan of Old Spice original scent product, and like the dandruff control of Head &amp; Shoulders.  </li>
            <li>, so I&#x27;m assuming this generation is reviving its popularity as it does offer a clean masculine scent.</li>
            <li>always, the active dandruff fighting ingredient is pyrithione zinc, effective and an approved</li>
            <li>This shampoo has the Old Spice scent which reminded me of my Dad who died at age 87 and was an ardent user even when I gifted him with more modern and expensive popular colonges and after shave.</li>
            <li>The flask is narrow, so that it will be able to fit on the corner shelf on your bathtub.</li>
            <li>When I had the opportunity to try my tried and true product with a hint of Old Spice fragrance added, I decided to give it a shot.  </li>
            <li>The same small amount generates a good lather that makes my hair feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I really like it, so can certainly recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li>They work very well.  </li>
            <li>Another plus is it doesn&#x27;t clash with his Polo cologne which has a much stronger scent.</li>
            <li>so you really get the benefit of your bargain.</li>
            <li>My son uses this on his hair, he has had issues with dandruff and this shampoo really helps</li>
            <li>This Head &amp; Shoulders Men Old Spice Dandruff Shampoo lathers reasonably well with just a small amount, and has a nice, mild scent</li>
            <li>Basically, this shampoo is the exact same as regular Head &amp; Shoulders, but it smells better.</li>
            <li>It works great and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>In fact, I wouldn&#x27;t use it regularly with my long hair, but my husband thought it was great for his short hair which he likes squeaky</li>
            <li>Overall, I love this product, particularly its new Old Spice smell.</li>
            <li>Unlike shampoo bottles from Clairol, which have caps that easily snap off to be lost, the cap on the HEAD &amp; SHOULDERS is very securely fastened to the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The OLD SPICE fragrance is subtle and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Third, it works up a good lather such that one really doesn&#x27;t need but a dab if one has very short hair as I do.</li>
            <li>For me, having a special man in my life using this product brings back fond memories of my Dad.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li>(the scent doesn&#x27;t really remind me of Old Spice</li>
            <li>And they smell pretty similar, even when the label suggests that the scent might be much different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>pretty much whichever is the scent du jour in the bulk shopping giant economy size.</li>
            <li>Seems to work identically to normal head &amp; shoulders.</li>
            <li>course, Old Spice has its own version of a regular shampoo, but with this combination he knows that, like all other Head and Shoulders shampoo products, this shampoo will help keep his dandruff under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last very long, but it is pleasant and just manly enough to separate it from the normal floral fragrance of the regular version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The Old Spice scent is definitely there, and it would have been very easy to go overkill and make it almost too powerful, but in this case it ends up being rather subtle.</li>
            <li>Head and Shoulders is well established as effective in successfully combating dandruff, but I had gave up on using it years ago -- driven away by the harsh unpleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>And they&#x27;re all pretty similar.  </li>
            <li>it meets all of the other aforementioned criteria, but I don&#x27;t love the scent.  </li>
            <li>Although I have never took any scientific interest in the chemistry of cosmetics and soaps, for those who are interested, there are several publications on the efficacy of PYRITHIONE ZINC in stopping dandruff.</li>
            <li>I am rapidly balding, and keep my hair cut pretty short</li>
            <li>Head and Shoulders with Old Spice scent?!?</li>
            <li>However I was surprised it was selected for this new scent shampoo</li>
            <li>It contains the same active ingredient 1% Pyrithione Zinc and is as effective as the regular H&amp;S products that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>In past years, I used to use Head and Shoulders, but stopped mainly because of the strong perfume they started using.  </li>
            <li>Amazingly, my head actually itches slightly, but constantly, since using it both times.  </li>
            <li>It really smells like Old Spice, and it has enough conditioning to make my boyfriend&#x27;s hair soft and smooth without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>Thick and green, but it smells GREAT.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s my least favorite scent of the H&amp;S products that I&#x27;ve tried so far.  </li>
            <li>He has everything else Old Spice, so this completes the set.</li>
            <li>compared ingredients to a 2-in-1 Head &amp; Shoulders and have near identical ingredients.</li>
            <li>He went out of his mind when he saw that they added Old Spice to it</li>
            <li>One advantage, a complete surprise, is that it succeeded in putting some unruly hair, which had been sticking out of place, in place.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m never tempted to try the old comb over move with my hair.  </li>
            <li>When I saw the Old Spice Head and Shoulders being offered, I had to try it.</li>
            <li>I started using Old Spice aftershave when I started shaving over 45 years ago.  </li>
            <li>your grandfather wasn&#x27;t wearing Old Spice, you wouldn&#x27;t be here&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Old spice head and shoulders?</li>
            <li>(Though I really fervently hope and wish this will become the scent du jour in the giant bottle size because I just never want to run out!!!)</li>
            <li>My husband won&#x27;t use old spice but he did use this</li>
            <li>What an improvement on an old, dependable anti-dandruff product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;All-in-all, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the Head &amp; Shoulders Old Spice dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li>The Head and Shoulders Old Spice Shampoo has a lot of scent in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Since my husband uses Head and Shoulders Shampoo and Old Spice Products</li>
            <li>This one has the added muted scent of classic Old Spice cologne which appears to stay within the personal space of 2-3 feet and which adds to the feeling of being refreshed after shampooing.</li>
            <li>He says he doesn&#x27;t think it helped all that much for the dandruff from the old dry weather</li>
            <li>This is essentially the same great H&amp;S product but without the weird chemical-medicinal smell.</li>
            <li>My dad used this shampoo and said it smelled nice, but it was no better at fighting dandruff than any other shampoo he has ever used.</li>
            <li>As far as the dandruff shampoo goes, it contains the expected 1% pyrithione zinc as the active ingredient that is in all of the H&amp;S dandruff shampoo products, and it has the 100% guarantee of making the user&#x27;s hair flake free.</li>
            <li>(Head &amp; Shoulders Old Spice Pyrithione zinc dandruff shampoo in a plastic 13.5 fluid ounces/400 mL squeeze bottle.</li>
            <li>the guy in Old Spice commercial talks about when he says ---&amp;#34;if</li>
            <li>Yes, this Head &amp; Shoulders Men Old Spice Dandruff Shampoo works just as well as all the Head &amp; Shoulders formulations have worked for my husband when talking about reducing or totally eliminating dandruff flakes and itchy scalp.  </li>
            <li>Yes, this specific formula does have that distinctive Old Spice scent.  </li>
            <li>Probably not since he can only wear Old Spice products when he uses this shampoo and he likes to switch the deodorant, after shave and cologne scents he uses.</li>
            <li>Since the active ingredient is 1% Pyrithione Zinc it should be effective in relieving dandruff with regular daily use or at least using twice a week.</li>
            <li>Without sounding overly weird, I love the old spice scent, it reminds me of my Dad.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this more than once.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> My kids love it.</li>
            <li> And, even better...</li>
            <li> No review is going to top the line: &amp;</li>
            <li> It really does smell great, the stuff works.  </li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s got my wife sniffing me a bit more these days...</li>
            <li> My husband is definitely enjoying washing with this product.</li>
            <li> All have smelled nice and do the job, clean hair with no flakes.</li>
            <li> Why it is that almost all shampoo makers now days think it&#x27;s appropriate to put strong perfumes in their shampoos is beyond me.  </li>
            <li> Bottom line - if you love the scent of Old Spice and needs some help with dandruff, this is a great option.</li>
            <li> Great shamoo with a old spice scent!  </li>
            <li> The smell is excellent, pure Old Spice, always my favorite.  </li>
            <li> None are offensive, and when the kids use it, or when I pilfer some for my hair, we&#x27;re all pretty happy in our mildly smelling flake free scalps.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> This Head &amp; Shoulders Old Spice is really very nice.  </li>
            <li> I would love to see this product in original scent as a 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> The product is easy to use, though I did not do any tests to determine if it would stop dandruff.</li>
            <li> This is too strong.  </li>
            <li> Even my wife remarked how strong the odor was after I&#x27;d used it</li>
            <li> Some people react strongly to strong odors.  </li>
            <li> It has a pleasant fragrance of Old Spice.&lt;br /&gt;5)</li>
            <li> This stuff is worth more than it&#x27;s weight in gold.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing sexy about this scent for me, it just brings a smile.</li>
            <li> My hair not only smells great</li>
            <li> but it feels clean too, light and manageable, not dried-out or flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works as well as normal Head and Shoulders with a nice scent.</li>
            <li> Five USEFUL Stars!</li>
            <li> Afterwards, I was very pleased with my hair - soft and manageable as one expects with a quality shampoo and</li>
            <li> Brilliant idea, marrying the functionality of Head and Shoulders with the epic manly scent of Old Spice.</li>
            <li> a shampoo product, I found this product to deliver rich, thick lather, rinses clean, and smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair looking great (or at least as good as it possibly can, good enough that my wife notices the difference), keeps my moderate to severe dandruff in check (no flakes and greatly reduces dryness and itching) and makes me smell more manly than ever before (and I&#x27;m already an Old Spice, original stick formula kind of guy).</li>
            <li> When I saw this on the Vine program, it was a good opportunity to try it again without the hassle of buying it in a store, trying it out, and having to go back to return it if dissatisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The claims are true; I don&#x27;t have dandruff anymore.</li>
            <li> Satisfaction guarantee: full refund with the return of the product and proof of purchase.)</li>
            <li> Second, it leaves the scalp feeling good -</li>
            <li> and he is currently loving this Old Spice scented formulation.</li>
            <li> First, the scent is right on so many levels - so pleasing.</li>
            <li> It smells nice for a short time, it does the work my husband has come to expect as a dandruff shampoo, it lathers up nicely but not to an extreme, and he is very satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li> This new Head and Shoulders Old Spice scented dandruff shampoo is a great idea and really wins me</li>
            <li> And, even better it&#x27;s not an overpowering or overwhelming scent, regardless of it&#x27;s current incarnation, (deodorant, body wash, aftershave, etc.), or as I&#x27;ve picked up here, shampoo.</li>
            <li> shampoo seemed as effective as regular Head and Shoulders in controlling light dandruff.</li>
            <li> I recommend if you&#x27;re looking for a fast and easy solution to flakes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be the first to admit that I love the scent of old spice, it&#x27;s classic, clean, spicy, and just for lack of a better descriptive word, manly.</li>
            <li> Head and Shoulders gives me relief from itching, and love the old spice smell...great buy!</li>
            <li> I don’t know what caused that unexpected good benefit, but it’s certainly another positive.  </li>
            <li> The same great head and shoulders product with a slightly more masculine, yet subtle and pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li> HEAD &amp; SHOULDERS OLD SPICE shampoo comes in a flask having a stylish shape.  </li>
            <li> Head &amp; Shoulders Men Old Spice Dandruff Shampoo is the latest in the H&amp;S line of products.</li>
            <li> and I have to say it put a smile on my face.</li>
            <li> It claims it &amp;#34;removes flakes, calms itching, relieves irritation reduces redness, fights dryness&amp;#34; and after 3 weeks of using this product, it appears this H&amp;S shampoo works as a dandruff shampoo, which was my only problem, and the Old Spice scent is very nice.</li>
            <li> In contrast, a round shampoo flask would not be able to fit so easily.  </li>
            <li> shampoo is sudsy and one of those that REALLY gets you hair clean.</li>
            <li> It smells great, leaves his hair feeling soft, and he doesn&#x27;t have to worry about flakes or dry scalp.</li>
            <li> It has some of what I remember as the old &amp;#34;Old Spice&amp;#34; fragrance to it, but it&#x27;s also got what seems to be the strong perfume odor I stopped using it because of.  </li>
            <li> Also, the price is very reasonable, as you would expect.</li>
            <li> First, a disclaimer.  </li>
            <li> This product is great if you don&#x27;t condition or use a secondary conditioner.  </li>
            <li> However, what is the point when the scent only hangs around for about an hour at the most?  </li>
            <li> Our family has used Head and Shoulders shampoos of various types for many years.</li>
            <li> The cap is large, so that it can be easily grasped easily when wet.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like Old Spice, Head &amp; Shoulders has other scents that may be more appealing to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> Instead, it has the familiar scent associated with the Old Spice products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Old Spice original scent product, and like the dandruff control of Head &amp; Shoulders.  </li>
            <li> , so I&#x27;m assuming this generation is reviving its popularity as it does offer a clean masculine scent.</li>
            <li> always, the active dandruff fighting ingredient is pyrithione zinc, effective and an approved</li>
            <li> This shampoo has the Old Spice scent which reminded me of my Dad who died at age 87 and was an ardent user even when I gifted him with more modern and expensive popular colonges and after shave.</li>
            <li> The flask is narrow, so that it will be able to fit on the corner shelf on your bathtub.</li>
            <li> When I had the opportunity to try my tried and true product with a hint of Old Spice fragrance added, I decided to give it a shot.  </li>
            <li> The same small amount generates a good lather that makes my hair feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I really like it, so can certainly recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> They work very well.  </li>
            <li> Another plus is it doesn&#x27;t clash with his Polo cologne which has a much stronger scent.</li>
            <li> so you really get the benefit of your bargain.</li>
            <li> My son uses this on his hair, he has had issues with dandruff and this shampoo really helps</li>
            <li> This Head &amp; Shoulders Men Old Spice Dandruff Shampoo lathers reasonably well with just a small amount, and has a nice, mild scent</li>
            <li> Basically, this shampoo is the exact same as regular Head &amp; Shoulders, but it smells better.</li>
            <li> It works great and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> In fact, I wouldn&#x27;t use it regularly with my long hair, but my husband thought it was great for his short hair which he likes squeaky</li>
            <li> Overall, I love this product, particularly its new Old Spice smell.</li>
            <li> Unlike shampoo bottles from Clairol, which have caps that easily snap off to be lost, the cap on the HEAD &amp; SHOULDERS is very securely fastened to the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The OLD SPICE fragrance is subtle and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> Third, it works up a good lather such that one really doesn&#x27;t need but a dab if one has very short hair as I do.</li>
            <li> For me, having a special man in my life using this product brings back fond memories of my Dad.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li> (the scent doesn&#x27;t really remind me of Old Spice</li>
            <li> And they smell pretty similar, even when the label suggests that the scent might be much different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> pretty much whichever is the scent du jour in the bulk shopping giant economy size.</li>
            <li> Seems to work identically to normal head &amp; shoulders.</li>
            <li> course, Old Spice has its own version of a regular shampoo, but with this combination he knows that, like all other Head and Shoulders shampoo products, this shampoo will help keep his dandruff under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last very long, but it is pleasant and just manly enough to separate it from the normal floral fragrance of the regular version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The Old Spice scent is definitely there, and it would have been very easy to go overkill and make it almost too powerful, but in this case it ends up being rather subtle.</li>
            <li> Head and Shoulders is well established as effective in successfully combating dandruff, but I had gave up on using it years ago -- driven away by the harsh unpleasant scent.  </li>
            <li> And they&#x27;re all pretty similar.  </li>
            <li> it meets all of the other aforementioned criteria, but I don&#x27;t love the scent.  </li>
            <li> Although I have never took any scientific interest in the chemistry of cosmetics and soaps, for those who are interested, there are several publications on the efficacy of PYRITHIONE ZINC in stopping dandruff.</li>
            <li> I am rapidly balding, and keep my hair cut pretty short</li>
            <li> Head and Shoulders with Old Spice scent?!?</li>
            <li> However I was surprised it was selected for this new scent shampoo</li>
            <li> It contains the same active ingredient 1% Pyrithione Zinc and is as effective as the regular H&amp;S products that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> In past years, I used to use Head and Shoulders, but stopped mainly because of the strong perfume they started using.  </li>
            <li> Amazingly, my head actually itches slightly, but constantly, since using it both times.  </li>
            <li> It really smells like Old Spice, and it has enough conditioning to make my boyfriend&#x27;s hair soft and smooth without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Thick and green, but it smells GREAT.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s my least favorite scent of the H&amp;S products that I&#x27;ve tried so far.  </li>
            <li> He has everything else Old Spice, so this completes the set.</li>
            <li> compared ingredients to a 2-in-1 Head &amp; Shoulders and have near identical ingredients.</li>
            <li> He went out of his mind when he saw that they added Old Spice to it</li>
            <li> One advantage, a complete surprise, is that it succeeded in putting some unruly hair, which had been sticking out of place, in place.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m never tempted to try the old comb over move with my hair.  </li>
            <li> When I saw the Old Spice Head and Shoulders being offered, I had to try it.</li>
            <li> I started using Old Spice aftershave when I started shaving over 45 years ago.  </li>
            <li> your grandfather wasn&#x27;t wearing Old Spice, you wouldn&#x27;t be here&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Old spice head and shoulders?</li>
            <li> (Though I really fervently hope and wish this will become the scent du jour in the giant bottle size because I just never want to run out!!!)</li>
            <li> My husband won&#x27;t use old spice but he did use this</li>
            <li> What an improvement on an old, dependable anti-dandruff product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;All-in-all, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the Head &amp; Shoulders Old Spice dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> The Head and Shoulders Old Spice Shampoo has a lot of scent in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Since my husband uses Head and Shoulders Shampoo and Old Spice Products</li>
            <li> This one has the added muted scent of classic Old Spice cologne which appears to stay within the personal space of 2-3 feet and which adds to the feeling of being refreshed after shampooing.</li>
            <li> He says he doesn&#x27;t think it helped all that much for the dandruff from the old dry weather</li>
            <li> This is essentially the same great H&amp;S product but without the weird chemical-medicinal smell.</li>
            <li> My dad used this shampoo and said it smelled nice, but it was no better at fighting dandruff than any other shampoo he has ever used.</li>
            <li> As far as the dandruff shampoo goes, it contains the expected 1% pyrithione zinc as the active ingredient that is in all of the H&amp;S dandruff shampoo products, and it has the 100% guarantee of making the user&#x27;s hair flake free.</li>
            <li> (Head &amp; Shoulders Old Spice Pyrithione zinc dandruff shampoo in a plastic 13.5 fluid ounces/400 mL squeeze bottle.</li>
            <li> the guy in Old Spice commercial talks about when he says ---&amp;#34;if</li>
            <li> Yes, this Head &amp; Shoulders Men Old Spice Dandruff Shampoo works just as well as all the Head &amp; Shoulders formulations have worked for my husband when talking about reducing or totally eliminating dandruff flakes and itchy scalp.  </li>
            <li> Yes, this specific formula does have that distinctive Old Spice scent.  </li>
            <li> Probably not since he can only wear Old Spice products when he uses this shampoo and he likes to switch the deodorant, after shave and cologne scents he uses.</li>
            <li> Since the active ingredient is 1% Pyrithione Zinc it should be effective in relieving dandruff with regular daily use or at least using twice a week.</li>
            <li> Without sounding overly weird, I love the old spice scent, it reminds me of my Dad.</li>
            <li> It sort of smells like Old Spice, but not exactly.  </li>
            <li> And has gone through the H&amp;S scent stages, classic, zesty citrus, green apple,</li>
            <li> husband has always used head n shoulders, as long as I&#x27;ve known him, (a reeeeeaaaallllyyy long time).</li>
            <li> described, this shampoo definitely smells like Old Spice out of the bottle and a slight fragrance of Old Spice lingers in his hair for at least a couple of hours after his shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to &amp;#34;wear&amp;#34; this odor for several hours after washing my hair, nor do I want the sinus issues that come with it due to the &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; in the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t currently have a dandruff problem, so being a fan of moderation in all things chemical or medicinal, I&#x27;ll mix in use of this Head and Shoulders for about every other shampooing, or to get the recommended treatment about twice a week.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find anything at fault with this particular Head &amp; Shoulders formulation.</li>
            <li> Without a dandruff shampoo, I occasionally flake due to a dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> and my hair had already been dry for a while.  </li>
            <li> It treats and nourishes my dry</li>
            <li> It lathers well, didn&#x27;t dry out his hair and does keep its fragrance in the hair, but not overly so.</li>
            <li> At any rate the active anti-dandruff ingredient is PYRITHIONE ZINC.</li>
            <li> We all breath a little deeper when the steam wafts from the doorway.</li>
            <li> At least some laundry detergent manufacturers have figured it out - they sell &amp;#34;free and clear&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> But despite the apparent reduction in flaking, the addition of constant itching and a few hours of putting up with the awful smell is not a good trade-off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the girly stuff that my wife uses, but can&#x27;t stand the smell, at least on me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the anticipated scent of Old Spice was just not there which was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> , this is a game changer.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t drive my cats mad with glee the way T-Gel does.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not at all unpleasant or objectionable, nor is it overpowering.  </li>
            <li> but he says the scent isn&#x27;t as bad as he thought it was before.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is essentially the same great H&amp;S product but without the weird chemical-medicinal smell. Instead, it has the familiar scent associated with the Old Spice products. The scent is pleasant and not overpowering at all. It contains the same active ingredient 1% Pyrithione Zinc and is as effective as the regular H&amp;S products that I&#x27;ve used. The content is creamy white and has the same consistency as regular H&amp;S. The same small amount generates a good lather that makes my hair feel fresh and clean. Overall, I love this product, particularly its new Old Spice smell.</li>
            <li> This Head &amp; Shoulders Men Old Spice Dandruff Shampoo lathers reasonably well with just a small amount, and has a nice, mild scent (the scent doesn&#x27;t really remind me of Old Spice but it&#x27;s a good scent).  Since using this shampoo, I&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;ve experienced fewer episodes of itchy scalp, and my hair looks and feels very clean.</li>
            <li> In past years, I used to use Head and Shoulders, but stopped mainly because of the strong perfume they started using.  When I saw this on the Vine program, it was a good opportunity to try it again without the hassle of buying it in a store, trying it out, and having to go back to return it if dissatisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I&#x27;m dissatisfied.  It has some of what I remember as the old &amp;#34;Old Spice&amp;#34; fragrance to it, but it&#x27;s also got what seems to be the strong perfume odor I stopped using it because of.  This is too strong.  Even my wife remarked how strong the odor was after I&#x27;d used it and my hair had already been dry for a while.  Why it is that almost all shampoo makers now days think it&#x27;s appropriate to put strong perfumes in their shampoos is beyond me.  Some people react strongly to strong odors.  At least some laundry detergent manufacturers have figured it out - they sell &amp;#34;free and clear&amp;#34; products that have no odor.  I don&#x27;t want to &amp;#34;wear&amp;#34; this odor for several hours after washing my hair, nor do I want the sinus issues that come with it due to the &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; in the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of that, I did try it out twice, mostly to see if it works.  Amazingly, my head actually itches slightly, but constantly, since using it both times.  Bring back the Head and Shoulders of 20+ years ago, and I&#x27;ll buy it again.  But despite the apparent reduction in flaking, the addition of constant itching and a few hours of putting up with the awful smell is not a good trade-off.</li>
            <li> It really smells like Old Spice, and it has enough conditioning to make my boyfriend&#x27;s hair soft and smooth without weighing it down. He has everything else Old Spice, so this completes the set.</li>
            <li> My dad used this shampoo and said it smelled nice, but it was no better at fighting dandruff than any other shampoo he has ever used. Basically, this shampoo is the exact same as regular Head &amp; Shoulders, but it smells better.</li>
            <li> smells great and he likes it</li>
            <li> Thick and green, but it smells GREAT. Brilliant idea, marrying the functionality of Head and Shoulders with the epic manly scent of Old Spice. I really enjoyed using this shampoo, it worked great and it smelled great. Best variation of Head and Shoulders yet!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve reviewed a number of Head &amp; Shoulders shampoos recently.  And they&#x27;re all pretty similar.  They work very well.  They smell quite good, far and away the best scented dandruff shampoos on the market, in my opinion.  They&#x27;re well-priced.  And they smell pretty similar, even when the label suggests that the scent might be much different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well this one definitely smells different from the others.  It sort of smells like Old Spice, but not exactly.  It&#x27;s certainly a more manly scent, so do keep that in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it meets all of the other aforementioned criteria, but I don&#x27;t love the scent.  It&#x27;s not at all unpleasant or objectionable, nor is it overpowering.  But it&#x27;s my least favorite scent of the H&amp;S products that I&#x27;ve tried so far.  4 star rated with 1 star removed because I don&#x27;t love the smell of it.</li>
            <li> Works as well as normal Head and Shoulders with a nice scent. I like it and my kids like using it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that Head and Shoulders does a nice job of keeping my scalp nice so I have not had a dandruff problem in years. This is no exception, but the combination of the shampoo and the Old Spice scent makes this perfect for guys of all ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo. The claims are true; I don&#x27;t have dandruff anymore. Also I have a feeling the conditioner is in there already even if it doesn&#x27;t say so....compared ingredients to a 2-in-1 Head &amp; Shoulders and have near identical ingredients.</li>
            <li> My nephew will only use Head and Shoulders. He went out of his mind when he saw that they added Old Spice to it LoL! He loves it!</li>
            <li> Some of the features are as follows:-&lt;br /&gt;1) It cleanses my hair.&lt;br /&gt;2) It is effective in wiping out 99% of dandruff flakes from hair.&lt;br /&gt;3) It treats and nourishes my dry scalp.&lt;br /&gt;4) It has a pleasant fragrance of Old Spice.&lt;br /&gt;5) My hair feels healthy and radiant after each use</li>
            <li> This shampoo has the Old Spice scent which reminded me of my Dad who died at age 87 and was an ardent user even when I gifted him with more modern and expensive popular colonges and after shave. However I was surprised it was selected for this new scent shampoo, so I&#x27;m assuming this generation is reviving its popularity as it does offer a clean masculine scent. It lathers well, didn&#x27;t dry out his hair and does keep its fragrance in the hair, but not overly so. Since the active ingredient is 1% Pyrithione Zinc it should be effective in relieving dandruff with regular daily use or at least using twice a week. For me, having a special man in my life using this product brings back fond memories of my Dad. Another plus is it doesn&#x27;t clash with his Polo cologne which has a much stronger scent.</li>
            <li> Great shamoo with a old spice scent!  I have eczema of the scalp, and have tried a ton of shampoos..Head and Shoulders gives me relief from itching, and love the old spice smell...great buy!</li>
            <li> Many compliments of the spice, and really keeps my hair looking great</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shampoo and won&#x27;t settle for anything else. It smells great, leaves his hair feeling soft, and he doesn&#x27;t have to worry about flakes or dry scalp. It works great and a little goes a long way so you really get the benefit of your bargain.</li>
            <li> This stuff is worth more than it&#x27;s weight in gold. It smells amazing and does a great job of keeping hair clean and free of dandruff. I&#x27;ve bought this more than once.</li>
            <li> HEAD &amp; SHOULDERS OLD SPICE shampoo comes in a flask having a stylish shape.  The flask is narrow, so that it will be able to fit on the corner shelf on your bathtub. In contrast, a round shampoo flask would not be able to fit so easily.  The cap is large, so that it can be easily grasped easily when wet. Unlike shampoo bottles from Clairol, which have caps that easily snap off to be lost, the cap on the HEAD &amp; SHOULDERS is very securely fastened to the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The OLD SPICE fragrance is subtle and not overpowering.  The product is easy to use, though I did not do any tests to determine if it would stop dandruff. At any rate the active anti-dandruff ingredient is PYRITHIONE ZINC. Although I have never took any scientific interest in the chemistry of cosmetics and soaps, for those who are interested, there are several publications on the efficacy of PYRITHIONE ZINC in stopping dandruff. See, for example, Draelos, ZD, et al (2005) J. Investig. Dermatol. Symp. Proc. 10:201-204; Schwartz, JR, et al (2013) Int. J. Cosmet. Sci. 35:381-387; and Bacon, RA, et al. (2014) J. Dermatolog. Treat. 25:237-240.</li>
            <li> Head &amp; Shoulders Men Old Spice Dandruff Shampoo is the latest in the H&amp;S line of products. This one has the added muted scent of classic Old Spice cologne which appears to stay within the personal space of 2-3 feet and which adds to the feeling of being refreshed after shampooing. As far as the dandruff shampoo goes, it contains the expected 1% pyrithione zinc as the active ingredient that is in all of the H&amp;S dandruff shampoo products, and it has the 100% guarantee of making the user&#x27;s hair flake free. It claims it &amp;#34;removes flakes, calms itching, relieves irritation reduces redness, fights dryness&amp;#34; and after 3 weeks of using this product, it appears this H&amp;S shampoo works as a dandruff shampoo, which was my only problem, and the Old Spice scent is very nice. Highly Recommended. Five USEFUL Stars! (Head &amp; Shoulders Old Spice Pyrithione zinc dandruff shampoo in a plastic 13.5 fluid ounces/400 mL squeeze bottle. Satisfaction guarantee: full refund with the return of the product and proof of purchase.)</li>
            <li> The same great head and shoulders product with a slightly more masculine, yet subtle and pleasant scent.  Even my girlfriend said she loved the smell.  Without a dandruff shampoo, I occasionally flake due to a dry scalp.  This works great and I&#x27;ve had no problems with dandruff using this H&amp;S product.</li>
            <li> This Head &amp; Shoulders Old Spice is really very nice.  The smell is excellent, pure Old Spice, always my favorite.  The results on my hair were also excellent; I’m impressed.  Hair looks very good with a lot of life and no itching.  One advantage, a complete surprise, is that it succeeded in putting some unruly hair, which had been sticking out of place, in place.  I don’t know what caused that unexpected good benefit, but it’s certainly another positive.  I really like it, so can certainly recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> Smells great and is a great product. My son uses this on his hair, he has had issues with dandruff and this shampoo really helps</li>
            <li> First, a disclaimer.  I am rapidly balding, and keep my hair cut pretty short so I&#x27;m never tempted to try the old comb over move with my hair.  That said, I still have to wash my hair, and I do not like my shampoos that I have tried. I&#x27;ve used the girly stuff that my wife uses, but can&#x27;t stand the smell, at least on me.  When I saw the Old Spice Head and Shoulders being offered, I had to try it. I&#x27;ve had Head and Shoulders in my gym bag for years, and it works well for me.  I started using Old Spice aftershave when I started shaving over 45 years ago.  My father used it, and my grandfather used it.  I&#x27;m the person the guy in Old Spice commercial talks about when he says ---&amp;#34;if your grandfather wasn&#x27;t wearing Old Spice, you wouldn&#x27;t be here&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo works great, I like how it smells, and I will buy it again when this runs out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Old Spice original scent product, and like the dandruff control of Head &amp; Shoulders.  This product is great if you don&#x27;t condition or use a secondary conditioner.  I would love to see this product in original scent as a 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> All men should try this, best shampoo youll try ever. Among all the h&amp;s versions, this is definitivelly the best</li>
            <li> Smells great definently will buy again</li>
            <li> It makes your hair smell &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; but it is a great inexpensive dandruff shampoo.  I recommend if you&#x27;re looking for a fast and easy solution to flakes.</li>
            <li> Yes, this Head &amp; Shoulders Men Old Spice Dandruff Shampoo works just as well as all the Head &amp; Shoulders formulations have worked for my husband when talking about reducing or totally eliminating dandruff flakes and itchy scalp.  Once you find out that Head &amp; Shoulders works for you it is to be hoped that it will always work on the dandruff and flakes problem.  Yes, this specific formula does have that distinctive Old Spice scent.  However, what is the point when the scent only hangs around for about an hour at the most?  It smells nice for a short time, it does the work my husband has come to expect as a dandruff shampoo, it lathers up nicely but not to an extreme, and he is very satisfied with it.  Will we buy it now that he has tried it?  Probably not since he can only wear Old Spice products when he uses this shampoo and he likes to switch the deodorant, after shave and cologne scents he uses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be the first to admit that I love the scent of old spice, it&#x27;s classic, clean, spicy, and just for lack of a better descriptive word, manly. It just is. And, even better it&#x27;s not an overpowering or overwhelming scent, regardless of it&#x27;s current incarnation, (deodorant, body wash, aftershave, etc.), or as I&#x27;ve picked up here, shampoo. It is distinctive, but hasn&#x27;t had anyone suffering scent sensitivity, or gagging from the fumes.&lt;br /&gt;My husband has always used head n shoulders, as long as I&#x27;ve known him, (a reeeeeaaaallllyyy long time). And has gone through the H&amp;S scent stages, classic, zesty citrus, green apple, pretty much whichever is the scent du jour in the bulk shopping giant economy size. All have smelled nice and do the job, clean hair with no flakes. None are offensive, and when the kids use it, or when I pilfer some for my hair, we&#x27;re all pretty happy in our mildly smelling flake free scalps.&lt;br /&gt;But, this is a game changer. Old spice head and shoulders? We have reached bathroom scented harmony. I love it. He loves it. My kids love it. We all breath a little deeper when the steam wafts from the doorway. And, even better... the price is comparable with the giant economy size. (Though I really fervently hope and wish this will become the scent du jour in the giant bottle size because I just never want to run out!!!)</li>
            <li> This shampoo is a winner, no doubt. First, the scent is right on so many levels - so pleasing. Second, it leaves the scalp feeling good - I didn&#x27;t sense dryness or itching. Third, it works up a good lather such that one really doesn&#x27;t need but a dab if one has very short hair as I do.</li>
            <li> Without sounding overly weird, I love the old spice scent, it reminds me of my Dad. My husband won&#x27;t use old spice but he did use this and I have to say it put a smile on my face. There&#x27;s nothing sexy about this scent for me, it just brings a smile. He says he doesn&#x27;t think it helped all that much for the dandruff from the old dry weather we&#x27;ve had but he says the scent isn&#x27;t as bad as he thought it was before.</li>
            <li> Head and Shoulders is well established as effective in successfully combating dandruff, but I had gave up on using it years ago -- driven away by the harsh unpleasant scent.  This new Head and Shoulders Old Spice scented dandruff shampoo is a great idea and really wins me over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, the active dandruff fighting ingredient is pyrithione zinc, effective and an approved over-the-counter antifungal/antibacterial agent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a shampoo product, I found this product to deliver rich, thick lather, rinses clean, and smells wonderful.  The Old Spice fragrance, by the way, is not in any way overwhelming, but muted and very pleasant.  I also chose to use a separate (different branded) post-shampoo conditioner.  Afterwards, I was very pleased with my hair - soft and manageable as one expects with a quality shampoo and conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t currently have a dandruff problem, so being a fan of moderation in all things chemical or medicinal, I&#x27;ll mix in use of this Head and Shoulders for about every other shampooing, or to get the recommended treatment about twice a week.</li>
            <li> No review is going to top the line: &amp;#34;my hair smells like Unicorns farted rainbows--manly rainbows.&amp;#34; so why try?  It really does smell great, the stuff works.  Excellent product.  Buy it. Listen to Eric.</li>
            <li> I wondered how this would work--Head and Shoulders with Old Spice scent?!? Can they make dandruff shampoo smell like aftershave? Yes, they can and they have. What an improvement on an old, dependable anti-dandruff product. This shampoo is a great fit if you want your hair to be flake-free and smell fantastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find anything at fault with this particular Head &amp; Shoulders formulation. It leaves my hair looking great (or at least as good as it possibly can, good enough that my wife notices the difference), keeps my moderate to severe dandruff in check (no flakes and greatly reduces dryness and itching) and makes me smell more manly than ever before (and I&#x27;m already an Old Spice, original stick formula kind of guy). The Old Spice scent is definitely there, and it would have been very easy to go overkill and make it almost too powerful, but in this case it ends up being rather subtle. My hair not only smells great (it&#x27;s got my wife sniffing me a bit more these days...big plus), but it feels clean too, light and manageable, not dried-out or flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the Head &amp; Shoulders Old Spice dandruff shampoo. It manages to take two products I already use and merge them into something that truly brings the best of both together in one product.</li>
            <li> Seems to work identically to normal head &amp; shoulders. Smells a bit like aftershave. Doesn&#x27;t drive my cats mad with glee the way T-Gel does.</li>
            <li> Kind of the best of both worlds - the effectiveness of Head &amp; Shoulders combined with the delicious scent of Old Spice. What&#x27;s not to like?? Also, the price is very reasonable, as you would expect. Bottom line - if you love the scent of Old Spice and needs some help with dandruff, this is a great option. If you don&#x27;t like Old Spice, Head &amp; Shoulders has other scents that may be more appealing to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> The Head and Shoulders Old Spice Shampoo has a lot of scent in the shower.  If you are scent-sensitive you might want to skip this variety and stick to regular H&amp;S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is sudsy and one of those that REALLY gets you hair clean. In fact, I wouldn&#x27;t use it regularly with my long hair, but my husband thought it was great for his short hair which he likes squeaky clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo seemed as effective as regular Head and Shoulders in controlling light dandruff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo for over a year now.  When I had the opportunity to try my tried and true product with a hint of Old Spice fragrance added, I decided to give it a shot.  The fragrance is just enough.  It doesn&#x27;t last very long, but it is pleasant and just manly enough to separate it from the normal floral fragrance of the regular version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this shampoo.</li>
            <li> my son loves the smell</li>
            <li> Since my husband uses Head and Shoulders Shampoo and Old Spice Products I thought he would like using this product. He says that the shampoos delivers as it always does by cleaning his hair and keeping the dandruff away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the anticipated scent of Old Spice was just not there which was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Our family has used Head and Shoulders shampoos of various types for many years. My husband was especially excited to get this product and he is currently loving this Old Spice scented formulation. Of course, he is also getting excellent results controlling his dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As described, this shampoo definitely smells like Old Spice out of the bottle and a slight fragrance of Old Spice lingers in his hair for at least a couple of hours after his shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, Old Spice has its own version of a regular shampoo, but with this combination he knows that, like all other Head and Shoulders shampoo products, this shampoo will help keep his dandruff under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great fusion of two great brands that are sure to be popular for a long time. My husband is definitely enjoying washing with this product.</li>
