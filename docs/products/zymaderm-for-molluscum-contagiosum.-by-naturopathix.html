    <ol>
            <li>It was the perfect storm for molluscum</li>
            <li>It has been amazing!!!!</li>
            <li>Worked great for Molluscum!</li>
            <li>And now my daughter&#x27;s skin looks wonderful!!!</li>
            <li>I am soooo happy with this!!!!</li>
            <li>I thought it worked great</li>
            <li>My son was so proud of us - he said we were molluscum killers.  </li>
            <li>It is a huge relief!!!</li>
            <li>Amazing results - you have to touch each pimple with it - time consuming but works!</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with this product!</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think it did my daughter any good.  </li>
            <li>This product is great, I wish I had known about it before we went to the dermatologist for treatments, this worked much better.  </li>
            <li>maybe just one more week of it!</li>
            <li>We tried so many things and came across this - within a day they started disappearing!  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;re very happy with this product, so is our young son.</li>
            <li>After 2 more months of doing nothing my son kept asking for me to put medicine on them</li>
            <li>I read many reviews before I purchased this item</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad it seems to be working for us...</li>
            <li>My daughter had more than 20 lesions on her neck.</li>
            <li>My daughter had these for more than six months before we started using.</li>
            <li>it worked ok</li>
            <li>The molluscum is not getting better its just not spreading</li>
            <li>, my house can&#x27;t handle any more of this stench.</li>
            <li>After dropping HUNDREDS at the dermatologist for my son and still more appts to go, I got this at Walgreen&#x27;s for $25.  </li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t need more than what&#x27;s in there.</li>
            <li>I have recommended this to so many friends and my daughters</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>Bought for my son&#x27;s ongoing molluscum contagiosum, which held strong for more than a year.</li>
            <li>Now after 2 months, she is completely free from Molluscum.</li>
            <li>Others have had better success with Zymaderm.</li>
            <li>i purchased it for my six year old and while it was better than having the lazer treatment -- it took about three months for it to be completely effective.</li>
            <li>Well worth the buy!</li>
            <li>It worked amazing on my six year old.</li>
            <li>and he tried the acne face wipes on his son and his went away quickly as well.  </li>
            <li>I got this stuff, it doesn&#x27;t sting at all and quickly helps the warts to go away.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m pretty sure I can legally sell it to you for $10.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly, highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>It is well worth a try.  </li>
            <li>but it was well worth it.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I was most satisfied that this natural method worked because my husband mocked me when I suggested it and then had to admit it was 100% cured by the 10th day, with very little pain.  </li>
            <li>but it was fast and never painful.</li>
            <li>At first it seemed to help by not spreading the MC.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>It may not look pretty for awhile, but it&#x27;ll subside soon after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He finally resigned and began using the patches too and has been getting much better.  </li>
            <li>(Which is what our pediatrician recommended in the first place.)</li>
            <li>My 6yo son with eczema broke out first.  </li>
            <li>sure anyone else saw whitehead / red swelling after applying this stuff, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict still out, but I&#x27;m giving up on this stuff</li>
            <li>I attempted to use the zymaderm alone for awhile but did not see very quick or apparent results.  </li>
            <li>If either of my children ever get molluscum again (and I really, really hope they don&#x27;t!), we will just keep their skin very moisturized and wait for their body&#x27;s immune system to recognize the bumps to heal them.  </li>
            <li>Works great, Smells terrible, but works great.</li>
            <li>After trying everything the doctor prescribed &amp; spending too much money at the dermatologist for treatments that did not work, I discovered zymaderm.</li>
            <li>so we decided to start trying to get very aggressive in our treatment</li>
            <li>We were absolutely meticulous about using this twice a day.</li>
            <li>and they say you can&#x27;t get it twice, so if anyone wants it please let me know.  </li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product completely and think it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I was glad that someone else had noted that a lot of the bumps get larger and more red before they actually disappear because that happened a lot.</li>
            <li>I came across Zymaderm and made a quick trip to the local Walgreens.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone having this problem.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>It is a little stinky, but it mostly smells like cloves.  </li>
            <li>I applied this to my son&#x27;s molluscum contagiosum for 4 straight weeks, twice a day and the lesions look exactly the same.</li>
            <li>I know that molluscum is not technically warts, but medicated wart patches can pretty much kill anything, including moles too.  </li>
            <li>The good news is that I do not think it has gotten worse, so perhaps the Zymaderm helped prevent spreading.</li>
            <li>We have seen two new lesions appear during that time.</li>
            <li>were completely gone in 4 weeks!</li>
            <li>Our pediatrician recommended this product and it worked well, although it took time and consistent use, 2 or 3 applications per day for several weeks.</li>
            <li>A couple more weeks later, her body finally recognized the molluscum and attacked the bumps - they became very red, but then disappeared soon.  </li>
            <li>Used it for about a month and it completely worked!  </li>
            <li>Over a period of the next 2 years the molloscum began to spread to other parts of his body and we paid his doctor and the dermatologist a visit about 3 more times.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was really worried because she was starting a new school and the lesions were highly visible.</li>
            <li>and she had it all over her neck during the summer and early fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My 2 yr old daughter was COVERED in molluscum.</li>
            <li>We used this on my daughter, after dealing with Molluscum for nearly a year.  </li>
            <li>I got all variations and phases of this stuff, watched gross videos of lancing these, and for a month, have not seen much improvement (except lethally terminating my sense of smell) while applying almost twice daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This worked well to clear up our 5 yr old outbreak he got from the community pool.</li>
            <li>I even tried it on ingrown acne that as an adult I get every  now</li>
            <li>So glad to have found a product that worked with a small expense!</li>
            <li>Within the first two days the molluscum began to dry up.  </li>
            <li>She was itching her eczema and her skin was becoming red and raw,</li>
            <li>The dermatologist recommended ZymaDerm as the first thing to try for my child before trying other alternatives.  </li>
            <li>I am currently using this product on my 7 year old daughter, forearm and belly.</li>
            <li>And my 5 year old son, knee and back.  </li>
            <li>We have been putting it directly on the spots twice a day for one week now and they are noticeably smaller and some of the spots are almost gone.  </li>
            <li>Long story short, I couldn&#x27;t bare seeing my 6 year old concerned about this problem that was now spreading to his cheeks</li>
            <li>It does leave behind little white scars but they are barely visible and will go away on their own</li>
            <li>Even if it works, which is still up for debate here after 4 weeks, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth potential nerve damage to anyone whose central nervous system gets within nose reach  of this foul smelling stench.  </li>

            <li> Long story short, I couldn&#x27;t bare seeing my 6 year old concerned about this problem that was now spreading to his cheeks</li>

            <li> Within a week, new bumps stopped appearing all together and the ones that were there were much smaller and turning a dark purple color as they went away.</li>
            <li> Over a period of two weeks it was completely gone and within the third week it stopped spreading to other body parts.  </li>
            <li> I rarely bother to write reviews but felt I had to recommend this because I am guessing I am not the first person to come to check out this product desperate to find something that worked.</li>
            <li> We will see what the long term effect is and if the sores come back.</li>
            <li> After 10 days, the initial outbreak was almost eliminated and subsequent flare-ups have been minimal.  </li>
            <li> We have now been using it religiously once a day for a month and no new bumps have appeared.</li>
            <li> The old ones are now flattened and just look like little scars that are fading.</li>
            <li> I ordered ZymaDerm after the Retina-A treatment prescribed from our dermatologist was too harsh on my 10 yr old daughter&#x27;s skin.  </li>
            <li> but it took a long time</li>
            <li> I had finally had enough when the nurse and I had to wrap my son in a robe and hold him down.  </li>
            <li> In any case, we are heading back to the doctor again to find out other options.</li>
            <li> We only used it once a day and sometimes once every other day and in about a month, all of the bumps are gone.</li>
            <li> The jar is tiny but it will easily last you a few months.</li>
            <li> I started using my acne/face wipes and after about 2 weeks they were all cleared up with no new growths, gave my brother my results</li>
            <li> The smell is kind of nasty, but if you can get past that it is worth the buy.</li>
            <li> It was obviously painless, a little stinky but who cares.  </li>
            <li> During the time I treated my son with this, once I applied the oil I allowed it to dry unto his skin and than put a breathable band-aid on his breakouts so that he wouldn&#x27;t scratch them and than touch other body parts.  </li>
            <li> She was covered in molluscum bumps, used it twice a day after a week the bumps turned red and then dried out and faded away.</li>
            <li> When the bumps get red and dried out, they are dying and beginning the process of going away.  </li>
            <li> and it began drying up the molluscum bumps within only a few days.</li>
            <li> I used it on my 7 year old daughter and it actually made it worse.</li>
            <li> My son now has one Molluscum lesion, and we have started to use this on him - getting rid of the virus far out weighs the possible tiny scarring pit (like I mentioned, small -- very small, hardly noticeable!)</li>
            <li> They were huge and painful and itchy.</li>
            <li> she is now down to about 10 spots and they are all faded and pretty hard to see!!!</li>
            <li> Overall I am still applying to about 6 only because I can still see where the lesions were and am afraid to stop using.  </li>
            <li> This was a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I used the combo of the wart patches and zymaderm and killed off the molluscum.  </li>
            <li> waste your money on this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Within 2 weeks of using Zymaderm ALL of them were cleared up, some in a few days.</li>
            <li> Each time was traumatic and ended with my son crying and in pain.  </li>
            <li> I even used it on a wart for a treatment (in conjunction with the bandaids for warts) and it killed the wart as well.</li>
            <li> Small, white spots around his ankles then behind his legs, now around his buttocks and wrists.  </li>
            <li> I washed her bedding every few days and kept her little sis off her bed!</li>
            <li> My poor son had a really wide spread case (approximately 100 molluscum on arms, legs and bottom) and we went to the dermatologist and pediatrician several times.  </li>
            <li> until we got up to about 8 or so of these itchy, horrible wart-like lesions (how can you really stop a 5 or 6 yrs old from itching).</li>
            <li> But now my daughter has small scars where the molluscum once was (almost pits, rather than elevated scars).  </li>
            <li> Not sure if this is from the ZymaDerm, or just the virus itself?  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if it&#x27;s intended for that</li>
            <li> The doctors tried freezing and cutting the molluscum off and they just kept coming back.  </li>
            <li> slowly another one would appear, on his face, legs, chest, etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty nasty.</li>
            <li> and it is very hard to keep it from running onto skin that is not affected.  </li>
            <li> The lesions got slightly worse before they began to shrink.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, that is why products like these, which do not work, stay in the marketplace.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but boy did it do the trick.  </li>
            <li> She had them from her neck down to her knees and it looked awful and sad.</li>
            <li> And the dermatologists tell you there is no treatment other than using blistering agents, which are horrible!</li>
            <li> We are desperate.  </li>
            <li> but it was getting to the point that I was desperate to get it to stop spreading because she was itching it at night.</li>
            <li> it just smells bad and does nothing.</li>
            <li> My sons had a bad breakout and after three weeks we started to see improvement.</li>
            <li> Was frustrated with my daughters molluscum, but this product helped me a lottttt.</li>
            <li> we have been dealing with this for almost 2 years now :(</li>
            <li> It may work, but not on my daughter:(</li>
            <li> one mentioned sharing the applicator on two kids, which, like an idiot, I did.  </li>
            <li> I wanted this to work so badly!  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> My child (4) had two bumps on her neck.  We used this product for two weeks &amp; one of the bumps was gone.  With in another week we could no longer find the second bump.  There is no scar, nothing.  It was obviously painless, a little stinky but who cares.  This product is great, I wish I had known about it before we went to the dermatologist for treatments, this worked much better.  I highly recommend this to anyone having this problem.</li>
            <li> The dermatologist recommended ZymaDerm as the first thing to try for my child before trying other alternatives.  After 10 days, the initial outbreak was almost eliminated and subsequent flare-ups have been minimal.  Now after 2 months, she is completely free from Molluscum.</li>
            <li> After trying everything the doctor prescribed &amp; spending too much money at the dermatologist for treatments that did not work, I discovered zymaderm. A life saver! Got rid of the molluscum bumps in about two months. Recommend for anyone.</li>
            <li> I wanted this to work so badly!  We followed the directions to a &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; and have been using for over a month without any improvement at all in my daughters bumps.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I applied this to my son&#x27;s molluscum contagiosum for 4 straight weeks, twice a day and the lesions look exactly the same. The good news is that I do not think it has gotten worse, so perhaps the Zymaderm helped prevent spreading. In any case, we are heading back to the doctor again to find out other options. Others have had better success with Zymaderm. We did not.</li>
            <li> Our daughter has had molluscum for months. It seemed to start up when her eczema flared up. She was itching her eczema and her skin was becoming red and raw, and then she also was taking swimming lessons twice a week. It was the perfect storm for molluscum and she had it all over her neck during the summer and early fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really worried because she was starting a new school and the lesions were highly visible. We even got a call from the principal asking if it was measles!! Kids can be cruel so we decided to start trying to get very aggressive in our treatment plan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After scouring the web, I came across Zymaderm. It has been amazing!!!! We started on Sept 10 and my daughter had over 50 lesions...she is now down to about 10 spots and they are all faded and pretty hard to see!!! It is a huge relief!!! We were absolutely meticulous about using this twice a day. I would say it was the biggest help in her recovery. We also started giving her vitamins to boost her immune system, giving her showers instead of baths, and washing towels immediately. I washed her bedding every few days and kept her little sis off her bed! I also bought some turtleneck-type tops to help keep her from scratching. If your children scratch, it will spread!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly, highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered ZymaDerm after the Retina-A treatment prescribed from our dermatologist was too harsh on my 10 yr old daughter&#x27;s skin.  At first it seemed to help by not spreading the MC.  But that is not the case.  We applied it 2 times per day.  The bumps have spread on my daughter&#x27;s face.  It has been 4 months since the bumps have appeared.  We are desperate.  Unfortunately, that is why products like these, which do not work, stay in the marketplace.</li>
            <li> It worked amazing on my six year old. She was covered in molluscum bumps, used it twice a day after a week the bumps turned red and then dried out and faded away. We were dealing with this nightmare for months before we found this product! And the dermatologists tell you there is no treatment other than using blistering agents, which are horrible!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! My sons warts he had on his legs for 6 months were completely gone in 4 weeks!</li>
            <li> Bought for my son&#x27;s ongoing molluscum contagiosum, which held strong for more than a year. Our pediatrician recommended this product and it worked well, although it took time and consistent use, 2 or 3 applications per day for several weeks. Since clearing up, we have not had any re-occurances! So glad to have found a product that worked with a small expense!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work, I bought it and followed as directed for 6 months with no results. The bumps just seemed to grow and spread.  After 2 more months of doing nothing my son kept asking for me to put medicine on them so they would go away.  I started using my acne/face wipes and after about 2 weeks they were all cleared up with no new growths, gave my brother my results and he tried the acne face wipes on his son and his went away quickly as well.  I would not recommend this product it just smells bad and does nothing.</li>
            <li> Well worth the buy! Worked great for Molluscum! I even tried it outo on my daughter&#x27;s wart and it got rid of that too! The smell is kind of nasty, but if you can get past that it is worth the buy.</li>
            <li> My 2 yr old daughter was COVERED in molluscum. They were huge and painful and itchy. She had them from her neck down to her knees and it looked awful and sad. I got this stuff, it doesn&#x27;t sting at all and quickly helps the warts to go away. They still have to go through the sore-ing and scabbing but it was fast and never painful. And now my daughter&#x27;s skin looks wonderful!!! I am soooo happy with this!!!!</li>
            <li> I am currently using this product on my 7 year old daughter, forearm and belly. And my 5 year old son, knee and back.  We have been putting it directly on the spots twice a day for one week now and they are noticeably smaller and some of the spots are almost gone.  It is a little stinky, but it mostly smells like cloves.  It is well worth a try.  I read many reviews before I purchased this item and it sounded like a hit or miss.  I&#x27;m so glad it seems to be working for us...maybe just one more week of it!</li>
            <li> We used this on my daughter, after dealing with Molluscum for nearly a year.  It did take care of the virus, after applying 2 x day for about 2 weeks.  But now my daughter has small scars where the molluscum once was (almost pits, rather than elevated scars).  Not sure if this is from the ZymaDerm, or just the virus itself?  My son now has one Molluscum lesion, and we have started to use this on him - getting rid of the virus far out weighs the possible tiny scarring pit (like I mentioned, small -- very small, hardly noticeable!)</li>
            <li> Product was suggested by our dermatologist. Works great, Smells terrible, but works great. Was concerned about the price initially but it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> I have never before written a review about a product.  My daughter had more than 20 lesions on her neck. We used twice a day.  We are on our 5 th week.  The lesions got slightly worse before they began to shrink. We have seen two new lesions appear during that time. Both have almost already dissolved. Overall I am still applying to about 6 only because I can still see where the lesions were and am afraid to stop using.  My daughter had these for more than six months before we started using. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money.  I followed the directions, but never saw any sign that it was having any affect.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical. My sons had a bad breakout and after three weeks we started to see improvement. Now at four weeks all sores are almost gone to thebyear. We will see what the long term effect is and if the sores come back. One drawback is the smell. It&#x27;s pretty nasty.</li>
            <li> I got rid of my molluscum in just under 2 months by using this oil and applying Wart Medicated patches (you can pick them up at your local CVS) to the individual bumps.  I know that molluscum is not technically warts, but medicated wart patches can pretty much kill anything, including moles too.  I attempted to use the zymaderm alone for awhile but did not see very quick or apparent results.  When the bumps get red and dried out, they are dying and beginning the process of going away.  It may not look pretty for awhile, but it&#x27;ll subside soon after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I used the combo of the wart patches and zymaderm and killed off the molluscum.  My husband chose to use only the zymaderm and is still battling them.  He finally resigned and began using the patches too and has been getting much better.  Just another piece of evidence that it takes a combo for it to work!</li>
            <li> My son kept breaking out with Molluscum and Zymaderm helped stop the outbreak.  I thought it worked great and I would recommend this to others!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work at all.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using for like 3weeks, nothing is better.&lt;br /&gt;Do not trust REVIEW.</li>
            <li> We used this product religiously for several weeks and I don&#x27;t think it did my daughter any good.  We finished the bottle and switched to regular moisturizer.  A couple more weeks later, her body finally recognized the molluscum and attacked the bumps - they became very red, but then disappeared soon.  If either of my children ever get molluscum again (and I really, really hope they don&#x27;t!), we will just keep their skin very moisturized and wait for their body&#x27;s immune system to recognize the bumps to heal them.  (Which is what our pediatrician recommended in the first place.)</li>
            <li> it worked ok but it took a long time and it is very hard to keep it from running onto skin that is not affected.  i purchased it for my six year old and while it was better than having the lazer treatment -- it took about three months for it to be completely effective.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my son for months. The molluscum is not getting better its just not spreading</li>
            <li> not working for us. molluscum is still spreading. we have been dealing with this for almost 2 years now :(</li>
            <li> My son picked up Molluscum Contagiosum from a playdate, he&#x27;d had it about a year and slowly another one would appear, on his face, legs, chest, etc. until we got up to about 8 or so of these itchy, horrible wart-like lesions (how can you really stop a 5 or 6 yrs old from itching). Within 2 weeks of using Zymaderm ALL of them were cleared up, some in a few days. We&#x27;re very happy with this product, so is our young son. And it&#x27;s homeopathic, as a plus.</li>
            <li> This stuff reeks.  Even if it works, which is still up for debate here after 4 weeks, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth potential nerve damage to anyone whose central nervous system gets within nose reach  of this foul smelling stench.  Think paint thinner mixed with  mercurochrome and menthol.  In the bottom of an ash tray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one mentioned sharing the applicator on two kids, which, like an idiot, I did.  My 6yo son with eczema broke out first.  Small, white spots around his ankles then behind his legs, now around his buttocks and wrists.  He&#x27;s had it about 8 months, same Dx, leave it alone, etc.  Then my 4yo son broke out in small bumps, while first son&#x27;s ramped up to red boil-looking things.  I got all variations and phases of this stuff, watched gross videos of lancing these, and for a month, have not seen much improvement (except lethally terminating my sense of smell) while applying almost twice daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure anyone else saw whitehead / red swelling after applying this stuff, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict still out, but I&#x27;m giving up on this stuff, my house can&#x27;t handle any more of this stench.</li>
            <li> After dropping HUNDREDS at the dermatologist for my son and still more appts to go, I got this at Walgreen&#x27;s for $25.  Used it for about a month and it completely worked!  I was skeptical, but boy did it do the trick.  Didn&#x27;t hurt him (unlike the dr treatments) either.  I still have 2/3 of a bottle left and they say you can&#x27;t get it twice, so if anyone wants it please let me know.  It&#x27;s not a drug so I&#x27;m pretty sure I can legally sell it to you for $10.  You won&#x27;t need more than what&#x27;s in there.</li>
            <li> This worked well to clear up our 5 yr old outbreak he got from the community pool. No fighting him to put it on. In fact he asked us for it whenever he sees another one.</li>
            <li> It really works. Was frustrated with my daughters molluscum, but this product helped me a lottttt. Thanks&lt;br /&gt;My 100% vote for it.</li>
            <li> My poor son had a really wide spread case (approximately 100 molluscum on arms, legs and bottom) and we went to the dermatologist and pediatrician several times.  Each time was traumatic and ended with my son crying and in pain.  The doctors tried freezing and cutting the molluscum off and they just kept coming back.  I had finally had enough when the nurse and I had to wrap my son in a robe and hold him down.  I could not stand the thought of putting him through it again.  I ordered this product and every spot was gone within 10 days.  They say it takes longer but we were religious about it.  We applied it morning and night each day and by the 10th day, there was nothing to treat.  My son was so proud of us - he said we were molluscum killers.  To be honest, I was most satisfied that this natural method worked because my husband mocked me when I suggested it and then had to admit it was 100% cured by the 10th day, with very little pain.  Buy this product and save your child the agony.</li>
            <li> My son started having molloscum breakouts at the age of 4.  His doctor did not prescribe anything and said it would go away.  Over a period of the next 2 years the molloscum began to spread to other parts of his body and we paid his doctor and the dermatologist a visit about 3 more times.  The only thing they could for us is that they provided us with a topical crème which probably soothed the itching and inflammation a bit but did not cure the problem or reduce breakouts.  Long story short, I couldn&#x27;t bare seeing my 6 year old concerned about this problem that was now spreading to his cheeks and I decided to research the problem.  I came across Zymaderm and made a quick trip to the local Walgreens.  Within the first two days the molluscum began to dry up.  Over a period of two weeks it was completely gone and within the third week it stopped spreading to other body parts.  During the time I treated my son with this, once I applied the oil I allowed it to dry unto his skin and than put a breathable band-aid on his breakouts so that he wouldn&#x27;t scratch them and than touch other body parts.  I also only gave him showers and not a bathe because I didn&#x27;t want him soaking in the molluscum infected areas.  THANK YOU God and to the inventor of this product.  It did what doctors couldn&#x27;t do and I am so thankful for it.  I highly recommend this product.  I even tried it on ingrown acne that as an adult I get every  now and than it stops further growth, drys it up and doesn&#x27;t leave a mark...I am not sure if it&#x27;s intended for that but hey, it worked!</li>
            <li> We tried so many things and came across this - within a day they started disappearing!  I have recommended this to so many friends and my daughters doctors now recommend it!  Amazing results - you have to touch each pimple with it - time consuming but works!</li>
            <li> I used it on my 7 year old daughter and it actually made it worse. I took her to the doctor and was told to discontinue the product and allow them to go on their own,which they have been doing so. It may work, but not on my daughter:(</li>
            <li> This product worked just as described and within weeks. It does leave behind little white scars but they are barely visible and will go away on their own I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> I rarely bother to write reviews but felt I had to recommend this because I am guessing I am not the first person to come to check out this product desperate to find something that worked. My daughter&#x27;s molluscum began on the back of her thighs and progressed to the point where it was covering both thighs, her backside, and was spreading to her feet. The doctor kept saying there was nothing to do but wait but it was getting to the point that I was desperate to get it to stop spreading because she was itching it at night. I figured I&#x27;d give this a try and it began drying up the molluscum bumps within only a few days. Within a week, new bumps stopped appearing all together and the ones that were there were much smaller and turning a dark purple color as they went away. We have now been using it religiously once a day for a month and no new bumps have appeared. The old ones are now flattened and just look like little scars that are fading. I recommend this product completely and think it is well worth the money. The jar is tiny but it will easily last you a few months. The oil smells and feels just like tea tree oil and does not burn or sting. The doctor will tell you to wait and wait for molluscum to go away...you could be waiting over a year, and in the meantime, it will spread. Give this a try.</li>
            <li> We only used it once a day and sometimes once every other day and in about a month, all of the bumps are gone. I was glad that someone else had noted that a lot of the bumps get larger and more red before they actually disappear because that happened a lot. I even used it on a wart for a treatment (in conjunction with the bandaids for warts) and it killed the wart as well. I am thrilled with this product!</li>
