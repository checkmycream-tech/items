            <li>A GOOD SHAMPOOING</li>

            <li>all good news</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think most people would be happy with them.</li>
            <li>I am impressed by the leather-like roll container for the brushes, the length is great for travel or purse as well as home, the bristles are indeed soft, but on some blushes, they don&#x27;t \\&quot;grab\\&quot; the tint.  </li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>Love these brushes!</li>

            <li>I love using them!</li>
            <li>really love that all of Shanys brushes are PETA approved as well!</li>
            <li>I love this set of brushes!</li>
            <li>My two favorite brushes from this set are the blush brush and the angled brush!</li>
            <li>The brushes included are good quality, but the bag had a STRONG chemical smell!  </li>
            <li>the quality is in really good shape the brushes are still soft :D</li>
            <li>Looked nice but not made well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks again Amazon for another great purchase!!</li>
            <li>This is a nice brush set.</li>
            <li>No shedding, the makeup goes on nicely</li>
            <li>The packaging was really nice</li>
            <li>it buffs it out nicely though.</li>
            <li>And I must say there are no complaints honestly.</li>
            <li>They are gorgeous and soft and work wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>Nice quality for the price.  </li>
            <li>The blending brush also does a nice job of finishing off looks.  </li>
            <li>Nice brushes would recommend</li>
            <li>unique   good good</li>
            <li>Quick ship, and great quality product... Will recommend to others.</li>
            <li>Some people were bothered by the smell of the carrying case, but I didnt note it to be a very strong scent at all.</li>
            <li>Great product for the price and very pretty as well</li>
            <li>i can honestly say they are much better than sephora and mac sets because ive had those also.</li>
            <li>The brushes are so soft and the apply my makeup flawlessly and effortlessly.</li>
            <li>My wife said that she was really happy to get these amazing real animal bristles in a set of brushes.</li>
            <li>they are very good quality and VERY soft.  </li>
            <li>The quality and softness on most of the brushes is very good with natural mink.  </li>
            <li>I really love this brush set.</li>
            <li>This set is perfect and the quality is better than the brushes that can be found in the local drug store.</li>
            <li>Hopefully, with more time, it will go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>my friends are still pleased and guess what we are recommending it to more ppl</li>
            <li>This is my travel bag of brushes, love the feel, have had others like this years ago.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for a great Product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS BRUSH SET</li>
            <li>AS IT STATED, TO ME IT WAS WAY BETTER</li>
            <li>A stronger adhesive to ensure durability would have been appropriate.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  </li>
            <li>I love them for mineral makeup.</li>
            <li>For now, I am a pleased customer.</li>
            <li>, I was thoroughly pleased.</li>
            <li>I was really pleased with the quality, packaging etc.</li>
            <li>I love the eyebrow tool, too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d return this if I weren&#x27;t in Australia (where a kabuki brush from MAC is 88 AUD from MAC) but the postage would probably cost me more.</li>
            <li>I love the kabuki and the powder brush.</li>
            <li>They are my favorite and they get the job done with an A+</li>
            <li>i still use just the top part.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>A beauty necessity that most women don&#x27;t want&lt;</li>
            <li>br /&gt;to spend their precious beauty dollars on.</li>
            <li>I think for the price, the product was pretty good.</li>
            <li>Washing these would also be a good idea before first use as well.</li>
            <li>they have such a elegant look that you feel like you dont wanna use em and keep em clean like that for eveeeeeeerd  &lt;3 all over d place  </li>
            <li>These are wonderful, soft and just the right size.</li>
            <li>Easy to take with me.</li>
            <li>Many makeup artists also use conditioner when they clean with shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are easy to use.</li>
            <li>Seems to be good quality and after a few months, they are still holding up great.</li>
            <li>The facial brushes were nice but nothing good for the eyes.</li>
            <li>THE POUCH BAG HAD A STRONG SMELL, SO I HUNG IT UP TO AIR OUT.</li>
            <li>The brushes arrived fast, I&#x27;m very pleased with these brushes.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a good brush set, and the best deal at the same time, look no further.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had these for over a month now and even with daily use they are holding up beautifully.  </li>
            <li>These are pretty nice.</li>
            <li>The set is attractively packaged in a compartmented, easy-to-pack leather-look roll that seems to be well constructed with no loose or faulty stitching.  </li>
            <li>I have not seen a better overall price value for this kind of quality!  </li>
            <li>Super soft bristles make this a really great set.  </li>
            <li>I love these brushes they are nice and soft and when I do my makeup</li>
            <li>I needed a cheap set of brushes and these fit the bill quality and price-wise.</li>
            <li>However all of the brushes fit into my travel-size makeup bag.</li>
            <li>and they are easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>The return went smoothly, so I purchased another set thinking it was a fluke.  </li>
            <li>Makeup coverage is smooth and even.</li>
            <li>They seem very well made are nicely sized.  </li>
            <li>These are the same great quality.</li>
            <li>It made it light and it made my face look refreshed.</li>
            <li>They are very well made and nicely sized.</li>
            <li>Overall a great product.</li>
            <li>I own a whole range of face and eye brushes from MAC and The Body Shop.</li>
            <li>all of them are FANTASTIC fyi.</li>
            <li>These brushes are soooooooooo soft and good at applying make-up without soaking it all up in the bristles.</li>
            <li>I wanted a brush set made of natural hairs, and one that had a good variety of brushes.</li>
            <li>They are soft and of good quality.</li>
            <li>Shipped faster than I thought they would, brushes are incredibly soft and good quality.</li>
            <li>(my MAC and TBS brushes are now 5 years old and still going strong).I gave this the benefit of the doubt as it&#x27;s gotten a lot of good reviews.</li>
            <li>im bying 3 more right now and giving em out to my friends  </li>
            <li>Brushes like this can easily cost you over the amount of Shany&#x27;s full set.</li>
            <li>But, wow, the mink brushes are super soft and silky, with a dense texture that is perfect for applying powders.  </li>
            <li>I bought this particularly for when I travel as I like the idea of it having it&#x27;s own case.</li>
            <li>so i bought a new case entirely other then that the brushes were fabulous she loved them and said they are great for traveling</li>
            <li>and she was just as excited as I was about it.</li>
            <li>tried my eco friendly synthetic hair brushes.</li>
            <li>brushes are super soft and I love it!</li>
            <li>wat is surprising is the low price for this set   </li>
            <li>well they were a really nice and soft  </li>
            <li>I had to wash the pouch as well, since it smelled more intense than the brushes.</li>
            <li>Overall, the brushes are really full, nice and soft and I feel as if the price is good for the value.</li>
            <li>but they were full size.</li>
            <li>Other than that they are great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the largest brush mainly for setting powder, and I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try fixing this with super</li>
            <li>the price is unblieveble and one more thing that i love is that they have flat bottoms</li>
            <li>This would be a good first set for a teenager or someone just starting with brushes.</li>
            <li>AND GREAT FOR EVERYDAY USE.  </li>
            <li>and they are simply just amazing.</li>
            <li>These are nice and worth the money, but please know the handles come apart from the brush as they are only glued on and not glued on well.  </li>
            <li>I bought this more for the bag than the brushes, to replace my bag which was getting old.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Grandma&#x27;s $0.02 - The [[ASIN:B0032DHP6O SHANY Studio Quality Cosmetic Brush Set, 7 Piece with Bag]] is a nice, well made set of basic cosmetic brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seems like a good product but a really toxic smell greets you when you open the product.</li>
            <li>Any brush that&#x27;s too soft will probably pick up a lot of your product but will retain it as well, more than it going to your face.</li>
            <li>Soft &amp; Smooth!</li>
            <li>I am not sure how much my daughter will love them, but they look like a really good set of brushes.</li>
            <li>Much better than what I expected and would most certainly buy again.</li>
            <li>My original pressed powder brush is denser and with slightly stiffer bristles and it applies powder so nicely.  </li>
            <li>This is because the brushes are long lasting, and will continue to have good use for years after being bought because the bag will ensure that the brushes will stay good for a long time.  </li>
            <li>They are terribly soft and the bag is totally fine, no smell at all.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and just the ones I need to apply powder, blush, foundation and eye shadow, but the finish of the brushes look cheap.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have allergies or scent issues, but this was way, WAY too much!  </li>
            <li>THIS WILL BE THE FIRST THING TO GET CLOSE TO MY FACE</li>
            <li>I have not used many different brush sets but this does apply make up well.</li>
            <li>This is my first set of brushes</li>
            <li>I washed  brushes &amp; bag when I first received them.</li>
            <li>This is her first cosmetic brush set</li>
            <li>These brushes were exactly what they said they were.  </li>
            <li>I had ordered some last year and was pleased with the quality.  </li>
            <li>I bought this and thought they were pretty until I tried to use them.</li>
            <li>The handle on the \\&quot;powder bush\\&quot; came detached the first time I used them.</li>
            <li>The carrying case looks like a faux leather which I find to be pretty stylish.\&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to worry about  putting too much makeup on with these brushes because they won&#x27;t allow you to!</li>
            <li>manufacturer recommends that you wash your brushes before you use them for the first time.  </li>
            <li>would love to see a set with all different powder/blush/bronzer/kabuki/buffer brushes.</li>
            <li>Overall a decent set with natural mink, at a good price.</li>
            <li>Bristles are a little soft, otherwise great brushes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice a huge difference between my synthetic brushes compared to these as far as make-up application.  </li>
            <li>Normally, I washed every single brush before the first use, and I used warm water and baby-shampoo.</li>
            <li>They are super soft!</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>The brushes are really full and really soft and there wasn&#x27;t any shedding.</li>
            <li>It did glue back on fairly easily</li>
            <li>SUPER SOFT BRUSHES AND</li>
            <li>The brushes are incredibly soft and full, and they work really well for face powders.</li>
            <li>I washed them as recommended before use and the head of the large brush</li>
            <li>I was looking for a set that included a large kabuki brush to use with my mineral makeup.</li>
            <li>The brush is a bit large but I just scrunched it a bit when applying the powder in the areas that needed control.</li>
            <li>The big Kabuki is fine, and the eyeliner brush, but I don&#x27;t wear much makeup aside from eye makeup and concealer.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good set of brushes mainly blush brushes and small detail brushes</li>
            <li>They are much softer than I thought they would be for their price</li>
            <li>I really like the feel of the mink hair</li>
            <li>THANKS AGAIN</li>
            <li>I absolutely rate them with Mac and Bobby Brown quality.</li>
            <li>This set has really helped me improve my look.</li>
            <li>These brushes come in a very professional-looking faux leather roll-up bag.  </li>
            <li>The whole brush set was very smelly, just like others mentioned.</li>
            <li>no broken arm or leg  </li>
            <li>* much.</li>
            <li>And if you&#x27;re a amazon prime member of course the shipping is fast.</li>
            <li>Real Review by a Real Person.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t believe it was a real leather pouch.</li>
            <li>I regret making this purchase, but it&#x27;d be good for a big foundation and powder fan, especially if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.    </li>
            <li>The large Kabuki brush is particularly</li>
            <li>But as other reviewers have pointed out, the travel case for these brushes has a most pungent, repugnant smell.  </li>
            <li>Most of the other sets included tons of brushes that I did not need.</li>
            <li>I agree with madmazel this product is much better than other brand names out there  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend   luv the packaging and fast shipment   its shick and</li>
            <li>I purchased these to replace older synthetic brushes I have had for 15 years.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re into pro makeup, this can be a standby set but not your main brush set.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly care for the powder/foundation brush as for me</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>it   highly recommended.   </li>
            <li>High quality  </li>
            <li>and when I opened the box I was amazed with how high quality these brushes are.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend</li>
            <li>the large kabuki (in my opinion) cant be used to directly apply powder/foundation.</li>
            <li>I really feel that I have been ripped off by other companies after finding this brush set because they are charging the same price for one of their cheaper brushes for the price of this whole kit and this kit has better quality.</li>
            <li>The brushes themselves are as soft as you can imagine and are quite a step up for me when I compare them to the discount store offerings or even the artistic stores such as Michael&#x27;s or H&amp;H Supply.  </li>
            <li>The brushes look nice and the hair feels very soft ad thick.</li>
            <li>After reading some of the less positive reviews, I  made sure to double check everything.  </li>
            <li>Extremely high-quality brushes (and the Kabuki&#x27;s huge).</li>
            <li>I have seen a lot of other sets not come with one, and I find those to be important.</li>
            <li>I purchased this set for myself and my little sister (who is far more of a make-up goddess than I).  </li>
            <li>i bought a new case for because nothing got rid of the smell not even setting it out a month</li>
            <li>purchased new makeup.</li>
            <li>I found out a new trick that you can do with the eye brow comb.</li>
            <li>I brought this set for my mom and she says it&#x27;s very soft and well put together.</li>
            <li>Very soft</li>
            <li>The bristles of these brushes are very soft and work well for applying makeup.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t affect the general efficiency of the whole package.</li>
            <li>The selection isn&#x27;t very good (basically no eye brushes, and the one they did include is a sponge!), and when I tried to use the small flat brush as a concealer brush it was so rough it scratched up my eye area and made it red.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve also had the sephora and they cost more than 100 to 150 dollars and their quality is not better than this shany set.</li>
            <li>#7 is Medium, when the bristles&#x27; size is exactly the opposite.</li>
            <li>These brushes are high quality, it is soft and not harsh to put makeup on.</li>
            <li>I wanted new brushes to replace my old ones.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much larger than the image shows...almost excessively large.  </li>
            <li>as long as you clean the brushes frequently they should last awhile.</li>
            <li>They are soft and silky I have been using them for over four months now.  </li>
            <li>yes yes yes they are soft  </li>
            <li>Soft bristles.</li>
            <li>I DID NOT EXPECT THIS BRUSH TO BE AS SOFT</li>
            <li>They are so soft, and they are generously sized.  </li>
            <li>They are soft with no breakage.</li>
            <li>and also the big brush, which makes my make up much easier.</li>
            <li>soft on skin   </li>
            <li>I can not imagine any professional using them.</li>
            <li>I was worried about them being so soft they could not hold any makeup</li>
            <li>and I found it completely changed the look of my powder.</li>
            <li>The bristles seem soft, and the handles are sturdy, but if they come unglued</li>
            <li>I needed to replace my old make-up brushes that are at least 15 years old or more...</li>
            <li>Even a professional could pull these out</li>
            <li>They are soft and so far they haven&#x27;t shed *too</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s soft for something synthetic but will not hold up for years and years</li>
            <li>I was surprised by the quality of these brushes.  </li>
            <li>I had my old ones for 30 years.</li>
            <li>These are baby soft and do not shed at all.</li>
            <li>Def professional quality.</li>
            <li>these are too soft and it makes applying pressed power take quite a while.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping this set would replace all my old brushes completely</li>
            <li>For me, the big brush is worth the price of the entire set.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that good especially when the biggest brush reached me in a broken state.</li>
            <li>glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the bristles are too soft and as such,only good for casual use.</li>
            <li>I bought these based on other reviews since it&#x27;s hard to know without seeing and touching them first.</li>
            <li>︎ I paid particular attention to the larger brushes, checking them both before and after cleaning for shedding bristles.  </li>
            <li>The little black bag it comes in is also a nice touch.</li>
            <li>would use no other ones!</li>
            <li>Brush is so soft it barely holds the blush powder.</li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft to the touch and hope they will last for a while.</li>
            <li>The case the brushes came in does have a slight smell but not bad enough for me not to use it.</li>
            <li>While there are special makeup brush cleaners that you can buy, Shany recommends ordinary shampoo.  </li>
            <li>These brushes are made of animal hair -- mink and badger -- so those who object to such things should steer clear and look instead for synthetic brushes.  </li>
            <li>BY SAYING THAT THIS IS MY BOYFRIEND, BECAUSE THIS BRUSH IS SOOOO BIG AND SOFT</li>
            <li>I bought this set as a gift for my 26year old sister as her Christmas present.</li>
            <li>This 7 piece brush set is different from others as it is made with 100% natural hair and comes in a variety of styles and shapes.</li>
            <li>I have purchased makeup brushes from groupon that were retailed for 3x the price of these brushes and they were a complete disaster and left bristles on my face while doing my makeup.</li>
            <li>The three larger brushes have bristles made of mink hair and are very soft, while the smaller ones are made of badger hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▶</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t really shed like like my other brushes did either.</li>
            <li>I wish there was one brush that was indeed a blush brush, one where the bristles are longer in the center of the head as one of my 25 yr old natural bristle brushes is.  </li>
            <li>Other than the minimal, normal, new brush shedding, this set had far exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, dry skin</li>

            <li> this cutee   it is one of purchases that i dont regret and i always feel good abt</li>
            <li> A GOOD SHAMPOOING</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift as it was also loved</li>
            <li> all good news</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think most people would be happy with them.</li>
            <li> I am impressed by the leather-like roll container for the brushes, the length is great for travel or purse as well as home, the bristles are indeed soft, but on some blushes, they don&#x27;t \\&quot;grab\\&quot; the tint.  </li>
            <li> Love!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes!</li>
            <li> I love these!</li>
            <li> How cute is the kabuki, by the way?!</li>
            <li> I love using them!</li>
            <li> really love that all of Shanys brushes are PETA approved as well!</li>
            <li> I love this set of brushes!</li>
            <li> My two favorite brushes from this set are the blush brush and the angled brush!</li>
            <li> The brushes included are good quality, but the bag had a STRONG chemical smell!  </li>
            <li> the quality is in really good shape the brushes are still soft :D</li>
            <li> Looked nice but not made well.  </li>
            <li> Thanks again Amazon for another great purchase!!</li>
            <li> This is a nice brush set.</li>
            <li> No shedding, the makeup goes on nicely</li>
            <li> The packaging was really nice</li>
            <li> it buffs it out nicely though.</li>
            <li> And I must say there are no complaints honestly.</li>
            <li> They are gorgeous and soft and work wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> Nice quality for the price.  </li>
            <li> The blending brush also does a nice job of finishing off looks.  </li>
            <li> Nice brushes would recommend</li>
            <li> unique   good good</li>
            <li> Quick ship, and great quality product... Will recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Some people were bothered by the smell of the carrying case, but I didnt note it to be a very strong scent at all.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price and very pretty as well</li>
            <li> i can honestly say they are much better than sephora and mac sets because ive had those also.</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft and the apply my makeup flawlessly and effortlessly.</li>
            <li> My wife said that she was really happy to get these amazing real animal bristles in a set of brushes.</li>
            <li> they are very good quality and VERY soft.  </li>
            <li> The quality and softness on most of the brushes is very good with natural mink.  </li>
            <li> I really love this brush set.</li>
            <li> This set is perfect and the quality is better than the brushes that can be found in the local drug store.</li>
            <li> Hopefully, with more time, it will go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> my friends are still pleased and guess what we are recommending it to more ppl</li>
            <li> This is my travel bag of brushes, love the feel, have had others like this years ago.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for a great Product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS BRUSH SET</li>
            <li> AS IT STATED, TO ME IT WAS WAY BETTER</li>
            <li> A stronger adhesive to ensure durability would have been appropriate.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  </li>
            <li> I love them for mineral makeup.</li>
            <li> For now, I am a pleased customer.</li>
            <li> , I was thoroughly pleased.</li>
            <li> I was really pleased with the quality, packaging etc.</li>
            <li> I love the eyebrow tool, too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d return this if I weren&#x27;t in Australia (where a kabuki brush from MAC is 88 AUD from MAC) but the postage would probably cost me more.</li>
            <li> I love the kabuki and the powder brush.</li>
            <li> They are my favorite and they get the job done with an A+</li>
            <li> i still use just the top part.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> A beauty necessity that most women don&#x27;t want&lt;</li>
            <li> br /&gt;to spend their precious beauty dollars on.</li>
            <li> I think for the price, the product was pretty good.</li>
            <li> Washing these would also be a good idea before first use as well.</li>
            <li> they have such a elegant look that you feel like you dont wanna use em and keep em clean like that for eveeeeeeerd  &lt;3 all over d place  </li>
            <li> These are wonderful, soft and just the right size.</li>
            <li> Easy to take with me.</li>
            <li> Many makeup artists also use conditioner when they clean with shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are easy to use.</li>
            <li> Seems to be good quality and after a few months, they are still holding up great.</li>
            <li> The facial brushes were nice but nothing good for the eyes.</li>
            <li> THE POUCH BAG HAD A STRONG SMELL, SO I HUNG IT UP TO AIR OUT.</li>
            <li> The brushes arrived fast, I&#x27;m very pleased with these brushes.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a good brush set, and the best deal at the same time, look no further.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these for over a month now and even with daily use they are holding up beautifully.  </li>
            <li> These are pretty nice.</li>
            <li> The set is attractively packaged in a compartmented, easy-to-pack leather-look roll that seems to be well constructed with no loose or faulty stitching.  </li>
            <li> I have not seen a better overall price value for this kind of quality!  </li>
            <li> Super soft bristles make this a really great set.  </li>
            <li> I love these brushes they are nice and soft and when I do my makeup</li>
            <li> I needed a cheap set of brushes and these fit the bill quality and price-wise.</li>
            <li> However all of the brushes fit into my travel-size makeup bag.</li>
            <li> and they are easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> The return went smoothly, so I purchased another set thinking it was a fluke.  </li>
            <li> Makeup coverage is smooth and even.</li>
            <li> They seem very well made are nicely sized.  </li>
            <li> These are the same great quality.</li>
            <li> It made it light and it made my face look refreshed.</li>
            <li> They are very well made and nicely sized.</li>
            <li> Overall a great product.</li>
            <li> I own a whole range of face and eye brushes from MAC and The Body Shop.</li>
            <li> all of them are FANTASTIC fyi.</li>
            <li> These brushes are soooooooooo soft and good at applying make-up without soaking it all up in the bristles.</li>
            <li> I wanted a brush set made of natural hairs, and one that had a good variety of brushes.</li>
            <li> They are soft and of good quality.</li>
            <li> Shipped faster than I thought they would, brushes are incredibly soft and good quality.</li>
            <li> (my MAC and TBS brushes are now 5 years old and still going strong).I gave this the benefit of the doubt as it&#x27;s gotten a lot of good reviews.</li>
            <li> im bying 3 more right now and giving em out to my friends  </li>
            <li> Brushes like this can easily cost you over the amount of Shany&#x27;s full set.</li>
            <li> But, wow, the mink brushes are super soft and silky, with a dense texture that is perfect for applying powders.  </li>
            <li> I bought this particularly for when I travel as I like the idea of it having it&#x27;s own case.</li>
            <li> so i bought a new case entirely other then that the brushes were fabulous she loved them and said they are great for traveling</li>
            <li> and she was just as excited as I was about it.</li>
            <li> tried my eco friendly synthetic hair brushes.</li>
            <li> brushes are super soft and I love it!</li>
            <li> wat is surprising is the low price for this set   </li>
            <li> well they were a really nice and soft  </li>
            <li> I had to wash the pouch as well, since it smelled more intense than the brushes.</li>
            <li> Overall, the brushes are really full, nice and soft and I feel as if the price is good for the value.</li>
            <li> but they were full size.</li>
            <li> Other than that they are great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the largest brush mainly for setting powder, and I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try fixing this with super</li>
            <li> the price is unblieveble and one more thing that i love is that they have flat bottoms</li>
            <li> This would be a good first set for a teenager or someone just starting with brushes.</li>
            <li> AND GREAT FOR EVERYDAY USE.  </li>
            <li> and they are simply just amazing.</li>
            <li> These are nice and worth the money, but please know the handles come apart from the brush as they are only glued on and not glued on well.  </li>
            <li> I bought this more for the bag than the brushes, to replace my bag which was getting old.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Grandma&#x27;s $0.02 - The [[ASIN:B0032DHP6O SHANY Studio Quality Cosmetic Brush Set, 7 Piece with Bag]] is a nice, well made set of basic cosmetic brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seems like a good product but a really toxic smell greets you when you open the product.</li>
            <li> Any brush that&#x27;s too soft will probably pick up a lot of your product but will retain it as well, more than it going to your face.</li>
            <li> Soft &amp; Smooth!</li>
            <li> I am not sure how much my daughter will love them, but they look like a really good set of brushes.</li>
            <li> Much better than what I expected and would most certainly buy again.</li>
            <li> My original pressed powder brush is denser and with slightly stiffer bristles and it applies powder so nicely.  </li>
            <li> This is because the brushes are long lasting, and will continue to have good use for years after being bought because the bag will ensure that the brushes will stay good for a long time.  </li>
            <li> They are terribly soft and the bag is totally fine, no smell at all.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and just the ones I need to apply powder, blush, foundation and eye shadow, but the finish of the brushes look cheap.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have allergies or scent issues, but this was way, WAY too much!  </li>
            <li> THIS WILL BE THE FIRST THING TO GET CLOSE TO MY FACE</li>
            <li> I have not used many different brush sets but this does apply make up well.</li>
            <li> This is my first set of brushes</li>
            <li> I washed  brushes &amp; bag when I first received them.</li>
            <li> This is her first cosmetic brush set</li>
            <li> These brushes were exactly what they said they were.  </li>
            <li> I had ordered some last year and was pleased with the quality.  </li>
            <li> I bought this and thought they were pretty until I tried to use them.</li>
            <li> The handle on the \\&quot;powder bush\\&quot; came detached the first time I used them.</li>
            <li> The carrying case looks like a faux leather which I find to be pretty stylish.\&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to worry about  putting too much makeup on with these brushes because they won&#x27;t allow you to!</li>
            <li> manufacturer recommends that you wash your brushes before you use them for the first time.  </li>
            <li> would love to see a set with all different powder/blush/bronzer/kabuki/buffer brushes.</li>
            <li> Overall a decent set with natural mink, at a good price.</li>
            <li> Bristles are a little soft, otherwise great brushes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice a huge difference between my synthetic brushes compared to these as far as make-up application.  </li>
            <li> Normally, I washed every single brush before the first use, and I used warm water and baby-shampoo.</li>
            <li> They are super soft!</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> The brushes are really full and really soft and there wasn&#x27;t any shedding.</li>
            <li> It did glue back on fairly easily</li>
            <li> SUPER SOFT BRUSHES AND</li>
            <li> The brushes are incredibly soft and full, and they work really well for face powders.</li>
            <li> I washed them as recommended before use and the head of the large brush</li>
            <li> I was looking for a set that included a large kabuki brush to use with my mineral makeup.</li>
            <li> The brush is a bit large but I just scrunched it a bit when applying the powder in the areas that needed control.</li>
            <li> The big Kabuki is fine, and the eyeliner brush, but I don&#x27;t wear much makeup aside from eye makeup and concealer.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good set of brushes mainly blush brushes and small detail brushes</li>
            <li> They are much softer than I thought they would be for their price</li>
            <li> I really like the feel of the mink hair</li>
            <li> THANKS AGAIN</li>
            <li> I absolutely rate them with Mac and Bobby Brown quality.</li>
            <li> This set has really helped me improve my look.</li>
            <li> These brushes come in a very professional-looking faux leather roll-up bag.  </li>
            <li> The whole brush set was very smelly, just like others mentioned.</li>
            <li> no broken arm or leg  </li>
            <li> * much.</li>
            <li> And if you&#x27;re a amazon prime member of course the shipping is fast.</li>
            <li> Real Review by a Real Person.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t believe it was a real leather pouch.</li>
            <li> I regret making this purchase, but it&#x27;d be good for a big foundation and powder fan, especially if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.    </li>
            <li> The large Kabuki brush is particularly</li>
            <li> But as other reviewers have pointed out, the travel case for these brushes has a most pungent, repugnant smell.  </li>
            <li> Most of the other sets included tons of brushes that I did not need.</li>
            <li> I agree with madmazel this product is much better than other brand names out there  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend   luv the packaging and fast shipment   its shick and</li>
            <li> I purchased these to replace older synthetic brushes I have had for 15 years.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re into pro makeup, this can be a standby set but not your main brush set.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly care for the powder/foundation brush as for me</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> it   highly recommended.   </li>
            <li> High quality  </li>
            <li> and when I opened the box I was amazed with how high quality these brushes are.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend</li>
            <li> the large kabuki (in my opinion) cant be used to directly apply powder/foundation.</li>
            <li> I really feel that I have been ripped off by other companies after finding this brush set because they are charging the same price for one of their cheaper brushes for the price of this whole kit and this kit has better quality.</li>
            <li> The brushes themselves are as soft as you can imagine and are quite a step up for me when I compare them to the discount store offerings or even the artistic stores such as Michael&#x27;s or H&amp;H Supply.  </li>
            <li> The brushes look nice and the hair feels very soft ad thick.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the less positive reviews, I  made sure to double check everything.  </li>
            <li> Extremely high-quality brushes (and the Kabuki&#x27;s huge).</li>
            <li> I have seen a lot of other sets not come with one, and I find those to be important.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set for myself and my little sister (who is far more of a make-up goddess than I).  </li>
            <li> i bought a new case for because nothing got rid of the smell not even setting it out a month</li>
            <li> purchased new makeup.</li>
            <li> I found out a new trick that you can do with the eye brow comb.</li>
            <li> I brought this set for my mom and she says it&#x27;s very soft and well put together.</li>
            <li> Very soft</li>
            <li> The bristles of these brushes are very soft and work well for applying makeup.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t affect the general efficiency of the whole package.</li>
            <li> The selection isn&#x27;t very good (basically no eye brushes, and the one they did include is a sponge!), and when I tried to use the small flat brush as a concealer brush it was so rough it scratched up my eye area and made it red.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve also had the sephora and they cost more than 100 to 150 dollars and their quality is not better than this shany set.</li>
            <li> #7 is Medium, when the bristles&#x27; size is exactly the opposite.</li>
            <li> These brushes are high quality, it is soft and not harsh to put makeup on.</li>
            <li> I wanted new brushes to replace my old ones.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much larger than the image shows...almost excessively large.  </li>
            <li> as long as you clean the brushes frequently they should last awhile.</li>
            <li> They are soft and silky I have been using them for over four months now.  </li>
            <li> yes yes yes they are soft  </li>
            <li> Soft bristles.</li>
            <li> I DID NOT EXPECT THIS BRUSH TO BE AS SOFT</li>
            <li> They are so soft, and they are generously sized.  </li>
            <li> They are soft with no breakage.</li>
            <li> and also the big brush, which makes my make up much easier.</li>
            <li> soft on skin   </li>
            <li> I can not imagine any professional using them.</li>
            <li> I was worried about them being so soft they could not hold any makeup</li>
            <li> and I found it completely changed the look of my powder.</li>
            <li> The bristles seem soft, and the handles are sturdy, but if they come unglued</li>
            <li> I needed to replace my old make-up brushes that are at least 15 years old or more...</li>
            <li> Even a professional could pull these out</li>
            <li> They are soft and so far they haven&#x27;t shed *too</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s soft for something synthetic but will not hold up for years and years</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the quality of these brushes.  </li>
            <li> I had my old ones for 30 years.</li>
            <li> These are baby soft and do not shed at all.</li>
            <li> Def professional quality.</li>
            <li> these are too soft and it makes applying pressed power take quite a while.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping this set would replace all my old brushes completely</li>
            <li> For me, the big brush is worth the price of the entire set.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that good especially when the biggest brush reached me in a broken state.</li>
            <li> glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the bristles are too soft and as such,only good for casual use.</li>
            <li> I bought these based on other reviews since it&#x27;s hard to know without seeing and touching them first.</li>
            <li> ︎ I paid particular attention to the larger brushes, checking them both before and after cleaning for shedding bristles.  </li>
            <li> The little black bag it comes in is also a nice touch.</li>
            <li> would use no other ones!</li>
            <li> Brush is so soft it barely holds the blush powder.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft to the touch and hope they will last for a while.</li>
            <li> The case the brushes came in does have a slight smell but not bad enough for me not to use it.</li>
            <li> While there are special makeup brush cleaners that you can buy, Shany recommends ordinary shampoo.  </li>
            <li> These brushes are made of animal hair -- mink and badger -- so those who object to such things should steer clear and look instead for synthetic brushes.  </li>
            <li> BY SAYING THAT THIS IS MY BOYFRIEND, BECAUSE THIS BRUSH IS SOOOO BIG AND SOFT</li>
            <li> I bought this set as a gift for my 26year old sister as her Christmas present.</li>
            <li> This 7 piece brush set is different from others as it is made with 100% natural hair and comes in a variety of styles and shapes.</li>
            <li> I have purchased makeup brushes from groupon that were retailed for 3x the price of these brushes and they were a complete disaster and left bristles on my face while doing my makeup.</li>
            <li> The three larger brushes have bristles made of mink hair and are very soft, while the smaller ones are made of badger hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▶</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t really shed like like my other brushes did either.</li>
            <li> I wish there was one brush that was indeed a blush brush, one where the bristles are longer in the center of the head as one of my 25 yr old natural bristle brushes is.  </li>
            <li> Other than the minimal, normal, new brush shedding, this set had far exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, dry skin</li>
            <li> The second set broke in exactly the same spot as the first, but unfortunately it was 31 days after the purchase, so I was only given a partial refund.  </li>
            <li> So I was in desperate need of some new makeup brushes that was budget friendly but reliable.</li>
            <li> these brushes are soooo soft and you get every brush u need in one little packet that you can carry around.</li>
            <li> The case is nice and the smell is not that bad.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with the brow brush/comb piece, it is plastic and seems to have synthetic fibers, a cheap piece.  </li>
            <li> This cosmetic brush set is a high-quality collection of silky and firm brushes, all stored in a soft, foldable pouch.  </li>
            <li> One for me and the other for my sister and noticed her big brush was also pulled away from the handle.  </li>
            <li> I let the brushes dry on the edge of the sink, and in the end, the smell was almost gone.</li>
            <li> but my knowledge is limited</li>
            <li> , the bristles are soft, well put together and I like the fact that they include a small pamphlet they tells you what each brush is for.</li>
            <li> I purchased these brushes and the first set came in broken.  </li>
            <li> I have not had any loose hairs come out while I have used the brushes so that is a plus.</li>
            <li> THEN I EXPECTED, AND</li>
            <li> and i like it except that the powder brush was a bit rough on my skin since i have a sensetive skin.</li>
            <li> Have used the brushes only a few days</li>
            <li> The  brushes all feature a flat bottom so that they will stand and are firmly attached to the handles.  </li>
            <li> The case, as mentioned by other reviewers, had a plastic-leathery-stored-in-a-box smell, but just leave it out on a table for a couple of days, and it&#x27;ll disappear.</li>
            <li> and i wanted to give you guys some other info   </li>
            <li> TO GET THE SMELL OUT OF THE BRUSHES, OTHER THAN THAT</li>
            <li> The other 2 medium sized brushes work well for me with blush, bronzer, and highlighter.</li>
            <li> Because these brushes work extremely well.</li>
            <li> Have not tried to other brushes yet so cannot review.</li>
            <li> The brushes are made out of mink so if you are not interested in products that contain these things, do not buy.</li>
            <li> i washed my brushes and they fell apart due to the water loosening whatever glue they used to put these together.</li>
            <li> These brushes also shed much less than my other ones.</li>
            <li> I find they work very well on expensive cosmetic products though.  </li>
            <li> I had ordered two sets for my daughters for Christmas which I also will return today as if they are such poor quality I don&#x27;t want to risk them breaking after minimal use.</li>
            <li> what a mess.</li>
            <li> All in all, a little overpriced for my needs, hence the rating.</li>
            <li> After a few times washing it, the Kabuki fell apart.</li>
            <li> I sent it back and today received the replacement and darned if the kabuki brush in this set is broken as well.  </li>
            <li> The bristles all seemed firmly attached.  </li>
            <li> SO... found my one natural bristle brush-great, but wrong size.</li>
            <li> but I use them everyday.</li>
            <li> Handles broke from brush in just a few uses.</li>
            <li> These brushes apply makeup average but are not top quality and are not durable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll do for a few months.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> The case stinks  to high heaven.</li>
            <li> The largest brush broke away from the handle and in reading other reviews, I see that this is a common complaint.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s up with e negative reviews</li>
            <li> These brushes are a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> The second reason is because they smelled so bad.</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> I have yet to use the smaller brushes, but I don&#x27;t see myself being disappointed.</li>
            <li> Broken on arrival.</li>
            <li> and since I&#x27;m addicted to Amazon</li>
            <li> I purchased one set for myself, and when they arrived the kabuki brush was broken, it looks like it came unglued.</li>
            <li> Probably, others will be broken soon.</li>
            <li> The black plastic case they come in SMELLS really bad.</li>
            <li> It came with a very horrible plastic smell and it needs to be aired out.</li>
            <li> Alot of people was complaining about a weird stinch coming from the set, like forementioned it may have been the scent from the leather/vinyl case.</li>
            <li> Also, including a sponge applicator in a brush set is a bit disappointing as sponge applicators are often included in makeup purchases.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I get these.  </li>
            <li> I bought these brushes because I was attracted by the fact that they were mink fur, but I have to say I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment!</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It had a really terrible chemical-plastic smell that to this day hasn&#x27;t gone away.</li>
            <li> but the case smelled horribly so when i gave the brushes as a gitf to my mother</li>
            <li> You can use the comb side for eyelashes too and it takes off the nasty flakes.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The brushes are soft and just the ones I need to apply powder, blush, foundation and eye shadow, but the finish of the brushes look cheap. Not well made at all. The case is nice and the smell is not that bad.</li>
            <li> Great quality for the price!</li>
            <li> Brushes are cheap and poorly made.  I never used them,</li>
            <li> I purchased these to replace older synthetic brushes I have had for 15 years.  They are soft and silky I have been using them for over four months now.  I washed them as recommended before use and the head of the large brush fell off.  It did glue back on fairly easily but this did make me question the quality.  The brushes work well.  I don&#x27;t really notice a huge difference between my synthetic brushes compared to these as far as make-up application.  I have not had any loose hairs come out while I have used the brushes so that is a plus.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price on these well-made, versatile cosmetic brushes.  But as other reviewers have pointed out, the travel case for these brushes has a most pungent, repugnant smell.  I threw my case away immediately.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a good brush set, and the best deal at the same time, look no further. The Shany 9pc does not compromise on quality. The brushes are the way they should be, and the case is of very good quality.</li>
            <li> Extremely high-quality brushes (and the Kabuki&#x27;s huge). The case, as mentioned by other reviewers, had a plastic-leathery-stored-in-a-box smell, but just leave it out on a table for a couple of days, and it&#x27;ll disappear. Doesn&#x27;t affect the general efficiency of the whole package.</li>
            <li> I really love this brush set. I was looking for a set that included a large kabuki brush to use with my mineral makeup. Most of the other sets included tons of brushes that I did not need. This set is perfect and the quality is better than the brushes that can be found in the local drug store. I recommend this set to those who don&#x27;t want to shell out a ton of money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set for myself and my little sister (who is far more of a make-up goddess than I).  Other than the minimal, normal, new brush shedding, this set had far exceeded my expectations.  It feels so good on your skin while applying make-up.  I would highly recommend.  I did not notice any stench of the bag.</li>
            <li> I needed a cheap set of brushes and these fit the bill quality and price-wise. I was very impressed by the quality of the brushes but the bag was awful. It had a really terrible chemical-plastic smell that to this day hasn&#x27;t gone away. However all of the brushes fit into my travel-size makeup bag. The only noticeable problem with the brushes is that they retained some of the odd-smell of the bag. Hopefully, with more time, it will go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend these as great first-time makeup brush buyers or for those who travel often. They are much softer than I thought they would be for their price and they apply marvelously.</li>
            <li> yes yes yes they are soft  they have such a elegant look that you feel like you dont wanna use em and keep em clean like that for eveeeeeeerd  &lt;3 all over d place  wat is surprising is the low price for this set   im bying 3 more right now and giving em out to my friends  so I came back here and i wanted to give you guys some other info   i bought this set a year ago and im still using it   the quality is in really good shape the brushes are still soft :D and everything is in one piece   so i just wanted to thank the maker for this cutee   it is one of purchases that i dont regret and i always feel good abt it   highly recommended.   ps my friends are still pleased and guess what we are recommending it to more ppl</li>
            <li> These are nice and worth the money, but please know the handles come apart from the brush as they are only glued on and not glued on well.  The big kabuki brush handle broke off the second day I had them.  With that said, it&#x27;s still usable.  I really like the feel of the mink hair and they are easy to clean.  Also, this is the largest kabuki brush I have ever seen, lol.  It&#x27;s much larger than the image shows...almost excessively large.  So just FYI.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I get these.  It has a sponge applicator (which I didn&#x27;t want) for eyes.  The facial brushes were nice but nothing good for the eyes. I returned them.</li>
            <li> Brushes shed. Soft bristles. But not the quality I expected.would not recommend. Purchase expense separate brushes. I only use these for travel now</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes because I was attracted by the fact that they were mink fur, but I have to say I&#x27;m disappointed. The selection isn&#x27;t very good (basically no eye brushes, and the one they did include is a sponge!), and when I tried to use the small flat brush as a concealer brush it was so rough it scratched up my eye area and made it red. The big Kabuki is fine, and the eyeliner brush, but I don&#x27;t wear much makeup aside from eye makeup and concealer. I regret making this purchase, but it&#x27;d be good for a big foundation and powder fan, especially if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.    *EDIT* After a few times washing it, the Kabuki fell apart. I&#x27;d give this two stars if I could but Amazon doesn&#x27;t let you change the star rating!</li>
            <li> I bought this more for the bag than the brushes, to replace my bag which was getting old.  The brushes included are good quality, but the bag had a STRONG chemical smell!  I set it out on a shelf in my bathroom for a week, hoping the smell would fade, but it didn&#x27;t.  The smell ruined brushes too.  I don&#x27;t have allergies or scent issues, but this was way, WAY too much!  I ended up returning it.  What a disappointment!</li>
            <li> This is my travel bag of brushes, love the feel, have had others like this years ago.  Been looking for them and finally foung what I wanted.  These are wonderful, soft and just the right size. Easy to take with me. Thanks for a great Product. and thank you Amazon for haveing this customer for me to buy from .</li>
            <li> The hair shreds.  Two brushes have come unglued.  Looked nice but not made well.  I am really disappointed with my purchase.</li>
            <li> ALL I&#x27;M GOING TO SAY IS I LOVE THIS BRUSH SET, THIS IS MY SECOND I PURCHASE, SO I&#x27;M GOING TO START OUT WITH THE KUBIKI BRUSH, LET ME TELL YOU BY SAYING THAT THIS IS MY BOYFRIEND, BECAUSE THIS BRUSH IS SOOOO BIG AND SOFT I DID NOT EXPECT THIS BRUSH TO BE AS SOFT AS IT STATED, TO ME IT WAS WAY BETTER THEN I EXPECTED, AND THIS WILL BE THE FIRST THING TO GET CLOSE TO MY FACE WHEN I APPLY MY MAKEUP IN THE MORNING. ALL BRUSHES DID NOT HAVE ANY SHEDDING AT ALL WHAT SO EVER. THE POUCH BAG HAD A STRONG SMELL, SO I HUNG IT UP TO AIR OUT. I WILL GIVE ALL MY BRUSHES A GOOD SHAMPOOING TO GET THE SMELL OUT OF THE BRUSHES, OTHER THAN THAT I LOVEEEEE MY BRUSHES. THANKS AGAIN SHANY FOR MAKING ME A VERY HAPPY PERSON. aka MSLADYLOCKS</li>
            <li> well they were a really nice and soft  but the case smelled horribly so when i gave the brushes as a gitf to my mother i bought a new case for because nothing got rid of the smell not even setting it out a month so i bought a new case entirely other then that the brushes were fabulous she loved them and said they are great for traveling</li>
            <li> Just love these  awesome price too</li>
            <li> I purchased these brushes and the first set came in broken.  The return went smoothly, so I purchased another set thinking it was a fluke.  The second set broke in exactly the same spot as the first, but unfortunately it was 31 days after the purchase, so I was only given a partial refund.  I would not buy.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my daughter and she loves them! They are super soft! This is a great buy!</li>
            <li> These brushes are beautiful. For me, the big brush is worth the price of the entire set. The brushes are incredibly soft and full, and they work really well for face powders. I&#x27;ve used the largest brush mainly for setting powder, and I love it. The other 2 medium sized brushes work well for me with blush, bronzer, and highlighter. I have yet to use the smaller brushes, but I don&#x27;t see myself being disappointed. Love!</li>
            <li> I bought these based on other reviews since it&#x27;s hard to know without seeing and touching them first. I absolutely rate them with Mac and Bobby Brown quality. As for the smell people talk about, mine came &amp;#34;smell free&amp;#34;. Thanks again Amazon for another great purchase!!</li>
            <li> The quality and softness on most of the brushes is very good with natural mink.  I have very sensitive, dry skin and this product does not irritate it at all.  Makeup coverage is smooth and even. The precision of the eye brushes is very good, I have flawlessly applied powder eyeliner with the angled brush.  I was not impressed with the brow brush/comb piece, it is plastic and seems to have synthetic fibers, a cheap piece.  Also, including a sponge applicator in a brush set is a bit disappointing as sponge applicators are often included in makeup purchases.  Overall a decent set with natural mink, at a good price.</li>
            <li> GREAT FOR TRAVEL!  AND GREAT FOR EVERYDAY USE.  SUPER SOFT BRUSHES AND THEY ARE THAT THEIR BEST WHEN USED WITH MINERAL PRODUCTS    ITS A MUST HAVE</li>
            <li> This is a nice brush set. I have not used many different brush sets but this does apply make up well. I do like it but my knowledge is limited</li>
            <li> I brought this set for my mom and she says it&#x27;s very soft and well put together. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s up with e negative reviews but maybe they just got a batch or something. Because these brushes work extremely well. They don&#x27;t really shed like like my other brushes did either.</li>
            <li> It comes in 7 piece of brushes and also a bag. These brushes are high quality, it is soft and not harsh to put makeup on.</li>
            <li> Great quality for its price. Much better than what I expected and would most certainly buy again. Bought as a gift as it was also loved</li>
            <li> These brushes are soooooooooo soft and good at applying make-up without soaking it all up in the bristles. They feel very good against my skin! Some people were bothered by the smell of the carrying case, but I didnt note it to be a very strong scent at all.</li>
            <li> The brushes feel amazing!  I have not seen a better overall price value for this kind of quality!  Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! Very soft and they don&#x27;t shed at all. No smell like some if the reviews had said. Great product for the price and very pretty as well</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:2d4fc70c1f8fd2bf5c27c5d35241534c]] This cosmetic brush set is a high-quality collection of silky and firm brushes, all stored in a soft, foldable pouch.  These brushes are made of animal hair -- mink and badger -- so those who object to such things should steer clear and look instead for synthetic brushes.  But, wow, the mink brushes are super soft and silky, with a dense texture that is perfect for applying powders.  Watch the video for a close-up tour of the set.  Note:  I received a sample for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</li>
            <li> This is my first set of brushes and I think they are great.  They seem very well made are nicely sized.  This set has really helped me improve my look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the brushes for 4 months now and they are still like the day I bought them.  They are so soft, and they are generously sized.  None of the hairs have ever fallen out.  I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> Broken on arrival. This is unacceptable. A stronger adhesive to ensure durability would have been appropriate. Heed the following advice: Save Your Money.</li>
            <li> These are some of the best brushes that I have. The are supersoft and perfect for light-to medium coverage. I use them for both liquid and mineral foundation without any issue.  I have had them for a while now and they are still holdind up perfectly. Brushes like this can easily cost you over the amount of Shany&#x27;s full set. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting a set of nicer make up brushes for some time now and since I&#x27;m addicted to Amazon I thought I would give these a try.  I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  I&#x27;ve had these for over a month now and even with daily use they are holding up beautifully.  They are soft with no breakage.</li>
            <li> Bristles are a little soft, otherwise great brushes.</li>
            <li> Brush is so soft it barely holds the blush powder. Have not tried to other brushes yet so cannot review.</li>
            <li> I love them for mineral makeup. No problem with shedding. I washed  brushes &amp; bag when I first received them.</li>
            <li> My wife said that she was really happy to get these amazing real animal bristles in a set of brushes.</li>
            <li> i have this brush set and they are simply just amazing. i can honestly say they are much better than sephora and mac sets because ive had those also. a while ago my friend bought me the mac brush set as a gift and i like it except that the powder brush was a bit rough on my skin since i have a sensetive skin. i&#x27;ve also had the sephora and they cost more than 100 to 150 dollars and their quality is not better than this shany set. these brushes are soooo soft and you get every brush u need in one little packet that you can carry around. the price is unblieveble and one more thing that i love is that they have flat bottoms so you can set them on the table upright without them rolling off or getting makeup on your satation.</li>
            <li> These brushes come in a very professional-looking faux leather roll-up bag.  The brushes themselves are as soft as you can imagine and are quite a step up for me when I compare them to the discount store offerings or even the artistic stores such as Michael&#x27;s or H&amp;H Supply.  They are definitely living up to the claim.</li>
            <li> The whole brush set was very smelly, just like others mentioned. Normally, I washed every single brush before the first use, and I used warm water and baby-shampoo. I let the brushes dry on the edge of the sink, and in the end, the smell was almost gone. I had to wash the pouch as well, since it smelled more intense than the brushes. The brushes are very soft to the touch and hope they will last for a while. I wanted a brush set made of natural hairs, and one that had a good variety of brushes. This set comes exactly as advertised, but I don&#x27;t seem to understand why brush #6 is called Small Blush Brush, and brush #7 is Medium, when the bristles&#x27; size is exactly the opposite. For now, I am a pleased customer.</li>
            <li> They are terribly soft and the bag is totally fine, no smell at all. the handles look well made as well. as long as you clean the brushes frequently they should last awhile.</li>
            <li> i like the eyebrow brush in it. and also the big brush, which makes my make up much easier.</li>
            <li> I bought this set as a gift for my 26year old sister as her Christmas present. She totally loves it! This is her first cosmetic brush set and she was just as excited as I was about it. The brushes are really full and really soft and there wasn&#x27;t any shedding. Alot of people was complaining about a weird stinch coming from the set, like forementioned it may have been the scent from the leather/vinyl case. I ensured to let it air out a bit before i wrapped it and gave it to her. The scent was not as drastic as others made it seem, but it did go away after airing for a day or two. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to purchase a first-time brush set or if you just like what comes in the set. Overall, the brushes are really full, nice and soft and I feel as if the price is good for the value.</li>
            <li> These brushes were exactly what they said they were.  I had ordered some last year and was pleased with the quality.  These are the same great quality.</li>
            <li> I agree with madmazel this product is much better than other brand names out there  im actually impressed   High quality  soft on skin   Ive had it for a month no broken arm or leg  I highly recommend   luv the packaging and fast shipment   its shick and unique   good good all good news</li>
            <li> Just what I was searching for after using the mink brushes from another venue for over 20 years.  Excellent replacement.</li>
            <li> I bought this and thought they were pretty until I tried to use them. Immediately the largest one broke and now the smallest brush broke. Basically these brushes are held together with glue and it will wear off. I&#x27;m never buying this brand again. Beware!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes they are nice and soft and when I do my makeup I don&#x27;t see a lot of fall out.</li>
            <li> I really feel that I have been ripped off by other companies after finding this brush set because they are charging the same price for one of their cheaper brushes for the price of this whole kit and this kit has better quality. The brushes are so soft and the apply my makeup flawlessly and effortlessly. These brushes also shed much less than my other ones. What a great find!!</li>
            <li> No shedding, the makeup goes on nicely and I&#x27;m really happy with this purchase! I would let a lot know about these wonderful brushes!</li>
            <li> I am impressed by the leather-like roll container for the brushes, the length is great for travel or purse as well as home, the bristles are indeed soft, but on some blushes, they don&#x27;t \\&quot;grab\\&quot; the tint.  I find they work very well on expensive cosmetic products though.  I wish there was one brush that was indeed a blush brush, one where the bristles are longer in the center of the head as one of my 25 yr old natural bristle brushes is.  I really only use 3 of the brushes as I have an assortment of kabuki brushes, too.  All in all, a little overpriced for my needs, hence the rating.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good set of brushes mainly blush brushes and small detail brushes but they are great to make your makeup look great</li>
            <li> these brushes were for my daughter in law. they were a hit, she loves them. Awesome set of brushes.</li>
            <li> These brushes are a big disappointment. I can not imagine any professional using them. The handle on the \\&quot;powder bush\\&quot; came detached the first time I used them. The others are coming detached as well. The brush blush had no substance to it. Do NOT recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a brush set that did not cost me an arm and a leg and I found it in this set. When I got the package (it only took a week to get here), I was thoroughly pleased. The packaging was really nice and when I opened the box I was amazed with how high quality these brushes are. Even my mother, who is a makeup snob, was impressed. The carrying case looks like a faux leather which I find to be pretty stylish.\&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are super soft and I love it! I was worried about them being so soft they could not hold any makeup but that is not the case. I used the biggest brush to apply my powder and I found it completely changed the look of my powder. It made it light and it made my face look refreshed. You don&#x27;t have to worry about  putting too much makeup on with these brushes because they won&#x27;t allow you to! The brush is a bit large but I just scrunched it a bit when applying the powder in the areas that needed control. I do plan on using the second largest brush for foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> The bristles of these brushes are very soft and work well for applying makeup.  The largest brush broke away from the handle and in reading other reviews, I see that this is a common complaint.  I bought two sets.  One for me and the other for my sister and noticed her big brush was also pulled away from the handle.  I was hoping the set would come with some user tips and instructions for cleaning, etc. but it didn&#x27;t.  I printed the description from the product on amazon to wrap with the gift so she would have some information.  I think for the price, the product was pretty good.</li>
            <li> These are some of my go to brushes. They are very well made and nicely sized. Perfect for traveling. Overall a great product.</li>
            <li> When I am going to buy brushes from Shany, this is the type that I will buy.  This is because the brushes are long lasting, and will continue to have good use for years after being bought because the bag will ensure that the brushes will stay good for a long time.  I do feel that these brushes are a must buy.</li>
            <li> I purchased one set for myself, and when they arrived the kabuki brush was broken, it looks like it came unglued. I sent it back and today received the replacement and darned if the kabuki brush in this set is broken as well.  I had ordered two sets for my daughters for Christmas which I also will return today as if they are such poor quality I don&#x27;t want to risk them breaking after minimal use. The bristles seem soft, and the handles are sturdy, but if they come unglued so easilty I don&#x27;t think most people would be happy with them.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how much my daughter will love them, but they look like a really good set of brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes look nice and the hair feels very soft ad thick. The only downfall I didn&#x27;t like is the case had a chemical like smell, I would defiantly suggest washing these before using them. Other than that they are great. I would recommend them.</li>
            <li> I needed to replace my old make-up brushes that are at least 15 years old or more...I searched for just a basic brush set, and I bought these for the price. I was really pleased with the quality, packaging etc. But the ultimate test is when using them the hairs do NOT fall off on your skin...These passed the test w/flying colors. This brush set is perfect for the at home makeup kit. Even a professional could pull these out and I would be impressed. This set would make an excellent bridesmaid gift, or any lady who wears make-up. The brushes are made out of mink so if you are not interested in products that contain these things, do not buy.</li>
            <li> I quite like the [[ASIN:B0032DHP6O SHANY Studio Quality Cosmetic Brush Set, 7 Piece with Bag]] that arrived  last week.  After reading some of the less positive reviews, I  made sure to double check everything.  The set is attractively packaged in a compartmented, easy-to-pack leather-look roll that seems to be well constructed with no loose or faulty stitching.  The  brushes all feature a flat bottom so that they will stand and are firmly attached to the handles.  The three larger brushes have bristles made of mink hair and are very soft, while the smaller ones are made of badger hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▶︎ I paid particular attention to the larger brushes, checking them both before and after cleaning for shedding bristles.  The bristles all seemed firmly attached.  The large Kabuki brush is particularly nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer recommends that you wash your brushes before you use them for the first time.  While there are special makeup brush cleaners that you can buy, Shany recommends ordinary shampoo.  Many makeup artists also use conditioner when they clean with shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▶︎ Either lay your brushes on the counter with the bristles hanging over the sink so that the brush does not flatten during drying or lay them on a towel, turning several times to preserve the shape.  (You can also use a blow dryer.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grandma&#x27;s $0.02 - The [[ASIN:B0032DHP6O SHANY Studio Quality Cosmetic Brush Set, 7 Piece with Bag]] is a nice, well made set of basic cosmetic brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended</li>
            <li> I love these! How cute is the kabuki, by the way?! These brushes are perfect to add to your collection! I love the eyebrow tool, too. I have seen a lot of other sets not come with one, and I find those to be important.</li>
            <li> The brushes arrived fast, I&#x27;m very pleased with these brushes. They are soft and of good quality. I highly recommend</li>
            <li> Shipped faster than I thought they would, brushes are incredibly soft and good quality.</li>
            <li> here&#x27;s my story... purchased new makeup. turned out to be a cream powder. tried my eco friendly synthetic hair brushes. what a mess. SO... found my one natural bristle brush-great, but wrong size. hunted these brushes up. they are very good quality and VERY soft.  the large kabuki (in my opinion) cant be used to directly apply powder/foundation. it buffs it out nicely though. the blush brushes worked well for blush and bronzer. don&#x27;t need the others so haven&#x27;t tried them. would love to see a set with all different powder/blush/bronzer/kabuki/buffer brushes. recommend this set.</li>
            <li> These are pretty nice. They are soft and so far they haven&#x27;t shed *too* much. The black plastic case they come in SMELLS really bad. Also, I did not know that they were mink when I bought them... I prolly wouldn&#x27;t have bought them if I had read that.</li>
            <li> Seems like a good product but a really toxic smell greets you when you open the product.</li>
            <li> This 7 piece brush set is different from others as it is made with 100% natural hair and comes in a variety of styles and shapes. The little black bag it comes in is also a nice touch. The price is also great. These are easy to use.</li>
            <li> I own a whole range of face and eye brushes from MAC and The Body Shop. Bristles-wise this is in the middle regarding quality-it&#x27;s soft for something synthetic but will not hold up for years and years (my MAC and TBS brushes are now 5 years old and still going strong).I gave this the benefit of the doubt as it&#x27;s gotten a lot of good reviews.It&#x27;s not that good especially when the biggest brush reached me in a broken state.I&#x27;d return this if I weren&#x27;t in Australia (where a kabuki brush from MAC is 88 AUD from MAC) but the postage would probably cost me more. I&#x27;ll try fixing this with super glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the bristles are too soft and as such,only good for casual use. I bought this particularly for when I travel as I like the idea of it having it&#x27;s own case. It came with a very horrible plastic smell and it needs to be aired out.Washing these would also be a good idea before first use as well.Any brush that&#x27;s too soft will probably pick up a lot of your product but will retain it as well, more than it going to your face.If you&#x27;re into pro makeup, this can be a standby set but not your main brush set.</li>
            <li> The handles come off, garbage, garbage, garbage, garbage. DO NOT by these at any cost. The case stinks  to high heaven. Stay away!</li>
            <li> Arrived timely. Great packaging. The case the brushes came in does have a slight smell but not bad enough for me not to use it. The brushes are very soft. Have used the brushes only a few days but no bristles have come out. I am happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> So I was in desperate need of some new makeup brushes that was budget friendly but reliable. And I must say there are no complaints honestly. I have purchased makeup brushes from groupon that were retailed for 3x the price of these brushes and they were a complete disaster and left bristles on my face while doing my makeup. But with these SHANY brushes they are wonderful they don&#x27;t leave any brush streaks, the bristles are soft, well put together and I like the fact that they include a small pamphlet they tells you what each brush is for. And if you&#x27;re a amazon prime member of course the shipping is fast. I ordered on a Thursday evening and received them Saturday. Real Review by a Real Person.</li>
            <li> I returned these for 2 reasons. I thought they were travel size since they came with a bag but they were full size. The second reason is because they smelled so bad. I think it might just be the bag.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the quality of these brushes.  They are gorgeous and soft and work wonderfully.  The compact size makes them great for travel... but I use them everyday.</li>
            <li> I wanted new brushes to replace my old ones. They are falling apart already. I had my old ones for 30 years. I haven&#x27;t had these for 30 days. Not good.</li>
            <li> these brushes are awesome quality! you can&#x27;t beat it! I love using them! would use no other ones! they work great and no fall out!</li>
            <li> Another great SHANY brush set...all of them are FANTASTIC fyi. These are baby soft and do not shed at all. The results you will achieve are amazing! Def professional quality.</li>
            <li> They are shorter brushes, but they are so dense and work so well that it doesn&#x27;t even matter. I love the kabuki and the powder brush. They are my favorite and they get the job done with an A+</li>
            <li> These are a great set of brushes!&lt;br /&gt;I really love that all of Shanys brushes are PETA approved as well!</li>
            <li> I love this set of brushes! My two favorite brushes from this set are the blush brush and the angled brush! Works great! The quality of the brushes are good! Soft &amp; Smooth!</li>
            <li> Nice quality for the price.  I don&#x27;t particularly care for the powder/foundation brush as for me these are too soft and it makes applying pressed power take quite a while.  My original pressed powder brush is denser and with slightly stiffer bristles and it applies powder so nicely.  I was hoping this set would replace all my old brushes completely but it looks as though I&#x27;ll need to be mixing and matching.  I do like the concealer brush from this set.  The blending brush also does a nice job of finishing off looks.  In the end I&#x27;m happy I purchased.  This would be a good first set for a teenager or someone just starting with brushes.</li>
            <li> Nice brushes would recommend</li>
            <li> One brush was detached from the handle before using it. Probably, others will be broken soon. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the kit to anyone.</li>
            <li> Super soft bristles make this a really great set.  Seems to be good quality and after a few months, they are still holding up great.</li>
            <li> Handles broke from brush in just a few uses.</li>
            <li> These brushes apply makeup average but are not top quality and are not durable. i washed my brushes and they fell apart due to the water loosening whatever glue they used to put these together. i still use just the top part. these are starter brushes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. It&#x27;ll do for a few months.</li>
            <li> These are a perfect set for any use! I use it everyday. I found out a new trick that you can do with the eye brow comb. You can use the comb side for eyelashes too and it takes off the nasty flakes.</li>
            <li> Just as described! Quick ship, and great quality product... Will recommend to others. Couldn&#x27;t believe it was a real leather pouch.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husbands two secretaries and they were a big hit.  A beauty necessity that most women don&#x27;t want&lt;br /&gt;to spend their precious beauty dollars on.</li>
