            <li>and I LOVE</li>
            <li>My daughter loves it  and the results are really outstanding.</li>
            <li>swivel cord makes it even better.</li>
            <li>This product is ok, doesn&#x27;t heat like I would like it too since I have course hair.</li>
            <li>Works as described but found it had more of a crimping effect on my hair.  </li>
            <li>fav. now :)</li>
            <li>I love the size waves this gives.  </li>
            <li>Also look at a deeper curl waver if you want more formal waves.</li>
            <li>These are much more beach like</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length fine hair, and it waved it very easily.  </li>
            <li>Over all i can sayt his is good, the size of the curls are medium sized which is perfect to create small waves.</li>
            <li>problems so far and makes her hair look beautiful.  </li>
            <li>For me, it is quick and easy to use because I am just touching up already wavy hair, but I can see that it could take a while to use for an individual that is more concerned with waving every section perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Heats up very quickly and curls like a charm.</li>
            <li>Maybe this waver works as easily as the video shows/</li>
            <li>I have medium length hair, and I could easily hold the youwave to wave the roots.its</li>
            <li>The first time I used this, my hair looked amazing.</li>
            <li>This is surprising, since my hair is fine and normally curls easily.</li>
            <li>it is non-greasy, is light, and doesn&#x27;t make me feel like I have some sort of product in my hair.</li>
            <li>It gets very hot very quickly.  </li>
            <li>and they quickly responded saying they had another color.  </li>
            <li>Also very fast shipping!</li>
            <li>the lever is very flexibale and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is an easy to use wave iron and my daughter, who is so picky really loves it</li>
            <li>My teenager and her 10 year old sister love the three barrel styler.</li>
            <li>Just the right dimensions to get close to the roots.  </li>
            <li>I just used it for the first time</li>
            <li>Even better, I can control the way the back of my head looks-</li>
            <li>As for being worried about constant heat damage, I read many reviews about heat sprays.</li>
            <li>The first thing that caused an issue was the power button.  </li>
            <li>Its ok, I would only use it once in awhile.</li>
            <li>I bought the kind you can use on wet hair.</li>
            <li>Oh well, It heats up well and stays hot.</li>
            <li>really useful.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li>Admittedly, the first reason I went with it is because of the Conair name.  </li>
            <li>Its a pretty color, I just would have preferred orange.</li>
            <li>I would love the barrels to be a tad bigger but they still get the job done.  </li>
            <li>in case you didn&#x27;t know, it&#x27;ll be as hot as you need</li>
            <li>have slightly wavy hair that I wanted to give a more uniform texture and this waver creates a much more natural look than curling iron ringlets.  </li>
            <li>It is very sturdy, it doesn&#x27;t get so hot it burns their hands.</li>
            <li>The Conair triple barrel was a good bought, altought the size of the waves are small, it&#x60;s</li>
            <li>Previous to the one I own</li>
            <li>While this is the first waver I have purchased and cannot say this is a unique feature, I can attest that it works well on short (approx.</li>
            <li>really like the wavy look I get when I put my hair in braids overnight and take them out in the morning.</li>
            <li>This product really produces what it claims to do.</li>
            <li>I thought this was going to leave me with big sexy waves, but It looks more like I put a bunch of tiny braids in my hair, slept in it overnight, then took them out that next morning.</li>
            <li>So though I rated it 1 star, I&#x27;d really give it a 0 star</li>
            <li>It really gives them another option when it comes to curling their hair.</li>
            <li>Fast heat up time, and it works so well that i don&#x27;t even have to use product in my hair to get it to hold.</li>
            <li>I really like this waver.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it gets very hot.it goes up to 350Â°.</li>
            <li>far as the wave iron goes it is great, i was worried it would be too big for my daughters hair at shoulder length and thin and fine, but it is perfect and stays in a few days with just little touch up the next day.  </li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t think this would be hot enough</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve had the same Conair flat iron for over 5 years, and I love that thing too,</li>
            <li>It was a little overwhelming deciding on which one to purchase.  </li>
            <li>So many of them were reviewed as \\&quot;big, clunky\\&quot; and for \\&quot;long hair</li>
            <li>, IMO they are more gimmicky than truly functional, and I don&#x27;t want to have to run it over my hair 8-9 times to get the desired look, frying my hair in the process.</li>
            <li>Yes, you do need to use a product to keep it controlled, and yes, it will give you a very full, SLIGHTLY frizzy look if you continually run your fingers through it</li>
            <li>My hair is much less frizzy when I use this, but product must be used with it to define the waves and prevent it from becoming too poofy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>these new kinds of irons--the ones that supposedly give you waves or spiral curls,</li>
            <li>I think with these new irons</li>
            <li>I think with these new irons</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time today, and it totally gives me the after-braid look.</li>
            <li>After extensive research and review of many other wavers, this is the one I went with--glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Not too heavy and easy to use.</li>
            <li>A friend has the InStyler and used it on me last summer, and it does work the way the infomercial advertises, but I can&#x27;t say that it was better or easier than any other flat iron I&#x27;ve used, so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth paying the extra money just for the \\&quot;InStyler\\&quot; name.</li>
            <li>It might have worked if I&#x27;d held it in place a few seconds longer or went back over the same piece of hair 4-5 more times, but I want to style my hair, not fry it!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look natural but for the money</li>
            <li>My 10 year old has shoulder length hair</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re expecting your hair to look like the model&#x27;s hair on the box, then go hire a professional hair stylist.  </li>
            <li>I typically wear my hair straight and have gotten numerous compliments on my full, wavy hair.</li>
            <li>Be careful on the heat setting as I had it on the hottest setting which was too hot and scorched by hair.</li>
            <li>The company didn&#x27;t have the color that I had ordered, so I got a purple one instead, and not having the right color wasn&#x27;t a big deal as long as it was the same product.  </li>
            <li>last too!!I sleep wild</li>
            <li>However, my stylist says if you want a really good ceramic flat iron, one that does the least damage to your hair, makes it shinier, you need to spend at least $100, that price really DOES matter when it comes to flat irons.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like it that hot, then turn it down!  </li>
            <li>After giving it several tries, I can&#x27;t get a decent curl with this styler.</li>
            <li>need a new flat iron (speaking of styler products) and was thinking of going with the InStyler, which I see amazon.com now sells (that is the same as the one the infomercial sells), but as they had a few different types of InStyler (the same size, so I don&#x27;t know what exactly the difference was between them), I didn&#x27;t know which to go with, or simply buy another of the one I have.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The waves look really pretty whether you do a hard solid spritzy wave or a natural beachy look.them waves</li>

            <li> Next time I use it, I&#x27;ll probably leave it on the hair for less than 10 seconds for bigger waves ( I left it on for 10-20 seconds this time around).  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My wife purchased this item.  Her review follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this item based on the review that claimed it worked on above-the-shoulder hair.  While this is the first waver I have purchased and cannot say this is a unique feature, I can attest that it works well on short (approx. chin length) hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have slightly wavy hair that I wanted to give a more uniform texture and this waver creates a much more natural look than curling iron ringlets.  For me, it is quick and easy to use because I am just touching up already wavy hair, but I can see that it could take a while to use for an individual that is more concerned with waving every section perfectly.  My hair is much less frizzy when I use this, but product must be used with it to define the waves and prevent it from becoming too poofy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest con (the reason I gave 4 stars) is that because of the button placement, I tend to accidentally turn it off while using it even when I am careful.</li>
            <li> I wish I had this waver years ago. I just used it for the first time and I LOVE it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the wavy look I get when I put my hair in braids overnight and take them out in the morning. Of course, that method is safer for your hair because you&#x27;re not scorching it all the time, but I am not very good at making decent braids in my hair, especially for the back of my head. After I take the braids out, I always feel like the back is uneven and looks bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began researching 3-barrel irons to find something to give me the after-braid look. So many of them were reviewed as \\&quot;big, clunky\\&quot; and for \\&quot;long hair only.\\&quot; I have just above the shoulder-length hair, so I knew I had to find something smaller, but I didn&#x27;t want a crimper because those make a funky 80s hairdo. I had narrowed it down to a few irons, and I took a chance on this one- it did not have any reviews. However, I&#x27;ve had the same Conair flat iron for over 5 years, and I love that thing too, so I decided to give this Conair product a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you, I am thrilled with this purchase. Yes, 30 bucks is a little pricey, but 30-40 seems to be the price for a decent iron of this variety. I used it for the first time today, and it totally gives me the after-braid look. Even better, I can control the way the back of my head looks- no more worrying about making uneven/crummy braids. With my medium-to-short hair, it takes about 20 minutes to do- the amount of time it would take to braid my hair anyway. As for being worried about constant heat damage, I read many reviews about heat sprays. I purchased one that has good reviews and am pleased with it- it is non-greasy, is light, and doesn&#x27;t make me feel like I have some sort of product in my hair. It is: Tresemme Thermal Creations Heat Tamer Protective Spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want your hair to have the braided look, GO WITH THIS IRON!</li>
            <li> This product really produces what it claims to do. My daughter loves it  and the results are really outstanding. I  would recommend this sellers product to everyone. A+++</li>
            <li> THis product is great. Heats up very quickly and curls like a charm. Vry good for the price. it is not too heavya nd the lever is very flexibale and easy to use. swivel cord makes it even better. Over all i can sayt his is good, the size of the curls are medium sized which is perfect to create small waves.</li>
            <li> If you are looking to create simple loose, beachy waves this is your product! For tighter waves, hold the styler on your hair for closer to 10 seconds...for looser waves, closer to 5 seconds. I have been very impressed by the natural looking waves that this achieves. I typically wear my hair straight and have gotten numerous compliments on my full, wavy hair. You won&#x27;t regret your purchase!</li>
            <li> I love love this product! I can use it to have mermaid-like hairstyle and \\&quot;just woke up\\&quot; hairstyle and they look pretty good! I also used it to curl my hair for an 80s  and fairy themed party. Everybody loved my hairstyle!</li>
            <li> I just recived this item today and i am sooooo happy with it i did my moms hair with it and it turned out awesome! Also very fast shipping! I ordered it Feb. 20th and recived it today on feb. 21st!!!</li>
            <li> I was so looking forward to trying this out.  But I cannot express how disappointed I was when I did.  The first thing that caused an issue was the power button.  Where they have it located on the handle, you accidentally keep turning it off which results in you having to keep reheating it over and over.  In doing my hair one time, it probably turned off about 20 times.  Next, the waves do not stay in.  Within minutes they are falling out.  And once the waves fall out, the frizz comes in.  This would work great if it was still 1973 and that look was in.  All in all, very unhappy with this product and would not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Be careful on the heat setting as I had it on the hottest setting which was too hot and scorched by hair.</li>
            <li> This product is ok, doesn&#x27;t heat like I would like it too since I have course hair. Also product doesn&#x27;t grab hair like it should with a barrel curling iron. Its ok, I would only use it once in awhile.</li>
            <li> I thought this was going to leave me with big sexy waves, but It looks more like I put a bunch of tiny braids in my hair, slept in it overnight, then took them out that next morning. Makes the hair look messy and frizzy. It doesn&#x27;t look natural but for the money it&#x27;s good quality, and I LOVE the conair heat stylets. I just suggest that you get a you wave with bigger barrels.</li>
            <li> Works as described but found it had more of a crimping effect on my hair.  This may be due to the texture of my hair, however.</li>
            <li> Maybe this waver works as easily as the video shows/implies on superfine, straight hair, but on my very thick hair that tends to wave and curl a little when it&#x27;s really humid or gets wet, it was useless. All it did was create little \\&quot;bends\\&quot; that looked absurd, lol. It might have worked if I&#x27;d held it in place a few seconds longer or went back over the same piece of hair 4-5 more times, but I want to style my hair, not fry it! So though I rated it 1 star, I&#x27;d really give it a 0 star grading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need a new flat iron (speaking of styler products) and was thinking of going with the InStyler, which I see amazon.com now sells (that is the same as the one the infomercial sells), but as they had a few different types of InStyler (the same size, so I don&#x27;t know what exactly the difference was between them), I didn&#x27;t know which to go with, or simply buy another of the one I have. Previous to the one I own I bought the kind you can use on wet hair. Those really do work, and your hair (at least mine did) does feel softer, shinier, but I can&#x27;t make up my mind which to get. A friend has the InStyler and used it on me last summer, and it does work the way the infomercial advertises, but I can&#x27;t say that it was better or easier than any other flat iron I&#x27;ve used, so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth paying the extra money just for the \\&quot;InStyler\\&quot; name. However, my stylist says if you want a really good ceramic flat iron, one that does the least damage to your hair, makes it shinier, you need to spend at least $100, that price really DOES matter when it comes to flat irons. Do you agree? I&#x27;m not sure if I do. I&#x27;ve owned more expensive and less expensive ones (one that was $129 and one that was $59), and I could not say the more-expensive one made my hair shinier or smoother, or was less damaging, so I&#x27;m torn on which kind to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding these new kinds of irons--the ones that supposedly give you waves or spiral curls, etc., IMO they are more gimmicky than truly functional, and I don&#x27;t want to have to run it over my hair 8-9 times to get the desired look, frying my hair in the process. I think with these new irons it&#x27;s a case of Buyer Beware...ional, and I don&#x27;t want to have to run it over my hair 8-9 times to get the desired look, frying my hair in the process. I think with these new irons it&#x27;s a case of Buyer Beware...</li>
            <li> My teenager and her 10 year old sister love the three barrel styler. It really gives them another option when it comes to curling their hair. Regular curling irons are still an option, but this one gives you the big beachy waves that they are always looking for. It works well on my daughter&#x27;s long hair. She has hair that goes all the way down to the middle of her back. My 10 year old has shoulder length hair and she uses it too. It is very sturdy, it doesn&#x27;t get so hot it burns their hands.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this, my hair looked amazing. The next few times my hair looked like a bad crimp job. Not sure what I did different. Oh well, It heats up well and stays hot. Not too heavy and easy to use. Occasionally I would hit the power button while I was using it. I like the shiny orange colored handle.</li>
            <li> The company didn&#x27;t have the color that I had ordered, so I got a purple one instead, and not having the right color wasn&#x27;t a big deal as long as it was the same product.  Very good to work with and they quickly responded saying they had another color.  They quickly shipped the product and were very good customer friendly.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the wave iron goes it is great, i was worried it would be too big for my daughters hair at shoulder length and thin and fine, but it is perfect and stays in a few days with just little touch up the next day.  Would suggest and get it again!!</li>
            <li> this is my daughters fav. now :)&lt;br /&gt;No problems so far and makes her hair look beautiful.  Used since she was 12.</li>
            <li> The Conair triple barrel was a good bought, altought the size of the waves are small, it&#x60;s really useful.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> After extensive research and review of many other wavers, this is the one I went with--glad I did.  I had no idea the amount of hair wavers on the market.  It was a little overwhelming deciding on which one to purchase.  This one is ideal.  Admittedly, the first reason I went with it is because of the Conair name.  I have had my Conair curling iron for almost 10 years, and it&#x27;s still holding strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros--Size is GREAT.  Not too big, not too small.  I was worried that it would be too heavy (as other products were described this way); not at all heavy.  Just the right dimensions to get close to the roots.  It gets very hot very quickly.  If you don&#x27;t like it that hot, then turn it down!  I had read one review where the person continually kept [accidentally] hitting the power button.  I don&#x27;t get it.  I had no problem whatsoever with that.  My fingers were never even close to hitting the power button inadvertently.  I love the size waves this gives.  I have shoulder length fine hair, and it waved it very easily.  Next time I use it, I&#x27;ll probably leave it on the hair for less than 10 seconds for bigger waves ( I left it on for 10-20 seconds this time around).  Yes, you do need to use a product to keep it controlled, and yes, it will give you a very full, SLIGHTLY frizzy look if you continually run your fingers through it--you do need to be careful.  I would think that ALL wavers would do that.  If you&#x27;re expecting your hair to look like the model&#x27;s hair on the box, then go hire a professional hair stylist.  It&#x27;s just common sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons--none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product--love the orange metallic.</li>
            <li> This is a great quality product. It curls/crimps perfectly...I get compliments all the time. Fast heat up time, and it works so well that i don&#x27;t even have to use product in my hair to get it to hold. I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no hair stylist but I try to do what I can without going to a shop. The curls hold up with some spritz, but if I wasn&#x27;t using that they would be gone in a matter of an hour or so.</li>
            <li> After giving it several tries, I can&#x27;t get a decent curl with this styler. This is surprising, since my hair is fine and normally curls easily. I&#x27;m sorry that I threw the packaging away, since I&#x27;d return it if I could.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Very good product</li>
            <li> I really like this waver. It took a little while longer to do all my hair than I would have wanted but it stayed for over a day. Definitely does give the look like you braided your hair overnight, which I was going for. Also look at a deeper curl waver if you want more formal waves. These are much more beach like and I may end up buying another with larger waves for classier looking curls.&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed though when I opened the package and it was not orange like I had wanted. It is like magenta. Its a pretty color, I just would have preferred orange.</li>
            <li> The quality of this product is a 10 in my book. I would love the barrels to be a tad bigger but they still get the job done.  I&#x27;m use to using the revlon 3 Barrel iron and prefer that size but I bought 5 of the revlon  and they all broke.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with the you wave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it gets very hot.it goes up to 350Â°. At first I didn&#x27;t think this would be hot enough (I am used to a flat iron which heats up to 410Â°.well in case you didn&#x27;t know, it&#x27;ll be as hot as you need&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its lightweight and not bulky at all. I have medium length hair, and I could easily hold the youwave to wave the roots.its a biiig plus because I had a bad opinion on a previous iron that shall remain nameless :coughs:Vidal sassoon:coughs:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The waves look really pretty whether you do a hard solid spritzy wave or a natural beachy look.them waves last too!!I sleep wild and I could put my hair up in a satin bonnet, go to bed, and next morning the waves still popped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m loving it and I just got it. I hope that it continues to work long term, if it does, I&#x27;ll give it 6 stars!</li>
            <li> Makes great beachy waves; easy to use</li>
            <li> This is an easy to use wave iron and my daughter, who is so picky really loves it and it works well.</li>
