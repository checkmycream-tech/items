    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The customer service was excellent!</li>
            <li>The OPI applicator brush is flawless, and the nude color tends to elongate fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a beautiful pinkish-nude polish and is great for anyone who loves pastels like me.</li>
            <li>I just received and I&#x27;m happy with the color.</li>
            <li>And OPI makes great products.</li>
            <li>The seller was very kind and sent me a return envelope with postage paid and credited my charge card.  </li>
            <li>Loved the color.</li>
            <li>Looked so good with my complexion</li>
            <li>That should say how much I love OPI!</li>
            <li>This color is almost neutral and looks great, very pretty but not too bright.</li>
            <li>Very light on the eyes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I chose it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d surely buy from her again.</li>
            <li>and I got so many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>OPI&#x27;s \\&quot;Coney Island Cotton Candy\\&quot; is a great color to use with a French manicure or pedicure and a good color by itself.  </li>
            <li>I put it on and immediately fell in love with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for the perfect nude shade and this is definitely it.</li>
            <li>Im very happy with the product I would gladly purchase other items from this seller.</li>
            <li>Very nice nail polish, very natural.</li>
            <li>For me this color came out, after layering it with 3 coats of polish, as more of a light nude color or peach.</li>
            <li>The shipper had good prices and fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>Some described me as brown skinned, others say dark skinned but either way the color still looks great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pale pinkish beige with a warm undertone that looks great with my medium-fair warm-toned skin.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty color.</li>
            <li>Very flattering for brown girls!!</li>
            <li>I love this color for its understated and natural look.</li>
            <li>This is a very neutral light pink that is almost clear, but it&#x27;s a beautiful color that stays on for days.  </li>
            <li>Just right for me.</li>
            <li>in general is easy to use while it is fresh.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much Amazon and O.P.I!</li>
            <li>I first tried out this product when I borrowed it from a friend.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took me several weeks to find this polish; it is not found in many stores.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light, but still the right amount of pink.</li>
            <li>With two coats it&#x27;s translucent, but I like it that way -- natural, but better than natural.</li>
            <li>Mostly the pictures come very close to the actual color on fingernails with the OPI polishes they picture, but not this</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very light pink.</li>
            <li>Looks a bit lighter than in the picture, the shipment was extremly fast.</li>
            <li>I am very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a very neutral color.  </li>
            <li>Having just recently got this polish this week I was excited to try it on.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough about the true colors and long-lasting effect of OPI nail lacquer.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to close it tightly.</li>
            <li>not sure how many coats they would have had to put on to get that.</li>
            <li>I use them with Sally Hansen Fast Dry top coat and Dry Kwick over it within a minute or two and the nails are dry in no time.</li>
            <li>It is a soft and pretty color, just not as pink as I was expecting by the pictures.</li>
            <li>Also, you can barely see it when it chips!</li>
            <li>The color almost matches my nail color, which I like because I keep my nails short and prefer a natural look.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Better for those looking for a very soft peachy color, rather than a pink.</li>
            <li>Its very similar to the picture, though perhaps a bit more nude and a little less pink.</li>

            <li> I have multiple bottles of different colors and have thrown away all the other brands I&#x27;ve bought.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the difference is between polish, enamel, and lacquer but have found the OPI lacquer lasts much longer than any other I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>

            <li> By the way, I am black.</li>
            <li> I have oily fingernails, plus I am very active.</li>
            <li> So, when I coincidentally found it at a little beauty store I was so happy!&lt;br</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d need at least three or four coats to get the opaque look in the photo.</li>
            <li> I never get tired of looking at it.</li>
            <li> I ordered Coney Island nail POLISH, and each I received the wrong thing..</li>

            <li> Loved the color. Looked so good with my complexion and I got so many compliments on it. Thank you so much Amazon and O.P.I!</li>
            <li> its not what I expected. I thought it would be like the picture but its not at all. it would take 4 or 5 coats to get that look and then its a different color pink.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the coverage, not like the photo... not sure how many coats they would have had to put on to get that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pale pinkish beige with a warm undertone that looks great with my medium-fair warm-toned skin.  With two coats it&#x27;s translucent, but I like it that way -- natural, but better than natural. You&#x27;d need at least three or four coats to get the opaque look in the photo.</li>

            <li> I received this Opi color.  The name of the color was correct but the polish wasn&#x27;t the color that I thought it would be.  The seller was very kind and sent me a return envelope with postage paid and credited my charge card.  The customer service was excellent!</li>
            <li> OPI&#x27;s \\&quot;Coney Island Cotton Candy\\&quot; is a great color to use with a French manicure or pedicure and a good color by itself.  It&#x27;s a very light pink.</li>
            <li> I first tried out this product when I borrowed it from a friend.

            <li> I have oily fingernails, plus I am very active. This is the only fingernail polish that I have found that stays on. The color almost matches my nail color, which I like because I keep my nails short and prefer a natural look.</li>
            <li> I ordered Coney Island nail POLISH, and each I received the wrong thing..You sent me nail Lacquer.  I know the difference in polish and lacquer.  I have had the polish before....I am very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this to anyone else.</li>
            <li> Definitely my go to polish when I can&#x27;t decide which color to get. I never get tired of looking at it. It&#x27;s very light, but still the right amount of pink. Very light on the eyes and I never tire of looking at it. By the way, I am black. Some described me as brown skinned, others say dark skinned but either way the color still looks great!</li>
            <li> I just received and I&#x27;m happy with the color.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for.  It is a very neutral color.  Matches everything. And OPI makes great products.</li>
            <li> I love this color for its understated and natural look.</li>
