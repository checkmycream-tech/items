    <ol>
            <li>hoping for the best.</li>
            <li>Really great product!</li>
            <li>If I was removing arm hair I would be happy, but on my legs it didn&#x27;t work that great.</li>
            <li>I am getting use to this, but it is going to work out great.</li>
            <li>Like it- works great for face &amp; pits</li>
            <li>Good product and works well</li>
            <li>Good product works good</li>
            <li>Very happy and would recommend this product to anyone interested in hair removal.</li>
            <li>Family love it!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping great product, and all together great experience will buy from again.</li>
            <li>(neither one even gets warm with use).  </li>
            <li>I liked it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it though.</li>
            <li>Followed the instructions, but just wasn&#x27;t satisfied</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>it works ok</li>
            <li>My wife tried it too and although she could feel the heat a bit more than I, it did not remove her arm or leg hair either.</li>
            <li>I suggest this until you get confident with it and the settings.</li>
            <li>but they became thicker on my chin where I have the most hair</li>
            <li>At any rate I&#x27;d say i&#x27;m better than I was .</li>
            <li>Love LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>you are better off using an eplilator.</li>
            <li>but its ok</li>
            <li>Well ,despite reviews that people are burning their faces off with this gadget I find this not to be true at all!</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It appears Nono works best on tight skin.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t cut it  smooth</li>
            <li>So far, so good here.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this</li>
            <li>It shows a full charge but will not work.</li>
            <li>I really like the little guy, but I had to practice with it to figure out how it works the best.</li>
            <li>I thought maybe I let the hair get too long for a good use</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy and fast.</li>
            <li>We did not see much success if any.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much fun to use.</li>
            <li>I found the No No very awkward to use and only marginally effective.  </li>
            <li>Takes too much time-haven&#x27;t seen results yet!</li>
            <li>Works well came fast!</li>
            <li>The unit performed exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>would love to get my money back</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I bought at amazon rather than from noNo - big price difference.</li>
            <li>I started with it on the first line however just in case</li>
            <li>this was the first thing that I bought that I was not satisfied with and they did not make good on it.</li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t turn it up to really high at first.</li>
            <li>Does not remove hair very well</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work though.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t really cover it up with make up either.  </li>
            <li>but when I tried to return it, it was way too much of a hassle as they wanted pictures of the problem before they would decide if it could be returned.</li>
            <li>It does not seem to do much of anything.</li>
            <li>I expected better results and longer time between hair removal.</li>
            <li>Painless - The system guarantees an absolutely pain-free experience despite the method of using thermal heat to remove hair.</li>
            <li>Does nothing for real stubble.  </li>
            <li>More than I expected!</li>
            <li>bougt it as a replacement for my wifes older nono..</li>
            <li>this product is more of a long term hair removal product if your looking for fast short term hair removing system this product isnt for you.</li>
            <li>One arm took over 2 hours and they are growing in at normal speed..</li>
            <li>I have had the chance to use the product and it does live up to expectations, painless hair removal.</li>
            <li>product showed up in plastic looking new..</li>
            <li>First use functioned well on arms and then later for peach fuzz on her face.</li>
            <li>Followed directions completely.</li>
            <li>So far the nono is not working</li>
            <li>Who knows after I start with the everyday thing I may come back and give it more stars if I see the hairs disappearing???  </li>
            <li>Takes a few tries to get the correct speed down, but other than that, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give it a few more tries before I throw in the towel.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it would work better on another body part, but definitely would NOT recommend for the upper lip!</li>
            <li>But mainly even after making several passes over the same area, the hair remains.</li>
            <li>it does the job of removing the hair but for someone that doesnt have the time dont bother because for a small area like your face it could take a couple hours to remove the hairs smoothly and will only work if you have hairs to remove</li>
            <li>It has not done what I expected it to do and have been using it very faithfully</li>
            <li>I used this on my legs first and nothing, still had stubble after using this for almost half an hour.  </li>
            <li>90 Degree angle and keeping a steady drag across the hairs.</li>
            <li>Gets a little hot, but you need to watch the video for the technique.</li>
            <li>I had high expectations for the item and felt like it was a big let down.</li>

            <li> I had high expectations for the item and felt like it was a big let down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a older person and my skin isn&#x27;t as tight as when I was younger.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t matter whether my facial hair was 1 mm long or 4 mm long, it just did not work.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of my money it dose not remove the hair , it burns it, and on top of that it leaves numbs  behind.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife&#x27;s Birthday and didn&#x27;t expect much after reading negative reviews.</li>
            <li> Unless your looking at it in the long run it will ..</li>
            <li> f Time will tell for the long term.</li>
            <li> I may wind up giving it to one of my lady friends, because it does not seem suited to the limited purposes for which I thought I needed it.</li>
            <li> Not painful, but can get uncomfortable in some areas.</li>
            <li> Did not work as expected.</li>
            <li> You have to push down fairly hard to get it to activate, which rules out sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li> The small tip seems to work well, but the 2 provided larger tips don&#x27;t do anything at all</li>
            <li> The other problem is that after using it on one leg it was already losing battery power.  </li>
            <li> Weirdly reduces cold sore outbreaks, but only slightly reduces hair growth of face, and then only the fine hair.  </li>
            <li> One spike that the head fits on broke in less than a week.</li>
            <li> but this don&#x27;t work as they show on tv not true</li>
            <li> it takes a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> It is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my wife&#x27;s birthday, she was so excited to get it, but after several attempts to use it , she was very disappointed!</li>
            <li> AND I want to return and not able after a month and a half!</li>
            <li> Not sure this product is working for me.  </li>
            <li> Sorry I didn&#x27;t buy it years earlier!</li>
            <li> too complicated to use sent back</li>
            <li> I should of listened to all of the reviews on here...upon opening it it never turned on :-/</li>
            <li> I found it difficult to use on the upper lip area.  </li>
            <li> but she nor I could get it to work hardly at all.</li>
            <li> No it sucks</li>
            <li> Was not effective in removing hair as advertised.</li>
            <li> After it took forever to get delivered by slow boat from China,  it took a while for me to get accustomed to how to operate it.  </li>
            <li> Not what I expected!!!!!</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t let me send it back too get my money back, which is making me very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Total disappointment!</li>
            <li> BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!</li>
            <li> Also, I find that you have to push down really hard to keep it activated, which is a bit painful.  </li>
            <li> It takes some practice to use and the buffing is the secret to removing all the residue of the burnt hairs.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with the product as I felt that I should be .</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t work for me, or at least it hasn&#x27;t yet.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I and my mom are very disappointed and we plan on sending it back</li>
            <li> Recieved the item and it was the wrong thing.  </li>
            <li> Sorry I bought it.</li>
            <li> Not worth a damn,, doesn&#x27;t work as advertised,, wife hated it.</li>
            <li> but the room stinks.</li>
            <li> Still using it though since it helps when I feel a cold sore coming on.  </li>
            <li> I AM GUESSING that the bad reviews were given by people who didn&#x27;t read the instructions.</li>
            <li> and it burned my skin and was so painful.</li>
            <li> it is not working wont come on followed all the instruction, been sick</li>
            <li> I was so hopeful to get this product but ended up so disappointed.</li>

            <li> Was very disappointed with the NoNo</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> have not used. hoping for the best.</li>
            <li> It was just as advertised. I&#x27;m satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> did not meet my expectations. Does not remove hair very well</li>
            <li> Not what I expected!!!!!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t cut it  smooth</li>
            <li> Recieved the item and it was the wrong thing.  It says NoNo, not NoNo Pro5.  I am sending it back.</li>
            <li> There was no noticeable hair removal at all.  Tried different areas from arms to back to legs.  We did not see much success if any.</li>
            <li> Received item on time and as described. I have had the chance to use the product and it does live up to expectations, painless hair removal. Very happy and would recommend this product to anyone interested in hair removal.</li>
            <li> More than I expected! It does the job just as described.</li>
            <li> Takes a few tries to get the correct speed down, but other than that, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> All it seems to do is give off a burning g hair smell. Hair is still there but the room stinks.</li>
            <li> Mine works. Gets a little hot, but you need to watch the video for the technique. 90 Degree angle and keeping a steady drag across the hairs.</li>
            <li> Good product and works well</li>
            <li> Not worth a damn,, doesn&#x27;t work as advertised,, wife hated it.</li>
            <li> I really like the little guy, but I had to practice with it to figure out how it works the best. One has to be patient. It will eventually sear off the hairs totally, but only after several uses. I&#x27;m glad I bought it though. It has reduced shaving by 50% until I can get all the hair singed off. It does not hurt, it&#x27;s just a process.</li>
            <li> There was no no-no in the package.</li>
            <li> Simply put.&lt;br /&gt;Nono just &amp;#34;nono worked&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Fast shipping great product, and all together great experience will buy from again.</li>
            <li> DOESN&#x27;T WORK AS ADVERTISED.</li>
            <li> Smell hair burning... Doesn&#x27;t really work though. Booo</li>
            <li> Takes too much time-haven&#x27;t seen results yet!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a older person and my skin isn&#x27;t as tight as when I was younger.  It appears Nono works best on tight skin.  Also, I find that you have to push down really hard to keep it activated, which is a bit painful.  Not sure this product is working for me.  I will try for the 60 days and see if I get the hang of it.  If not, I&#x27;m going to return it.</li>
            <li> Really great product! Works well came fast! Everything I needed for an all in one hair removal tool. Family love it! I&#x27;m going to order another!</li>
            <li> Actually the nono doesn&#x27;t work at all! I have read the directions and have tried it several times and never once has it performed like it should! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this device to anyone!</li>
            <li> It did not work, I returned it 😖 john</li>
            <li> If I was removing arm hair I would be happy, but on my legs it didn&#x27;t work that great. Followed the instructions, but just wasn&#x27;t satisfied</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awful and it burnt my mother in-laws face! I do not recommend it</li>
            <li> Did not work at all. Just made a burning smell but removed no hair. Followed directions completely. Total disappointment!</li>
            <li> I only purchased this for my upper lip area and cut myself with it.  For two weeks I had to walk around with it until it healed.  I couldn&#x27;t really cover it up with make up either.  Not sure if it would work better on another body part, but definitely would NOT recommend for the upper lip!</li>
            <li> So far the nono is not working</li>
            <li> The unit performed exactly as advertised. It takes some practice to use and the buffing is the secret to removing all the residue of the burnt hairs.</li>
            <li> The small tip seems to work well, but the 2 provided larger tips don&#x27;t do anything at all (neither one even gets warm with use).  Since I bought this for hair on my chin (I use the smaller tip for that) I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> product showed up in plastic looking new..bougt it as a replacement for my wifes older nono..does not work..sending back seems to be a hassle.</li>
            <li> It did not perform well at all!!!! I got it for my mom for her birthday.  She has been wanting one but she nor I could get it to work hardly at all. I and my mom are very disappointed and we plan on sending it back</li>
            <li> Trying to cancel this order.</li>
            <li> Sorry I didn&#x27;t buy it years earlier!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t but this don&#x27;t work as they show on tv not true would love to get my money back</li>
            <li> I liked it I guess .. It shouldnt replace shaving though. Unless your looking at it in the long run it will .. this product is more of a long term hair removal product if your looking for fast short term hair removing system this product isnt for you.</li>
            <li> I am getting use to this, but it is going to work out great.</li>
            <li> it does not perform as shown on TV.  I would not buy it again but I&#x27;m glad I bought at amazon rather than from noNo - big price difference.</li>
            <li> it works ok it does the job of removing the hair but for someone that doesnt have the time dont bother because for a small area like your face it could take a couple hours to remove the hairs smoothly and will only work if you have hairs to remove</li>
            <li> Item was as posted thank you</li>
            <li> product doesn&#x27;t work like manufacturer says. I want my money back!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much fun to use. It&#x27;s easy and fast.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my wife&#x27;s birthday, she was so excited to get it, but after several attempts to use it , she was very disappointed! she went back &amp; read the instructions several times, but it still did not function properly! the only place that it actually worked was on arm hairs, it did nothing for the leg hairs! Amazon does not have any return information, i will try calling to find out how to return it, if i can not return it i will no longer buy anything from Amazon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed.  I kept going over and over an area on my leg but the hair just wouldn&#x27;t cut.  I&#x27;ll give it a few more tries before I throw in the towel.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work at all. It is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This product is probably o.k. but just not what I was expecting but when I tried to return it, it was way too much of a hassle as they wanted pictures of the problem before they would decide if it could be returned.</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed with the NoNo</li>
            <li> my wife loves the way it works.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. I tried using it on facial hair and it did nothing.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT! Does not work! AND I want to return and not able after a month and a half! Learned a lesson here, Only buy from Amazon and not 3rd parties!</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  Does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> It does not seem to do much of anything.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of my money it dose not remove the hair , it burns it, and on top of that it leaves numbs  behind.  One arm took over 2 hours and they are growing in at normal speed..this thing is a joke</li>
            <li> Like it- works great for face &amp; pits</li>
            <li> No it sucks and im out the money i paid for both - no stars.....</li>
            <li> Awful. Might as well use a set of tweezers and pull out the unwanted hairs.</li>
            <li> My NoNo stopped working after three uses.  It shows a full charge but will not work.</li>
            <li> I found the No No very awkward to use and only marginally effective.  I returned the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Francene Bernest</li>
            <li> It works like promised. But don&#x27;t turn it up to really high at first. It will burn you.  The disc of instructions are not helpful.</li>
            <li> This product simply did not work. It appeared to be functioning as explained in the instructions, however, I could not get it to remove any hair at all on my face. It didn&#x27;t matter whether my facial hair was 1 mm long or 4 mm long, it just did not work. My wife tried it too and although she could feel the heat a bit more than I, it did not remove her arm or leg hair either. I do not recommend this product. The seller was deceptive and misleading with respect to return conditions as well. We had to invoke Amazon&#x27;s guarantee to get a refund.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as stated</li>
            <li> Note it doesn&#x27;t work as advertised. Note my scruffy face hair&#x27;s not even a touch with the use of no-no. I had to use my razor to shave.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife&#x27;s Birthday and didn&#x27;t expect much after reading negative reviews. She loves it! First use functioned well on arms and then later for peach fuzz on her face. So far, so good here.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Does not work as advertised</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s horrible I want my money back rate 0</li>
            <li> Product would charge, but wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Takes several strokes to remove (singe) only some hair. Not painful, but can get uncomfortable in some areas.</li>
            <li> Does not work on the face as per commercial. One spike that the head fits on broke in less than a week. Would not recommend!</li>
            <li> I expected better results and longer time between hair removal.</li>
            <li> I used it once on #1 setting and it burned my skin and was so painful. How can i return it!!!!!</li>
            <li> Well ,despite reviews that people are burning their faces off with this gadget I find this not to be true at all! I started with it on the first line however just in case and i am now up to third line.  I suggest this until you get confident with it and the settings. Hows it doing on my chin hairs?  Well I cant see they are going away just yet but they became thicker on my chin where I have the most hair and they do seem to be growing slower.  I also have to admit I am not using every day so maybe that is a factor to consider also.  Since I have not seen the no hair results it promised I am giving it a 3 star for now. Who knows after I start with the everyday thing I may come back and give it more stars if I see the hairs disappearing???  At any rate I&#x27;d say i&#x27;m better than I was . Thicker hairs are easier to pluck and shave away?</li>
            <li> too complicated to use sent back</li>
            <li> I feel  that the item is not as simple to use as advertised . I was not happy with the product as I felt that I should be . I had high expectations for the item and felt like it was a big let down.</li>
            <li> This thing is junk! I can&#x27;t believe I fell for it! Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> The NONO is worthless. I used it for 25 minutes and could not tell any difference in my hair removal on my leg. I want to return it , but found out that returns are not allowed. So I just lost $80.00.  I am very disappointed in Amazon this was the first thing that I bought that I was not satisfied with and they did not make good on it.</li>
            <li> Does not work at all! Very disappointed! I was so looking forward to this product.</li>
            <li> Painless - The system guarantees an absolutely pain-free experience despite the method of using thermal heat to remove hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered this Nono Pro, and it does NOT work. It smells like the hair is burning, but nothing comes off. I followed the directions and all, still, nothing! It won&#x27;t let me send it back too get my money back, which is making me very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I read the booklet, watched the video and still can&#x27;t get this thing to remove any hair.  I was so excited to get this so I could stop paying to get  waxed at the salon. I used this on my legs first and nothing, still had stubble after using this for almost half an hour.  I thought maybe I let the hair get too long for a good use so I shaved and tried it the next morning, it still didn&#x27;t work.  The other problem is that after using it on one leg it was already losing battery power.  I guess I&#x27;ll have to send it back and go back to waxing and shaving.  I was so hopeful to get this product but ended up so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Was not effective in removing hair as advertised.</li>
            <li> Good product works good</li>
            <li> Weirdly reduces cold sore outbreaks, but only slightly reduces hair growth of face, and then only the fine hair.  Does nothing for real stubble.  Still using it though since it helps when I feel a cold sore coming on.  They should market the product for this problem, not hair removal.</li>
            <li> It works!! f Time will tell for the long term.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t work for me, or at least it hasn&#x27;t yet.  You have to push down fairly hard to get it to activate, which rules out sensitive areas.  But mainly even after making several passes over the same area, the hair remains.</li>
            <li> No does not trim hair!!! Sorry I bought it. Will tell everyone not to purchase it.</li>
            <li> Love LOVE LOVE MY NO NO PRO 5. I AM GUESSING that the bad reviews were given by people who didn&#x27;t read the instructions.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what to make of this. After it took forever to get delivered by slow boat from China,  it took a while for me to get accustomed to how to operate it.  I may wind up giving it to one of my lady friends, because it does not seem suited to the limited purposes for which I thought I needed it.</li>
            <li> Did not work as expected. Actually did not work at all. Returning for refund.</li>
            <li> It has not done what I expected it to do and have been using it very faithfully</li>
            <li> Not improved at all, returned.</li>
            <li> This is a scam. Did not remove any hair. Don,t buy this you are better off using an eplilator.</li>
            <li> it takes a little getting used to. but its ok</li>
            <li> works but not effectivy</li>
            <li> I should of listened to all of the reviews on here...upon opening it it never turned on :-/</li>
            <li> it is not working wont come on followed all the instruction, been sick havnt tried to send it back</li>
            <li> I found it difficult to use on the upper lip area.  Otherwise it did what it was advertised to do.</li>
