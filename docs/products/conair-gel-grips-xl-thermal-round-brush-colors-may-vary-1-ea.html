            <li>What a great idea to add gel to the handle!</li>

            <li>It has a good grip, very comfortable to hold, it&#x27;s a nice size, it&#x27;s not bad on the head, BUT it pulls your hair!</li>

            <li>I love the size and comfort handle of this brush.</li>
            <li>Love this brush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure how I managed without you</li>
            <li>but I now know that I will never be able to survive without you again :)</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Love the holes and the air flow of the brush.  </li>
            <li>Love this brush.</li>
            <li>I love it because I can fix my hair in minutes</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m holding on to it, hopefully with practice my style will look better.</li>
            <li>or so I have to wipe off some of the goo that has oozed out of the top of the handle</li>
            <li>its just okay.</li>
            <li>The size is ideal for  creating volume to flat hair.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s because I have fine hair, and lots of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fine for my daughter but can&#x27;t use for intended purpose.</li>
            <li>as expected, very good</li>
            <li>This one was incredibly cheap</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s definitely comfortable</li>
            <li>Easy to clean</li>
            <li>The handle is really comfortable too.</li>
            <li>Cheap brush doesn&#x27;t work well on my hair.</li>
            <li>Works fine, nothing special though.</li>
            <li>(I have very long straight hair and the diameter is perfect for blow drying)&lt;br /&gt;-Bristle</li>
            <li>Fabulous brush, Grip is comfortable, hair dries quickly.</li>
            <li>The jell grip is great when your holding the brush for long periods of time (blow out).  </li>
            <li>First, when I&#x27;d finished blow drying my hair, I found that my hair had a lot of static.  </li>
            <li>Size of brush is great for long layers.</li>
            <li>Still worth it!</li>
            <li>Had this brush before and it works great to straighten my long hair.</li>
            <li>the little amount of time I was able to use it, it was great, but now I can&#x27;t get it to stay together</li>
            <li>As many users have posted, the gel grip, although nice in theory, it instantly locks onto hair as you attempt to roll it in your hands and pulls it around the handle.</li>
            <li>Fits nicely in hands and very soft.</li>
            <li>I have a pretty intense hair dryer and this brush has held its own against it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably ending up returning the brush and even though it might be a bright pricier for the same size barrel</li>
            <li>so wrap a bit of athletic tape or soft bandages around it, making sure the end will not go against the direction you wrap your hair and you&#x27;ll be just fine.</li>
            <li>Other than that, its  great styling tool.</li>
            <li>Other one is plenty old and still perfect condition.</li>
            <li>He likes his very much!</li>
            <li>The size and durability of the brush is worth the couple minutes hassle of taking the gel grip off.</li>
            <li>It  is really useful and practical.</li>
            <li>I would have liked the handle a bit smaller.</li>
            <li>worth the buy</li>
            <li>Makes nice big volume curls and gives lift.</li>
            <li>Of course, when I tried to catch it, it was super hot from my blow</li>
            <li>I can put the brush right up to the hair dryer and the bristles stay in tact.  </li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t have to clean it often.</li>
            <li>Its handle is so soft and easy to grip, plus the brush itself serves its purpose well.</li>
            <li>The grip is incredibly soft and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>The handle has a small metal ring that connects it to the top, and many times a hair or two gets caught and is pulled out from that spot.</li>
            <li>It seems like it would melt if I was to leave in my car or get it too hot.</li>
            <li>Handle feels good on touch but bristles way too harsh.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be a good brush but less than a month of using it, it broke!</li>
            <li>Also, the bristles don&#x27;t really pull the hair enough so it doesn&#x27;t work any better than a paddle brush for blow drying.</li>
            <li>I love this brush so much :) it&#x27;s so big</li>
            <li>A large one.  </li>
            <li>Because the handle is that certain mushy material and where that connects to the brush, hair gets caught in there ALL the time.</li>
            <li>As noted by other reviewers here, hair does stick to the handle of the brush right where the super cushy ultra soft grip of awesome meets the actual base of the brush.  </li>
            <li>From there a bit of pulling (be careful around the top and bottom edges)</li>
            <li>I bought this brush with not too much hope.  </li>
            <li>(For anyone reading this: I guess you can probably tell how much I adore this brush.)  </li>
            <li>Really does the job.</li>
            <li>Really like this.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Conair.</li>
            <li>I was not expecting to like this so much.</li>
            <li>I like it and it has reasonable price.</li>
            <li>that makes my hair really voluminous.</li>
            <li>Overall, this brush is comfortable to grip and helps add volume to your hair, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li>I absolutely would not recommend anyone to purchase this brush.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had the problem so many other reviewers have had with the brush</li>
            <li>will remove the grip entirely leaving a smooth round handle that slides easily!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The bristles are really soft, at first time I thought they were going to hurt in contact  </li>
            <li>personally would like the brush much better if it had a regular ole run of the mill plastic handle.</li>
            <li>Update: February 2, 2017 - Still my go-to styling brush, no issues with the gel grip removed and highly durable.</li>
            <li>This is a brush designed for blow-drying out your hair evenly and more quickly than a solid round brush.</li>
            <li>Nice and thick barrel.</li>
            <li>Easy gel grip handle makes it so easy to round brush dry your hair!</li>
            <li>Helps me dry my hair more quickly and gives it a little volume.</li>
            <li>The measurement around the bristles, the actual round, most important part of the brush, is just short of 11 inches around.  </li>
            <li>I had been looking for a large round brush with long bristles for a while after my stylist used one that was amazing but completely out of my price range.</li>
            <li>I got a purple one, not this pretty blue color.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s a good round brush for blow-drying.</li>
            <li>Makes round brushing easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supposed to be a soft grip</li>
            <li>It made my hair amazingly soft</li>
            <li>Where her brush gave me volume and a soft curl, this one gave me frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, compared to this brush, my old brush seems like heaven.</li>
            <li>Like the soft grip handle.</li>
            <li>Secondly, although the handle of the brush is a gel material and incredibly comfortable to use, while blow drying my hair, many times strands of hair would get caught between the gel handle and my hand and because there is a snug grip due to the gel material, hair wasn&#x27;t able to slip out and instead was painfully plucked out of my scalp.  </li>
            <li>Quoting my girlfriend, \\&quot;I want this grip on other things I can&#x27;t think of right now.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it for someone who uses their hair dryer like I do (daily).</li>
            <li>My current brush does that, which is one reason I wanted to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>The one pro, my hair did dry really fast.</li>
            <li>They really need to figure out a design or different fabric or something because blow drying your hair with this thing will give you a massive HEADACHE!</li>
            <li>I have medium length, fine but thick (lots of it) hair.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I found the bristles to be too flimsy to be effective.  </li>
            <li>Kind of disappointed because Conair is a recognizable name</li>
            <li>With my first brush rather, than toss it, I simply took a pair of sharp scissors and punctured the middle of the handle.</li>
            <li>wife uses everyday to brush her hair and She seems to like it very much</li>

            <li> Update: February 2, 2017 - Still my go-to styling brush, no issues with the gel grip removed and highly durable.</li>
            <li> This is a brush designed for blow-drying out your hair evenly and more quickly than a solid round brush.</li>
            <li> Nice and thick barrel.</li>
            <li> Easy gel grip handle makes it so easy to round brush dry your hair!</li>
            <li> Helps me dry my hair more quickly and gives it a little volume.</li>
            <li> The measurement around the bristles, the actual round, most important part of the brush, is just short of 11 inches around.  </li>
            <li> I had been looking for a large round brush with long bristles for a while after my stylist used one that was amazing but completely out of my price range.</li>
            <li> I got a purple one, not this pretty blue color.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s a good round brush for blow-drying.</li>
            <li> Makes round brushing easy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to be a soft grip</li>
            <li> It made my hair amazingly soft</li>
            <li> Where her brush gave me volume and a soft curl, this one gave me frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, compared to this brush, my old brush seems like heaven.</li>
            <li> Like the soft grip handle.</li>
            <li> Secondly, although the handle of the brush is a gel material and incredibly comfortable to use, while blow drying my hair, many times strands of hair would get caught between the gel handle and my hand and because there is a snug grip due to the gel material, hair wasn&#x27;t able to slip out and instead was painfully plucked out of my scalp.  </li>
            <li> Quoting my girlfriend, \\&quot;I want this grip on other things I can&#x27;t think of right now.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it for someone who uses their hair dryer like I do (daily).</li>
            <li> My current brush does that, which is one reason I wanted to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> The one pro, my hair did dry really fast.</li>
            <li> They really need to figure out a design or different fabric or something because blow drying your hair with this thing will give you a massive HEADACHE!</li>
            <li> I have medium length, fine but thick (lots of it) hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I found the bristles to be too flimsy to be effective.  </li>
            <li> Kind of disappointed because Conair is a recognizable name</li>
            <li> With my first brush rather, than toss it, I simply took a pair of sharp scissors and punctured the middle of the handle.</li>
            <li> wife uses everyday to brush her hair and She seems to like it very much</li>
            <li> But this really does the job to gently dry and give hair a little curl and bounce.</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re not careful, like other reviewers stated your hair can get caught around it or in the seam between handle and brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad that it was so cheaply made.</li>
            <li> A bit bigger than expected, but does its job.</li>
            <li> I also used this on my daughters hair, which is long.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also just over 9 and 1/2 inches long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this exact model of Conair&#x27;s XI Thermal Round Brush for a few years now with one modification.</li>
            <li> So long, in fact, before I found this brush I preferred to let my hair air dry.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t get hand or arm fatigue if it takes a long time to dry your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its an ok round brush its a little weak</li>
            <li> and it does not make the hair dry.</li>
            <li> Great to dry hair but dreadful little part where the comb connects to the soft grip.  </li>
            <li> I actually have a slightly smaller barrel of this same design and run the brushes against each other to help rid the metal core and small holes of residue that needs a helping hand.  </li>
            <li> My last brush saw near everyday use for 3 years of some heavy duty styling, pulling, and rolling before the brush and handle snapped and why I&#x27;ve now ordered another.  </li>
            <li> Bristles aren&#x27;t harsh and they are long lasting.</li>
            <li> i have naturally wavy to frizzy hair and it usually takes me abiut half an hour to blow dry.</li>
            <li> It was a little bigger than expected</li>
            <li> This is really not a brush designed to just brush your hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these brushed... one for my husband (thinning hair) and one for me (heavy hair).  </li>
            <li> Constantly getting hair trapped and pulled there.</li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> but plastic bristles are a bit rough on hair.</li>
            <li> I did not run into the issues that some of the other users faced where my hair got caught on the handle.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> other week</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I have long (well past mid back) very thick wavy hair and to blow dry</li>
            <li> The metal insert helps to dry hair faster but the round end detached from the handle when I used it.</li>
            <li> The round metal part of the rush keeps popping off while I blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> The only complaint is that my hair (which is just under my shoulder) gets stuck in the handle.</li>
            <li> The top base of the brush is 2 and 1/4 inches across.  </li>
            <li> It took half the time with thos brush.</li>
            <li> I worked too hard &amp; waited too long to grow my hair out.  </li>
            <li> Just wish the bristles where a little stronger.</li>
            <li> The bristles are just bristles and do not have little plastic bulbs on the ends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days now</li>
            <li> I bought this brush a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> As a result I had a few hairs ripped off.</li>
            <li> but as other reviewers have commented it can be hard to hold.</li>
            <li> All the rest I have tried the bristles are too stiff.</li>
            <li> The only way I can dry my hair without it looking crazy is by drying it in sections with a round brush and a concentrator tip on my hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are stiff and hold up well to cling to your hair and allow it to wrap around the tips holding them in a curl when you reach the base of your hair to pull off sleek, soft cured ends for basic drying.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles make this brush useless for those with thick or longer hair.</li>
            <li> and I had to use the straightening iron very little.  </li>
            <li> This is the only brush I have found that will release the really bad knots while continuing through the hair to remove the minor ones.</li>
            <li> I am BFFs with my hair dryer and have found that the heat from it usually melts the bristles on every brush I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  </li>
            <li> Either I am really clumsy or this brush isn&#x27;t what I needed.</li>
            <li> I have naturally thick and curly hair</li>
            <li> It glides through my thick hair.</li>
            <li> I would suggest a rubber base brush (works for all types of hair) before following up with this to style.</li>
            <li> My second time using this brush, the barrel became disconnected from the base.  </li>
            <li> If there is one negative thing its that for some reson, a random strand will get caught in a groove somewhere on the brush and yank out a strand ocassionally.</li>
            <li> My daughter has an over abundance of thin diameter hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s broken after 3 uses.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m unable to use it.  </li>
            <li> It makes it weird to hold and it snags hair.  </li>
            <li> Sorry Conair, this brush was not a win for me!</li>
            <li> but that doesn&#x27;t make it uncomfortable (</li>

            <li> I did not run into the issues that some of the other users faced where my hair got caught on the handle.  I actually really liked the gel handle.  I did, however, have a problem with the bristles on this brush.  I have naturally thick and curly hair so I wanted this brush for days that I straightened my hair.  Unfortunately, I found the bristles to be too flimsy to be effective.  Even when I used it on my daughter, they just didn&#x27;t seem to hold up.</li>
            <li> What a great idea to add gel to the handle! Makes blowing out my hair much less painful! The bristles are great too. No tangling at all. Love this brush!</li>
            <li> quality brush. is what it is.</li>
            <li> yes your hair will wrap around the handle and get stuck where the gel handle meets the rest of the brush.  so wrap a bit of athletic tape or soft bandages around it, making sure the end will not go against the direction you wrap your hair and you&#x27;ll be just fine.</li>
            <li> Good brush!  Helps me dry my hair more quickly and gives it a little volume.</li>
            <li> I got a purple one, not this pretty blue color. Works fine, nothing special though.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a large round brush with long bristles for a while after my stylist used one that was amazing but completely out of my price range. This one was incredibly cheap so I took a chance. It works. I have long (well past mid back) very thick wavy hair and to blow dry it takes forever. So long, in fact, before I found this brush I preferred to let my hair air dry. But this really does the job to gently dry and give hair a little curl and bounce. The gel grip handle is okay, it&#x27;s definitely comfortable but if you&#x27;re not careful, like other reviewers stated your hair can get caught around it or in the seam between handle and brush. Ouch.&lt;br /&gt;Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this exact model of Conair&#x27;s XI Thermal Round Brush for a few years now with one modification. As many users have posted, the gel grip, although nice in theory, it instantly locks onto hair as you attempt to roll it in your hands and pulls it around the handle. With my first brush rather, than toss it, I simply took a pair of sharp scissors and punctured the middle of the handle. From there a bit of pulling (be careful around the top and bottom edges) will remove the grip entirely leaving a smooth round handle that slides easily! The size and durability of the brush is worth the couple minutes hassle of taking the gel grip off. My last brush saw near everyday use for 3 years of some heavy duty styling, pulling, and rolling before the brush and handle snapped and why I&#x27;ve now ordered another.  This is a brush designed for blow-drying out your hair evenly and more quickly than a solid round brush. The bristles are stiff and hold up well to cling to your hair and allow it to wrap around the tips holding them in a curl when you reach the base of your hair to pull off sleek, soft cured ends for basic drying. That coupled with the inner metal core that heats up to the temperature of your hair dryer to help the curl hold. This is really not a brush designed to just brush your hair. I would suggest a rubber base brush (works for all types of hair) before following up with this to style. If your going to use hair products to style it is also best if you wash the brush off each time. I actually have a slightly smaller barrel of this same design and run the brushes against each other to help rid the metal core and small holes of residue that needs a helping hand.  Update: February 2, 2017 - Still my go-to styling brush, no issues with the gel grip removed and highly durable.</li>
            <li> Love it! Makes round brushing easy.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles make this brush useless for those with thick or longer hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this on behalf of my girlfriend&#x27;s experience with it, including my clueless man input as well.    The grip is incredibly soft and comfortable.  Quoting my girlfriend, \\&quot;I want this grip on other things I can&#x27;t think of right now.\\&quot;  When I suggested, \\&quot;Bicycle handles?\\&quot; I received a resounding \\&quot;YES!\\&quot;    The bristles are ceramic or something and not nylon.  Something I personally do not understand.  That seems like a painful experience when it meets your scalp, but she said it&#x27;s a good thing somehow.    As noted by other reviewers here, hair does stick to the handle of the brush right where the super cushy ultra soft grip of awesome meets the actual base of the brush.  Docked it a star there for the growing hairball factor.    Otherwise it&#x27;s a brush.  A large one.  With a handle most childhood teddy bears could be jealous of.</li>
            <li> I love the size and comfort handle of this brush. Just wish the bristles where a little stronger.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush with not too much hope.  I am BFFs with my hair dryer and have found that the heat from it usually melts the bristles on every brush I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  So, in my never ending quest to find a brush that won&#x27;t melt, I came across this one.  Holy awesome.  I can put the brush right up to the hair dryer and the bristles stay in tact.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days now and it&#x27;s still in perfect condition.  I have a pretty intense hair dryer and this brush has held its own against it.  I only gave it 4 stars because my hair has been caught in the area between the bristles and handle.  Other than that, this brush is amazing.  I would highly recommend it for someone who uses their hair dryer like I do (daily).</li>
            <li> Love this brush.  This is my second one.  The jell grip is great when your holding the brush for long periods of time (blow out).  The size is ideal for  creating volume to flat hair.  Would buy this again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush last night and found that the barrel is a great XL size, and works great with my medium length bobbed hairstyle.  However, I have two issues with this brush.  First, when I&#x27;d finished blow drying my hair, I found that my hair had a lot of static.  I had to spray my who head with hairspray to keep the hair from floating.  Secondly, although the handle of the brush is a gel material and incredibly comfortable to use, while blow drying my hair, many times strands of hair would get caught between the gel handle and my hand and because there is a snug grip due to the gel material, hair wasn&#x27;t able to slip out and instead was painfully plucked out of my scalp.  Ouch!  I&#x27;ll probably ending up returning the brush and even though it might be a bright pricier for the same size barrel, I&#x27;ll buy a similar brush but by a different maker.</li>
            <li> The squishy grip on the handle grabs your hair and yanks it while you are trying to turn the brush as you blowdry. It&#x27;s the worst design. It&#x27;s supposed to be a soft grip but it grabs hair! I hate this brush and wish I never bought it.</li>
            <li> It is good for drying my hair a bit faster but does nothing gor the &amp;#34;French Poodle&amp;#34; look. I still use several products for taming the mane...</li>
            <li> I do like this brush but as other reviewers have commented it can be hard to hold. Other than that, its  great styling tool.</li>
            <li> Kind of disappointed because Conair is a recognizable name and you&#x27;d expect a solid, reliable product.  My second time using this brush, the barrel became disconnected from the base.  Of course, when I tried to catch it, it was super hot from my blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;For the little amount of time I was able to use it, it was great, but now I can&#x27;t get it to stay together so I&#x27;m unable to use it.  I&#x27;m sad that it was so cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Dear Conair Gel Grips Brush: where have you been all my life?! I&#x27;m not quite sure how I managed without you but I now know that I will never be able to survive without you again :) (For anyone reading this: I guess you can probably tell how much I adore this brush.)  :)</li>
            <li> The handle has a small metal ring that connects it to the top, and many times a hair or two gets caught and is pulled out from that spot. Other than that, it&#x27;s a good round brush for blow-drying.</li>
            <li> Fits nicely in hands and very soft.</li>
            <li> Really does the job. The bristles are just bristles and do not have little plastic bulbs on the ends. Size of brush is great for long layers.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a good brush but less than a month of using it, it broke! The handle popped off from the brush. I&#x27;m really disappointed in this purchase.</li>
            <li> Really like this. Nice and thick barrel. Comfy handle. Easy to clean but I really don&#x27;t have to clean it often. Which I like. Bristles aren&#x27;t harsh and they are long lasting. This is my second one. Bought  it for travel. Other one is plenty old and still perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Love the holes and the air flow of the brush.  But my hair gets caught in the area between the brush &amp; the gel of the handle.  I worked too hard &amp; waited too long to grow my hair out.  I ended up using a box cutter to remove the gel handle.</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these brushed... one for my husband (thinning hair) and one for me (heavy hair).  He likes his very much! and I&#x27;m HAPPY  with mine!  Thanks, Conair.</li>
            <li> I should have believed all the reviews! Hair snags in the gel handle. Cutting it off helped but it still gets caught in the groove.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the gel grip on this brush.  It makes it weird to hold and it snags hair.  Also, the bristles don&#x27;t really pull the hair enough so it doesn&#x27;t work any better than a paddle brush for blow drying.</li>
            <li> Love this brush. i have naturally wavy to frizzy hair and it usually takes me abiut half an hour to blow dry. It took half the time with thos brush. Its very light weight and the cushion grip is awesome. If there is one negative thing its that for some reson, a random strand will get caught in a groove somewhere on the brush and yank out a strand ocassionally.</li>
            <li> I love it because I can fix my hair in minutes and it does not make the hair dry. I can take care of my hair faster now.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the problem so many other reviewers have had with the brush handle getting stuck in my hair. Maybe it&#x27;s because I have fine hair, and lots of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush helps me straighten my wavy hair if I use the concentrator nozzle on my hair dryer. It&#x27;s lightweight so you don&#x27;t get hand or arm fatigue if it takes a long time to dry your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have medium length, fine but thick (lots of it) hair. The only way I can dry my hair without it looking crazy is by drying it in sections with a round brush and a concentrator tip on my hair dryer.  I&#x27;ve tried to use this brush countless times and well, I just can&#x27;t!  It doesn&#x27;t matter which angle you hold it or how you twist it, when drying my hair with this brush the gel handle squishes in and causes your hair to wrap around the silver ring on the handle and when you let go to adjust your grip it pinches the strands of hair and pulls them out of your head the next time you move it. It is painful and I don&#x27;t know about you but I would rather not pull my hair out, even if I have a lot of it. I just trashed it. Sorry Conair, this brush was not a win for me!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she said is an amazing brush and the grip is the softer she ever had also It was a little bigger than expected but that doesn&#x27;t make it uncomfortable (but I think is a bit bigger for a travel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are really soft, at first time I thought they were going to hurt in contact  but it didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife uses everyday to brush her hair and She seems to like it very much</li>
            <li> This is a great brush for hair straightening. It glides through my thick hair. The handle is really comfortable too. I was not expecting to like this so much. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> A bit bigger than expected, but does its job. Has a nice grip. Would be best for someone with longer hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter has an over abundance of thin diameter hair. it tangles like MAD! This is the only brush I have found that will release the really bad knots while continuing through the hair to remove the minor ones. All the rest I have tried the bristles are too stiff.</li>
            <li> as expected, very good</li>
            <li> Fabulous brush, Grip is comfortable, hair dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this brush! Its handle is so soft and easy to grip, plus the brush itself serves its purpose well.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush a few weeks ago. Handle feels good on touch but bristles way too harsh. Also in the process of styling hair gets into details of barrels and gets stacked. As a result I had a few hairs ripped off. Painful.</li>
            <li> It  is really useful and practical. I like it and it has reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The metal insert helps to dry hair faster but the round end detached from the handle when I used it. It&#x27;s broken after 3 uses.</li>
            <li> This brush ripped my hair out where the gel handle meets the rest of the brush.  I promptly returned it as every time I tried to use it, it did the same thing.</li>
            <li> Easy gel grip handle makes it so easy to round brush dry your hair! Best brush ever- I need to buy more to have on stock!</li>
            <li> My hair is shorter and it works well.  I also used this on my daughters hair, which is long.  The size is awesome, nice and fat, and the first time I used it, I fell in love.  Since the description only says XL, I will give you some measurements.  The top base of the brush is 2 and 1/4 inches across.  The measurement around the bristles, the actual round, most important part of the brush, is just short of 11 inches around.  It&#x27;s also just over 9 and 1/2 inches long.  It made my hair amazingly soft and I had to use the straightening iron very little.  Quite nice.</li>
            <li> Great brush. Bought for my wife and she gets compliments and people asking what she is doing different with her hair.</li>
            <li> I love this brush so much :) it&#x27;s so big that makes my hair really voluminous.</li>
            <li> Awesome brush! I had the gel paddle brush for years and I still use it! I know this one will last forever as well. Great for blow drying when styling curly.</li>
            <li> The brush Is great for blow drying your hair smooth! The only complaint is that my hair (which is just under my shoulder) gets stuck in the handle.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this was like the one that my stylist used when she did a blow out on my hair. Either I am really clumsy or this brush isn&#x27;t what I needed. Where her brush gave me volume and a soft curl, this one gave me frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m holding on to it, hopefully with practice my style will look better. The one pro, my hair did dry really fast.</li>
            <li> Cheap brush doesn&#x27;t work well on my hair. Fine for my daughter but can&#x27;t use for intended purpose.</li>
            <li> The brush is alright, it does the job but I feel like the bristles break my hair  since they are made of a bendable plastic. Overall, this brush is comfortable to grip and helps add volume to your hair, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great brush. Grip is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife. But she is not too happy with it. We bought it for the brand name Conair, which is the last word in hair styling products. It pulls her hair and there is a lot of breakage.</li>
            <li> Great to dry hair but dreadful little part where the comb connects to the soft grip.  Constantly getting hair trapped and pulled there.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Size (I have very long straight hair and the diameter is perfect for blow drying)&lt;br /&gt;-Bristle density&lt;br /&gt;-Bristle stiffness&lt;br /&gt;-No static&lt;br /&gt;-Light weight&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Every other week or so I have to wipe off some of the goo that has oozed out of the top of the handle&lt;br /&gt;-My hair sticks to the gel grip handle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally would like the brush much better if it had a regular ole run of the mill plastic handle. Then it would have gotten 5 stars</li>
            <li> Feels good on my head. The brush is a great size. I would have liked the handle a bit smaller.</li>
            <li> Its an ok round brush its a little weak but it helped get the job done the  bristles kinda sucked</li>
            <li> Much bigger than I was expecting but it doesn&#x27;t get caught in my hair or over heat with a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> As expected. worth the buy</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of the handle.  It seems like it would melt if I was to leave in my car or get it too hot.</li>
            <li> very very bad quality&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t buy it or you will regret</li>
            <li> Really nice brush, it gives a lot of volume to my hair with the blow dryer. but plastic bristles are a bit rough on hair. Still worth it!</li>
            <li> The round metal part of the rush keeps popping off while I blow dry my hair. Other than that its just okay.</li>
            <li> I absolutely would not recommend anyone to purchase this brush. It has a good grip, very comfortable to hold, it&#x27;s a nice size, it&#x27;s not bad on the head, BUT it pulls your hair! Because the handle is that certain mushy material and where that connects to the brush, hair gets caught in there ALL the time. My current brush does that, which is one reason I wanted to buy a new one. However, compared to this brush, my old brush seems like heaven. They really need to figure out a design or different fabric or something because blow drying your hair with this thing will give you a massive HEADACHE!</li>
            <li> Had this brush before and it works great to straighten my long hair. Like the soft grip handle. Makes nice big volume curls and gives lift.</li>
