            <li>and they promptly changed the shipment from perfect bliss to morning glory without husstle.</li>
            <li>this is the best body spray ever and I can no longer find it in stores.</li>
            <li>I received my purchase of Calgon Body Mist - Perfect Bliss soon after I ordered it.  </li>
            <li>None of the bottles had any odor of the Perfect Bliss fragrance.  </li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s happy</li>
            <li>received in excellent condition and I am enjoying the scent already.</li>
            <li>A good product for a not so pricey one.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully when these two bottles are done I can get more!</li>
            <li>It is not a perfume but a great light scent to use after a shower.</li>
            <li>use for after shower spray - very light and calming</li>
            <li>It is a very light, clean scent; I think better that what you get at Bath &amp; Body Works!</li>
            <li>my wife will only use perfect bliss as her after shower body spray ...</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to find this scent at WalMart, but they have stopped carrying it.  </li>
            <li>I have used Calgon Perfect Bliss for years, and have ordered it before from Amazon after I couldn&#x27;t find it in local stores anymore.  </li>
            <li>I bought 6 and will buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li>This is a good buy, worth for the money.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, and it looks like it&#x27;s been discontinued.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad Amazon has it.  </li>
            <li>Have received many compliments on the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It has a real fresh scent.</li>
            <li>I just love this light and fresh scent.</li>
            <li>The product does not seem to be the \\&quot;original or actual\\&quot; scent.   </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s misleading to still have the original product version pictured on the Amazon site.&lt;br</li>
            <li>More importantly, the fragrance is entirely different and smells more like mosquito</li>
            <li>Instead it is a lite, clean, fresh after shower body mist.</li>
            <li>Exactly as I remember !</li>
            <li>I also spray it lightly on pillowcase for a very restful nights sleep...</li>
            <li>Will leave you fresh smelling all day.  </li>
            <li>It is soft fresh light and last longer then most body sprays</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and could not find in the stores anymore.  </li>
            <li>Such a pleasant scent to wear to work or even at home after a long shower.</li>
            <li>the light fresh previous version I&#x27;m used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been having more and more difficult time to find this around my neighbor stores, and even when I find one, it will at least cost $10 or more.</li>
            <li>Not bad, but definitely not the same.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this product before in stores but feel this is possibly old.</li>
            <li>Now having read other reviews, I see I&#x27;m not the only one who thinks the new version is nowhere near the scent of the original verison.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Amazon needs to update its product photos, and the seller needs to double check to make sure any new versions are the same as the previous ones.  </li>
            <li>new product has the same name, but looks like an &amp;#34;updated&amp;#34; version from the new bottle and tabel.  </li>

            <li> my wife will only use perfect bliss as her after shower body spray ... we get it by the case</li>
            <li> The product does not seem to be the \\&quot;original or actual\\&quot; scent.   I dont think its the same as the product sold off the shelf   (which I cant seem to find anywhere, thats why I ordered it  on line). Im very disappointed with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have looked everywhere for this scent.  It is not a perfume but a great light scent to use after a shower.</li>
            <li> Not a perfume or cologne so if you are into an overpowering fragrance, this is not it. Instead it is a lite, clean, fresh after shower body mist. I love it. It&#x27;s hard to find.</li>
            <li> I have mistakenly ordered 10 bottles of this where I meant to order the morning glory sent. I called seller&#x27;s customer service few days later and they promptly changed the shipment from perfect bliss to morning glory without husstle. I have been having more and more difficult time to find this around my neighbor stores, and even when I find one, it will at least cost $10 or more.</li>
            <li> I used to be able to find this scent at WalMart, but they have stopped carrying it.  It is a very light, clean scent; I think better that what you get at Bath &amp; Body Works!</li>
            <li> I have used Calgon Perfect Bliss for years, and have ordered it before from Amazon after I couldn&#x27;t find it in local stores anymore.  Previously, I received what was pictured on the Web site, and it was indeed the same product.  However, this last time I received a different product entirely -- not what was pictured, and certainly not the same fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new product has the same name, but looks like an &amp;#34;updated&amp;#34; version from the new bottle and tabel.  More importantly, the fragrance is entirely different and smells more like mosquito repellent.than the light fresh previous version I&#x27;m used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a complete waste of time and money for me, and I&#x27;m displeased that 1) the Amazon product photo does not reflect the new version, and 2) the new version has a different and awful fragrance.  If I had seen a different product pictured I would have asked about any change in fragrance before ordering.  Now, I&#x27;m just stuck with a terrible product that costs too much in money and trouble to return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon needs to update its product photos, and the seller needs to double check to make sure any new versions are the same as the previous ones.  Otherwise, your customers will be shortchanged.  Now having read other reviews, I see I&#x27;m not the only one who thinks the new version is nowhere near the scent of the original verison.  It&#x27;s misleading to still have the original product version pictured on the Amazon site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this &amp;#34;Perfect Bliss&amp;#34; turned out to be Perfectly Awful!</li>
            <li> expectations met...thank you!..received in excellent condition and I am enjoying the scent already. Hopefully when these two bottles are done I can get more!</li>
            <li> Besides the change in appearance(does not look like bottle shown), the scent is a little different. Not bad, but definitely not the same. probably will not buy again.</li>
            <li> this is the best body spray ever and I can no longer find it in stores. I bought 6 and will buy more when I run out. It is soft fresh light and last longer then most body sprays</li>
            <li> My wife didn&#x27;t think that I could get this product, but I am a hunter with the attitude never say never.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is very weak and off. I&#x27;ve purchased this product before in stores but feel this is possibly old.</li>
            <li> Exactly as I remember !</li>
            <li> this is hard to  get in our area my girlfrend asked me to find her some. she loves it so i bought it for her. it arrived when promised and she&#x27;s happy so all is good.will buy again when she runs out.</li>
            <li> I also spray it lightly on pillowcase for a very restful nights sleep...use for after shower spray - very light and calming</li>
            <li> Will leave you fresh smelling all day.  A good product for a not so pricey one.  This is a good buy, worth for the money.</li>
            <li> Item was sent out of state as a Christmas gift, was told arrived on time as stated, won&#x27;t know anything else till opened.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and could not find in the stores anymore.  I just love this light and fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I received my purchase of Calgon Body Mist - Perfect Bliss soon after I ordered it.  I did not open each bottle until 2-3 weeks later.  None of the bottles had any odor of the Perfect Bliss fragrance.  They all smelled like alcohol.  Either they were diluted or so old the fragrance was totally missing.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, and it looks like it&#x27;s been discontinued.  I&#x27;m glad Amazon has it.  It has a real fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Such a pleasant scent to wear to work or even at home after a long shower. Stays on for quite a while also.</li>
            <li> Have received many compliments on the fragrance.  Have already recommended this to my daughter in-law, and she has also purchased it.  Love it.</li>
