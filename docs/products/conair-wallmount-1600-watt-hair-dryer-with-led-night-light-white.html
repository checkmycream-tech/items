            <li>liked the wall mount as it saves time not having to take a dryer out of the drawer, then out of a case and plug it in.</li>

            <li>I was soooo happy to find an exact replacement!  </li>
            <li>I read reviews on this that said the night light was too bright.  </li>
            <li>Be nice if it had one more (faster) speed</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the most convenient dryer you can own.</li>
            <li>and I loved the added night light feature.  </li>

            <li>:)</li>
            <li>We started using this model 10 years ago - it&#x27;s so much better than putting it in a drawer or leaving it on the counter all the time.  </li>
            <li>I love that my hair dryer is no longer cluttering up my sink area.  </li>
            <li>They are enjoyed by all and used a lot.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>

            <li>Space saver for sure.</li>
            <li>Available when I want it!</li>
            <li>I am beginning to wonder if there is a wallmount dryer that lasts more than a year.</li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>also the mount is a lot bulkier taking up more space than it needs to...</li>
            <li>so you have more room in your drawers.</li>
            <li>Just bought 2 more.</li>
            <li>Great replacement for a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>The dryer was as described, and we are pleased with its design and appearance.</li>
            <li>Because of the placement on the blower, it takes up more space than I anticipated.  </li>
            <li>Pleased</li>
            <li>The wattage is better and it dries my hair faster.</li>
            <li>Love these hair dryers.  </li>
            <li>I am installing two more</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS ITEM, HAVE ONE IN EVERY BATHROOM.</li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>They really are great.</li>
            <li>I felt confident when ordering the brand name because I figured they had years of experience with these products.</li>
            <li>I love that it mounts on the wall</li>
            <li>but I wish it had more power.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I put the Conair 134R hair dryer on my guests bathroom wall and my visiting company love the idea because they do not have to lug a hair dryer along when they visit me.  </li>
            <li>The hair dryer itself is perfect for simple operation...</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>sure to install away from water.</li>

            <li>and even I was able to install them myself.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s okay.  </li>

            <li>Well pleased.  </li>
            <li>I do like the night light feature too!</li>

            <li>Yes, I could have picked it up and put it away, but that just didn&#x27;t happen most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I think that they need to use a switch that can handle more amps.</li>
            <li>I love how it hangs on the wall</li>
            <li>and it allows you more room.</li>
            <li>Works like a champ, and I love</li>
            <li>Love the fact that they are wall mounted.</li>
            <li>I love that the dryer is off the bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li>Be sure and mount to wall with screws.</li>
            <li>I love they way it stores on the wall, out of the way.</li>
            <li>I love having the hair dryer mounted.</li>
            <li>Love this...</li>
            <li>This is a replacement for the one I have had for many years.</li>

            <li>Easy to install, has it&#x27;s own night light, and will even flip the switch to the off position when you re-holster it</li>
            <li>It is very light and easy to manipulate.</li>
            <li>These are super handy.</li>
            <li>We love the convenience of having wall mounted hair dryers that have 2 settings for drying our hair, are lightweight and easy to handle, and have the added feature of a nightlight.</li>
            <li>so it isn&#x27;t too much light - just kind of like the light you would see on a computer supply cord.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compact, light weight and the night light is handy.</li>
            <li>The night light is just right without being too bright.  </li>
            <li>Love the night light.  </li>
            <li>So far, 2 months, works great.</li>
            <li>Love the night light, it is out of the way, shuts off when you replace it, and looks attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Feels cheap but works OK.  </li>
            <li>I love its compactness and the convenient night light feature.  </li>
            <li>and we loved that one so much that we bought another.  </li>
            <li>The dryer works good and it is very convient to have it so close at hand.</li>
            <li>I was very excited when I saw it available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I use them often and when guests come they are so handy because they are right there on the wall .</li>
            <li>I have these hairdryers in both of our bathrooms and they are so handy because they are right there.  </li>
            <li>It is beautiful, space save, powerful and very durable plus it has a night light.</li>
            <li>Makes it easy to replace.</li>
            <li>The hair dryer will still mount but has a habit of falling easily if disturbed.</li>
            <li>Easy to mount.</li>
            <li>Found that this easy &amp;#34;repair&amp;#34; needs to be repeated every couple of years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to mount.  </li>
            <li>dryers are easy to installed</li>
            <li>Easy to mount.  </li>
            <li>were easy to install and use.  </li>
            <li>Was easy to install and worked well ....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to mount and has plenty of power.</li>
            <li>Installation is easy.</li>
            <li>and I have had wall mount dryers before and are an easy install.  </li>
            <li>easy to install.</li>
            <li>Once installed, the plate makes it easy to get the product on and off the wall.</li>
            <li>Easy to use to style with.</li>
            <li>Cradle seems to hold well, and release easily.</li>
            <li>Saves space and easy to mount.</li>
            <li>so the screws would easily go through.</li>
            <li>The dryer still goes in but without the clips it comes out too easily.  </li>
            <li>Easy fix</li>
            <li>Easy to mount.  </li>
            <li>Once the screen has been removed, built up lint can be accessed and cleaned easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to do</li>
            <li>Easy installation, and the wife loves it, so in my book</li>
            <li>The unit is compact and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to install.</li>
            <li>That one is still going strong.</li>
            <li>This one&#x27;s not quite as good as some competition or Conair&#x27;s older product.</li>
            <li>I mounted it right next to the changing table, and it is flawless.</li>
            <li>The light isn&#x27;t very bright but gives off enough light</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m off to buy a full size hairdryer with more power and will just have to figure out a place to hang it.  </li>
            <li>they ALWAYS elect to use this - and it&#x27;s obviously installed very conveniently in the bathroom - good screws and installation instructions that come with it.</li>
            <li>I am almost certain they sent a refurbished piece of junk!!!</li>
            <li>(the dryer was fine, it was the holder).  </li>
            <li>but it is fine for me.</li>
            <li>They are so easy and light to handle.</li>
            <li>It died.this one is strong or light, depending on what you need it for.  </li>
            <li>It is ideal for bathrooms with limited counter space.</li>
            <li>This is great for a smaller bathroom - like I have - and it mounted easily on the wall</li>
            <li>No hunting for the dryer, no unwrapping and untangling cords, it&#x27;s always right there, super handy.  </li>
            <li>Very nice simple design - easy to use.</li>
            <li>Nice little dryer‚Ä¶fits great on the wall and has a lot of power.</li>
            <li>This will cause the dryer to no longer securely attach to the wall unit.</li>
            <li>Night light has night sensor.  </li>
            <li>So handy and so much neater in appearance.</li>
            <li>My Wife loves it and that&#x27;s important.</li>
            <li>This dryer has a night light</li>
            <li>I like is night light since I&#x27;m a Bald Guy.</li>
            <li>Conjecture is that those who experienced short life with this appliance may not have cleaned the lint filter as often as required.</li>
            <li>It does a great job drying both my longer hair and my husband&#x27;s short hair.</li>
            <li>THis dryer is great - especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>I like the nite light that&#x27;s built into it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another feature is that it comes with a night light that does go off when the bathroom light goes on.</li>
            <li>Worked great but only lasted about 2 years.  </li>
            <li>night light is added bonus</li>
            <li>and my husband likes the night light feature.</li>
            <li>The night light is a bonus.</li>
            <li>the nite light on both dryers does not work.</li>
            <li>compact, light, and 1600 watt.  </li>
            <li>I also has a night light on it.</li>
            <li>Rating is based upon value, as I searched many different options and this was the most cost effective with a nightlight.  </li>
            <li>The night light is on a LED sensor so no turning on or off.</li>
            <li>I also like led night light</li>
            <li>The girls liked it so much</li>
            <li>The night light is also a gr8 feature for finding your way to the bathroom at night.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thought if hotels had these wall mounts, then they might be available out there.  </li>
            <li>I needed a light-weight dryer because of an arm injury and this one is indeed light.  </li>
            <li>Also, when plugging in, there was no power to the light unit.</li>
            <li>It lasted for 12 years Ilove the sturdy construction and the continuous LED light.</li>
            <li>and I also like the automatic night light.</li>
            <li>I had to search my garage for self tapping metal screws to match the hole size and finally after a good hour or so was able to attach the wall plate that holds the dryer.</li>
            <li>After a good bit of research &amp; reading reviews, I ordered this model to replace an old Oster model.</li>
            <li>so far so good; works as promised, and arrived on time.</li>
            <li>The extra feature of a night light is very nice for our home use.</li>
            <li>I love this hairdryer and the ease of having it on the wall right there to use</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it&#x27;s right by the sink</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for anyone for sure!</li>
            <li>It is very powerful for the size.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t very powerful</li>
            <li>I find it very handy for my daily hair drying.</li>
            <li>Easy to mount and easy to use; powerful without harming hair.</li>
            <li>While it may not be the most powerful or versatile hair dryer available, it is certainly the most convenient.  </li>
            <li>Powerful!</li>
            <li>My wife has one or two others that have specialty attachments  and are probably more powerful, but this is the one that she uses as the primary one, because it is always right there, nothing to pull out and plug in etc.</li>
            <li>It was easy to install, and the night light is a great feature for people who use the shower room after dark.</li>
            <li>I took it apart to clean it</li>
            <li>- I got a good 15 years worth of use out of the old one, so I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s right there for quick easy use and has a night light, as well.</li>
            <li>This dryer would be wonderful if it fit on the small wall I have to plug it into!  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and right at your fingertips Ilovesanta</li>
            <li>the fact I purchased the exact same model again tells you how happy I am with it.</li>
            <li>It also has a nice nightlight built in and that&#x27;s handy in a dark bathroom.</li>
            <li>Alot more attractive than a dryer sitting around on a counter or taking up needed space in the small cabinet under the sink.  </li>
            <li>I was happy to find the exact same item</li>
            <li>Try different brand and still thinking Conair did a good job on this one.</li>
            <li>Looks good and very quiet.</li>
            <li>&amp; I loved it enough to repurchase rather than getting another brand or style.</li>
            <li>Love it, very convenient.</li>
            <li>But good enough for what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Being able to have a blow dryer at hand, rather than stuffed in some drawer or cabinet, makes the morning routine so much easier.  </li>
            <li>Overall, a good value for the money.</li>
            <li>good product, good price fast delivery exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>For the price it was not bad</li>
            <li>Handy little blowdryer, better than leaving one plugged in on vanity!</li>
            <li>Super cheap, very quiet, with a nice night light, barely use any electricity, great heat, simple to use, VERY comfortable in hand.</li>
            <li>The price was acceptable and I was pleased to have my old non-working appliance replaced so easily.</li>
            <li>So convenient to have it right there on the wall, and the night light is a bonus.</li>
            <li>It is ideal for me and easy to use and out of the way, just right for a small space</li>
            <li>but I can tell you it was pretty easy to install.</li>
            <li>A great little hairdryer and sturdy mount with night light.</li>
            <li>Lots of power for straight hair and low is also great for curly hair.</li>
            <li>Lucky for us.</li>
            <li>I received it quickly.  </li>
            <li>Cools  off quickly with the side mount hanging.  </li>
            <li>The night light is a nice extra.</li>
            <li>I really liked how it dries and the general look.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re really convenient and super easy to use.</li>
            <li>I bought this dryer for myself a few months ago and liked it so much I bought two more for each of my two grand daughters.</li>
            <li>I love my new wall mounted hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>He looked all over for another one, and was really happy to find this one that would fit in his small bathroom.</li>
            <li>The first one lasted about 5 years - it&#x27;s actually good for a hair dryer that gets daily use.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kind of cool, I just don&#x27;t totally get it.  </li>
            <li>Had one that finally wore out and loved it so much bought another one just like it!</li>
            <li>We are extremely please with the design and the white night light is a nice feature and not too bright as was mentioned in reviews of alternative models.</li>
            <li>Easy to install, not too loud, no complain!!!</li>
            <li>This is my second one, I love it!</li>
            <li>Just what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much!!</li>
            <li>When I first saw this model I was excited about the practicality of it&#x27;s wall mount design, and the sleek styling it offered.  </li>
            <li>Lots of hot air!</li>
            <li>works great,  no cord mess &amp; no place to find it ...</li>
            <li>This latest one I bought because I thought I would start fresh at my new condo.  </li>
            <li>It dries quickly and is handy to have mounted on the wall next to my bathroom sink.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great little dryer.  </li>
            <li>Great little dryer.</li>
            <li>I really like the night light too.  </li>
            <li>night light is very convenient and I have had no trouhle with it.</li>
            <li>It is compact but powerful.</li>
            <li>But - gotta say I&#x27;m really glad we kept the old unit.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to find the same design still available.  </li>
            <li>Powerful with 2 speeds and has a night lite.</li>
            <li>I liked the looks of it and that it turns off automatically when inserted back into the receptacle.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful and compact.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s more powerful than my old hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>Powerful, efficient and convenient.</li>
            <li>so far I&#x27;m 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li>I like this hair dryer, it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>Worth every penney.  </li>
            <li>I think it is pretty cool.</li>
            <li>This replacement is a clone in every respect and fits the bill, compact, lightweight and powerful.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s worth 5 stars.</li>
            <li>My wife liked it enough that she bought 2 of these when we got home from our ski trip.  </li>
            <li>Mounting is easy, very easy to use, but why we purchased this is that it is out and with a simple grab, its ready to go.</li>
            <li>I tell myself I am going to get a new one, but the price of the dryer is not bad and it&#x27;s more convenient to just buy another, vs. having to get another kind of dryer that has a different foot print and will potentially cause more damage to your wall.</li>
            <li>(Note that not keeping the lint filter clean will cause this issue as well, due to restricted airflow over the thermocouple).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indeed, a pretty darn good unit for the money.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and quick delivery.</li>
            <li>LED nightlight isn&#x27;t super bright, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me at night even with the bathroom door open into my bedroom, but is bright enough that you can see in the middle of the night once you get in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this dryer for its convenience and quick hair drying!</li>
            <li>That one went right in the plate that was already there.</li>
            <li>always right where it&#x27;s mounted</li>
            <li>works well, priced right, but the attachment bracket almost makes it is &amp;#34;permanent&amp;#34; attachment to your wall.  </li>
            <li>Immediately purchased this and hung it right up.</li>
            <li>Gives the luxury of a hotel right in my bathroom</li>
            <li>it is just right for drying my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The price is right as well.</li>
            <li>They really help to clean up the clutter.</li>
            <li>looks good on the wall and has enough cord to mount just about anywhere in a normal bathroom.</li>
            <li>Again, a very easy fix but a step that should have been anticipated and handled prior to the product leaving product development.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This item is great if you have a small bathroom like I do.  </li>
            <li>but I just use my own brush to control my hair as I blow dry.</li>
            <li>The previous lasted 4 years and the mounting plate is still good so all you need is switch the units.</li>
            <li>We mounted a 2nd unit on the same wall bracket in about 5 seconds and are again happy campers.</li>
            <li>I love having my hair dryer ready for action whenever I need it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it is powerful enough to handle most every requirement.</li>
            <li>Also has an LED night light which provides just enough light to see in the bathroom at night.</li>
            <li>Currently on the 3rd hair dryer in 10 years so happy with product and cost is very reasonable.   </li>
            <li>The original unit worked fine until the internal fan that pulls air through the unit shattered.  </li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s great to have it up on the wall and out of the way, the small size makes it better suited to short hair.  </li>
            <li>Fit right where the old dyers was mounted.</li>
            <li>The first one is about 10 years old and running strong.</li>
            <li>I like this hair dryer very much.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s working fine.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it is a good little appliance.</li>
            <li>Good little dryer.  </li>
            <li>The dual dryer settings are useful and the high setting is quite powerful- plenty for ay hair type in my opinoin.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>so if I ever get married again she will have one to use.</li>
            <li>ONE, MY FIRST ONE BROKE WHERE THE HAIR DRYER HOOKS INTO THE MOUNT, I WOULD MAKE THAT AREA STRONGER.</li>
            <li>Worked great for at least 15 years.</li>
            <li>I owned this exact product for about 5 years before it \\&quot;died\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased with its performance, so I purchased the same dryer again.  </li>
            <li>It has helped with the clutter in the kids bathroom soooo much!</li>
            <li>Take it off, turn it all and you are receiving a blast of hot air.  </li>
            <li>a feature I am very fond of!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m presently seeking a better made model, after all,</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re going to mount something on your wall, you want it to last more than a year, no?</li>
            <li>I had the first one for about 3 or 4 years</li>
            <li>Love it and use it daily.  </li>
            <li>works perfect for us, not too big and not too small, wife luvs the ease of it on the wall</li>
            <li>I plan to buy more of this product for gifts in the future.</li>
            <li>I have a hair dryer with higher wattage than this one.  </li>
            <li>It was a gift and exactly what she asked for.  </li>
            <li>The nightlight is just a dim light</li>
            <li>Works well, doesn&#x27;t make the bathroom hot.</li>
            <li>My first Conair lasted for 12 years.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s exactly what she has been asking for.</li>
            <li>The first lasted about 10 years.</li>
            <li>But it will work perfect for the times I have guests and give them that cheesy hotel feeling.</li>
            <li>Many of the wall mounted units have to be placed back into the wall mounting to turn off.  </li>
            <li>the night light died early in its lifetime but it still dries hair...</li>
            <li>Very convenient and efficient!</li>
            <li>We were always leaving the hair dryer on the counter as it was hot</li>
            <li>Installation was straight forward, unit is compact, and powerful.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with this manufacturer.  </li>
            <li>The blower is powerful and my hair dries fast.</li>
            <li>It is a noisy unit and can get quite warm, but performs as I expected.</li>
            <li>I tried supplied sticky tape first and it fell off the wall within 3 days</li>
            <li>The first one still worked, but wore out the clip to hold it in over years of use.</li>
            <li>I love everything about this hairdryer - it is smaller, quieter, hangs on the wall</li>
            <li>So convenient to have it right there ready to go in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>Works great though the night light is kinda useless.</li>
            <li>Pretty clunky-looking and too large for my dinky bathroom.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast and item was exactly what we were looking for.  </li>
            <li>easy to mount with double faced tape.</li>
            <li>My grand daughter comes here when she is in a hurry to dry her hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Installation is easy and can be done by anyone with even extremely basic skills in no</li>
            <li>Good for short to medium hair, but not for long hair.  </li>
            <li>So I went with the tape, and I&#x27;m pleased to say it went up without a single hitch and is holding the unit up with no problem whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>I would have given it a 5 star rating but I am replacing it with like kind, and my former one burned out prematurely; so I&#x27;m not expecting this one to last any longer than the first one.  </li>
            <li>The metal plate has knock outs for direct wire as well, if your outlet or electrical box happens to be in the exact right position.  </li>
            <li>The rear filter screen on the new unit fell right off out of the box.</li>
            <li>and I just plain LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I had a huge oldschool Conair for ages, literally decades, before it finally gave out, so I knew I&#x27;d be going with a Conair again.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>But that is really all I need.</li>
            <li>For some reason when it is plugged in it has a low buzz, as if the night light is doing something.  </li>
            <li>The fan became very sluggish and the coils would overheat, then it would spark and the thermostat would reset.  </li>
            <li>never have to turn on the bathroom light in the middle of the night..</li>
            <li>and you are ready to go.  </li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m getting ready to buy # 9</li>
            <li>Always plugged in and ready to use.</li>
            <li>Very efficient.</li>
            <li>Very well made.  </li>
            <li>It is very convenient and has a nightlight.</li>
            <li>They are convenient and very reliable.  </li>
            <li>Night light is just enough to see but not keep you awake.</li>
            <li>This Conair Wallmount Dryer with LED night light was my second purchase.  </li>
            <li>We have had this dryer in all of the hotels we&#x27;ve stayed at in Mexico, and it really is the way to have a dryer at your fingertips without taking up counter space.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast as always.  </li>
            <li>It is there on the wall ready for use.</li>
            <li>Just enough light.</li>
            <li>so much quiter maby just appeares to be that way.  </li>
            <li>One is in the guest room and doesn&#x27;t get much use.  </li>
            <li>And for a condo that is also a vacation rental, this works very well.</li>
            <li>I would have preferred a 3 speed model, but they are very scarce.</li>
            <li>Love this hair dryer, but the handle area turned pink within about 2 weeks of using it.</li>
            <li>suggest discarding the plastic anchors provided and using the self tapping plastic anchors available at your local store (or here on Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I guess adding a dollar to the price might be too much to ask.</li>
            <li>I am very please with the operation of the unit.  </li>
            <li>The light is now a LED version, which saves power but but puts out much less light than the older model-</li>
            <li>I really like this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Very neat.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>built better than I had expected and well thought out.</li>
            <li>I really like the dryer but the install for drywall without studs inserts</li>
            <li>She finds it very convenient.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is really convenient to have the dryer hanging oon the wall, out of the way until you are ready to use it.</li>
            <li>All of them lasted very well.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Reasonable wall-mount dryer for the price.</li>
            <li>i especially like the night light.</li>
            <li>and then you&#x27;ll have something that throws out enough light to  work as a nightlight.</li>
            <li>been using the same kind for several years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had it about a month, but so far I am pleased with it&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li>It would be helpful to know this since a super lengthy cord could be challenging in a small bathroom.......</li>
            <li>Even when it was new it didn&#x27;t blow a lot of air, though it did get fairly hot.  </li>
            <li>Have had other Conairs for many years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably get two more for the other guest baths.</li>
            <li>Very slick hair dryer with good power.</li>
            <li>Night light wouldn&#x27;t light up a small box.</li>
            <li>Great blow dryer, but does not hold tight in the holder, but rather loosely.  </li>
            <li>The older ones got clogged in the filter area and had to be cleaned (one just stopped working - and smelled like over heating) -- the next one I learned to clean.  </li>
            <li>After the metal plate is removed from the back of the front, it is easy to loosen the cord anchors allowing one to adjust the length of the power cord depending on how far way the outlet is.  </li>
            <li>It dries my hair pretty quickly and I have long hair.</li>
            <li>has a small light that turns on while your bathroom light is off, i would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This is an exact replacement for our old one.</li>
            <li>But the screen on the old unit was an exact match.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fixed on the wall and always ready to be used!</li>
            <li>Excellant hot air to dry hair quickly .</li>
            <li>Blowing into the back got old pretty quick, and in the hope</li>
            <li>Has a little more heat which she wants.</li>
            <li>I have it in a rental condo and it has been working ok for about a year and a half.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned two older models and then just bought the newest model.  </li>
            <li>Product was what I wanted, ordering was simple and delivery happened quickly.  </li>
            <li>Very convenient to use and powerful enough for even the longest hair.  </li>
            <li>This took several trips as I wanted to make sure they weren&#x27;t too big</li>
            <li>If this had been for an older woman without a knowledge of drilling out metal, this would have been a return.</li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer--this is my second purchase of this model, the last one was 8 years ago.  </li>
            <li>but I can honestly say I am very pleased with the performance of the product for the price and would not let a few poor reviews stop me from buying this product .My</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Would recommend this highly.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Love this little guy.  </li>
            <li>but I wish they put a little more R&amp;D into the durability.</li>
            <li>What can I say, a minute saved is a minute earned, and I reclaimed much needed drawer space by replacing my old, bulky, heavyweight dryer with this wall mounted one.  </li>
            <li>Small, light yet powerful.</li>
            <li>I can tell by closer examination that it would only get more stretched.</li>
            <li>NO complaint.</li>
            <li>It does go off when normal room lighting is on.  </li>
            <li>I have it mounted on the right wall above the outlet, about 18&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Second one mounted right on  the originals mounting plate in seconds.</li>
            <li>On this one I had to cut the cord and re splice it, due to it being hooked to the Light</li>
            <li>My wife loves her new Conair wall mount hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>I bought a new one to replace it.</li>
            <li>This new one is for a new home.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item new in the box</li>
            <li>Mounted in new poop deck bathroom</li>
            <li>Bought a new home</li>
            <li>I bought them to put up in my new beach house.</li>
            <li>Not only are they handy, you don&#x27;t have to waste space in your drawer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine, but the air is not nearly as hot as my old 1600 watt unit by another maker...</li>
            <li>I have very straight, short hair.  </li>
            <li>For our small bathroom, it is very convient and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to mount, provides  plenty of heat, and the cord length is long enough so you don&#x27;t have to stretch to use it.</li>
            <li>The nightlight is also nice - although we don&#x27;t normally dry our hair in the dark.</li>
            <li>Bought two of them for our bathrooms, easy to install, fits flat with your flat wall or on tile, drill screws into grout part of your tile if your going to install in tile otherwise your tile may break.  </li>
            <li>It fits reasonably tight to the wall and the dryer snaps in and out of the holder easily.</li>
            <li>Plan to buy a couple more for our other bathrooms as  well as a back up to keep on hand.</li>
            <li>The first one died (I contributed by not cleaning it enough).  </li>
            <li>The first one lasted five years and the second lasted 4 1/2 years.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to get this hairdryer as we have no space in our tiny bathroom to store a bigger hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>One dryer glowed red hot after 8 months.</li>
            <li>My first one lasted about 9 months and then began to continually overheat and shut off several times during my styling process.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly the same one as in the hotel.  </li>
            <li>Our first Conair lasted 7 years of daily rigorous use.</li>
            <li>It actually looks pretty cute on my wall in my small bathroom.</li>
            <li>No more cords and more space in vanityüòÄ</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace the exact same one I had purchased 15 years ago.</li>
            <li>The first one finally stopped working after 8 years.</li>
            <li>New unit was exactly the same as the old.</li>
            <li>To those of you that had the units burn up, may I suggest that once a week you clean the dust and other fuzzy stuff from the air intake portion of the dryer......</li>
            <li>A 1600 watt hair dryer can&#x27;t give my hair the lift I&#x27;m used to, and it takes a few minutes longer to style because the air motion isn&#x27;t as strong nor hot enough.</li>
            <li>(it might dry 10 or more people&#x27;s hair in a single day where we have it).</li>
            <li>The 2 little tabs that snap the screen onto the main housing were like melted smooth and could not be fixed.</li>
            <li>My only objection was that the plastic clips which hold the dryer in place broke easily, and the part of the cord that attaches to the dryer came loose.  </li>
            <li>After 12 years, my old (exactly the same) dryer died - it didn&#x27;t owe me a thing.  </li>
            <li>Screw the screws through the holes (if you were lucky enough to get one with holes) to make pilot holes in the wall where you will want to install the plastic self taping anchors.&lt;br /&gt;Screw the self tapping anchors into the drywall (do not over tighten) then put the metal plate back up and align the hole patterns.  </li>
            <li>It fit in our motor home space and held tightly without shifting during travel.</li>
            <li>I tossed my Remington and LOVE this little, convenient giant of a hair-dryer!  </li>
            <li>I wanted to have something that helped keep counters clear.  </li>
            <li>I like this hair dryer because it was stronger than my old wallmount dryer.  </li>
            <li>Reason replace old dryer was that plastic holders broke and had to lay dryer on counter.</li>
            <li>I hope it lasts as long as the first one</li>
            <li>The old one lasted 10 years and</li>
            <li>We have to replace it every year or two, but I imagine in residential use it would last much longer</li>
            <li>It stretched and re-coiled about 50% on the first try.</li>
            <li>Convenient and classy wall mount hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Conair Wallmount Dryer because we absolutely wore out our last one</li>
            <li>I could 50 year old women.</li>
            <li>Had to leave 1 and 2 at my old house.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t think it would work as well as the ones in the hotel as I figured there&#x27;s was a commercial grade.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised it worked just as well.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t want to screw into the wall above the outlet because I have no idea how the apartment bathroom is wired.  </li>
            <li>So I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as relying on it for a nightlight.  </li>
            <li>I was so panicked when my old one gave out that I shelled out for next-day,</li>
            <li>My 3 ladies of the house have used it and like it so far.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully this one will not suffer from early death syndrome.</li>
            <li>and I have one in each bathroom - very convenient since it does not take up extra space</li>
            <li>so I just pulled the old one off the wall, adjusted the cord length and snapped the now one in.</li>
            <li>I would expect it to last longer than that-maybe I am expecting too much</li>
            <li>The green night light is also helpful to find my way into the bathroom when the sun has not  yet risen.</li>
            <li>Bought this to replace old one but model feels cheaper.  </li>
            <li>My old Conair burntout beacause I never cleaned it.</li>
            <li>makes the age old problem of hair dryer storage and cord tangle fade away.</li>
            <li>this one must have cheaper parts it completely broke in 5 months</li>
            <li>Two settings High is hot and blows hard and low is significantly cooler and blows rather soft.  </li>
            <li>so it is not really suitable as a night light for the bathroom as the older model was (otherwise I would have given 5 stars).  </li>
            <li>The nightlight seems like a total afterthought, it certainly doesn&#x27;t put enough light out to help you find stuff in the dark bathroom or not stub your toe.  </li>
            <li>Small, easy to mount.  </li>
            <li>The last one held up for several years and am hoping the same will be true with this one.</li>
            <li>The old one just stopped working on the high setting, but still works on low.</li>
            <li>Also on the old ones, I could just take it from the wll mount bracket and use it like a regular Blower, or just put a new one in an old prewall mounted bracket.  </li>
            <li>I bought this as a replacement for the exact same model that lasted several years.  </li>
            <li>From personal experience I know it&#x27;s easy to put this little chore off.</li>
            <li>same as old one that was at least 14 years old, got the same model and it works even better, did not have to even install the newer wall mount was also the exact same.</li>
            <li>Provides very, very little light.  </li>
            <li>Then pulled out the included screws and to my surprise found out that the holes were way too small for the screws to fit through.</li>
            <li>And ... that unit still runs but the thermocouple switch that shuts the unit off when it overheats has &amp;#34;worn&amp;#34; over the years and has begun to engage a little too quickly.</li>
            <li>The new one that I ordered don&#x27;t really seem to have quite as much air movement as they did in the past,</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace one just like it , I have used it everyday for at least 5years, I love the way it is out of the way , and right at your finger tips.</li>
            <li>when you put the hair dryer back in the wall mount, there&#x27;s a little plastic piece that holds it in securely and that piece was damaged.  </li>
            <li>Was easy to install (instructions made installation seem more complicated that it was) and works well (no louder than your average dryer).  </li>
            <li>Small but very powerful.</li>
            <li>I find myself again in need of a new wall mounted hair dryer, dreading removing this one and remounting the next.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Hopefully this new one will come soon and last longer.</li>
            <li>My first Conair served and lasted me a long time, therefore, there was no question that I needed and wanted to have it replaced with one of the same.</li>
            <li>Also this only have high and low settings while old dryer had 3 settings.  </li>
            <li>My only concern is that this my second one and with the first I found that unless the item is placed very carefully back in the hanger that the clips can/do break off.  </li>
            <li>This seems as hot as my other dryer.  </li>
            <li>We have a very small bathroom (You know the kind where you have to go to the next room to change the toilet tissue.).</li>
            <li>Also, no spare parts are available for this model; therefore, I was not able to fix the former one.</li>
            <li>We had these in our old home and left them so as not to disturb the wallpaper.  </li>
            <li>This replaced a 20 year old unit of the same design</li>
            <li>I also purchased one for the male&#x27;s bathroom in the house and will put in the master bathroom once I am complete with the remodel</li>
            <li>I hope it is fixed in the future.</li>
            <li>Only had this item for about a week, but so far it seems to work well.  </li>
            <li>The clip on our old one finally broke after years of usage.  </li>
            <li>the directions for mounting are like many, you have to translate a poor picture.</li>
            <li>Not good way to deal with dangling cord ... can&#x27;t easily wrap around holder and no hook or anything to store it.</li>
            <li>It is powerful enough for my family, but if you have thick or long hair with a lot of girls in your family this hair dryer might not be powerful enough for you.</li>
            <li>My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t find what is essentially the same hair dryer - also available from Amazon - without the wasted (and unneeded) plastic frame (housing... frame?)  </li>
            <li>The high setting burned out, and the low setting is not hot enough nor fast enough for me.  </li>
            <li>the elements started glowing bright red and smelled like it was going to burst into flames...very irritating as I had owned one previously that lasted for years....</li>
            <li>i just need to add a telephone and an emergency pull cord near the toilet.</li>
            <li>When it cools down, it goes back to hot.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying another - since it will slide right into the space vacated by the old one I won&#x27;t have any wallpaper issues to contend with and, for $20, its hard to beat the value.</li>
            <li>My housekeeper accidently broke the little latch on the first one</li>
            <li>It is a little more expensive but well worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lasted me through a total of 4 years with really long hair and 4 years of short hair, daily use, and no problems until the very end (the &amp;#34;High&amp;#34; setting gave out suddenly).</li>
            <li>only complaint is my original was in chrome</li>
            <li>Lets hope it lasts as long as my old one.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have really thick or long hair--it will probably work just fine.</li>
            <li>Dries hair just Lila hair dryers should dry it a wow product</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bright enough to be your only night light in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>Previously had an OSTER, but the last two I have had didn&#x27;t last very long.&lt;br /&gt;Trying</li>
            <li>These little hairdryers work very well for their size.</li>
            <li>The mount on the wall is reasonable in size and the dryer works very well on my wife&#x27;s very thick hair.  </li>
            <li>two speeds, switches up for high, down for low.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have owned three of these wall-mounted hair dryers because they perform well and look good.</li>

            <li> but this is a good quality hair dryer.</li>

            <li> Nice nightlight that works automaticlly.</li>

            <li> I was soooo happy to find an exact replacement!  </li>
            <li> I read reviews on this that said the night light was too bright.  </li>
            <li> Be nice if it had one more (faster) speed</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the most convenient dryer you can own.</li>
            <li> and I loved the added night light feature.  </li>

            <li> :)</li>
            <li> We started using this model 10 years ago - it&#x27;s so much better than putting it in a drawer or leaving it on the counter all the time.  </li>
            <li> I love that my hair dryer is no longer cluttering up my sink area.  </li>
            <li> They are enjoyed by all and used a lot.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Powerful &amp; good looking wallmount hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Love the wall mount dryer</li>
            <li> I went about 3 feet at most.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Space saver for sure.</li>
            <li> Available when I want it!</li>
            <li> I am beginning to wonder if there is a wallmount dryer that lasts more than a year.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> also the mount is a lot bulkier taking up more space than it needs to...</li>
            <li> so you have more room in your drawers.</li>
            <li> Just bought 2 more.</li>
            <li> Great replacement for a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> The dryer was as described, and we are pleased with its design and appearance.</li>
            <li> Because of the placement on the blower, it takes up more space than I anticipated.  </li>
            <li> Pleased</li>
            <li> The wattage is better and it dries my hair faster.</li>
            <li> Love these hair dryers.  </li>
            <li> I am installing two more</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS ITEM, HAVE ONE IN EVERY BATHROOM.</li>
            <li> This dryer frees up space on the counter top.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> They really are great.</li>
            <li> I felt confident when ordering the brand name because I figured they had years of experience with these products.</li>
            <li> I love that it mounts on the wall</li>
            <li> but I wish it had more power.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I put the Conair 134R hair dryer on my guests bathroom wall and my visiting company love the idea because they do not have to lug a hair dryer along when they visit me.  </li>
            <li> The hair dryer itself is perfect for simple operation...</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> sure to install away from water.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s mounted on the wall.  </li>
            <li> I love everything about this dryer.  </li>
            <li> Could have more power.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> and even I was able to install them myself.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> Love this hairdryer.</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC!  </li>
            <li> We love this.</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> My wife &amp; daughter love the convenience of having it mounted in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> love the  convenience</li>
            <li> The nightlight is perfect as far as light intensity.  </li>
            <li> Well pleased.  </li>
            <li> I do like the night light feature too!</li>
            <li> but that was after more than a dozen years.</li>
            <li> off the vanity top</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> More of a &amp;#34;find my hair dryer in the dark&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I love the night lite it has.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I could have picked it up and put it away, but that just didn&#x27;t happen most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I think that they need to use a switch that can handle more amps.</li>
            <li> I love how it hangs on the wall</li>
            <li> and it allows you more room.</li>
            <li> Works like a champ, and I love</li>
            <li> Love the fact that they are wall mounted.</li>
            <li> I love that the dryer is off the bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li> Be sure and mount to wall with screws.</li>
            <li> I love they way it stores on the wall, out of the way.</li>
            <li> I love having the hair dryer mounted.</li>
            <li> Love this...</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for the one I have had for many years.</li>
            <li> I just love that it hangs up out of the way in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> It is just right for my wife&#x27;s needs and the night light is a welcome plus.</li>
            <li> Easily accessible and looks nice.</li>
            <li> Great product, sleek design and high powered wall mount hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Powerful dryer and easy to install, at a good price.  </li>
            <li> Easy to install, has it&#x27;s own night light, and will even flip the switch to the off position when you re-holster it</li>
            <li> It is very light and easy to manipulate.</li>
            <li> These are super handy.</li>
            <li> We love the convenience of having wall mounted hair dryers that have 2 settings for drying our hair, are lightweight and easy to handle, and have the added feature of a nightlight.</li>
            <li> so it isn&#x27;t too much light - just kind of like the light you would see on a computer supply cord.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact, light weight and the night light is handy.</li>
            <li> The night light is just right without being too bright.  </li>
            <li> Love the night light.  </li>
            <li> So far, 2 months, works great.</li>
            <li> Love the night light, it is out of the way, shuts off when you replace it, and looks attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Feels cheap but works OK.  </li>
            <li> I love its compactness and the convenient night light feature.  </li>
            <li> and we loved that one so much that we bought another.  </li>
            <li> The dryer works good and it is very convient to have it so close at hand.</li>
            <li> I was very excited when I saw it available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I use them often and when guests come they are so handy because they are right there on the wall .</li>
            <li> I have these hairdryers in both of our bathrooms and they are so handy because they are right there.  </li>
            <li> It is beautiful, space save, powerful and very durable plus it has a night light.</li>
            <li> Makes it easy to replace.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer will still mount but has a habit of falling easily if disturbed.</li>
            <li> Easy to mount.</li>
            <li> Found that this easy &amp;#34;repair&amp;#34; needs to be repeated every couple of years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to mount.  </li>
            <li> dryers are easy to installed</li>
            <li> Easy to mount.  </li>
            <li> were easy to install and use.  </li>
            <li> Was easy to install and worked well ....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to mount and has plenty of power.</li>
            <li> Installation is easy.</li>
            <li> and I have had wall mount dryers before and are an easy install.  </li>
            <li> easy to install.</li>
            <li> Once installed, the plate makes it easy to get the product on and off the wall.</li>
            <li> Easy to use to style with.</li>
            <li> Cradle seems to hold well, and release easily.</li>
            <li> Saves space and easy to mount.</li>
            <li> so the screws would easily go through.</li>
            <li> The dryer still goes in but without the clips it comes out too easily.  </li>
            <li> Easy fix</li>
            <li> Easy to mount.  </li>
            <li> Once the screen has been removed, built up lint can be accessed and cleaned easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to do</li>
            <li> Easy installation, and the wife loves it, so in my book</li>
            <li> The unit is compact and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to install.</li>
            <li> That one is still going strong.</li>
            <li> This one&#x27;s not quite as good as some competition or Conair&#x27;s older product.</li>
            <li> I mounted it right next to the changing table, and it is flawless.</li>
            <li> The light isn&#x27;t very bright but gives off enough light</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m off to buy a full size hairdryer with more power and will just have to figure out a place to hang it.  </li>
            <li> they ALWAYS elect to use this - and it&#x27;s obviously installed very conveniently in the bathroom - good screws and installation instructions that come with it.</li>
            <li> I am almost certain they sent a refurbished piece of junk!!!</li>
            <li> (the dryer was fine, it was the holder).  </li>
            <li> but it is fine for me.</li>
            <li> They are so easy and light to handle.</li>
            <li> It died.this one is strong or light, depending on what you need it for.  </li>
            <li> It is ideal for bathrooms with limited counter space.</li>
            <li> This is great for a smaller bathroom - like I have - and it mounted easily on the wall</li>
            <li> No hunting for the dryer, no unwrapping and untangling cords, it&#x27;s always right there, super handy.  </li>
            <li> Very nice simple design - easy to use.</li>
            <li> Nice little dryer‚Ä¶fits great on the wall and has a lot of power.</li>
            <li> This will cause the dryer to no longer securely attach to the wall unit.</li>
            <li> Night light has night sensor.  </li>
            <li> So handy and so much neater in appearance.</li>
            <li> My Wife loves it and that&#x27;s important.</li>
            <li> This dryer has a night light</li>
            <li> I like is night light since I&#x27;m a Bald Guy.</li>
            <li> Conjecture is that those who experienced short life with this appliance may not have cleaned the lint filter as often as required.</li>
            <li> It does a great job drying both my longer hair and my husband&#x27;s short hair.</li>
            <li> THis dryer is great - especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> I like the nite light that&#x27;s built into it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another feature is that it comes with a night light that does go off when the bathroom light goes on.</li>
            <li> Worked great but only lasted about 2 years.  </li>
            <li> night light is added bonus</li>
            <li> and my husband likes the night light feature.</li>
            <li> The night light is a bonus.</li>
            <li> the nite light on both dryers does not work.</li>
            <li> compact, light, and 1600 watt.  </li>
            <li> I also has a night light on it.</li>
            <li> Rating is based upon value, as I searched many different options and this was the most cost effective with a nightlight.  </li>
            <li> The night light is on a LED sensor so no turning on or off.</li>
            <li> I also like led night light</li>
            <li> The girls liked it so much</li>
            <li> The night light is also a gr8 feature for finding your way to the bathroom at night.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thought if hotels had these wall mounts, then they might be available out there.  </li>
            <li> I needed a light-weight dryer because of an arm injury and this one is indeed light.  </li>
            <li> Also, when plugging in, there was no power to the light unit.</li>
            <li> It lasted for 12 years Ilove the sturdy construction and the continuous LED light.</li>
            <li> and I also like the automatic night light.</li>
            <li> I had to search my garage for self tapping metal screws to match the hole size and finally after a good hour or so was able to attach the wall plate that holds the dryer.</li>
            <li> After a good bit of research &amp; reading reviews, I ordered this model to replace an old Oster model.</li>
            <li> so far so good; works as promised, and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> The extra feature of a night light is very nice for our home use.</li>
            <li> I love this hairdryer and the ease of having it on the wall right there to use</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it&#x27;s right by the sink</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for anyone for sure!</li>
            <li> It is very powerful for the size.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t very powerful</li>
            <li> I find it very handy for my daily hair drying.</li>
            <li> Easy to mount and easy to use; powerful without harming hair.</li>
            <li> While it may not be the most powerful or versatile hair dryer available, it is certainly the most convenient.  </li>
            <li> Powerful!</li>
            <li> My wife has one or two others that have specialty attachments  and are probably more powerful, but this is the one that she uses as the primary one, because it is always right there, nothing to pull out and plug in etc.</li>
            <li> It was easy to install, and the night light is a great feature for people who use the shower room after dark.</li>
            <li> I took it apart to clean it</li>
            <li> - I got a good 15 years worth of use out of the old one, so I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s right there for quick easy use and has a night light, as well.</li>
            <li> This dryer would be wonderful if it fit on the small wall I have to plug it into!  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and right at your fingertips Ilovesanta</li>
            <li> the fact I purchased the exact same model again tells you how happy I am with it.</li>
            <li> It also has a nice nightlight built in and that&#x27;s handy in a dark bathroom.</li>
            <li> Alot more attractive than a dryer sitting around on a counter or taking up needed space in the small cabinet under the sink.  </li>
            <li> I was happy to find the exact same item</li>
            <li> Try different brand and still thinking Conair did a good job on this one.</li>
            <li> Looks good and very quiet.</li>
            <li> &amp; I loved it enough to repurchase rather than getting another brand or style.</li>
            <li> Love it, very convenient.</li>
            <li> But good enough for what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Being able to have a blow dryer at hand, rather than stuffed in some drawer or cabinet, makes the morning routine so much easier.  </li>
            <li> Overall, a good value for the money.</li>
            <li> good product, good price fast delivery exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> For the price it was not bad</li>
            <li> Handy little blowdryer, better than leaving one plugged in on vanity!</li>
            <li> Super cheap, very quiet, with a nice night light, barely use any electricity, great heat, simple to use, VERY comfortable in hand.</li>
            <li> The price was acceptable and I was pleased to have my old non-working appliance replaced so easily.</li>
            <li> So convenient to have it right there on the wall, and the night light is a bonus.</li>
            <li> It is ideal for me and easy to use and out of the way, just right for a small space</li>
            <li> but I can tell you it was pretty easy to install.</li>
            <li> A great little hairdryer and sturdy mount with night light.</li>
            <li> Lots of power for straight hair and low is also great for curly hair.</li>
            <li> Lucky for us.</li>
            <li> I received it quickly.  </li>
            <li> Cools  off quickly with the side mount hanging.  </li>
            <li> The night light is a nice extra.</li>
            <li> I really liked how it dries and the general look.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really convenient and super easy to use.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer for myself a few months ago and liked it so much I bought two more for each of my two grand daughters.</li>
            <li> I love my new wall mounted hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> He looked all over for another one, and was really happy to find this one that would fit in his small bathroom.</li>
            <li> The first one lasted about 5 years - it&#x27;s actually good for a hair dryer that gets daily use.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s kind of cool, I just don&#x27;t totally get it.  </li>
            <li> Had one that finally wore out and loved it so much bought another one just like it!</li>
            <li> We are extremely please with the design and the white night light is a nice feature and not too bright as was mentioned in reviews of alternative models.</li>
            <li> Easy to install, not too loud, no complain!!!</li>
            <li> This is my second one, I love it!</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much!!</li>
            <li> When I first saw this model I was excited about the practicality of it&#x27;s wall mount design, and the sleek styling it offered.  </li>
            <li> Lots of hot air!</li>
            <li> works great,  no cord mess &amp; no place to find it ...</li>
            <li> This latest one I bought because I thought I would start fresh at my new condo.  </li>
            <li> It dries quickly and is handy to have mounted on the wall next to my bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great little dryer.  </li>
            <li> Great little dryer.</li>
            <li> I really like the night light too.  </li>
            <li> night light is very convenient and I have had no trouhle with it.</li>
            <li> It is compact but powerful.</li>
            <li> But - gotta say I&#x27;m really glad we kept the old unit.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to find the same design still available.  </li>
            <li> Powerful with 2 speeds and has a night lite.</li>
            <li> I liked the looks of it and that it turns off automatically when inserted back into the receptacle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful and compact.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s more powerful than my old hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Powerful, efficient and convenient.</li>
            <li> so far I&#x27;m 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li> I like this hair dryer, it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> Worth every penney.  </li>
            <li> I think it is pretty cool.</li>
            <li> This replacement is a clone in every respect and fits the bill, compact, lightweight and powerful.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s worth 5 stars.</li>
            <li> My wife liked it enough that she bought 2 of these when we got home from our ski trip.  </li>
            <li> Mounting is easy, very easy to use, but why we purchased this is that it is out and with a simple grab, its ready to go.</li>
            <li> I tell myself I am going to get a new one, but the price of the dryer is not bad and it&#x27;s more convenient to just buy another, vs. having to get another kind of dryer that has a different foot print and will potentially cause more damage to your wall.</li>
            <li> (Note that not keeping the lint filter clean will cause this issue as well, due to restricted airflow over the thermocouple).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indeed, a pretty darn good unit for the money.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> LED nightlight isn&#x27;t super bright, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me at night even with the bathroom door open into my bedroom, but is bright enough that you can see in the middle of the night once you get in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this dryer for its convenience and quick hair drying!</li>
            <li> That one went right in the plate that was already there.</li>
            <li> always right where it&#x27;s mounted</li>
            <li> works well, priced right, but the attachment bracket almost makes it is &amp;#34;permanent&amp;#34; attachment to your wall.  </li>
            <li> Immediately purchased this and hung it right up.</li>
            <li> Gives the luxury of a hotel right in my bathroom</li>
            <li> it is just right for drying my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The price is right as well.</li>
            <li> They really help to clean up the clutter.</li>
            <li> looks good on the wall and has enough cord to mount just about anywhere in a normal bathroom.</li>
            <li> Again, a very easy fix but a step that should have been anticipated and handled prior to the product leaving product development.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This item is great if you have a small bathroom like I do.  </li>
            <li> but I just use my own brush to control my hair as I blow dry.</li>
            <li> The previous lasted 4 years and the mounting plate is still good so all you need is switch the units.</li>
            <li> We mounted a 2nd unit on the same wall bracket in about 5 seconds and are again happy campers.</li>
            <li> I love having my hair dryer ready for action whenever I need it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it is powerful enough to handle most every requirement.</li>
            <li> Also has an LED night light which provides just enough light to see in the bathroom at night.</li>
            <li> Currently on the 3rd hair dryer in 10 years so happy with product and cost is very reasonable.   </li>
            <li> The original unit worked fine until the internal fan that pulls air through the unit shattered.  </li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s great to have it up on the wall and out of the way, the small size makes it better suited to short hair.  </li>
            <li> Fit right where the old dyers was mounted.</li>
            <li> The first one is about 10 years old and running strong.</li>
            <li> I like this hair dryer very much.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s working fine.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it is a good little appliance.</li>
            <li> Good little dryer.  </li>
            <li> The dual dryer settings are useful and the high setting is quite powerful- plenty for ay hair type in my opinoin.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> so if I ever get married again she will have one to use.</li>
            <li> ONE, MY FIRST ONE BROKE WHERE THE HAIR DRYER HOOKS INTO THE MOUNT, I WOULD MAKE THAT AREA STRONGER.</li>
            <li> Worked great for at least 15 years.</li>
            <li> I owned this exact product for about 5 years before it \\&quot;died\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased with its performance, so I purchased the same dryer again.  </li>
            <li> It has helped with the clutter in the kids bathroom soooo much!</li>
            <li> Take it off, turn it all and you are receiving a blast of hot air.  </li>
            <li> a feature I am very fond of!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m presently seeking a better made model, after all,</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re going to mount something on your wall, you want it to last more than a year, no?</li>
            <li> I had the first one for about 3 or 4 years</li>
            <li> Love it and use it daily.  </li>
            <li> works perfect for us, not too big and not too small, wife luvs the ease of it on the wall</li>
            <li> I plan to buy more of this product for gifts in the future.</li>
            <li> I have a hair dryer with higher wattage than this one.  </li>
            <li> It was a gift and exactly what she asked for.  </li>
            <li> The nightlight is just a dim light</li>
            <li> Works well, doesn&#x27;t make the bathroom hot.</li>
            <li> My first Conair lasted for 12 years.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s exactly what she has been asking for.</li>
            <li> The first lasted about 10 years.</li>
            <li> But it will work perfect for the times I have guests and give them that cheesy hotel feeling.</li>
            <li> Many of the wall mounted units have to be placed back into the wall mounting to turn off.  </li>
            <li> the night light died early in its lifetime but it still dries hair...</li>
            <li> Very convenient and efficient!</li>
            <li> We were always leaving the hair dryer on the counter as it was hot</li>
            <li> Installation was straight forward, unit is compact, and powerful.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with this manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> The blower is powerful and my hair dries fast.</li>
            <li> It is a noisy unit and can get quite warm, but performs as I expected.</li>
            <li> I tried supplied sticky tape first and it fell off the wall within 3 days</li>
            <li> The first one still worked, but wore out the clip to hold it in over years of use.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this hairdryer - it is smaller, quieter, hangs on the wall</li>
            <li> So convenient to have it right there ready to go in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Works great though the night light is kinda useless.</li>
            <li> Pretty clunky-looking and too large for my dinky bathroom.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast and item was exactly what we were looking for.  </li>
            <li> easy to mount with double faced tape.</li>
            <li> My grand daughter comes here when she is in a hurry to dry her hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Installation is easy and can be done by anyone with even extremely basic skills in no</li>
            <li> Good for short to medium hair, but not for long hair.  </li>
            <li> So I went with the tape, and I&#x27;m pleased to say it went up without a single hitch and is holding the unit up with no problem whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> I would have given it a 5 star rating but I am replacing it with like kind, and my former one burned out prematurely; so I&#x27;m not expecting this one to last any longer than the first one.  </li>
            <li> The metal plate has knock outs for direct wire as well, if your outlet or electrical box happens to be in the exact right position.  </li>
            <li> The rear filter screen on the new unit fell right off out of the box.</li>
            <li> and I just plain LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I had a huge oldschool Conair for ages, literally decades, before it finally gave out, so I knew I&#x27;d be going with a Conair again.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> But that is really all I need.</li>
            <li> For some reason when it is plugged in it has a low buzz, as if the night light is doing something.  </li>
            <li> The fan became very sluggish and the coils would overheat, then it would spark and the thermostat would reset.  </li>
            <li> never have to turn on the bathroom light in the middle of the night..</li>
            <li> and you are ready to go.  </li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m getting ready to buy # 9</li>
            <li> Always plugged in and ready to use.</li>
            <li> Very efficient.</li>
            <li> Very well made.  </li>
            <li> It is very convenient and has a nightlight.</li>
            <li> They are convenient and very reliable.  </li>
            <li> Night light is just enough to see but not keep you awake.</li>
            <li> This Conair Wallmount Dryer with LED night light was my second purchase.  </li>
            <li> We have had this dryer in all of the hotels we&#x27;ve stayed at in Mexico, and it really is the way to have a dryer at your fingertips without taking up counter space.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast as always.  </li>
            <li> It is there on the wall ready for use.</li>
            <li> Just enough light.</li>
            <li> so much quiter maby just appeares to be that way.  </li>
            <li> One is in the guest room and doesn&#x27;t get much use.  </li>
            <li> And for a condo that is also a vacation rental, this works very well.</li>
            <li> I would have preferred a 3 speed model, but they are very scarce.</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer, but the handle area turned pink within about 2 weeks of using it.</li>
            <li> suggest discarding the plastic anchors provided and using the self tapping plastic anchors available at your local store (or here on Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I guess adding a dollar to the price might be too much to ask.</li>
            <li> I am very please with the operation of the unit.  </li>
            <li> The light is now a LED version, which saves power but but puts out much less light than the older model-</li>
            <li> I really like this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Very neat.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> built better than I had expected and well thought out.</li>
            <li> I really like the dryer but the install for drywall without studs inserts</li>
            <li> She finds it very convenient.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is really convenient to have the dryer hanging oon the wall, out of the way until you are ready to use it.</li>
            <li> All of them lasted very well.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Reasonable wall-mount dryer for the price.</li>
            <li> i especially like the night light.</li>
            <li> and then you&#x27;ll have something that throws out enough light to  work as a nightlight.</li>
            <li> been using the same kind for several years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it about a month, but so far I am pleased with it&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li> It would be helpful to know this since a super lengthy cord could be challenging in a small bathroom.......</li>
            <li> Even when it was new it didn&#x27;t blow a lot of air, though it did get fairly hot.  </li>
            <li> Have had other Conairs for many years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably get two more for the other guest baths.</li>
            <li> Very slick hair dryer with good power.</li>
            <li> Night light wouldn&#x27;t light up a small box.</li>
            <li> Great blow dryer, but does not hold tight in the holder, but rather loosely.  </li>
            <li> The older ones got clogged in the filter area and had to be cleaned (one just stopped working - and smelled like over heating) -- the next one I learned to clean.  </li>
            <li> After the metal plate is removed from the back of the front, it is easy to loosen the cord anchors allowing one to adjust the length of the power cord depending on how far way the outlet is.  </li>
            <li> It dries my hair pretty quickly and I have long hair.</li>
            <li> has a small light that turns on while your bathroom light is off, i would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is an exact replacement for our old one.</li>
            <li> But the screen on the old unit was an exact match.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fixed on the wall and always ready to be used!</li>
            <li> Excellant hot air to dry hair quickly .</li>
            <li> Blowing into the back got old pretty quick, and in the hope</li>
            <li> Has a little more heat which she wants.</li>
            <li> I have it in a rental condo and it has been working ok for about a year and a half.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned two older models and then just bought the newest model.  </li>
            <li> Product was what I wanted, ordering was simple and delivery happened quickly.  </li>
            <li> Very convenient to use and powerful enough for even the longest hair.  </li>
            <li> This took several trips as I wanted to make sure they weren&#x27;t too big</li>
            <li> If this had been for an older woman without a knowledge of drilling out metal, this would have been a return.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer--this is my second purchase of this model, the last one was 8 years ago.  </li>
            <li> but I can honestly say I am very pleased with the performance of the product for the price and would not let a few poor reviews stop me from buying this product .My</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this highly.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Love this little guy.  </li>
            <li> but I wish they put a little more R&amp;D into the durability.</li>
            <li> What can I say, a minute saved is a minute earned, and I reclaimed much needed drawer space by replacing my old, bulky, heavyweight dryer with this wall mounted one.  </li>
            <li> Small, light yet powerful.</li>
            <li> I can tell by closer examination that it would only get more stretched.</li>
            <li> NO complaint.</li>
            <li> It does go off when normal room lighting is on.  </li>
            <li> I have it mounted on the right wall above the outlet, about 18&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Second one mounted right on  the originals mounting plate in seconds.</li>
            <li> On this one I had to cut the cord and re splice it, due to it being hooked to the Light</li>
            <li> My wife loves her new Conair wall mount hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I bought a new one to replace it.</li>
            <li> This new one is for a new home.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item new in the box</li>
            <li> Mounted in new poop deck bathroom</li>
            <li> Bought a new home</li>
            <li> I bought them to put up in my new beach house.</li>
            <li> Not only are they handy, you don&#x27;t have to waste space in your drawer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine, but the air is not nearly as hot as my old 1600 watt unit by another maker...</li>
            <li> I have very straight, short hair.  </li>
            <li> For our small bathroom, it is very convient and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to mount, provides  plenty of heat, and the cord length is long enough so you don&#x27;t have to stretch to use it.</li>
            <li> The nightlight is also nice - although we don&#x27;t normally dry our hair in the dark.</li>
            <li> Bought two of them for our bathrooms, easy to install, fits flat with your flat wall or on tile, drill screws into grout part of your tile if your going to install in tile otherwise your tile may break.  </li>
            <li> It fits reasonably tight to the wall and the dryer snaps in and out of the holder easily.</li>
            <li> Plan to buy a couple more for our other bathrooms as  well as a back up to keep on hand.</li>
            <li> The first one died (I contributed by not cleaning it enough).  </li>
            <li> The first one lasted five years and the second lasted 4 1/2 years.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to get this hairdryer as we have no space in our tiny bathroom to store a bigger hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> One dryer glowed red hot after 8 months.</li>
            <li> My first one lasted about 9 months and then began to continually overheat and shut off several times during my styling process.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly the same one as in the hotel.  </li>
            <li> Our first Conair lasted 7 years of daily rigorous use.</li>
            <li> It actually looks pretty cute on my wall in my small bathroom.</li>
            <li> No more cords and more space in vanityüòÄ</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace the exact same one I had purchased 15 years ago.</li>
            <li> The first one finally stopped working after 8 years.</li>
            <li> New unit was exactly the same as the old.</li>
            <li> To those of you that had the units burn up, may I suggest that once a week you clean the dust and other fuzzy stuff from the air intake portion of the dryer......</li>
            <li> A 1600 watt hair dryer can&#x27;t give my hair the lift I&#x27;m used to, and it takes a few minutes longer to style because the air motion isn&#x27;t as strong nor hot enough.</li>
            <li> (it might dry 10 or more people&#x27;s hair in a single day where we have it).</li>
            <li> The 2 little tabs that snap the screen onto the main housing were like melted smooth and could not be fixed.</li>
            <li> My only objection was that the plastic clips which hold the dryer in place broke easily, and the part of the cord that attaches to the dryer came loose.  </li>
            <li> After 12 years, my old (exactly the same) dryer died - it didn&#x27;t owe me a thing.  </li>
            <li> Screw the screws through the holes (if you were lucky enough to get one with holes) to make pilot holes in the wall where you will want to install the plastic self taping anchors.&lt;br /&gt;Screw the self tapping anchors into the drywall (do not over tighten) then put the metal plate back up and align the hole patterns.  </li>
            <li> It fit in our motor home space and held tightly without shifting during travel.</li>
            <li> I tossed my Remington and LOVE this little, convenient giant of a hair-dryer!  </li>
            <li> I wanted to have something that helped keep counters clear.  </li>
            <li> I like this hair dryer because it was stronger than my old wallmount dryer.  </li>
            <li> Reason replace old dryer was that plastic holders broke and had to lay dryer on counter.</li>
            <li> I hope it lasts as long as the first one</li>
            <li> The old one lasted 10 years and</li>
            <li> We have to replace it every year or two, but I imagine in residential use it would last much longer</li>
            <li> It stretched and re-coiled about 50% on the first try.</li>
            <li> Convenient and classy wall mount hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Conair Wallmount Dryer because we absolutely wore out our last one</li>
            <li> I could 50 year old women.</li>
            <li> Had to leave 1 and 2 at my old house.  </li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t think it would work as well as the ones in the hotel as I figured there&#x27;s was a commercial grade.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised it worked just as well.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t want to screw into the wall above the outlet because I have no idea how the apartment bathroom is wired.  </li>
            <li> So I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as relying on it for a nightlight.  </li>
            <li> I was so panicked when my old one gave out that I shelled out for next-day,</li>
            <li> My 3 ladies of the house have used it and like it so far.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully this one will not suffer from early death syndrome.</li>
            <li> and I have one in each bathroom - very convenient since it does not take up extra space</li>
            <li> so I just pulled the old one off the wall, adjusted the cord length and snapped the now one in.</li>
            <li> I would expect it to last longer than that-maybe I am expecting too much</li>
            <li> The green night light is also helpful to find my way into the bathroom when the sun has not  yet risen.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace old one but model feels cheaper.  </li>
            <li> My old Conair burntout beacause I never cleaned it.</li>
            <li> makes the age old problem of hair dryer storage and cord tangle fade away.</li>
            <li> this one must have cheaper parts it completely broke in 5 months</li>
            <li> Two settings High is hot and blows hard and low is significantly cooler and blows rather soft.  </li>
            <li> so it is not really suitable as a night light for the bathroom as the older model was (otherwise I would have given 5 stars).  </li>
            <li> The nightlight seems like a total afterthought, it certainly doesn&#x27;t put enough light out to help you find stuff in the dark bathroom or not stub your toe.  </li>
            <li> Small, easy to mount.  </li>
            <li> The last one held up for several years and am hoping the same will be true with this one.</li>
            <li> The old one just stopped working on the high setting, but still works on low.</li>
            <li> Also on the old ones, I could just take it from the wll mount bracket and use it like a regular Blower, or just put a new one in an old prewall mounted bracket.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for the exact same model that lasted several years.  </li>
            <li> From personal experience I know it&#x27;s easy to put this little chore off.</li>
            <li> same as old one that was at least 14 years old, got the same model and it works even better, did not have to even install the newer wall mount was also the exact same.</li>
            <li> Provides very, very little light.  </li>
            <li> Then pulled out the included screws and to my surprise found out that the holes were way too small for the screws to fit through.</li>
            <li> And ... that unit still runs but the thermocouple switch that shuts the unit off when it overheats has &amp;#34;worn&amp;#34; over the years and has begun to engage a little too quickly.</li>
            <li> The new one that I ordered don&#x27;t really seem to have quite as much air movement as they did in the past,</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace one just like it , I have used it everyday for at least 5years, I love the way it is out of the way , and right at your finger tips.</li>
            <li> when you put the hair dryer back in the wall mount, there&#x27;s a little plastic piece that holds it in securely and that piece was damaged.  </li>
            <li> Was easy to install (instructions made installation seem more complicated that it was) and works well (no louder than your average dryer).  </li>
            <li> Small but very powerful.</li>
            <li> I find myself again in need of a new wall mounted hair dryer, dreading removing this one and remounting the next.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Hopefully this new one will come soon and last longer.</li>
            <li> My first Conair served and lasted me a long time, therefore, there was no question that I needed and wanted to have it replaced with one of the same.</li>
            <li> Also this only have high and low settings while old dryer had 3 settings.  </li>
            <li> My only concern is that this my second one and with the first I found that unless the item is placed very carefully back in the hanger that the clips can/do break off.  </li>
            <li> This seems as hot as my other dryer.  </li>
            <li> We have a very small bathroom (You know the kind where you have to go to the next room to change the toilet tissue.).</li>
            <li> Also, no spare parts are available for this model; therefore, I was not able to fix the former one.</li>
            <li> We had these in our old home and left them so as not to disturb the wallpaper.  </li>
            <li> This replaced a 20 year old unit of the same design</li>
            <li> I also purchased one for the male&#x27;s bathroom in the house and will put in the master bathroom once I am complete with the remodel</li>
            <li> I hope it is fixed in the future.</li>
            <li> Only had this item for about a week, but so far it seems to work well.  </li>
            <li> The clip on our old one finally broke after years of usage.  </li>
            <li> the directions for mounting are like many, you have to translate a poor picture.</li>
            <li> Not good way to deal with dangling cord ... can&#x27;t easily wrap around holder and no hook or anything to store it.</li>
            <li> It is powerful enough for my family, but if you have thick or long hair with a lot of girls in your family this hair dryer might not be powerful enough for you.</li>
            <li> My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t find what is essentially the same hair dryer - also available from Amazon - without the wasted (and unneeded) plastic frame (housing... frame?)  </li>
            <li> The high setting burned out, and the low setting is not hot enough nor fast enough for me.  </li>
            <li> the elements started glowing bright red and smelled like it was going to burst into flames...very irritating as I had owned one previously that lasted for years....</li>
            <li> i just need to add a telephone and an emergency pull cord near the toilet.</li>
            <li> When it cools down, it goes back to hot.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying another - since it will slide right into the space vacated by the old one I won&#x27;t have any wallpaper issues to contend with and, for $20, its hard to beat the value.</li>
            <li> My housekeeper accidently broke the little latch on the first one</li>
            <li> It is a little more expensive but well worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lasted me through a total of 4 years with really long hair and 4 years of short hair, daily use, and no problems until the very end (the &amp;#34;High&amp;#34; setting gave out suddenly).</li>
            <li> only complaint is my original was in chrome</li>
            <li> Lets hope it lasts as long as my old one.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have really thick or long hair--it will probably work just fine.</li>
            <li> Dries hair just Lila hair dryers should dry it a wow product</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not bright enough to be your only night light in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> Previously had an OSTER, but the last two I have had didn&#x27;t last very long.&lt;br /&gt;Trying</li>
            <li> These little hairdryers work very well for their size.</li>
            <li> The mount on the wall is reasonable in size and the dryer works very well on my wife&#x27;s very thick hair.  </li>
            <li> two speeds, switches up for high, down for low.  </li>
            <li> The night light is not very bright, but of course, I never tested it with my eyes adjusted to the dark.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other wall mounts and hand-held and haven&#x27;t found one that worked nearly as well and was so convenient.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for someone who doesn&#x27;t want to hold a heavy drier.</li>
            <li> It did not last long at all</li>
            <li> so I cant tell you how long it will last</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last long so I contacted Conair and they sent another one</li>
            <li> does not have the power to dry my hear in a short length of time.  </li>
            <li> I selected this modeal as I had a previous model of this same hair dryer that finally failed after a few years of good service.  </li>
            <li> We had it about a year which is as long as the warranty is good for.  :(</li>
            <li> Once I unpacked the dryer and hung it on the wall plate, I noticed the dust cover on the back of the dryer looked loose.</li>
            <li> The main problem I have had on EVERY one is that the small plastic side pieces that hold the dryer into the wall mount will eventually crack and break off.</li>
            <li> This helped for a little bit but it completely burned out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was pleased to find this at a price that was approximately 50% less than other retailers and</li>
            <li> You can adjust the length of the cord on both the &amp;#34;plug side&amp;#34; and the &amp;#34;handheld side&amp;#34; before you hang it up and installation was very easy--I&#x27;m not handy at all and had no problems.</li>
            <li> In addition to its convenience, she says it dries faster than her old heavy dryer.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s roughly $6/year which allows me to justify replacing the unit with the same model.   </li>
            <li> With longer hair you have to be careful to hold the dryer farther away from your head so that hair doesn&#x27;t get sucked into the back of it.  </li>
            <li> Lasted a long time.  </li>
            <li> If you have long hair like me</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> We will see how long this one lasts.</li>
            <li> I had one on my wall before for a long time, until it just wouldn&#x27;t hang in the socket anymore, so I had to have another one.  </li>
            <li> The only problem we had was that the wall mount was a bit larger than the ones we&#x27;ve used, so a bit less compact.</li>
            <li> The wall mount dryer was just what I needed for my new small bathroom as I do not have any counter space.  </li>
            <li> This was mentioned by other reviewers as well, so it is definitely a design flaw.</li>
            <li> Wish I had purchased something like it a long time ago!</li>
            <li> Bought this 2nd one for the other bathroom.</li>
            <li> But as one of the other reviewers noted, the plastic piece that holds the dryer to the mounting station breaks before the actual dryer dies.  </li>
            <li> The other we use daily.  </li>
            <li> And since it&#x27;s out all the time it reminds my girls to dry their hair.  </li>
            <li> I can dry my hair faster with this dryer.</li>
            <li> otherwise I let my hair dry by itself.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We use this to dry off baby butt when doing a diaper change.</li>
            <li> A bit loud and dryer opening is small.</li>
            <li> Our club shower room was bare bones, so I decided to splurge and add a few things including this dryer.  </li>
            <li> the &amp;#34;ears&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;fingers&amp;#34; that hold the dryer became worn, or loose, so the hairdryer would fall out.</li>
            <li> but my short hair is dry in less than a minute.</li>
            <li> The only negative reviews I read about this (and all other dryers) is that some die too early.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and it didn&#x27;t blow hard enough nor hot enough to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> and Amazon gave me my money back less shipping</li>
            <li> My previous wall mount lasted ten years.</li>
            <li> Died after only a dozen or less uses.  </li>
            <li> the previous brand I had was much smaller.</li>
            <li> last one lasted less than 2 years.</li>
            <li> It has a hi and low but no cool button for when you need just air.</li>
            <li> If you have had this product only a few months and you start experiencing the unit shutting off before your hair is dry - this is the thing to check.</li>
            <li> after less than a year of minimal use, the hairdryer quit working properly....</li>
            <li> The 2nd had a little piece of plastic that broke off in the holder -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the little amenities that make a big difference.</li>
            <li> Cord running from wall to unit little too short.</li>
            <li> Was a little big for the space it needed to put it in.</li>
            <li> Dries my long hair in MINUTES!!!</li>
            <li> My complaint would be that the dryer is really loud.</li>
            <li> I am not a real glam girl</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s delivery was 1-2 days quicker than I expected.</li>
            <li> It works well, but needs to be replaced every few years after daily use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owed my present unit for not quite a year now, and a few days ago I went to turn it on, and it just wouldn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Dries faster than I expected.</li>
            <li> The last hairdryer ran for over 2 years, with two people using it everyday.  </li>
            <li> Only gave it a 4 because I have to replace it every few years or so.</li>
            <li> It is also very lightweight so my arm doesn&#x27;t get tired when I&#x27;m drying my hair.</li>
            <li> We have purchased three of these for different bathrooms, had them for quite awhile now and never had an issue with them failing after a few months.</li>
            <li> Works as expected, but the Scotch sticky mounts don&#x27;t hold up against steam...</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have the space to leave a dryer on a counter, and I&#x27;m certainly not going to take one out each morning and put it away after use.  </li>
            <li> While not as powerful as the older dryer, the time saved just taking it off the wall base and turn it on makes up for it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lower wattage, but it took less time to dry my hair because it did not overheat.  </li>
            <li> No more having to keep in a drawer, taking it out, putting it back, every time I want to use it.  </li>
            <li> They work fibe, but they&#x27;re extremely noisy.</li>
            <li> The dryer is small but packs enough punch for my wife.  </li>
            <li> As the other reviewers all said, it does work well</li>
            <li> A small plastic piece cracked during installation, which caused us to have to install a different way.  </li>
            <li> First one, the dryer  failed after a year to lock to unit.</li>
            <li> I may get another one for the other bathroom.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is small enough so it does not get in the way of my medicine cabinet or vanity drawers with the hanging cord.</li>
            <li> You will always find some problems with production due to worker error or flaws in the product</li>
            <li> this may be due to our power structure</li>
            <li> the other one broke</li>
            <li> There are no bells and whistles with this dryer, other than the feeble little nightlight - it&#x27;s got three settings - OFF, LOW, and HIGH.  </li>
            <li> Only problem with this hair dryer is there are two tabs on the housing to turn it off automatically if you place it back while running that have broken off of both hair dryers.</li>
            <li> Availability of wallmount dryers is limited to a few models.</li>
            <li> Not to despair, I just balled up a small amount of double stick clear tape &amp; put it behind the parts.</li>
            <li> To add to all the existing problems the grip that hold the hair dryer handle was so loos that it hardly held the hair dryer in place when it is sitting back in the cradle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The little LED nightlight feature is pretty much useless as a night lite.</li>
            <li> Recently purchased this again to replace a unit in our bathroom that has been there at least 6 years.</li>
            <li> This is not worth it.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement, I had the same one since at least 2005.</li>
            <li> and the nightlight works in the dark.</li>
            <li> I think I am drying my hair in HALF the time I previously took.  </li>
            <li> I was unable to find a comparable product at the local big box stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Had one previously that wore out to the extent that the clamps holding the blower in place on the wall bracket were no longer doing the job.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased about a half dozen of these.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the Conair 1600 Watt wall-mounted hair dryer and put it up in 5 minutes; arranged the cord so it was out of the way and mostly hidden under the mirror of my medicine cabinet; plugged it in and turned it on.</li>
            <li> however, the cord is REALLY long and hard to manage.  </li>
            <li> As my husband said it would have died if I used it 1 time (long thick curly hair).</li>
            <li> It must be a little less, because it never overheats, but you wouldn&#x27;t notice it.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully it will last a while, but if not, its not an expensive accessory, so we&#x27;ll have to see how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> I have used these little wall-hung hair dryers while on vacation and wondered if I would like one at home.  </li>
            <li> Works well, could have a little longer cord.</li>
            <li> a lot of plastic just to hold a little handheld dryer</li>
            <li> I think this is a gret little dryer</li>
            <li> although not really sure due to it is</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why they give you little pin holes.</li>
            <li> and it fit on the previous model&#x27;s base plate,</li>
            <li> And the back plate was a little tough to get off.</li>
            <li> The cavity behind the wallmount is spacious and allows me the hide the extra power cord that I do not need.  </li>
            <li> Used once daily by my husband for approximately 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> The fan would speed up within a few minutes to where it could keep the coils from overheating, but eventually this took even longer.  </li>
            <li> I disabled mine after a couple of nights of trying to ignore the green glow emanating from the bathroom.</li>
            <li> After a few years they cracked and fell off.  </li>
            <li> My poor wall, this will be the third dryer.  </li>
            <li> Drier does not sit firmly in holder; I worry that it will fall out (it hasn&#x27;t yet).</li>
            <li> After inspecting the problem, I found that one of the prongs that hold it to the dryer was missing.</li>
            <li> The clips have broken on several but not all of mine.  </li>
            <li> Never falls off, always there when you need your hair fluffy.</li>
            <li> The mounting directions were a little confusing, though.  </li>
            <li> Our small bathroom has no place on the vanity or drawer for it.</li>
            <li> 1 week past the return period.</li>
            <li> This dryer is small and fits out of the way on the wall.  </li>
            <li> We have a small bathroom</li>
            <li> No more fighting or pulling it out of a draw each time.</li>
            <li> Small but packs a punch.</li>
            <li> Conair&#x27;s metal wall mount holes in the plate were too small for the screws given.</li>
            <li> so the small screw head would just go through the hole.</li>
            <li> I should have stopped ordering replacements, lazy on our part</li>
            <li> wall-mounted hair dryer is a space-saver in the small bathroom.</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;m not thrilled with is the night-light built into the base is extremely dim.  </li>
            <li> But turned my ordinary bathroom into a four star hotel bathroom.</li>
            <li> The one that did have holes the holes were too small and the provided screws would not go through</li>
            <li> /&gt;Night light is worthless and was not a good addition to the product.  </li>
            <li> the dryer is small, compact and stores insight but out of the way.  </li>
            <li> Works well, base is a little large compared to others I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> well didn&#x27;t use not very good quality purchased some to use instead</li>
            <li> The Conair dryer came with the wrong set of screws to wall mount, and the instructions were not clear either.</li>
            <li> Hopefully this lasts at least 4 years again.</li>
            <li> The 1st lasted at least 8 years.</li>
            <li> They do burn out eventually, but the price allows a replacement, so we just leave the base mount on the wall up, and snap a new unit in place.</li>
            <li> It takes forever to dry my hair as cold air does nothing.  </li>
            <li> #2 lasted about 4 years, so not too bad for daily use</li>
            <li> The only thing is the small plastic parts that hold the hand unit in the base.</li>
            <li> There are a couple of weak areas that I wish they would improve.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also had one that just eventually got too weak</li>
            <li> I am not totally happy with the switch for turning on an off, it could be improved.</li>
            <li> I had to drill out the mounting holes a little on the base</li>
            <li> Its not impressive in any way, but</li>
            <li> Installation was difficult.  </li>
            <li> THIS IS SILLY MAKING ME TYPE</li>
            <li> Very frustrating and oh, so avoidable by the company.</li>
            <li> It keeps overheating and switching to cold air.  </li>
            <li> so It would not just come out of the wall mount bracket  without cutting the cord.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We have bought at least 6 of these....and they all inexplicably die within a matter of one year!!  </li>
            <li> Wrong!  </li>
            <li> Disappointed in the functions .  </li>
            <li> Drove me crazy!  </li>
            <li> I purchased another one and the plastic tabs that hold the dryer on the base broke.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s tuts tote wall and shuts off when returned to base.</li>
            <li> The plastic front snaps onto a metal base that is attached to the wall.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m worthless with a drill</li>
            <li> Just so disgusted.</li>
            <li> Customer service was horrible!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent unit well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Space saver. Works great</li>
            <li> It is convenient and one doesn&#x27;t have to bend a stretch to locate it.  It hangs on the wall and the night light is great!</li>
            <li> My wife loves her new Conair wall mount hair dryer.  In addition to its convenience, she says it dries faster than her old heavy dryer.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for home as well as hotel! I have one in each of my 3 bathrooms!!</li>
            <li> I like this hair dryer because it was stronger than my old wallmount dryer.  This dryer is physically larger than old dryer and require moving installation because it would not fit into the old mounting area.  Also this only have high and low settings while old dryer had 3 settings.  Happy with it since it is now on wall. Reason replace old dryer was that plastic holders broke and had to lay dryer on counter.</li>
            <li> Love this dryer.have been using the same kind for several years. Lots of power for straight hair and low is also great for curly hair.</li>
            <li> I read reviews on this that said the night light was too bright.  I don&#x27;t agree at all; besides, I would not recommend ever leaving a blow-dryer plugged in all the time.  It&#x27;s a great little dryer.  No more having to keep in a drawer, taking it out, putting it back, every time I want to use it.  It was a snap to put together and get on the wall.</li>
            <li> I used this one at the company showers after my workout so I had to buy.  Dries my long hair in MINUTES!!! LOVE IT!! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have used these little wall-hung hair dryers while on vacation and wondered if I would like one at home.  I DO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I tossed my Remington and LOVE this little, convenient giant of a hair-dryer!  I think I am drying my hair in HALF the time I previously took.  WHY didn&#x27;t I buy this sooner???  :)</li>
            <li> This is an exact replacement for our old one. Makes it easy to replace. Our small bathroom has no place on the vanity or drawer for it. Wallmount makes it handy. Clip that holds handle broke, but dryer still worked.</li>
            <li> I have owned three of these wall-mounted hair dryers because they perform well and look good. The main problem I have had on EVERY one is that the small plastic side pieces that hold the dryer into the wall mount will eventually crack and break off. This will cause the dryer to no longer securely attach to the wall unit. This was mentioned by other reviewers as well, so it is definitely a design flaw. Otherwise, it is a good little appliance.</li>
            <li> This is a great Hair Dryer. I have had two of them Plenty of heat and power.  Night light has night sensor.  Only problem with this hair dryer is there are two tabs on the housing to turn it off automatically if you place it back while running that have broken off of both hair dryers. P&gt;S&gt; I always turned it off but those tabs still broke with regular use. The hair dryer will still mount but has a habit of falling easily if disturbed.</li>
            <li> This is the third house we have put these into our master baths.  I even have one installed in our RV!  So handy and so much neater in appearance.</li>
            <li> Great little dryer. Small, light yet powerful. Easy to mount. What more can be said  about a good product. Plan to buy a couple more for our other bathrooms as  well as a back up to keep on hand. My Wife loves it and that&#x27;s important.</li>
            <li> Need to be very specific on hanging cord or inside wiring.</li>
            <li> We had these in our old home and left them so as not to disturb the wallpaper.  We were so happy to find them again and they discounted $10 for buying two. That&#x27;s so great. It is awesome not to have to look for your hairdryer and put it away each time!</li>
            <li> Easliy installed and works well.....</li>
            <li> We started using this model 10 years ago - it&#x27;s so much better than putting it in a drawer or leaving it on the counter all the time.  This dryer has a night light but it&#x27;s not bright enough to be your only night light in the bathroom.  We&#x27;re on our 3rd Conair wall mount dryer (all the same model).  The first one lasted about 5 years - it&#x27;s actually good for a hair dryer that gets daily use.  The first one died (I contributed by not cleaning it enough).  The 2nd had a little piece of plastic that broke off in the holder - when you put the hair dryer back in the wall mount, there&#x27;s a little plastic piece that holds it in securely and that piece was damaged.  #2 lasted about 4 years, so not too bad for daily use (the dryer was fine, it was the holder).  Hopefully this lasts at least 4 years again.</li>
            <li> Dryer came on time as advertised and works great. Thanks.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I have 2 in my house and they work well.  I did have one that only lasted about 5years before the heat coil burned. I bought a new one to replace it.</li>
            <li> I love that my hair dryer is no longer cluttering up my sink area.  The cavity behind the wallmount is spacious and allows me the hide the extra power cord that I do not need.  I really like the night light too.  The 1600 watts may be a ittle underpowered for some but it is fine for me.</li>
            <li> Works well, could have a little longer cord. the directions for mounting are like many, you have to translate a poor picture.</li>
            <li> So convenient on the wall!!! This is my second one, I love it!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve owned three of this model hair dryer now.  The first one lasted five years and the second lasted 4 1/2 years.  That&#x27;s roughly $6/year which allows me to justify replacing the unit with the same model.   That and the fact that the mount is already on the wall.  Of course, we still have our backup hair dryer which is a Gillette Pro-Max that I received 30+ years ago when I was sixteen.   That one is still going strong.</li>
            <li> Just like the ones in hotel.</li>
            <li> We liked the convenience so well that we bought one for the guest bathroom too.</li>
            <li> These are great.  I have them in all my bed and breakfast rooms.  They are enjoyed by all and used a lot.  The night light is very handy also!</li>
            <li> the  dryer was a replacement one for one I purchased 10 yrs ago. I hope it lasts as long as the first one</li>
            <li> My favorite hairdryer.&lt;br /&gt;It is compact and out of the way!</li>
            <li> I love it. Always liked them when we stayed in hotels. Now I have my own.</li>
            <li> The night light is just right without being too bright.  My only concern is that this my second one and with the first I found that unless the item is placed very carefully back in the hanger that the clips can/do break off.  The last one held up for several years and am hoping the same will be true with this one.</li>
            <li> Powerful &amp; good looking wallmount hair dryer. Try different brand and still thinking Conair did a good job on this one. Easy to install, not too loud, no complain!!!</li>
            <li> Purchased to replace same dryer we have had in out bathroom for the last 10 years. That should say everything.  The old one lasted 10 years and the fact I purchased the exact same model again tells you how happy I am with it.</li>
            <li> very nice and functional hair dryer.  Easy to mount and easy to use; powerful without harming hair.</li>
            <li> We use it in a commercial facility.  Its not impressive in any way, but it does what its supposed to.  We have to replace it every year or two, but I imagine in residential use it would last much longer (it might dry 10 or more people&#x27;s hair in a single day where we have it).</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she loved it so much.&lt;br /&gt;what I like is night light since I&#x27;m a Bald Guy. LOL</li>
            <li> I love my new wall mounted hair dryer.  It&#x27;s like being in a hotel room. I would recommend this item to anyone.</li>
            <li> This replaced a 20 year old unit of the same design</li>
            <li> Works well.  Be nice if it had one more (faster) speed but this is a good quality hair dryer.</li>
            <li> We were very satisfied with this hair dryer. We put one in our home in Va and two of them we took to Fl and put them in both of our bathrooms there.  I use them often and when guests come they are so handy because they are right there on the wall . We are replacing the one in Va that was put in 6 years ago . That one went right in the plate that was already there.</li>
            <li> Recently purchased this again to replace a unit in our bathroom that has been there at least 6 years. And ... that unit still runs but the thermocouple switch that shuts the unit off when it overheats has &amp;#34;worn&amp;#34; over the years and has begun to engage a little too quickly. (Note that not keeping the lint filter clean will cause this issue as well, due to restricted airflow over the thermocouple).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indeed, a pretty darn good unit for the money. After a couple of years of use (literally, used hundreds of times in that period) the &amp;#34;ears&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;fingers&amp;#34; that hold the dryer became worn, or loose, so the hairdryer would fall out. This was solved by placing a strip of Velcro on the inside of each &amp;#34;ear&amp;#34;.  Would have given product 5 stars if this had not occurred. Found that this easy &amp;#34;repair&amp;#34; needs to be repeated every couple of years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From my experience, definitely would not hesitate to recommend. Conjecture is that those who experienced short life with this appliance may not have cleaned the lint filter as often as required. From personal experience I know it&#x27;s easy to put this little chore off. If you have had this product only a few months and you start experiencing the unit shutting off before your hair is dry - this is the thing to check.</li>
            <li> Love the wall mount dryer this is the third one purchased</li>
            <li> What a piece of junk. Used once daily by my husband for approximately 5 minutes. Started smoking &amp; burned out today. 1 week past the return period. Will never purchase a Conair product again. Just so disgusted. Please please please move on to the next item. This is not worth it. As my husband said it would have died if I used it 1 time (long thick curly hair). So the next one gets tested by me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve installed these in my bathrooms. They work fibe, but they&#x27;re extremely noisy. Sometimes I worry that it might damage my eardrums.</li>
            <li> Replaced a like unit which had lasted 6 years</li>
            <li> We have purchased three of these and they do not last. This last purchased lasted 7 months. Will not purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> This item is great if you have a small bathroom like I do.  It hangs on the wall and is convenient. It doesn&#x27;t have any features and only two speeds may be a drawback for some. But that is really all I need. It has no attachments but I just use my own brush to control my hair as I blow dry.</li>
            <li> This dryer is small and fits out of the way on the wall.  This one replaces one just like it that lasted for years and years.  It does a great job drying both my longer hair and my husband&#x27;s short hair.</li>
            <li> The dryer is small but packs enough punch for my wife.  Installed the unit when we remodeled in 1998 and it just died this morning.  I&#x27;m buying another - since it will slide right into the space vacated by the old one I won&#x27;t have any wallpaper issues to contend with and, for $20, its hard to beat the value.</li>
            <li> THis dryer is great - especially for the price.  Easy to mount.  Two settings High is hot and blows hard and low is significantly cooler and blows rather soft.  I am not a real glam girl so the settings work for me.</li>
            <li> I would expect a \\&quot;coil cord\\&quot; to re-coil.  This does not.  It stretched and re-coiled about 50% on the first try. I did not over do it.  I went about 3 feet at most. I can tell by closer examination that it would only get more stretched. What is the point of a coiled cord.  I could simply use a regular dryer with a hook.  I had not mounted it but had one person hold it against the wall for placement evaluation...not to test the cord.  I am returning this \\&quot;defective\\&quot; product.</li>
            <li> I really liked how it dries and the general look.  I&#x27;ve owned two older models and then just bought the newest model.  The older ones got clogged in the filter area and had to be cleaned (one just stopped working - and smelled like over heating) -- the next one I learned to clean.  This latest one I bought because I thought I would start fresh at my new condo.  But they only had a version with a nightlight, which I didn&#x27;t need, but I ordered anyway.  For some reason when it is plugged in it has a low buzz, as if the night light is doing something.  When I hit the reset button it goes away.  Then about a month after installing, it fell off the wall.  I had used the sticky mount option, instead of screw mounting.  Before I screw mount something, I want to find another dryer that doesn&#x27;t buzz and won&#x27;t get clogged and burn out on me.</li>
            <li> Conair 134R 1600 Watt Wallmount Dryer with LED Night Light is a very good dryer.  The previous lasted 4 years and the mounting plate is still good so all you need is switch the units.</li>
            <li> thought it was smaller!!</li>
            <li> As the other reviewers all said, it does work well while it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ours started overheating but I used tweezers to get all the dust out of the back. This helped for a little bit but it completely burned out. We had it about a year which is as long as the warranty is good for.  :(</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Wish I had purchased something like it a long time ago!</li>
            <li> living in a travel trailer doesnt give you lots of space..so this product is great for me  works great too  thanks</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this hairdryer as we have no space in our tiny bathroom to store a bigger hairdryer.  I&#x27;ve used wall-mounted hairdryers in hotels and thought that it would be the solution for me.    Wrong!  While it&#x27;s great to have it up on the wall and out of the way, the small size makes it better suited to short hair.  With longer hair you have to be careful to hold the dryer farther away from your head so that hair doesn&#x27;t get sucked into the back of it.  I believe this is what caused my hairdryer to start overheating after just two months of use.  The fan became very sluggish and the coils would overheat, then it would spark and the thermostat would reset.  The fan would speed up within a few minutes to where it could keep the coils from overheating, but eventually this took even longer.  I took it apart to clean it but it is made in such a way that you can&#x27;t get at the hair that is wrapped around the fan stem.  I could see that it was only a few strands anyway, but even this was too much.    Even when it was new it didn&#x27;t blow a lot of air, though it did get fairly hot.  I&#x27;m off to buy a full size hairdryer with more power and will just have to figure out a place to hang it.  Blah.      p.s.  The nightlight is really, really bright.  I disabled mine after a couple of nights of trying to ignore the green glow emanating from the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Space saver for sure. A bit loud and dryer opening is small.</li>
            <li> Excellent, would buy again.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is the same or similar to units we have used in hotels when we have traveled. It is compact but powerful. The extra feature of a night light is very nice for our home use. We have one in our master bath and our guest bath and would recommend this item to friends.</li>
            <li> I have had this hair dryer for 4 or 5 years now, every day use. It has worked flawlessly. The only thing is the small plastic parts that hold the hand unit in the base. After a few years they cracked and fell off.  Not to despair, I just balled up a small amount of double stick clear tape &amp; put it behind the parts. Works perfect again. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Convenient and classy wall mount hair dryer. No fumbling under the sink or closet. Available when I want it!</li>
            <li> awesome product. Tucked out of the way in the female&#x27;s bathroom of my home. I also purchased one for the male&#x27;s bathroom in the house and will put in the master bathroom once I am complete with the remodel so if I ever get married again she will have one to use. great night light also. never have to turn on the bathroom light in the middle of the night..</li>
            <li> Shipment was received in short time.&lt;br /&gt;Hair dryers are easy to installed</li>
            <li> THIS IS MY 2ND. ONE, MY FIRST ONE BROKE WHERE THE HAIR DRYER HOOKS INTO THE MOUNT, I WOULD MAKE THAT AREA STRONGER.</li>
            <li> got this Conair Wallmount hair dryer about a month ago to replace the one we had for about 15 years that finally blew up. It&#x27;s the most convenient dryer you can own. Didn&#x27;t even have to replace the wall mount bracket. New unit was exactly the same as the old. But - gotta say I&#x27;m really glad we kept the old unit. The rear filter screen on the new unit fell right off out of the box. The 2 little tabs that snap the screen onto the main housing were like melted smooth and could not be fixed. But the screen on the old unit was an exact match. So - snap-off, snap-on, and viola, back in business. Lucky for us. And Amazon. Or they&#x27;d have to pay for an exchange. And we&#x27;d be stuck using a clunky, 10 pound albatross dryer for bout a week or so. Amazon&#x27;s delivery was 1-2 days quicker than I expected. Good price too. Oh, the built in night light is real handy too. Worked great for at least 15 years.</li>
            <li> same as old one that was at least 14 years old, got the same model and it works even better, did not have to even install the newer wall mount was also the exact same.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer started out great and I loved the added night light feature.  It did not last long at all so now I&#x27;m shopping for something to replace it.  My poor wall, this will be the third dryer.  I am beginning to wonder if there is a wallmount dryer that lasts more than a year.</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these dryers. One dryer glowed red hot after 8 months. I threw it out. I purchased another one and the plastic tabs that hold the dryer on the base broke. Customer service was horrible!!! They practically accused me of breaking it myself. The representative said that she owned one and my problem never happened to her. Anyway, after calling back I spoke with another woman who said to mail the dryer at my expense($9.00) and they would send me another dryer. Well I received the dryer yesterday, plugged it in and the plug popped and blew the circuit in the bathroom. I am almost certain they sent a refurbished piece of junk!!! Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> The style looks sheik hanging on wall. Looks good and very quiet. I like the nite light that&#x27;s built into it.</li>
            <li> Works well for my application.</li>
            <li> This is our second unit after 10 years of daily service.  The original unit worked fine until the internal fan that pulls air through the unit shattered.  We mounted a 2nd unit on the same wall bracket in about 5 seconds and are again happy campers.</li>
            <li> I owned this exact product for about 5 years before it \\&quot;died\\&quot;.  I was pleased with its performance, so I purchased the same dryer again.  My only objection was that the plastic clips which hold the dryer in place broke easily, and the part of the cord that attaches to the dryer came loose.  Both of these things happened within a couple of years, but did not impair the functioning of the product.</li>
            <li> This is my second one in 8 years and I think it is great. This new one is for a new home.</li>
            <li> I bought 2! One for the master bath and one for the kids bath. It has helped with the clutter in the kids bathroom soooo much! And since it&#x27;s out all the time it reminds my girls to dry their hair.  I LOVE it! I would recommend it to anybody with kids.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer. I will never by a regular dryer again. It looks great and is very attractive on the wall.</li>
            <li> Delivery was on time! I They are so easy and light to handle. Just what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much!!</li>
            <li> After 12 years, my old (exactly the same) dryer died - it didn&#x27;t owe me a thing.  I was pleased to find the same design still available.  We have a small bathroom so I don&#x27;t have the space to leave a dryer on a counter, and I&#x27;m certainly not going to take one out each morning and put it away after use.  This is so darn convenient!</li>
            <li> I oove it!  Works great, plenty of blow power and love the added bonus of the night light. I would recommend this product for purchase.</li>
            <li> I was unable to find a comparable product at the local big box stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleased to find this at a price that was approximately 50% less than other retailers and websites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great and does not take up additional counter top in bathroom.</li>
            <li> After seeing one of these at a motel, decided we needed a wall mounted hair dryer. For our small bathroom, it is very convient and easy to use. Mounting was simple, all hardware provided.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We liked the wall mount as it saves time not having to take a dryer out of the drawer, then out of a case and plug it in. While not as powerful as the older dryer, the time saved just taking it off the wall base and turn it on makes up for it. That&#x27;s all. Take it off, turn it all and you are receiving a blast of hot air.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Another feature is that it comes with a night light that does go off when the bathroom light goes on. Would recommend this highly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine, but the air is not nearly as hot as my old 1600 watt unit by another maker...also the mount is a lot bulkier taking up more space than it needs to...a lot of plastic just to hold a little handheld dryer</li>
            <li> Use the microwave on a daily basis. Very nice simple design - easy to use. Wallmount dryer is wonderful - hangs well on the wall-like the light-great night light-light weight and works well. Very happy with both products.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Conair Wallmount Dryer because we absolutely wore out our last one and we loved that one so much that we bought another.  I have these hairdryers in both of our bathrooms and they are so handy because they are right there.  Just pick it up and turn it on and you are ready to go.  Great product.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer hangs in the wall in the bathroom so you have more room in your drawers. It works well, but needs to be replaced every few years after daily use. It is powerful enough for my family, but if you have thick or long hair with a lot of girls in your family this hair dryer might not be powerful enough for you.</li>
            <li> NO complaint. It is very powerful for the size.</li>
            <li> Love these dryers! Had one for 9 years, finally burned out. Just bought 2 more. So convenient to have it right there on the wall, and the night light is a bonus.</li>
            <li> When I first saw this model I was excited about the practicality of it&#x27;s wall mount design, and the sleek styling it offered.  It&#x27;s 1600 watts supplied ample drying power, and the unit even has the ability to be shut off from the handset... a feature I am very fond of!  The problem; they don&#x27;t last!  My first one lasted about 9 months and then began to continually overheat and shut off several times during my styling process.  Blowing into the back got old pretty quick, and in the hope that I just got that one lemon, I decided to order another.  I&#x27;ve owed my present unit for not quite a year now, and a few days ago I went to turn it on, and it just wouldn&#x27;t.  Terminal.  I find myself again in need of a new wall mounted hair dryer, dreading removing this one and remounting the next.  I&#x27;m presently seeking a better made model, after all, if you&#x27;re going to mount something on your wall, you want it to last more than a year, no?</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have bought this dryer. My housekeeper accidently broke the little latch on the first one so it wouldn&#x27;t atay hung up anymore. I had the first one for about 3 or 4 years &amp; I loved it enough to repurchase rather than getting another brand or style. Highly recommend this dryer for its convenience and quick hair drying!</li>
            <li> Great Dryer, easy to put on wall. Very Happy with it. Nice nite lite.</li>
            <li> I have had a couple of these over the years.  They&#x27;ve been great.  Lasted a long time.  Easy to mount.  Great night light too.</li>
            <li> Fit right where the old dyers was mounted. Great replacement for a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> Love it and use it daily.  So convenient.</li>
            <li> Love not having to store a hair dryer and so far the Conair is operating GREAT!  It&#x27;s also a great weight and wattage for drying your hair.</li>
            <li> Great product, sleek design and high powered wall mount hair dryer.  Would highly recommend</li>
            <li> I like it.  It dries my hair pretty quickly and I have long hair.</li>
            <li> Lots of hot air! easy to mount with double faced tape. Had to return one that was defective way out of warranty and Amazon gave me my money back less shipping and I bought another. We have tow in out bathroom and find them so convenient  and they look good on the wall as well. No more fighting or pulling it out of a draw each time. What a simple luxury!</li>
            <li> These are on the wall on our bathrooms- they look great  were easy to install and use.  They really help to clean up the clutter.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 of these dryers and returned both.  My hair is very thick and it didn&#x27;t blow hard enough nor hot enough to dry my hair.  If you don&#x27;t have really thick or long hair--it will probably work just fine.</li>
            <li> Replaced one that had its day</li>
            <li> Installation was difficult.  A small plastic piece cracked during installation, which caused us to have to install a different way.  I wish the hair dryer carrier was smaller.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!  Mount it in your bathroom on the wall and no hassle finding and using it.&lt;br /&gt;We have now bought 4 of these (3 for our home and one as a gift to a house guest who loved it).&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The dryer was as described, and we are pleased with its design and appearance. It was well-packed and mailed promptly.</li>
            <li> Dryer is great, night light is not that great.</li>
            <li> Works great and keeps the vanity uncluttered.</li>
            <li> /Mounted well.  Looks and works great!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace one just like it , I have used it everyday for at least 5years, I love the way it is out of the way , and right at your finger tips.</li>
            <li> Already had one. Bought this 2nd one for the other bathroom. Great product.</li>
            <li> Because of the placement on the blower, it takes up more space than I anticipated.  It does the job!</li>
            <li> Product was what I wanted, ordering was simple and delivery happened quickly.  Pleased</li>
            <li> Very good hair dryer. It hugs to the wall. Powerful with 2 speeds and has a night lite. This is our second one. First one, the dryer  failed after a year to lock to unit. Hopefully this one will last longer. Have had other Conairs for many years. Two in another bathroom and one for dogs.</li>
            <li> this is the second one I&#x27;ve had. It works wonderfully</li>
            <li> works perfect for us, not too big and not too small, wife luvs the ease of it on the wall</li>
            <li> Had one previously that wore out to the extent that the clamps holding the blower in place on the wall bracket were no longer doing the job.  This was a replacement.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer looks good. Was easy to install and worked well .... For a year. With no filter over the air intake, hair is continuously sucked into the back of the dryer. If you have long hair like me it winds around the fan spindle and eventually overheats the motor. The only reason we got a year out of it is because we took it apart and cleaned it-it is not designed to be taken apart. Good thing it was cheap. My previous wall mount lasted ten years.</li>
            <li> i have owned about 8 of these in the last 7 years. plastic piece on holder always breaks and unit burns up after 9 months and i&#x27;m getting ready to buy # 9</li>
            <li> This hair dryer replaced an Oster wall mount that finally burnt out after 6-7 years. I liked the looks of it and that it turns off automatically when inserted back into the receptacle.  The wattage is better and it dries my hair faster. Lets hope it lasts as long as my old one.</li>
            <li> Good replacement.  Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful and compact. It&#x27;s perfect to keep counter tops and cabinets clutter free.I highly recommend it for anyone for sure!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s right there for quick easy use and has a night light, as well. It was easy to install and does a great job.</li>
            <li> This dryer would be wonderful if it fit on the small wall I have to plug it into!  It dries well and I do like everything else about it.</li>
            <li> workes very good. i like it because it hang on the wall out of the way</li>
            <li> My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t find what is essentially the same hair dryer - also available from Amazon - without the wasted (and unneeded) plastic frame (housing... frame?)  above the unit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product attached to the wall with the double faced &amp;#34;sticky things&amp;#34;  included. It hasn&#x27;t fallen off. It dries my hair. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Love these hair dryers.  Very convenient to use and powerful enough for even the longest hair.  Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have purchased these over the years and like the fact that this one had a nite lite. I am still using this particular one and still have one I bought previously without a nite lite.</li>
            <li> I always thought I wanted one of these. A recent motel stay convinced me. Always plugged in and ready to use. Very efficient.</li>
            <li> Years ago we purchased two Sunbeam wall mount hair dryers &#x27;his and hers&#x27;. They have seen service now in two homes. Mine is still doing well but this Conair replaced my wife&#x27;s. Has a little more heat which she wants. She is happy----------so I am happy</li>
            <li> I wanted to have something that helped keep counters clear.  This is inexpensive and serves the purpose. Cords don&#x27;t stretch out and looks organized.</li>
            <li> I plan to buy more of this product for gifts in the future. I hung my dryer up as soon as I got it and have used it a lot.</li>
            <li> It kicks out the heat doesn&#x27;t take up space, neat, nicely sized, blows like an hurricane you&#x27; ll love it.  Needs an man to install there isn&#x27;t anyway I could 50 year old women.</li>
            <li> Excellent Hair Dryer--my wife, daughter and guests love them.  Very well made.  Seem to last forever.  I am installing two more so we have one in each bathroom.  The first one is about 10 years old and running strong.</li>
            <li> I have it in a rental condo and it has been working ok for about a year and a half.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and right at your fingertips Ilovesanta that&#x27;s tuts tote wall and shuts off when returned to base.</li>
            <li> Worked great but only lasted about 2 years.  This is our second wall mount dryer in 3 years.  They simply don&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> I am replacing a unit I bought over 10 years ago.  The high setting burned out, and the low setting is not hot enough nor fast enough for me.  I think this is a gret little dryer and I like the neat wall mount.</li>
            <li> I have been using this model for the last 10 years, it only been replaced for once.  It is beautiful, space save, powerful and very durable plus it has a night light.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the hair dryer. Having it hanging next to the mirrors in my bathroom give me extra space on my sink counter.</li>
            <li> We downsized our bath and needed a smaller blowdryer. This thing rocks! It&#x27;s easy to mount and has plenty of power. The nightlight is also nice - although we don&#x27;t normally dry our hair in the dark. I&#x27;ll probably get two more for the other guest baths.</li>
            <li> Very nice, works well. Great product and handy to use.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS ITEM, HAVE ONE IN EVERY BATHROOM.</li>
            <li> easy to mount, works great  night light is added bonus</li>
            <li> Just as promissed. Works great has a great night light. Dries hair just Lila hair dryers should dry it a wow product</li>
            <li> These are my 3rd and 4th.  Had to leave 1 and 2 at my old house.  Perfect size, speed and temp.</li>
            <li> This dryer frees up space on the counter top. It isn&#x27;t very powerful so that&#x27;s why I gave it four stars. I had to have someone install it for me so that added additional cost. I like the fact that it is all white.</li>
            <li> Have used similar products for years. This one&#x27;s not quite as good as some competition or Conair&#x27;s older product. Installation is easy. Drier does not sit firmly in holder; I worry that it will fall out (it hasn&#x27;t yet). Not good way to deal with dangling cord ... can&#x27;t easily wrap around holder and no hook or anything to store it. Would be nice if dryer turned on when removed from holder. Holder footprint is much larger than it needs to be. Otherwise, hairdryer does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and dries hair well.</li>
            <li> This is the third unit I&#x27;ve purchased.  They last two or three years.  It is very convenient and has a nightlight.</li>
            <li> Currently on the 3rd hair dryer in 10 years so happy with product and cost is very reasonable.   Availability of wallmount dryers is limited to a few models.</li>
            <li> Small but packs a punch. Dries my hair up just as good as my bulky hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Works great and always at hands reach. Very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Love this little guy.  Good for short to medium hair, but not for long hair.  Nightlite is nice touch.</li>
            <li> I love it. Keeps it out of the way. Don&#x27;t have to worry about where to put it away or winding up a cord. Works well and my husband likes the night light feature. Just purchased this one to replace one I bought 13 years ago. Also bought one for a vacation home. They really are great.</li>
            <li> Great wall mount dryer.</li>
            <li> I received my product with great tracking from Amazon. I felt confident when ordering the brand name because I figured they had years of experience with these products. I purchased this item new in the box and I have had wall mount dryers before and are an easy install.  Conair&#x27;s metal wall mount holes in the plate were too small for the screws given. There was no way to screw them into the plate to attach to the wall.  I had to search my garage for self tapping metal screws to match the hole size and finally after a good hour or so was able to attach the wall plate that holds the dryer. Once I unpacked the dryer and hung it on the wall plate, I noticed the dust cover on the back of the dryer looked loose. After inspecting the problem, I found that one of the prongs that hold it to the dryer was missing. To add to all the existing problems the grip that hold the hair dryer handle was so loos that it hardly held the hair dryer in place when it is sitting back in the cradle.&lt;br /&gt;I called Conair customer service to see what they could do for me and I was told they have no parts for this hair dryer. I would need to contact Amazon to return or replace.  What a complete waste of time not to mention I threw my old hair dryer out. I will not be purchasing another Conair wall mount dryer in the future.</li>
            <li> I did not like the design or the size so I sent it back. Pretty clunky-looking and too large for my dinky bathroom.</li>
            <li> For the price it was not bad</li>
            <li> This is my third one in 15 years.  They are convenient and very reliable.  A great buy!</li>
            <li> Died after only a dozen or less uses.  Smoke and electrical smell from unit.</li>
            <li> been using this brand in my bathrooms for years.  easy to install.</li>
            <li> Night light is just enough to see but not keep you awake. Hair dryer is great. Installs either with screws or tape.</li>
            <li> The product itself is a 4 - 5 star product. It is just right for my wife&#x27;s needs and the night light is a welcome plus. The 3 stars was for installation. I found the wall stud to screw the back plate into the wall for security. I drilled the holes. Then pulled out the included screws and to my surprise found out that the holes were way too small for the screws to fit through. I had to go to the shop and drill out the holes bigger. This took several trips as I wanted to make sure they weren&#x27;t too big so the small screw head would just go through the hole. Very frustrating and oh, so avoidable by the company. Once installed, the plate makes it easy to get the product on and off the wall. I hope it is fixed in the future. If this had been for an older woman without a knowledge of drilling out metal, this would have been a return.</li>
            <li> I find it very handy for my daily hair drying. My grand daughter comes here when she is in a hurry to dry her hair.</li>
            <li> This is the third time I have bought this model. I love that it mounts on the wall so I don&#x27;t have it in a drawer or on the counter. The night light is a bonus. Each one lasts about 5 years before the plastic breaks or wears out.</li>
            <li> I like this hair dryer very much. It hangs on the wall so one does not have to get it out and plug it in. It also has a nice nightlight built in and that&#x27;s handy in a dark bathroom.</li>
            <li> I would have given it a 5 star rating but I am replacing it with like kind, and my former one burned out prematurely; so I&#x27;m not expecting this one to last any longer than the first one.  Also, no spare parts are available for this model; therefore, I was not able to fix the former one.</li>
            <li> Works great but I wish it had more power.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this compact, convenient hair dryer!</li>
            <li> This was a replacement, I had the same one since at least 2005. It is very light weight with lots of power. Easy to use to style with.</li>
            <li> Love it, very convenient. I was thrilled when I got a hotel room and they had this hair dryer in the bathroom. I was very excited when I saw it available on Amazon. I really didn&#x27;t think it would work as well as the ones in the hotel as I figured there&#x27;s was a commercial grade. I was pleasantly surprised it worked just as well. I get a lot of compliments on it when I have guests, especially those that forgot to pack one or don&#x27;t want to go digging for their. It is an excellent idea for bathrooms or teenagers room. My Granddaughter has asked for one to put beside her vanity. Perhaps Santa will provide.</li>
            <li> the nite light on both dryers does not work.</li>
            <li> Bought this one ten years ago..and it finally quit on me..I was soooo happy to find an exact replacement!  Has lots of necessary wattage and I love not having to find storage for a hair dryer!!</li>
            <li> I love having my hair dryer ready for action whenever I need it.&lt;br /&gt;Conair is an excellent product.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Just like in the motels.  compact, light, and 1600 watt.  Wall mount perfect to keep it out of the way but handy.</li>
            <li> works great,  no cord mess &amp; no place to find it ... always right where it&#x27;s mounted</li>
            <li> I put the Conair 134R hair dryer on my guests bathroom wall and my visiting company love the idea because they do not have to lug a hair dryer along when they visit me.  I also has a night light on it.</li>
            <li> I love this hairdryer and the ease of having it on the wall right there to use</li>
            <li> Just installed 31 of these at our motel.  Rating is based upon value, as I searched many different options and this was the most cost effective with a nightlight.  The plastic front snaps onto a metal base that is attached to the wall.  I used the four wall anchors and screws provided with each unit.  After the metal plate is removed from the back of the front, it is easy to loosen the cord anchors allowing one to adjust the length of the power cord depending on how far way the outlet is.  The metal plate has knock outs for direct wire as well, if your outlet or electrical box happens to be in the exact right position.  The night light is not very bright, but of course, I never tested it with my eyes adjusted to the dark.  It does go off when normal room lighting is on.  The hair dryer itself is perfect for simple operation... two speeds, switches up for high, down for low.  The cradle automatically returns the switch to off if the user forgets this operation.  Cradle seems to hold well, and release easily.</li>
            <li> My hair dryer broke and I needed a replacement.  I keep my hair dryer plugged in by my sink and I worried about my grandkids accidentally dropping it in the sink so I bought this wall mounted unit.  I absolutely love it.  So convenient and it&#x27;s more powerful than my old hair dryer.  I may get another one for the other bathroom.</li>
            <li> It works well but it is under powered. But good enough for what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Super easy to install and very handy to preserve the valuable counter space!&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to install away from water.</li>
            <li> The wall mount dryer was just what I needed for my new small bathroom as I do not have any counter space.  Works great!</li>
            <li> I really love it and a great appliance and glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Works great, easy to install, good drying power.</li>
            <li> Great value for the money!</li>
            <li> Works well, base is a little large compared to others I&#x27;ve had. Can&#x27;t beat the cost.</li>
            <li> It is as great as the one it replaced.</li>
            <li> This is great for a smaller bathroom - like I have - and it mounted easily on the wall and I use it daily,</li>
            <li> This Conair Wallmount Dryer with LED night light was my second purchase.  My first Conair served and lasted me a long time, therefore, there was no question that I needed and wanted to have it replaced with one of the same.</li>
            <li> Good quality with a matching price,. Easy to install, good night light. A good buy!&lt;br /&gt;Will consider buy one more.</li>
            <li> Powerful dryer and easy to install, at a good price.  Keeps the cord off the counter and frees up counter space.</li>
            <li> works well, priced right, but the attachment bracket almost makes it is &amp;#34;permanent&amp;#34; attachment to your wall.  Try to remove it and something will break.</li>
            <li> Mounted in new poop deck bathroom</li>
            <li> I am soon to be on my 4th of these hair dryers. I like the ease and convenience of a wall mount hair dryer as it helps with the bathroom clutter. But as one of the other reviewers noted, the plastic piece that holds the dryer to the mounting station breaks before the actual dryer dies.  Every time this happens I tell myself I am going to get a new one, but the price of the dryer is not bad and it&#x27;s more convenient to just buy another, vs. having to get another kind of dryer that has a different foot print and will potentially cause more damage to your wall.</li>
            <li> I have a hair dryer with higher wattage than this one.  It keeps overheating and switching to cold air.  When it cools down, it goes back to hot.  It takes forever to dry my hair as cold air does nothing.  I was in a hotel that had this hair dryer.  It&#x27;s lower wattage, but it took less time to dry my hair because it did not overheat.  When I got home from vacation, I decided to see if I could find the same hair dryer on Amazon.  This is exactly the same one as in the hotel.  I ordered it.  I received it quickly.  I LOVE IT.  I love that it&#x27;s mounted on the wall.  I love everything about this dryer.  Don&#x27;t let the lower wattage fool you.  This seems as hot as my other dryer.  It must be a little less, because it never overheats, but you wouldn&#x27;t notice it.  I can dry my hair faster with this dryer.</li>
            <li> This is my 4th one !!! Love it on my wall just like fine hotels, and it works GREAT</li>
            <li> We have bought at least 6 of these....and they all inexplicably die within a matter of one year!!  I should have stopped ordering replacements, lazy on our part so we could just use the same wall mounts.  Time to try another brand!!!</li>
            <li> We have had this dryer in all of the hotels we&#x27;ve stayed at in Mexico, and it really is the way to have a dryer at your fingertips without taking up counter space. The only problem we had was that the wall mount was a bit larger than the ones we&#x27;ve used, so a bit less compact. A good way to gain vanity top space and have a dryer close to hand, that is always plugged in and handy.</li>
            <li> Dogs to work as well as my hand held  Conair and doesn&#x27;t have button to stop heat and just blow air .  Disappointed in the functions .  Steve allen</li>
            <li> Could have more power.</li>
            <li> It was a gift and exactly what she asked for.  She loved it.</li>
            <li> These are super handy. Just like a hotel at home.</li>
            <li> Very slick hair dryer with good power.</li>
            <li> Very good √çtem, good service from Amazon</li>
            <li> I had a huge oldschool Conair for ages, literally decades, before it finally gave out, so I knew I&#x27;d be going with a Conair again.  Stumbed across this and thought it would be perfect, as my bathroom is smallish and the more space-saving features the better.  Shipping was fast as always.  My biggest worry was how it would go up, and I was relieved to find two options - screws or double-sided tape.  I really didn&#x27;t want to screw into the wall above the outlet because I have no idea how the apartment bathroom is wired.  So I went with the tape, and I&#x27;m pleased to say it went up without a single hitch and is holding the unit up with no problem whatsoever.  There are no bells and whistles with this dryer, other than the feeble little nightlight - it&#x27;s got three settings - OFF, LOW, and HIGH.  And that&#x27;s just exactly enough options for me.  I&#x27;m a guy with longish (shoulder length) hair and don&#x27;t really want to fuss in front of the mirror, just want my hair dried if I need to be somewhere.  This comes in very handy for teaching 8am classes where I roll out of bed into the shower and then into the car at 6am.  No hunting for the dryer, no unwrapping and untangling cords, it&#x27;s always right there, super handy.  The nightlight seems like a total afterthought, it certainly doesn&#x27;t put enough light out to help you find stuff in the dark bathroom or not stub your toe.  It&#x27;s just... there.  And I guess in its own way it&#x27;s kind of cool, I just don&#x27;t totally get it.  Doesn&#x27;t matter.  This is for drying hair and it does that well.</li>
            <li> These are the best.  You don&#x27;t have to look around for a dryer. It is there on the wall ready for use.</li>
            <li> Replace this product with identical product after 6 years and never had a problem. Very satisfied</li>
            <li> Works great though the night light is kinda useless.</li>
            <li> Dries faster than I expected. Cools  off quickly with the side mount hanging.  Love the night light.  Just enough light.</li>
            <li> Have been using the Conair walmount dryers for years.  The new one that I ordered don&#x27;t really seem to have quite as much air movement as they did in the past, although not really sure due to it is so much quiter maby just appeares to be that way.  Also on the old ones, I could just take it from the wll mount bracket and use it like a regular Blower, or just put a new one in an old prewall mounted bracket.  On this one I had to cut the cord and re splice it, due to it being hooked to the Light so It would not just come out of the wall mount bracket  without cutting the cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jerry</li>
            <li> Powerful, efficient and convenient. Can&#x27;t ask for more. My wife loves it.</li>
            <li> Great for the OCD types like me who hate having things like blow dryers messing up your bathroom.</li>
            <li> This is a great hairdryer.  I got one for two of my three bathrooms and wish I had just got three.  It gets the hair dryer off the counter and/or out of the drawer.  Eliminates the cord scramble.  I&#x27;m worthless with a drill and even I was able to install them myself. The nightlight is just a dim light so it isn&#x27;t too much light - just kind of like the light you would see on a computer supply cord.  So I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as relying on it for a nightlight.  But that&#x27;s okay.  I wasn&#x27;t counting on that for a nightlight anyway.  I&#x27;ve only had them 3 or 4 months so I can&#x27;t attest to the longevity.  One is in the guest room and doesn&#x27;t get much use.  The other we use daily.  so far I&#x27;m 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li> We love the convenience of having wall mounted hair dryers that have 2 settings for drying our hair, are lightweight and easy to handle, and have the added feature of a nightlight.</li>
            <li> wall-mounted hair dryer is a space-saver in the small bathroom. And for a condo that is also a vacation rental, this works very well. We won&#x27;t know how well it holds up over time until we get &amp;#34;over time&amp;#34;. But for now -- looks good, sounds good, dries well.</li>
            <li> dryer is excellent ,night light not to good.</li>
            <li> I like this hair dryer, it&#x27;s worth the price. Thank you</li>
            <li> Very happy with the hair dryer, its everything I hoped for</li>
            <li> Excellent value for the price.</li>
            <li> Love this hairdryer. Had another one I bought ten years ago that finally gave out. Immediately purchased this and hung it right up. Gives the luxury of a hotel right in my bathroom</li>
            <li> This is the fifth unit we have had in our house and use three at any time.  They do burn out eventually, but the price allows a replacement, so we just leave the base mount on the wall up, and snap a new unit in place.</li>
            <li> The dryer arrived as pictured......however, the cord is REALLY long and hard to manage.  It would be helpful to know this since a super lengthy cord could be challenging in a small bathroom.......Conair needs to shorten this cord by a good 12 inches.</li>
            <li> Although this hairdryer has only to settings it is just right for drying my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I only use it when I am in a hurry to day my hair otherwise I let my hair dry by itself.&lt;br /&gt;The night light is very convenient and I have had no trouhle with it. I&lt;br /&gt;It is small enough so it does not get in the way of my medicine cabinet or vanity drawers with the hanging cord.</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC!  Worth every penney.  I was looking for a self contained unit, and this was the one.  Looks good once mounted, plenty of drying power, and the price is good.  I will be purchasing a second unit for my guest bathroom.  If your on the fence concerning this item, going ahead and buy-it, you won&#x27;t regret it...</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer--this is my second purchase of this model, the last one was 8 years ago.  It&#x27;s lasted me through a total of 4 years with really long hair and 4 years of short hair, daily use, and no problems until the very end (the &amp;#34;High&amp;#34; setting gave out suddenly). I have tried other wall mounts and hand-held and haven&#x27;t found one that worked nearly as well and was so convenient.  LED nightlight isn&#x27;t super bright, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me at night even with the bathroom door open into my bedroom, but is bright enough that you can see in the middle of the night once you get in the bathroom.  You can adjust the length of the cord on both the &amp;#34;plug side&amp;#34; and the &amp;#34;handheld side&amp;#34; before you hang it up and installation was very easy--I&#x27;m not handy at all and had no problems. I was so panicked when my old one gave out that I shelled out for next-day, Saturday shipping just so I wouldn&#x27;t have to go without it!</li>
            <li> We love this. So convenient to have it right there ready to go in the bathroom. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Only had this item for about a week, but so far it seems to work well.  Got it mounted on the wall and it works.  The only thing I&#x27;m not thrilled with is the night-light built into the base is extremely dim.  Its bordering on the unhelpful level of dimness.  It would be nice if this was just a bit brighter, but thats not why we bought it anyway, we got it for the hair dryer.  My 3 ladies of the house have used it and like it so far.  Hopefully it will last a while, but if not, its not an expensive accessory, so we&#x27;ll have to see how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> Works well, doesn&#x27;t make the bathroom hot. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is how big the wall mount is--the previous brand I had was much smaller.</li>
            <li> My first Conair lasted for 12 years.  When it died, I decided to just buy another and place on the pre-existing plate, and it still fits!  My complaint would be that the dryer is really loud.</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer.  So convenient not to have to put it away when I&#x27;m finished drying my hair.  I loved these in hotel rooms and it is great on the wall in my master bath!  No problems installing it either.  Great purchase!!!!</li>
            <li> Perfect and easy to install ..... it&#x27;s exactly what she has been asking for. Light and does an excellent job.</li>
            <li> Saves space and easy to mount. The night light is on a LED sensor so no turning on or off.</li>
            <li> This is my second one purchased.  The last hairdryer ran for over 2 years, with two people using it everyday.  Delivery was fast and item was exactly what we were looking for.  The dryer hangs nicely on the wall and works well.</li>
            <li> While it may not be the most powerful or versatile hair dryer available, it is certainly the most convenient.  I bought this as a replacement for the exact same model that lasted several years.  My wife wanted this one replaced when the plastic internal fan blades broke apart, but that was after 5-10 years of regular use.  My wife has one or two others that have specialty attachments  and are probably more powerful, but this is the one that she uses as the primary one, because it is always right there, nothing to pull out and plug in etc. It&#x27;s just there and it is powerful enough to handle most every requirement. I use it infrequently but my short hair is dry in less than a minute.</li>
            <li> This is our 2nd one. The 1st lasted at least 8 years. My wife &amp; daughter love the convenience of having it mounted in the bathroom. The night light is a nice extra.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Small but very powerful.</li>
            <li> Great price for a great product. has a small light that turns on while your bathroom light is off, i would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> We use this to dry off baby butt when doing a diaper change. I mounted it right next to the changing table, and it is flawless. Easy to install, has it&#x27;s own night light, and will even flip the switch to the off position when you re-holster it when its on! Great product!</li>
            <li> Great convenience and space saver.</li>
            <li> Compact, heats well but is noisier than others. This is the second one of these we have purchased. The first lasted about 10 years. If noise is a priority, look at others.</li>
            <li> love the  convenience</li>
            <li> This was east to install. I had to drill out the mounting holes a little on the base so the screws would easily go through. I don&#x27;t know why they give you little pin holes. But turned my ordinary bathroom into a four star hotel bathroom. i just need to add a telephone and an emergency pull cord near the toilet. I just got it so I cant tell you how long it will last but I can tell you it was pretty easy to install. and the nightlight works in the dark. It has a hi and low but no cool button for when you need just air. But it will work perfect for the times I have guests and give them that cheesy hotel feeling. It is nice to have it out of the way and up on the wall. It is snall but does the job. Overall...I think it is pretty cool. Add Amazon Prime and it is here in two days guaranteed.</li>
            <li> The conair hairdryer arrived promptly and works perfectly.  The price was acceptable and I was pleased to have my old non-working appliance replaced so easily.</li>
            <li> I had one of these for 9 years before it died.  Loved it and had to have another.  It&#x27;s compact, light weight and the night light is handy.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd wallmount Conair in 20+ yrs.  Beats anything I&#x27;ve seen in hotels, no matter what brand they use.</li>
            <li> Gift for my wife.  She loves the convenience.</li>
            <li> Great, convenient product. My husband had one and it lasted for years. He looked all over for another one, and was really happy to find this one that would fit in his small bathroom.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the little amenities that make a big difference. Our club shower room was bare bones, so I decided to splurge and add a few things including this dryer.  It was easy to install, and the night light is a great feature for people who use the shower room after dark. So far it&#x27;s working fine.</li>
            <li> Small, easy to mount.  Does the job</li>
            <li> A great little hairdryer and sturdy mount with night light.</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer plus you can turn it off from the handle.  Many of the wall mounted units have to be placed back into the wall mounting to turn off.  The nightlight is perfect as far as light intensity.  So far, 2 months, works great.</li>
            <li> Well pleased.  I had one of these for years and just had to replace it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last long so I contacted Conair and they sent another one</li>
            <li> The only negative reviews I read about this (and all other dryers) is that some die too early. Hopefully this one will not suffer from early death syndrome. It is ideal for bathrooms with limited counter space. We are extremely please with the design and the white night light is a nice feature and not too bright as was mentioned in reviews of alternative models. Chose this one after analyzing reviews of all models. It is a little more expensive but well worth it.</li>
            <li> these are great I have three bathrooms and I have one in each bathroom - very convenient since it does not take up extra space</li>
            <li> After a good bit of research &amp; reading reviews, I ordered this model to replace an old Oster model. I would have preferred a 3 speed model, but they are very scarce. I&#x27;ve only had it about a month, but so far I am pleased with it&#x27;s performance. I do like the night light feature too!</li>
            <li> Wall  mount is nice. I also like led night light</li>
            <li> I love it!  It has fulfilled my expectations!</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer, but the handle area turned pink within about 2 weeks of using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased about a half dozen of these.  Longterm they work well.  There are a couple of weak areas that I wish they would improve.  One is the plastic clips that hold the &amp;#34;neck&amp;#34; of the hairdryer in the mount.  The clips have broken on several but not all of mine.  The dryer still goes in but without the clips it comes out too easily.  I&#x27;ve also had one that just eventually got too weak but that was after more than a dozen years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect. If this sounds like it would work for you, you should buy it.  We could talk about the idea of a hair drier on the wall, but if it appeals to you this is a very good product.</li>
            <li> I put this in a rental condo and it is terrific. The LED night light is a wonderful feature to the unit.</li>
            <li> The clip on our old one finally broke after years of usage.  The girls liked it so much I bought another one - definitely a good value.  Keeps the dryer handy but out of the way.  And as a bonus they hadn&#x27;t changed the mounting system so I just pulled the old one off the wall, adjusted the cord length and snapped the now one in.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for getting that hair dryer off the vanity top to give you more space. Easy to mount, provides  plenty of heat, and the cord length is long enough so you don&#x27;t have to stretch to use it. I have it mounted on the right wall above the outlet, about 18&amp;#34; off the vanity top and it is out of the way but also handy when needed. It fits reasonably tight to the wall and the dryer snaps in and out of the holder easily. Good design on this one. The &amp;#34;night light&amp;#34; part is of no use to me but some may like it. It is built in and automatic.</li>
            <li> Previously had an OSTER, but the last two I have had didn&#x27;t last very long.&lt;br /&gt;Trying the Conair, still getting used to the way it hangs. (Sideways)</li>
            <li> the night light died early in its lifetime but it still dries hair...</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what I needed! It&#x27;s fixed on the wall and always ready to be used! Very convenient and efficient! Great!</li>
            <li> Love it.  Only gave it a 4 because I have to replace it every few years or so.</li>
            <li> Good little dryer.  Cord running from wall to unit little too short.</li>
            <li> I have purchased these for every bathroom!  Not only are they handy, you don&#x27;t have to waste space in your drawer.  The night light is also a gr8 feature for finding your way to the bathroom at night.</li>
            <li> This is great and I like the night light which was a special bonus!!</li>
            <li> Had one that finally wore out and loved it so much bought another one just like it! You don&#x27;t have to worry where to put it, it&#x27;s on the wall!</li>
            <li> It is ideal for me and easy to use and out of the way, just right for a small space</li>
            <li> Handy little blowdryer, better than leaving one plugged in on vanity! Not alot of power though</li>
            <li> excellant hair dryer that mounts on wall to save counter space. Excellant hot air to dry hair quickly . Nice nightlight that works automaticlly.</li>
            <li> Our first Conair lasted 7 years of daily rigorous use. This replacement is a clone in every respect and fits the bill, compact, lightweight and powerful. The price is right as well.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent, compact, easily installed and easy to use dryer.  This is the third of these units we have owned.</li>
            <li> Great blow dryer, but does not hold tight in the holder, but rather loosely.  After using it just a short time the plastic piece that holds the hair dryer in place broke off, now it is disconnected and sitting in the basement not being used.</li>
            <li> so far so good; works as promised, and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Ordered two.  One had no mounting holes drilled???  Easy fix but still should have been caught by QC.  The one that did have holes the holes were too small and the provided screws would not go through so I had to use a larger drill bit to open it up a size or two.  Again, a very easy fix but a step that should have been anticipated and handled prior to the product leaving product development.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Night light is worthless and was not a good addition to the product.  Provides very, very little light.  More of a &amp;#34;find my hair dryer in the dark&amp;#34; beacon if you ask me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Installation is easy and can be done by anyone with even extremely basic skills in no time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest discarding the plastic anchors provided and using the self tapping plastic anchors available at your local store (or here on Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First remove the metal plate from the back of the unit and hold it against the wall where you want it.  Screw the screws through the holes (if you were lucky enough to get one with holes) to make pilot holes in the wall where you will want to install the plastic self taping anchors.&lt;br /&gt;Screw the self tapping anchors into the drywall (do not over tighten) then put the metal plate back up and align the hole patterns.  Install with three screws and pop the plastic hair dryer onto the metal plate and you are finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product does have a removable screen for easy cleaning (excellent feature).  This should extend the product life substantially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Was easy to install (instructions made installation seem more complicated that it was) and works well (no louder than your average dryer).  I like not having to unplug my dryer, wrap the cord up, and place it in a drawer.  What can I say, a minute saved is a minute earned, and I reclaimed much needed drawer space by replacing my old, bulky, heavyweight dryer with this wall mounted one.  I only wish I had purchased it earlier.  It is also very lightweight so my arm doesn&#x27;t get tired when I&#x27;m drying my hair.</li>
            <li> This dryer works great and saves space.  I have one at our home and at our Lake House.  I love the night lite it has.  Its easy to hang on the wall and looks nice too.</li>
            <li> We were always leaving the hair dryer on the counter as it was hot and we didn&#x27;t want to put it away where it might touch something.  Then off we went and it sat on the counter until the next time it was needed.  Drove me crazy!  Yes, I could have picked it up and put it away, but that just didn&#x27;t happen most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thought if hotels had these wall mounts, then they might be available out there.  We have purchased three of these for different bathrooms, had them for quite awhile now and never had an issue with them failing after a few months. Easy to mount.  Alot more attractive than a dryer sitting around on a counter or taking up needed space in the small cabinet under the sink.  Love the night light, it is out of the way, shuts off when you replace it, and looks attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this definitely.</li>
            <li> I love this out of the way blow dryer!  For the price you can&#x27;t beat it!  It actually looks pretty cute on my wall in my small bathroom.</li>
            <li> Was a little big for the space it needed to put it in. Had to return it.</li>
            <li> Great product. Was surprised to see it&#x27;s perfect shape. It fit in our motor home space and held tightly without shifting during travel.</li>
            <li> This is one step to de clutter your vanity! And it works great</li>
            <li> So handie to have on wall and has great blowing power</li>
            <li> Nice little dryer‚Ä¶fits great on the wall and has a lot of power.</li>
            <li> Bought in July!  Ate itself up..   Sooooooo. 3 months and it blew up.</li>
            <li> Being able to have a blow dryer at hand, rather than stuffed in some drawer or cabinet, makes the morning routine so much easier.  One tip...to prevent overheating, do occasionally remove the screen from the back of the dryer.  Once the screen has been removed, built up lint can be accessed and cleaned easily.</li>
            <li> Works great, looks good and was easy to install.  The only con....wish it had a longer cord.</li>
            <li> We are on our 2nd one in about 7 years. Had to have one after using similar model in a hotel. Second one mounted right on  the originals mounting plate in seconds. To those of you that had the units burn up, may I suggest that once a week you clean the dust and other fuzzy stuff from the air intake portion of the dryer......it&#x27;s like changing the furnace filter, only easier. You will always find some problems with production due to worker error or flaws in the product but I can honestly say I am very pleased with the performance of the product for the price and would not let a few poor reviews stop me from buying this product .My only complaint is my original was in chrome and now I can only find white. It&#x27;s a guy thing.</li>
            <li> It works good and has a great nightlite</li>
            <li> Conair has a good product but I wish they put a little more R&amp;D into the durability. The power switch tends to burn out prematurely. I am a service tech and I think that they need to use a switch that can handle more amps. Easy to do but I guess adding a dollar to the price might be too much to ask. This is the 3rd on that I bought in 10 years. I would expect it to last longer than that-maybe I am expecting too much but that is what I expect. Mounting is easy, very easy to use, but why we purchased this is that it is out and with a simple grab, its ready to go. No need to go digging in a drawer, untangling the power cord and re storing it after use. Night light is a good feature as well. We will see how long this one lasts.</li>
            <li> I have two in my bathroom, and these are good choice. I hadto replace one because it was not working.  It was cheaper to buy one than to try to repair it.</li>
            <li> Works well but there may be a problem with the wall mount because we&#x27;ve had it a couple of months and my husband hasn&#x27;t hung it on the wall yet.</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer and love it hanging on the wall!</li>
            <li> Works as expected, but the Scotch sticky mounts don&#x27;t hold up against steam...</li>
            <li> The value of this hair dryer was great I love how it hangs on the wall</li>
            <li> I had one prior. It died.this one is strong or light, depending on what you need it for.  I love the fact that it&#x27;s right by the sink and I don&#x27;t have to go looking for it.  I use it all the time</li>
            <li> Turn on switch is on the handle which makes it convenient.</li>
            <li> Works great in my cottage up north.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended to hotel &amp; motel owners who want a secure way to provide a hairdryer to guests, without losing it.</li>
            <li> simple to mount and my wife says it works great.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer for myself a few months ago and liked it so much I bought two more for each of my two grand daughters. The light isn&#x27;t very bright but gives off enough light</li>
            <li> I needed a light-weight dryer because of an arm injury and this one is indeed light.  I like that.  I wish the cord was either longer or not curled so it didn&#x27;t have to be so close to the holder.</li>
            <li> We have a very small bathroom (You know the kind where you have to go to the next room to change the toilet tissue.). I purchased the Conair 1600 Watt wall-mounted hair dryer and put it up in 5 minutes; arranged the cord so it was out of the way and mostly hidden under the mirror of my medicine cabinet; plugged it in and turned it on. It worked great. The green night light is also helpful to find my way into the bathroom when the sun has not  yet risen.</li>
            <li> Good product to have in the bathroom and it allows you more room. I bought an extra one for the guest bathroom</li>
            <li> We were very pleased with this purchase. The dryer works good and it is very convient to have it so close at hand.</li>
            <li> No more cords and more space in vanityüòÄ</li>
            <li> Works like a champ, and I love it hangs on the wall so it doesn&#x27;t use counter space!   UPDATE....after less than a year of minimal use, the hairdryer quit working properly....the elements started glowing bright red and smelled like it was going to burst into flames...very irritating as I had owned one previously that lasted for years....</li>
            <li> Bought as replacement for worn out dryer. Installation was straight forward, unit is compact, and powerful. Just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with this manufacturer.  I am very please with the operation of the unit.  I am not totally happy with the switch for turning on an off, it could be improved.</li>
            <li> I have 2 of the conair hair dryers. Love the fact that they are wall mounted. The blower is powerful and my hair dries fast.</li>
            <li> Easy installation, and the wife loves it, so in my book that&#x27;s worth 5 stars.</li>
            <li> A great product and works perfectly.  I love that the dryer is off the bathroom counter.  The mounting directions were a little confusing, though.  And the back plate was a little tough to get off.</li>
            <li> I selected this modeal as I had a previous model of this same hair dryer that finally failed after a few years of good service.  I purchsed the model 134R and it fit on the previous model&#x27;s base plate, so I did not have to re-mount to the wall.  The light is now a LED version, which saves power but but puts out much less light than the older model- so it is not really suitable as a night light for the bathroom as the older model was (otherwise I would have given 5 stars).  The dual dryer settings are useful and the high setting is quite powerful- plenty for ay hair type in my opinoin. It is a noisy unit and can get quite warm, but performs as I expected. Overall, a good value for the money.</li>
            <li> Feels cheap but works OK.  Bought this to replace old one but model feels cheaper.  last one lasted less than 2 years.</li>
            <li> The Conair dryer came with the wrong set of screws to wall mount, and the instructions were not clear either. Also, when plugging in, there was no power to the light unit.</li>
            <li> Best wall mounted hair dryer I have owned.  Love it!</li>
            <li> As described, A+++ Seller</li>
            <li> Very handy hanging on the wall.  Night light wouldn&#x27;t light up a small box.</li>
            <li> I really like this hair dryer. It dries quickly and is handy to have mounted on the wall next to my bathroom sink. I would have given it five stars, but the cord does not retract out of the way like the one did that I replaced. I think this is a change that should be made which would make the hair dryer just about perfect.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace the exact same one I had purchased 15 years ago. The old one just stopped working on the high setting, but still works on low. Very handy, nice design with the night light feature, keeps the hair dryer out of the way. I was happy to find the exact same item - I got a good 15 years worth of use out of the old one, so I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> Perfect size and great performance. Be sure and mount to wall with screws. I tried supplied sticky tape first and it fell off the wall within 3 days</li>
            <li> I love this hair drier!  It is very light and easy to manipulate. I bought this to replace the last one that I had bought in 2003.  I love they way it stores on the wall, out of the way. Very neat. I have seen this model in Hotels, too. I highly recommend it for someone who doesn&#x27;t want to hold a heavy drier.</li>
            <li> I love having the hair dryer mounted. Easily accessible and looks nice. This is our second one in 10 years. The first one still worked, but wore out the clip to hold it in over years of use. Would recommend and buy again, good value.</li>
            <li> I love its compactness and the convenient night light feature.  These features definitely meet my needs.  I&#x27;d like to see Conair do away with the 1600 watt hair dryer and go with an 1800 watt unit instead.  I have very straight, short hair.  A 1600 watt hair dryer can&#x27;t give my hair the lift I&#x27;m used to, and it takes a few minutes longer to style because the air motion isn&#x27;t as strong nor hot enough.</li>
            <li> hotel style...great for rental property</li>
            <li> Very nice item. Great Delivery.  Thanks</li>
            <li> My old Conair burntout beacause I never cleaned it. It lasted for 12 years Ilove the sturdy construction and the continuous LED light.</li>
            <li> I needed a wall mount for space .  The unit is compact and easy to use.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love this...I had one on my wall before for a long time, until it just wouldn&#x27;t hang in the socket anymore, so I had to have another one.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Pros:  Saves room on the counter, compact size, HI setting is strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  It only lasted two years and one month.  Had to re-order one again today because we had already installed the metal panel on the wall and didn&#x27;t want to have to take it off and repaint and redo it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully this new one will come soon and last longer. We shall see...</li>
            <li> this is the same unit i had before...liked it then and i like it now...i would buy it again./...i did not take the back section off and i mounted this on the same spot.......</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for the one I have had for many years.</li>
            <li> Work great.  Have installed one in all bathrooms at both homes.</li>
            <li> Great addition to my home.</li>
            <li> good product, good price fast delivery exactly what I expected. would purchase from this seller again. built better than I had expected and well thought out. makes the age old problem of hair dryer storage and cord tangle fade away. looks good on the wall and has enough cord to mount just about anywhere in a normal bathroom.</li>
            <li> Works great, wife happy</li>
            <li> Bought two of them for our bathrooms, easy to install, fits flat with your flat wall or on tile, drill screws into grout part of your tile if your going to install in tile otherwise your tile may break.  Have had them for almost 6 months no problems at all!  Powerful!</li>
            <li> I really like the dryer but the install for drywall without studs inserts well didn&#x27;t use not very good quality purchased some to use instead</li>
            <li> This hair dryer arrived in good time and worked as advertised. My wife loves that it hangs on the wall in our bathroom. She finds it very convenient. Would not hesitate to deal with this company again.</li>
            <li> I am in hotel industry - I could buy thousands of these. Super cheap, very quiet, with a nice night light, barely use any electricity, great heat, simple to use, VERY comfortable in hand. I&#x27;ve never seen a guest use their own brought hair-dryer. they ALWAYS elect to use this - and it&#x27;s obviously installed very conveniently in the bathroom - good screws and installation instructions that come with it. Never falls off, always there when you need your hair fluffy.</li>
            <li> Arrived ahead of schedule, good price.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this hairdryer - it is smaller, quieter, hangs on the wall and I just plain LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> does not have the power to dry my hear in a short length of time.  this may be due to our power structure</li>
            <li> I had 2 originals of these hair dryers they worked great for years.  I still have one but one the other one broke I reordered this one must have cheaper parts it completely broke in 5 months</li>
            <li> This is the third time we have bought this dryer. The first one finally stopped working after 8 years. Bought another one and it continues to work. Bought a new home and we bought another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is really convenient to have the dryer hanging oon the wall, out of the way until you are ready to use it. Also has an LED night light which provides just enough light to see in the bathroom at night. Oh and it has lots of drying power.</li>
            <li> Nothing like a wall mount hair dryer for the bathroom.  Just like the hotels.  I had one and thought the guest bathroom needed one too</li>
            <li> This is my Conair dryer.  All of them lasted very well.  I just love that it hangs up out of the way in the bathroom.  Hope they never quit making them.</li>
            <li> We had one of these wallmount dryers at a condo we were renting while skiing.  My wife liked it enough that she bought 2 of these when we got home from our ski trip.  The mount on the wall is reasonable in size and the dryer works very well on my wife&#x27;s very thick hair.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer and it burned out in 1 month, dont bother. It will be a waist of money.</li>
            <li> Reasonable wall-mount dryer for the price. Easy to install.</li>
            <li> Perfect size, dries my hair fast.  I like the built-in nightlight.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still working after 3 years and I also like the automatic night light.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for the same unit we&#x27;d had for years.  Just a simple snap-in installation.  Great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> the dryer is small, compact and stores insight but out of the way.  i especially like the night light. Great product</li>
            <li> Good seller. I received the product on time and without problems. I recommend for all.</li>
            <li> Great dryer, convenient wall access</li>
            <li> Works and looks as discribed ! Great value looks great.THIS IS SILLY MAKING ME TYPE MORE WORDS BEFORE I CAN SUBMIT !</li>
            <li> These little hairdryers work very well for their size. I bought them to put up in my new beach house. They&#x27;re really convenient and super easy to use. Plus, my guests don&#x27;t have to remember to bring their own hairdryer. The little LED nightlight feature is pretty much useless as a night lite. Make the LED white and then you&#x27;ll have something that throws out enough light to  work as a nightlight. But that shouldn&#x27;t keep anyone from buying this product.</li>
