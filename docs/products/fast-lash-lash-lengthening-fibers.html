            <li>Someone told me to buy this and it would be amazing.  </li>
            <li>But, it is nice to have the opportunity to purchase it at Amazon</li>
            <li>I had eyelash extensions, but one day I couldn&#x27;t stand them and pulled them off with my own lashes.  </li>
            <li>Since my own lashes have grown back, but aren&#x27;t as nice as they used to be, this is a great tool for filling in and lengthening my own lashes.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I actually love this product.</li>
            <li>This product is basically fibers that adhere to the mascara on your lashes, then you apply another coat of mascara on top of the fibers.</li>
            <li>I love the way my eyelashes look with this on.</li>
            <li>Glad to see it on Amazon</li>
            <li>I Love this stuff, it makes my eyelashes look like falsies.  </li>
            <li>It is awesome, exactly as described and came super quick!</li>
            <li>I have more masquera on my shelf than CVS.  </li>
            <li>Dust Bunny in a tube is more like it.  </li>
            <li>My mom gave me some a while back, fell in love with this product!!!!!  </li>
            <li>It make the lashes look ok but nothing too fancy.</li>
            <li>Will be buying more.</li>
            <li>I have used another brand that I love</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>

            <li>FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>This is an interesting product.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product i dont have to apply tons of mascara</li>
            <li>Great product goes on easily and works very well.  </li>
            <li>It is easy  to use , and i am pleased with theresults.</li>
            <li>Also, most importantly, the fibers do not get in my eyes and yet (with makeup remover)</li>
            <li>When the wand is pulled out of the tube fuzzy particles fly everywhere like blowing old dandelions.&lt;br</li>
            <li>they are easily removed along with rest of eye makeup.</li>
            <li>Yeah, it thickened my lashes amazingly but it was so much hassle</li>
            <li>amazing how it works so fast...between fast lash and latisse</li>
            <li>I love this product and gave it as a gift with so much success can&#x27;t begin to describe.  </li>
            <li>Gives me beautiful long full lashes.  </li>
            <li>I had to do quite a bit of clean up after</li>
            <li>On one hand, it certainly does make a notable difference in the length and volume of your lashes.</li>
            <li>I love a dramatic look for my eyes and these do great!</li>
            <li>This was shipped to me fast, along with a free sample and a coupon!</li>
            <li>Good product overall.</li>
            <li>i just do a coat of mascara, a coat of fast lash, two more coats of mascara</li>
            <li>I use it with Maybelline colossal mascara for a perfect thick lash.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone that wants long beautiful lashes.</li>
            <li>FUN</li>
            <li>To me, its worth the effort.  </li>
            <li>Some reviews complain about much comes out, but you do get your moneys worth!</li>
            <li>I have used lash fibers in the past with great results.  </li>
            <li>As with all of we gurls, I listen to every lash commercial, every masquera ad hoping to find that magic potion to give me Liz Taylor&#x27;s lashes.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it not only lengthens, it fills in where you need your lashes to be thicker!</li>
            <li>i apply any mascara first then</li>
            <li>Add a nice black eyeliner (I like Smashbox jet</li>
            <li>I use this with a really gooey or wet mascara and it is quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>The consistency is of powdered dried foam, full of static.</li>
            <li>I used smart lash to grow them but that product does not work and stings your eyes</li>
            <li>My lashes are fine and short and this makes them pop.</li>
            <li>I already have decent lashes but this product enhances them SO MUCH!</li>
            <li>I just have to be more careful when putting it on because it flakes into my eyes if you get too much on the wand.</li>
            <li>So I bought  Fast Lash.  </li>
            <li>Add masquera, then sweep on Fast Lash and reaply masquera.  </li>
            <li>Anyone who needs a lash &amp;#34;boost&amp;#34; can count on Fast Lash.</li>
            <li>the fast lash then mascara</li>
            <li>Really I didn&#x27;t notice much difference in my lashes</li>
            <li>Did absolutely nothing for me except get in my eyes and burn.</li>
            <li>So when a new product comes along I&#x27;m the first in line(silly ninny that I am).  </li>
            <li>Removal of is fast and super easy with plain water.</li>
            <li>Using a nice wet mascara, it&#x27;s easy to create both length &amp; volume after a little practice applying the fibers to lashes.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product first a number of years ago (more than six) and since then, a few times.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I can highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>Like it a lot, does what it says it will,  but removing it is a little more work.  </li>
            <li>When you pull the wand from the tube it is so clotted with fibers that it really makes you think twice about putting it anywhere near your eye.</li>
            <li>but once you get the hang of how to apply it, its actually pretty simple.</li>
            <li>I am interested in purchasing this product to private label</li>
            <li>I had tried everywhere to replace my old one, to no avail.</li>
            <li>it really does give you lashes that are as big as falsies.</li>
            <li>use a gentle hand and follow up with regular mascara to set them.</li>
            <li>so i love the thick look</li>
            <li>works great but little fibers get in your eyes so not great for contact wearers.  </li>
            <li>it is not worth a  penny i have used other lash extenders but this is dry and most of the product ends up on the face and not the lashes!</li>
            <li>I was so confused after I initially opened fast lash because as I unscrewed the top off Started to see things floating around from the wind and noticed this wasn&#x27;t your normal and what I expected it to be primer!</li>
            <li>apply a coat of mascara, and while the mascara is still wet apply a gentle coat of the lengthening fibers.</li>
            <li>that it wasn&#x27;t worth the trouble.</li>
            <li>Huge waste of money!!Don&#x27;t buy !!</li>
            <li>This is far better than any false eyelashes or 100 coats of mascara!  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty messy putting on.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s true, so you have to be a little careful.</li>
            <li>I was never able to put on fake lashes so this is great to create that look.</li>

            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty messy putting on.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s true, so you have to be a little careful.</li>
            <li> I was never able to put on fake lashes so this is great to create that look.</li>
            <li> They look thick, long and full.  </li>
            <li> On the other, it&#x27;s kind of difficult to use as the fibers fall all over the place and can get rather clumpy with mascara.</li>
            <li> It is fair to say that it does in fact make lashes look a lot longer, but seriously people, don&#x27;t expect them to look like false lashes.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions, even got a new mascara that was wet enough to try and apply this dry flaky fibrous stuff to my lashes and ruined every time!</li>
            <li> What you get are big clumps of grey lashes that look like you been crawling around under the bed.  </li>
            <li> The product last for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for a daily look, but it can be fun if you&#x27;re going for a dramatic look.</li>
            <li> Makes you&#x27;re lashes EXTREMELY long.</li>
            <li> A considerable bit of the product is wasted in the application process, and the process is time</li>
            <li> then you can reapply fast lash depending on how thick you want...</li>
            <li> This product does not live up to its discription.</li>
            <li> One bottle can last a year, provided you seal it tight.  </li>
            <li> Does not deliver the results I expected</li>
            <li> These fibers are VERY loose.</li>
            <li> Must be careful when applying.</li>
            <li> you will experience the worst kind of torment, first with the actual pain and then having to fish it out of your poor, abused eye.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> so I can combine it with other orders.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the neck of the tube is a little tight, so when you pull out the wand, fibers can tend to fall off the wand.</li>
            <li> &quot; NOT COOL.</li>
            <li> It makes your lashes long and thick.</li>
            <li> A little goes a Lonnng way.</li>
            <li> and it looked quite messy</li>
            <li> Yes, I concede that it is messy</li>
            <li> I wasted my money on this product.</li>
            <li> , if i&#x27;m in a dark club, people won&#x27;t see how messy it is and just see how thick my lashes are.\\</li>
            <li> I purchased it in the past from the company that makes the product.  </li>
            <li> This was all dried out when I opened it!</li>
            <li> First I apply the base coat, then roll the fibers on, and finish with the mascara.</li>
            <li> This is EXTREMELY hard to apply.</li>
            <li> I know some reviewers complained about the fibers getting in their eyes.</li>
            <li> (I have and it hasn&#x27;t really bothered me, just annoying).</li>
            <li> not buy this ridiculous product, if it can even be called a product - it is a joke.</li>
            <li> I could see this product shedding if you use it with a weak mascara that sheds anyway.</li>
            <li> This makes your lashes plump up SOOO thick!  </li>
            <li> The tube is PACKED with fibers so pull it out very slowly.  </li>
            <li> It was flakey and not able to even use it!!</li>
            <li> It is like false lashes in a bottle.</li>
            <li> This gives me the look of fake eyelashes without having to try to apply them ( I so cannot apply false eyelashes!).</li>
            <li> Welp, I was wrong.</li>

            <li> This was shipped to me fast, along with a free sample and a coupon! I already have decent lashes but this product enhances them SO MUCH! It is like false lashes in a bottle. Be careful with the fibers when applying, just try not to get them directly in your eye (I have and it hasn&#x27;t really bothered me, just annoying). I am going to order again in the future.</li>
            <li> I combined this with NYX doll eye mascara. This is EXTREMELY hard to apply. When you pull the wand from the tube it is so clotted with fibers that it really makes you think twice about putting it anywhere near your eye. So i did as recommended and tried to tap off excess and then, (after applying a coat of mascara) I sort of patted it on my lashes (don&#x27;t try to stroke it on like mascara trust me it does not work) and then covered it with another coat of mascara. Yeah, it thickened my lashes amazingly but it was so much hassle and it looked quite messy that it wasn&#x27;t worth the trouble. I had to do quite a bit of clean up after (I took some tweezers and tried to remove the unwanted clumps of fibers) Also, if you get this product in your eyes (and you probably will as it tends to fall off the wand) you will experience the worst kind of torment, first with the actual pain and then having to fish it out of your poor, abused eye. Suffice to say when I had finally finished in appyling, and cleaning it up so it looked acceptable, my eyes were red and puffy. I found myself making excuses for it, \\&quot;Well, if i&#x27;m in a dark club, people won&#x27;t see how messy it is and just see how thick my lashes are.\\&quot; NOT COOL.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I purchased it in the past from the company that makes the product.  But, it is nice to have the opportunity to purchase it at Amazon so I can combine it with other orders.  This makes your lashes plump up SOOO thick!  I use it with Maybelline colossal mascara for a perfect thick lash.  Add a nice black eyeliner (I like Smashbox jet set waterproof eyeliner...which, oh look, you can buy on Amazon!) and your lashes look even fuller.  FUN</li>
            <li> I actually love this product. Yes, I concede that it is messy but once you get the hang of how to apply it, its actually pretty simple. This product is basically fibers that adhere to the mascara on your lashes, then you apply another coat of mascara on top of the fibers. This gives me the look of fake eyelashes without having to try to apply them ( I so cannot apply false eyelashes!). I love the way my eyelashes look with this on. My only problem is I cannot find this sold anymore at the stores I go to (got mine at Ulta but they no longer have it), therefore, I have been rationing mine. Glad to see it on Amazon and I will order another bottle soon!</li>
            <li> I Love this stuff, it makes my eyelashes look like falsies.  They look thick, long and full.  I use this with a really gooey or wet mascara and it is quick and easy.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It is awesome, exactly as described and came super quick!</li>
            <li> I thought this was discontinued so it was great to find it here.  This product takes practice and you sort of learn to sculpt your lashes.  I was never able to put on fake lashes so this is great to create that look.</li>
            <li> As with all of we gurls, I listen to every lash commercial, every masquera ad hoping to find that magic potion to give me Liz Taylor&#x27;s lashes. I have more masquera on my shelf than CVS.  So when a new product comes along I&#x27;m the first in line(silly ninny that I am).  So I bought  Fast Lash.  What I got for my expectations was a tube of belly-button lint to stick to my lashes.  Add masquera, then sweep on Fast Lash and reaply masquera.  What you get are big clumps of grey lashes that look like you been crawling around under the bed.  Dust Bunny in a tube is more like it.  dianefromcarroll@yahoo.com</li>
            <li> Does not deliver the results I expected</li>
            <li> I love this product, it not only lengthens, it fills in where you need your lashes to be thicker! My favorite makeup item!</li>
            <li> Tweezerman makes this product. I had tried everywhere to replace my old one, to no avail. My mistake----I didn&#x27;t come to amazon.com to find it soon enough!. Anyone who needs a lash &amp;#34;boost&amp;#34; can count on Fast Lash. Also, most importantly, the fibers do not get in my eyes and yet (with makeup remover) they are easily removed along with rest of eye makeup. nybeasutysecrets - Thank you!</li>
            <li> Love it!!!!!! It makes your lashes long and thick. My mom gave me some a while back, fell in love with this product!!!!!  I searcher and searched, till I found it again. A MUST IN  ANY MAKE-UP CASE!!!!!!</li>
            <li> works great but little fibers get in your eyes so not great for contact wearers.  Definitely would continue to use if not for that.</li>
            <li> This was all dried out when I opened it! It was flakey and not able to even use it!! Huge waste of money!!Don&#x27;t buy !!</li>
            <li> I would give it zero stars if I could.  I wasted my money on this product. The powder went into  my eye and caused an allergic reaction. It is almost impossible not to get the powder inside the eye. The consistency is of powdered dried foam, full of static. The powder flies all over your eyes and face when trying to apply. Terrible , Terrible product. This product should be removed from the market, it is a health hazard to the eyes.</li>
            <li> This stuff gets everywhere. In your hair, clothes, eye, everything!!! It make the lashes look ok but nothing too fancy.</li>
            <li> I love a dramatic look for my eyes and these do great! The fibers makes my lashes longer and fuller.</li>
            <li> I had eyelash extensions, but one day I couldn&#x27;t stand them and pulled them off with my own lashes.  Since my own lashes have grown back, but aren&#x27;t as nice as they used to be, this is a great tool for filling in and lengthening my own lashes.</li>
            <li> it is not worth a  penny i have used other lash extenders but this is dry and most of the product ends up on the face and not the lashes!</li>
            <li> These fibers are VERY loose. Must be careful when applying. Makes you&#x27;re lashes EXTREMELY long. Will be buying more.</li>
            <li> I have used another brand that I love but it is very expensive. This is 1/2 the price and works. I just have to be more careful when putting it on because it flakes into my eyes if you get too much on the wand.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 5 years. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years.  It is easy  to use , and i am pleased with theresults.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I saw a video on you tube that turned me onto this and the results are amazing. it really does give you lashes that are as big as falsies. to use-. apply a coat of mascara, and while the mascara is still wet apply a gentle coat of the lengthening fibers. a little goes a long way. use a gentle hand and follow up with regular mascara to set them. I recommend using this product with a good waterproof mascara that lasts all day. I could see this product shedding if you use it with a weak mascara that sheds anyway. I can highly recommend this product. it is like having fasle eyelashes without the discomfort of glue.</li>
            <li> It came on time. Product was perfect and I love it.  I would recommend this product to anyone that wants long beautiful lashes.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and love it it lasts longer than the name brands at sephora...it makes your lashes thicker and longer but more thicker ...i apply any mascara first then the fast lash then mascara then you can reapply fast lash depending on how thick you want...i have sparse lashes so i love the thick look I used smart lash to grow them but that product does not work and stings your eyes I now am using latisse and it does work costly but amazing how it works so fast...between fast lash and latisse i am in heaven....</li>
            <li> My lashes are fine and short and this makes them pop. I wouldn&#x27;t be without this product. FANTASTIC! APPLYING MASCARA OVER THIS MAKES THEM LONGER.</li>
            <li> I was so confused after I initially opened fast lash because as I unscrewed the top off Started to see things floating around from the wind and noticed this wasn&#x27;t your normal and what I expected it to be primer! I followed the instructions, even got a new mascara that was wet enough to try and apply this dry flaky fibrous stuff to my lashes and ruined every time!</li>
            <li> Someone told me to buy this and it would be amazing.  Really I didn&#x27;t notice much difference in my lashes and it&#x27;s pretty messy putting on.</li>
            <li> Love love love!!!! This product is amazing, it adds length and fullness to your eyelashes!! All of my friends have ordered it, and they love it as well!!</li>
            <li> Great product goes on easily and works very well.  My lashes are terrific.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> incredible product...love it</li>
            <li> I was a member of a beauty club 20+ years ago.  They sent me a product similar to this and I LOVED it.  For years I looked for it but never found it.  I ran across this one and tried it.  This is far better than any false eyelashes or 100 coats of mascara!  The tube is PACKED with fibers so pull it out very slowly.  Some reviews complain about much comes out, but you do get your moneys worth!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  Using a nice wet mascara, it&#x27;s easy to create both length &amp; volume after a little practice applying the fibers to lashes. The only complaint I have is that the neck of the tube is a little tight, so when you pull out the wand, fibers can tend to fall off the wand. I recommend placing a piece of paper under the tube as you pull the wand out in order to catch the falling fibers and return the fallen fibers to the tube once you&#x27;re done with the eyelash application.</li>
            <li> The fibers fly all over the place when removed from the container but effective in creating longer lashes.</li>
            <li> This is an interesting product. On one hand, it certainly does make a notable difference in the length and volume of your lashes. On the other, it&#x27;s kind of difficult to use as the fibers fall all over the place and can get rather clumpy with mascara. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for a daily look, but it can be fun if you&#x27;re going for a dramatic look.</li>
            <li> I know some reviewers complained about the fibers getting in their eyes. That&#x27;s true, so you have to be a little careful. But it does what it&#x27;s designed to do.</li>
            <li> I love this product and gave it as a gift with so much success can&#x27;t begin to describe.  Great product great price.</li>
            <li> Gives me beautiful long full lashes.  I just tap the wand a couple of times to remove the excess fibers. I use a 2 step mascara with tubes, even though not recommended. First I apply the base coat, then roll the fibers on, and finish with the mascara. on front and back of lashes to cover any white fiber. Removal of is fast and super easy with plain water. Love this!</li>
            <li> This product looked expired!</li>
            <li> I am interested in purchasing this product to private label</li>
            <li> Like it a lot, does what it says it will,  but removing it is a little more work.  Good product overall.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product first a number of years ago (more than six) and since then, a few times.  The product last for a very long time.  One bottle can last a year, provided you seal it tight.  A considerable bit of the product is wasted in the application process, and the process is time consuming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that as a lash lover... To me, its worth the effort.  It is fair to say that it does in fact make lashes look a lot longer, but seriously people, don&#x27;t expect them to look like false lashes.</li>
            <li> I tried this thinking it would actually give me longer lashes. Welp, I was wrong. Did absolutely nothing for me except get in my eyes and burn. This product does not live up to its discription. Wont purchase again.</li>
            <li> A little goes a Lonnng way. I absolutely LOVE this product i dont have to apply tons of mascara i just do a coat of mascara, a coat of fast lash, two more coats of mascara and I&#x27;m done. Better then fake lashes and fibre mascara all in one. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> This is the biggest scam I have ever seen.  I have used lash fibers in the past with great results.  When the wand is pulled out of the tube fuzzy particles fly everywhere like blowing old dandelions.&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy this ridiculous product, if it can even be called a product - it is a joke.</li>
