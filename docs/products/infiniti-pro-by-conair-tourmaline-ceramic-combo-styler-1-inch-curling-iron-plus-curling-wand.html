            <li>First and foremost, this did an excellent job at curling my hair.</li>
            <li>Love this curling iron!</li>
            <li>I love the two barrels, just twist to switch!  </li>
            <li>love that!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Both pieces are easy to use and work great.  </li>
            <li>Very excited to use this!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s working amazing, and inside the box there is a glove</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t wait to try on my own hair.</li>
            <li>The fingertip glove is also a nice freebie.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Both attachments attach nicely to the handle -- each one plugs into it with four metal prongs and then you screw it in place or release it via the screw-in ring on the handle.</li>
            <li>inch clip barrel holds hair nice and tight&lt;</li>
            <li>nice spiral curls or beachy waves&lt;br</li>
            <li>weight&lt;br /&gt;end of both barrels has nice plastic piece to hold on too&lt;</li>
            <li>quickly)&lt;br /&gt;end of both barrels has nice plastic piece to hold on too (can snag if you slide hair out instead of unwinding)</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used the curling iron much, but the wand gives great curls that hold all day!</li>
            <li>The barrels are very smoth, and leaves your hair shiny with perfect curls.</li>
            <li>The Infiniti Pro combo styler is a great system for quickly and consistently creating beautiful curls.</li>
            <li>The devices are easy to swap out, even if it warm.</li>
            <li>Love this curly iron.  </li>
            <li>Returned it and got the Babyliss nano Titanium and like it much better.</li>
            <li>Or, you may be perfectly satisfied with protecting just your thumb and two fingers in which case this will satisfy your needs.</li>
            <li>and you want to make sure they don&#x27;t accidentally touch a cooling curling</li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>however the more I use the curling wand the more I realize for my hair</li>
            <li>: This is a handsome, stylish-looking curling iron.</li>
            <li>You need a clip, like there is on the one-inch barrel, to be able to get the spiral curls they rave about on the package.</li>
            <li>You have to push the plus (+) sign on the top button, until your desired temperature is lit up.</li>
            <li>You have to push the plus (+) sign on the top button, until your desired temperature is lit up.</li>
            <li>So glad they included the 3 finger glove</li>
            <li>This item didn&#x27;t want to stay on my hand and was more cumbersome than anything</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am pleased with this styler.</li>
            <li>The curls were nice and smooth and did remove the frizz from my hair.</li>
            <li>with most curling wands (the wand attachment), there is no clamp, so you have to wrap the hair around with your fingers and hold the hair while it heats up.</li>
            <li>I have gone through many curling irons in my life, but I have never used a curling wand.</li>
            <li>I was highly satisfied with the curling iron barrel.</li>
            <li>styling wand is for my daughter&#x27;s usage - my hair works ok with it, but I&#x27;m just not a fan.</li>
            <li>I love the variety of ways this curling iron can be used.</li>
            <li>The tourmaline ceramic is a smooth surface that hair, even with product in it slides easily over (no sticking!).</li>
            <li>After watching Jill Duggar use one on tv I was able to use this one fine.</li>
            <li>Easy to use convertible curling irons.  </li>
            <li>It has a clean, non-stick finish that would probably even be able to handle hair coated with gel or hair spray.</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly, so you don&#x27;t have to hang around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So easy but wait till the barrel has cooled to switch.  </li>
            <li>Both of the barrels are coated with tourmaline ceramic, and the hair slides easily over it.  </li>
            <li>The attachments slide in relatively easily and fasten securely.</li>
            <li>Today it is a bit humid and my fine hair gets a bit frizzy</li>
            <li>The four temperatures that are available are 310, 330, 360, and 400.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>is cheap ...</li>
            <li>Part of it is a great, professional-grade styling instrument that works on all different kinds of hair.</li>
            <li>an important component.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pros-&lt;br /&gt;includes two smooth barrels (1 inch clip and clip less)&lt;br /&gt;easy to switch out barrels</li>
            <li>and my hair is already curly on its own, so it doesn&#x27;t need much help.</li>
            <li>so I have a tangle free experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was super easy to return.</li>
            <li>own a much older model of their curling iron</li>
            <li>I find that I get more use from the clipless barrel most days, but it&#x27;s nice to have the other available.</li>
            <li>I was pleased that the temperature on both barrels get super hot</li>
            <li>The curling iron slips right into the handle once you understand the positions required of the handle and the curling iron to easily slip on.</li>
            <li>I also really like that the cord attaches to the styler via a swivel which allows for more freedom of movement without it getting twisted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I think they could have sprung for a full glove.</li>
            <li>The wand part works a bit better, but doesn&#x27;t make very defined curls.</li>
            <li>Of course, you have to wait for the barrel to cool before swapping it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The one-inch curling iron has a good cool grip on the handle and tip that seem like they will last longer than those on cheaper curling irons.</li>
            <li>and I would have liked to have seen it included with this one since it&#x27;s nice to have when you have little ones running around the house</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it, it was fine.</li>
            <li>It heats up extremely quickly and provides plenty of heat for quick styling.</li>
            <li>I must admit that I was quick to judge</li>
            <li>I found the length to be adequate for my needs.</li>
            <li>While it took a little practice and help from the included finger protecting glove, I was left with the most beautiful curls!</li>
            <li>I tested the styler on each heat setting and found that the 330 degree setting was perfect for my thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two barrels: I love the versatility that this product offers with the two barrels.</li>
            <li>&quot; curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachments are good quality -- ceramic, heavy, with a heat free knob at the end to hold with your free hand.</li>
            <li>only surprise was the cheap look of the styler handle -- the silver heat bar looks like someone had a sticker set and put the shiniest one on, and the whole handle is made of the kind of cheap plastic</li>
            <li>The attachments are easy to pop on and off and it heats up really fast.</li>
            <li>The unit switches out really easy and heats up fast.</li>
            <li>The wand barrel, on the other hand, was amazing!</li>
            <li>The power cord swivel is built right, so it&#x27;s not going to get in the way or wear out quickly.</li>
            <li>My old school curling irons seemed much more substantial and weight, but the barrel on this feels like it has a nice solid grip to it.</li>
            <li>My daughter has long hair, and I tried the tapered barrel on her hair, and created some very interesting sausage curls.  </li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly and heats up to a high temperature which I like.</li>
            <li>When I saw this, I was excited about replacing/upgrading my old/non-working curling iron because my daughter really wanted me to curl her</li>
            <li>this product is solid in function and its light weight makes it easy to hold for extended periods and maneuver around one&#x27;s head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is great, because my hair doesn&#x27;t usually hold a curl that well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy enough to swap the curling tools out, but you do have to wait for them to cool before attempting to switch</li>
            <li>and she was able to curl her hair on the second lowest temperature setting,</li>
            <li>so I suppose this curling iron might have higher temperatures than the ones we have been using</li>
            <li>Infiniti product by Conair have been consistently products that work well with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&#x27;s look at the positives first</li>
            <li>Did exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to go over spots multiple times or wait for more than 10 seconds to achieve the wave/curl that I want.  </li>
            <li>The spring is good on the 1\\&quot; curler, and holds the hair in firmly while turning the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a nice curling combo set, but I prefer our other Conair curling irons.</li>
            <li>3 finger glove is ridiculous, irons themselves are great</li>
            <li>The swivel mounted cord is 5 feet long, which is more than sufficient for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She loves it and says it&#x27;s nice being able to switch the wands back and fourth for different looks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy enough to twist and switch the barrels.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, and I only need the lowest temperature setting.  </li>
            <li>Very versatile -- takes a while to learn how to use the wand.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t do much to my hair, ever.</li>
            <li>This is something my wife wanted and she told me that she really likes it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen what it&#x27;s capable of doing</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really need a glove</li>
            <li>I took the wand and just smoothed over the frizz not curling at all was fast and efficient.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really curl my hair-</li>
            <li>/&gt;This unit is really lightweight, but it seems sturdy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has 4 temperature settings, which I really like.  </li>
            <li>It heats up extremely fast.  </li>
            <li>With shoulder-length straight hair I like to create waves.</li>
            <li>I like the way I can experiment, rather fast, with looser or tighter curls.</li>
            <li>If you have thick, wiry or coarse hair, the one-inch barrel with this curling iron would be the ideal styling tool for you--particularly if you have hair that needs straightening.</li>
            <li>If you have thick, wiry or coarse hair, the one-inch barrel with this curling iron would be the ideal styling tool for you--particularly if you have hair that needs straightening.</li>
            <li>I have very thick hair, so the high temperature of the styler, along with the Tourmaline ceramic, helped create an attractive style without damaging my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m from the old school era and had never used a wand before but the learning curve was brief and I actually found the wand to be easier and more enjoyable to use than the traditional barrel.</li>
            <li>This curling iron/curling wand combo adds a nice bit of versatility that you don&#x27;t get with an ordinary curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I guess you typically use the first to fingers and thumb when curling but the others should be protected, too, as they can easily get in the way and get burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that it has both a traditional curling iron and the wand attachment because both perform differently.</li>
            <li>(our older ones have settings from 1-30</li>
            <li>We have them on our older curling irons</li>
            <li>The iron heats up quickly and has four different heat settings--from 320 to 400 degrees.</li>
            <li>This curling iron is a decent product.</li>
            <li>it heats up super fast, like a flat iron does, much faster than my old school curling irons with barrels and clips.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a 1\\&quot; styler with a bit of versatility that won&#x27;t break the bank, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I liked the idea of the special glove to prevent burns, but found maneuvering the hair with it on a little difficult ,so I mostly curled without it.</li>
            <li>The barrels are easy to install and remove; they simply slide in and lock with a simple twist of the locking ring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Note that the hear resistant fingertip glove included is only for the right handed.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Lightweight: My first impression of this styler was that it was likely a cheaply made product due to it being so lightweight.</li>
            <li>It keeps the hot iron from making contact with the counter and helps the device stay solidly in place without sliding or rolling.</li>
            <li>I usually use 400 on my flat iron but found that I could go to the 330 with this and get great results, probably because I curl hair that is smoother texture than the frizzy hair I straighten with my flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are gloves one can buy to prevent burns, but they are relatively easy to avoid once you have a few practice runs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is clearly built to last!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like that this offers you the ability to switch between a regular curling iron and a clipless barrel.</li>
            <li>My curls are soft and shinning.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although there is not anything worth criticizing about the appliance per se it is surprising that included is a useless, IMHO, three finger partial glove.</li>
            <li>Infiniti Pro by Conair Professional Nano Tourmaline Ceramic Curling Iron - 1\\&quot;]]</li>
            <li>and I was actually pleasantly surprised...</li>
            <li>For just a few pennies more this appliance could have done the same instead of this three finger cheapo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the plastic stand that sits behind the barrel and is not some flimsy wire you have to flip out of the way, as with most styling irons.</li>
            <li>I was able to rinse the barrel and stand it with the electrodes down on a wire rack to dry it off with no adverse affects, thank goodness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was able to rinse the barrel and stand it with the electrodes down on a wire rack to dry it off with no adverse affects, thank goodness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price point is decent for a styler that includes two ceramic barrels and multiple heat settings.</li>
            <li>No regrets</li>
            <li>Recently, I pulled out a 20 year old curling iron to curl my daughters hair</li>
            <li>As the old saw goes, &amp;#34;Different strokes for different folks&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame the manufacturer didn&#x27;t spend a few extra cents to include a full glove.</li>
            <li>They also have a tag attached to warn people not to let small children handle it, because the hot iron could burn them (UH-HUH!).</li>
            <li>I have thin fine hair.  </li>

            <li> So glad they included the 3 finger glove</li>
            <li> This item didn&#x27;t want to stay on my hand and was more cumbersome than anything</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I am pleased with this styler.</li>
            <li> The curls were nice and smooth and did remove the frizz from my hair.</li>
            <li> with most curling wands (the wand attachment), there is no clamp, so you have to wrap the hair around with your fingers and hold the hair while it heats up.</li>
            <li> I have gone through many curling irons in my life, but I have never used a curling wand.</li>
            <li> I was highly satisfied with the curling iron barrel.</li>
            <li> styling wand is for my daughter&#x27;s usage - my hair works ok with it, but I&#x27;m just not a fan.</li>
            <li> I love the variety of ways this curling iron can be used.</li>
            <li> The tourmaline ceramic is a smooth surface that hair, even with product in it slides easily over (no sticking!).</li>
            <li> After watching Jill Duggar use one on tv I was able to use this one fine.</li>
            <li> Easy to use convertible curling irons.  </li>
            <li> It has a clean, non-stick finish that would probably even be able to handle hair coated with gel or hair spray.</li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly, so you don&#x27;t have to hang around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So easy but wait till the barrel has cooled to switch.  </li>
            <li> Both of the barrels are coated with tourmaline ceramic, and the hair slides easily over it.  </li>
            <li> The attachments slide in relatively easily and fasten securely.</li>
            <li> Today it is a bit humid and my fine hair gets a bit frizzy</li>
            <li> The four temperatures that are available are 310, 330, 360, and 400.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> is cheap ...</li>
            <li> Part of it is a great, professional-grade styling instrument that works on all different kinds of hair.</li>
            <li> an important component.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pros-&lt;br /&gt;includes two smooth barrels (1 inch clip and clip less)&lt;br /&gt;easy to switch out barrels</li>
            <li> and my hair is already curly on its own, so it doesn&#x27;t need much help.</li>
            <li> so I have a tangle free experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was super easy to return.</li>
            <li> own a much older model of their curling iron</li>
            <li> I find that I get more use from the clipless barrel most days, but it&#x27;s nice to have the other available.</li>
            <li> I was pleased that the temperature on both barrels get super hot</li>
            <li> The curling iron slips right into the handle once you understand the positions required of the handle and the curling iron to easily slip on.</li>
            <li> I also really like that the cord attaches to the styler via a swivel which allows for more freedom of movement without it getting twisted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I think they could have sprung for a full glove.</li>
            <li> The wand part works a bit better, but doesn&#x27;t make very defined curls.</li>
            <li> Of course, you have to wait for the barrel to cool before swapping it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The one-inch curling iron has a good cool grip on the handle and tip that seem like they will last longer than those on cheaper curling irons.</li>
            <li> and I would have liked to have seen it included with this one since it&#x27;s nice to have when you have little ones running around the house</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it, it was fine.</li>
            <li> It heats up extremely quickly and provides plenty of heat for quick styling.</li>
            <li> I must admit that I was quick to judge</li>
            <li> I found the length to be adequate for my needs.</li>
            <li> While it took a little practice and help from the included finger protecting glove, I was left with the most beautiful curls!</li>
            <li> I tested the styler on each heat setting and found that the 330 degree setting was perfect for my thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two barrels: I love the versatility that this product offers with the two barrels.</li>
            <li> &quot; curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachments are good quality -- ceramic, heavy, with a heat free knob at the end to hold with your free hand.</li>
            <li> only surprise was the cheap look of the styler handle -- the silver heat bar looks like someone had a sticker set and put the shiniest one on, and the whole handle is made of the kind of cheap plastic</li>
            <li> The attachments are easy to pop on and off and it heats up really fast.</li>
            <li> The unit switches out really easy and heats up fast.</li>
            <li> The wand barrel, on the other hand, was amazing!</li>
            <li> The power cord swivel is built right, so it&#x27;s not going to get in the way or wear out quickly.</li>
            <li> My old school curling irons seemed much more substantial and weight, but the barrel on this feels like it has a nice solid grip to it.</li>
            <li> My daughter has long hair, and I tried the tapered barrel on her hair, and created some very interesting sausage curls.  </li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly and heats up to a high temperature which I like.</li>
            <li> When I saw this, I was excited about replacing/upgrading my old/non-working curling iron because my daughter really wanted me to curl her</li>
            <li> this product is solid in function and its light weight makes it easy to hold for extended periods and maneuver around one&#x27;s head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is great, because my hair doesn&#x27;t usually hold a curl that well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy enough to swap the curling tools out, but you do have to wait for them to cool before attempting to switch</li>
            <li> and she was able to curl her hair on the second lowest temperature setting,</li>
            <li> so I suppose this curling iron might have higher temperatures than the ones we have been using</li>
            <li> Infiniti product by Conair have been consistently products that work well with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &#x27;s look at the positives first</li>
            <li> Did exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to go over spots multiple times or wait for more than 10 seconds to achieve the wave/curl that I want.  </li>
            <li> The spring is good on the 1\\&quot; curler, and holds the hair in firmly while turning the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a nice curling combo set, but I prefer our other Conair curling irons.</li>
            <li> 3 finger glove is ridiculous, irons themselves are great</li>
            <li> The swivel mounted cord is 5 feet long, which is more than sufficient for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She loves it and says it&#x27;s nice being able to switch the wands back and fourth for different looks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy enough to twist and switch the barrels.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, and I only need the lowest temperature setting.  </li>
            <li> Very versatile -- takes a while to learn how to use the wand.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do much to my hair, ever.</li>
            <li> This is something my wife wanted and she told me that she really likes it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen what it&#x27;s capable of doing</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really need a glove</li>
            <li> I took the wand and just smoothed over the frizz not curling at all was fast and efficient.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really curl my hair-</li>
            <li> /&gt;This unit is really lightweight, but it seems sturdy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has 4 temperature settings, which I really like.  </li>
            <li> It heats up extremely fast.  </li>
            <li> With shoulder-length straight hair I like to create waves.</li>
            <li> I like the way I can experiment, rather fast, with looser or tighter curls.</li>
            <li> If you have thick, wiry or coarse hair, the one-inch barrel with this curling iron would be the ideal styling tool for you--particularly if you have hair that needs straightening.</li>
            <li> If you have thick, wiry or coarse hair, the one-inch barrel with this curling iron would be the ideal styling tool for you--particularly if you have hair that needs straightening.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair, so the high temperature of the styler, along with the Tourmaline ceramic, helped create an attractive style without damaging my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m from the old school era and had never used a wand before but the learning curve was brief and I actually found the wand to be easier and more enjoyable to use than the traditional barrel.</li>
            <li> This curling iron/curling wand combo adds a nice bit of versatility that you don&#x27;t get with an ordinary curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I guess you typically use the first to fingers and thumb when curling but the others should be protected, too, as they can easily get in the way and get burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that it has both a traditional curling iron and the wand attachment because both perform differently.</li>
            <li> (our older ones have settings from 1-30</li>
            <li> We have them on our older curling irons</li>
            <li> The iron heats up quickly and has four different heat settings--from 320 to 400 degrees.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is a decent product.</li>
            <li> it heats up super fast, like a flat iron does, much faster than my old school curling irons with barrels and clips.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a 1\\&quot; styler with a bit of versatility that won&#x27;t break the bank, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of the special glove to prevent burns, but found maneuvering the hair with it on a little difficult ,so I mostly curled without it.</li>
            <li> The barrels are easy to install and remove; they simply slide in and lock with a simple twist of the locking ring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Note that the hear resistant fingertip glove included is only for the right handed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Lightweight: My first impression of this styler was that it was likely a cheaply made product due to it being so lightweight.</li>
            <li> It keeps the hot iron from making contact with the counter and helps the device stay solidly in place without sliding or rolling.</li>
            <li> I usually use 400 on my flat iron but found that I could go to the 330 with this and get great results, probably because I curl hair that is smoother texture than the frizzy hair I straighten with my flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are gloves one can buy to prevent burns, but they are relatively easy to avoid once you have a few practice runs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is clearly built to last!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like that this offers you the ability to switch between a regular curling iron and a clipless barrel.</li>
            <li> My curls are soft and shinning.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although there is not anything worth criticizing about the appliance per se it is surprising that included is a useless, IMHO, three finger partial glove.</li>
            <li> Infiniti Pro by Conair Professional Nano Tourmaline Ceramic Curling Iron - 1\\&quot;]]</li>
            <li> and I was actually pleasantly surprised...</li>
            <li> For just a few pennies more this appliance could have done the same instead of this three finger cheapo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like the plastic stand that sits behind the barrel and is not some flimsy wire you have to flip out of the way, as with most styling irons.</li>
            <li> I was able to rinse the barrel and stand it with the electrodes down on a wire rack to dry it off with no adverse affects, thank goodness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> The price point is decent for a styler that includes two ceramic barrels and multiple heat settings.</li>
            <li> No regrets</li>
            <li> Recently, I pulled out a 20 year old curling iron to curl my daughters hair</li>
            <li> As the old saw goes, &amp;#34;Different strokes for different folks&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame the manufacturer didn&#x27;t spend a few extra cents to include a full glove.</li>
            <li> They also have a tag attached to warn people not to let small children handle it, because the hot iron could burn them (UH-HUH!).</li>
            <li> I have thin fine hair.  </li>
            <li> Was a little weird to get used to switching them out, but once I did it, it seemed pretty easy.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s really no need for it or the three-finger mitt, in my opinion.e a tag attached to warn people not to let small children handle it, because the hot iron could burn them (UH-HUH!).</li>
            <li> Finally, I unplugged it, and when I pulled this time, the barrel went flying across the room into the toilet</li>
            <li> Finally, I unplugged it, and when I pulled this time, the barrel went flying across the room into the toilet</li>
            <li> but won&#x27;t last long --</li>
            <li> The hot pink, black, silver and gun-metal gray look sharp together.</li>
            <li> My one daughter has hair that ordinarily needs one of the highest settings on an older Conair curling iron</li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive about buying a 2-in 1 item but this is clearly a winner.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have noted, the 3 finger glove is really kind of silly - why not a full glove?</li>
            <li> The glove was difficult for me to keep on my hand since it only has 3 fingers, and I quickly gave up on it.  </li>
            <li> Now I have short hair and the curler does not fit the smaller barrel that it comes with.</li>
            <li> The attachment with the clamp only curls the bottom half (and not very well at that), and it leaves a definite kink where the clamp closes.</li>
            <li> One attachment is a curling wand that narrows down to the tip, and the second one has a clamp and makes 1\\</li>
            <li> They dedicate an entire page of the users&#x27; booklet to tell you not to use the curling iron in or near water--even when it is off, but plugged in (DUH!).</li>
            <li> Put down the lid of the toilet when using this device!).</li>
            <li> Put down the lid of the toilet when using this device!).</li>
            <li> This useless item fits over the thumb, index finger and the finger that evaluates the worth of this item.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s really no need for it or the three-finger mitt, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s certainly not the shortest either.</li>
            <li> Other hair appliances that my wife has include a glove that protects all of her fingers.</li>
            <li> I can use the wand, and my hair will stay curled for 2-3 days after (Other irons, I have to touch up every day or wash my hair and start over each day).  </li>
            <li> You are provided a three-finger heat glove with the curling iron, but it only lets you push a small section of hair against the iron.</li>
            <li> The other oddity (probably a safety feature) is that you cannot change barrels when the device is plugged in.</li>
            <li> I tried and tried to get the one barrel out to put in the other, but it wouldn&#x27;t budge.</li>

            <li> I tried a wand a few years ago but just couldn&#x27;t  master it.</li>
            <li> A few highlights to this system:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Will update after a few months to report on its wearability over time.</li>

            <li> Easy to use convertible curling irons.  The variety of curls you can make is good. The barrels are a little small for medium or longer length hair.  Note that the hear resistant fingertip glove included is only for the right handed.  There is no heat protection if you try to flip it to use on the left hand.</li>
            <li> Very versatile -- takes a while to learn how to use the wand.</li>
            <li> The fact is that it was expanses then Sally</li>
            <li> Got it thinking it would be a great curler. I don&#x27;t do much to my hair, ever. The first time I tried it, it was fine. That was months ago. Now I have short hair and the curler does not fit the smaller barrel that it comes with. The product did not let me change the barrels. The smaller barrel would not lock in. It was a manufacturing error. I think that I broke it trying to get it to get in there and lock. The metal posts bent, so I used my bed post to unbend them. But I gave up. I tried putting the larger barrel back in and it would not lock in. Very poorly made product. It&#x27;s now in my garbage can.</li>
            <li> Love this curly iron.  My curls are soft and shinning.</li>
            <li> I like the curling irons but the partial glove is a terrible idea and a complete waste.</li>
            <li> This is something my wife wanted and she told me that she really likes it.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is great! I have perfect curls, no frizz, and the iron heats up very fast.</li>
            <li> Loved it. Worked great.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product at all - might just be my hair but the curls where way too tight. Returned it and got the Babyliss nano Titanium and like it much better. It was super easy to return.</li>
            <li> 3 finger glove is ridiculous, irons themselves are great</li>
            <li> Very excited to use this! I&#x27;ve seen what it&#x27;s capable of doing and I can&#x27;t wait to try on my own hair. No regrets</li>

            <li> My wife likes the curling iron feature to use with her fairly short hair. The curling iron slips right into the handle once you understand the positions required of the handle and the curling iron to easily slip on. Same goes for the wand. They can be locked into place by turning the collar on the handle. Along with the power button the four temperature setting are displayed on the handle. The four temperatures that are available are 310, 330, 360, and 400.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although there is not anything worth criticizing about the appliance per se it is surprising that included is a useless, IMHO, three finger partial glove. This useless item fits over the thumb, index finger and the finger that evaluates the worth of this item.That is the reason for the deduction of one star.  Other hair appliances that my wife has include a glove that protects all of her fingers. For just a few pennies more this appliance could have done the same instead of this three finger cheapo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you purchase this appliance you may want to consider the purchase of a glove as well depending, of course, on how you would plan to use this item. Or, you may be perfectly satisfied with protecting just your thumb and two fingers in which case this will satisfy your needs. As the old saw goes, &amp;#34;Different strokes for different folks&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This curling iron/curling wand combo adds a nice bit of versatility that you don&#x27;t get with an ordinary curling iron.  It&#x27;s easy enough to swap the curling tools out, but you do have to wait for them to cool before attempting to switch (I would assume that&#x27;s obvious, but you never know with some people.)  The curling iron has four temperature settings.  My one daughter has hair that ordinarily needs one of the highest settings on an older Conair curling iron and she was able to curl her hair on the second lowest temperature setting, so I suppose this curling iron might have higher temperatures than the ones we have been using (our older ones have settings from 1-30 so I have no idea what the actual temperature is for those).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set comes with a 3 finger heat resistant glove.  My daughter pointed out that it can only be worn on the left hand.  So if you&#x27;re left handed or curl your hair left handed, this bonus item isn&#x27;t going to work for you.  I attempted to turn it inside out so my daughter could use it, but the material was too stiff and it wouldn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish this set came with a protective sleeve for the curling iron.  We have them on our older curling irons and I would have liked to have seen it included with this one since it&#x27;s nice to have when you have little ones running around the house and you want to make sure they don&#x27;t accidentally touch a cooling curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a nice curling combo set, but I prefer our other Conair curling irons.</li>
            <li> I love this.  Both pieces are easy to use and work great.  I can use the wand, and my hair will stay curled for 2-3 days after (Other irons, I have to touch up every day or wash my hair and start over each day).  This is great, because my hair doesn&#x27;t usually hold a curl that well.</li>
            <li> I have thin fine hair.  It is hair&lt;br /&gt;d to find products that give a lasting curl.  Infiniti product by Conair have been consistently products that work well with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item heats quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The three finger \\&quot;glove\\&quot; that comes with it for use with the curling wand is cheap ... it works yes but won&#x27;t last long -- however the more I use the curling wand the more I realize for my hair I don&#x27;t really need a glove&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own a much older model of their curling iron ([[ASIN:B000F5CDP0 Infiniti Pro by Conair Professional Nano Tourmaline Ceramic Curling Iron - 1\\&quot;]]) If you just need a curling iron this is a great choice.</li>
            <li> For years, Conair has been a leader in hair-styling products. However, I have mixed feelings about this curling iron. Part of it is a great, professional-grade styling instrument that works on all different kinds of hair. But the other half is unusable, because it is missing an important component.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s look at the positives first: This is a handsome, stylish-looking curling iron. It has a clean, non-stick finish that would probably even be able to handle hair coated with gel or hair spray. The hot pink, black, silver and gun-metal gray look sharp together. The one-inch curling iron has a good cool grip on the handle and tip that seem like they will last longer than those on cheaper curling irons. I really like the plastic stand that sits behind the barrel and is not some flimsy wire you have to flip out of the way, as with most styling irons. It keeps the hot iron from making contact with the counter and helps the device stay solidly in place without sliding or rolling. The attachments slide in relatively easily and fasten securely. The iron heats up quickly and has four different heat settings--from 320 to 400 degrees. The power cord swivel is built right, so it&#x27;s not going to get in the way or wear out quickly. This product is clearly built to last!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like is that the smaller barrel has nothing to hold your hair in place. You are provided a three-finger heat glove with the curling iron, but it only lets you push a small section of hair against the iron. You need a clip, like there is on the one-inch barrel, to be able to get the spiral curls they rave about on the package. This makes that attachment virtually useless, as far as I am concerned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are also some idiosyncrasies about the device that are NOT explained in the minimal instructions provided. They dedicate an entire page of the users&#x27; booklet to tell you not to use the curling iron in or near water--even when it is off, but plugged in (DUH!). They also have a tag attached to warn people not to let small children handle it, because the hot iron could burn them (UH-HUH!). However, they do not bother to inform you that the curling iron will not come on automatically, when you plug it in and turn on the power. You have to push the plus (+) sign on the top button, until your desired temperature is lit up. Then it heats up super-fast. The other oddity (probably a safety feature) is that you cannot change barrels when the device is plugged in. I turned it off, but it was still attached to the electrical socket. I tried and tried to get the one barrel out to put in the other, but it wouldn&#x27;t budge. Finally, I unplugged it, and when I pulled this time, the barrel went flying across the room into the toilet (NOTE TO SELF: Put down the lid of the toilet when using this device!). I was able to rinse the barrel and stand it with the electrodes down on a wire rack to dry it off with no adverse affects, thank goodness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When trying this out, we only used the lowest setting, as the hair we were styling was thick, but baby-fine. The hotter settings would be ideal for coarser, thicker hair. If you have thick, wiry or coarse hair, the one-inch barrel with this curling iron would be the ideal styling tool for you--particularly if you have hair that needs straightening. If you can get a model like this without the superfluous skinnier attachment, I would recommend it. There&#x27;s really no need for it or the three-finger mitt, in my opinion.e a tag attached to warn people not to let small children handle it, because the hot iron could burn them (UH-HUH!).

            <li> This product is working well.</li>
            <li> I like the 2 in one set. I tried a wand a few years ago but just couldn&#x27;t  master it. After watching Jill Duggar use one on tv I was able to use this one fine. So glad they included the 3 finger glove so I don&#x27;t burn my hand. The unit switches out really easy and heats up fast. I have sholulder length hair si both work for me. Today it is a bit humid and my fine hair gets a bit frizzy si I took the wand and just smoothed over the frizz not curling at all was fast and efficient. Very pleased with product.</li>
            <li> The Infiniti Pro combo styler is a great system for quickly and consistently creating beautiful curls. This system comes with two barrels: one traditional style curling barrel that is 1\\&quot; in diameter and a tapered curling wand that spans from 1/2\\&quot; to 1\\&quot; in diameter. I&#x27;m from the old school era and had never used a wand before but the learning curve was brief and I actually found the wand to be easier and more enjoyable to use than the traditional barrel. The tourmaline ceramic is a smooth surface that hair, even with product in it slides easily over (no sticking!). A few highlights to this system:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heat: This styler has four temperature settings: 310, 330, 360, 400 degrees. It heats up extremely quickly and provides plenty of heat for quick styling. I tested the styler on each heat setting and found that the 330 degree setting was perfect for my thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two barrels: I love the versatility that this product offers with the two barrels. The barrels are easy to install and remove; they simply slide in and lock with a simple twist of the locking ring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight: My first impression of this styler was that it was likely a cheaply made product due to it being so lightweight. I must admit that I was quick to judge and I was actually pleasantly surprised... this product is solid in function and its light weight makes it easy to hold for extended periods and maneuver around one&#x27;s head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cord: This styler&#x27;s cord is 5 feet in length. It&#x27;s not the longest cord I have ever seen on a curling iron but it&#x27;s certainly not the shortest either. I found the length to be adequate for my needs. I also really like that the cord attaches to the styler via a swivel which allows for more freedom of movement without it getting twisted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One small \\&quot;gripe\\&quot;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included \\&quot;heat protective\\&quot; glove: I actually laughed when I saw this. I suppose you can call it a glove but it only covers your thumb, index and middle fingers. I understand the intention but I think they could have sprung for a full glove. This item didn&#x27;t want to stay on my hand and was more cumbersome than anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am pleased with this styler. The price point is decent for a styler that includes two ceramic barrels and multiple heat settings. It performs well and despite being lightweight, it feels solidly built. If you&#x27;re looking for a 1\\&quot; styler with a bit of versatility that won&#x27;t break the bank, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is a decent product. It heats up very quickly and heats up to a high temperature which I like. I have medium length hair and I felt that the 1&amp;#34; barrel is just too small for the size of curl I was looking for. The size might work great for shorter hair or for someone looking for a tighter curl. The curls were nice and smooth and did remove the frizz from my hair.</li>
            <li> First and foremost, this did an excellent job at curling my hair. It heats up very quickly, so you don&#x27;t have to hang around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both attachments attach nicely to the handle -- each one plugs into it with four metal prongs and then you screw it in place or release it via the screw-in ring on the handle. One attachment is a curling wand that narrows down to the tip, and the second one has a clamp and makes 1\\&quot; curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachments are good quality -- ceramic, heavy, with a heat free knob at the end to hold with your free hand. The spring is good on the 1\\&quot; curler, and holds the hair in firmly while turning the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only surprise was the cheap look of the styler handle -- the silver heat bar looks like someone had a sticker set and put the shiniest one on, and the whole handle is made of the kind of cheap plastic I see on mass-produced toys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with most curling wands (the wand attachment), there is no clamp, so you have to wrap the hair around with your fingers and hold the hair while it heats up. There are gloves one can buy to prevent burns, but they are relatively easy to avoid once you have a few practice runs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you just care about your hair getting curled, I recommend this. If you&#x27;re giving it as a present or care about how it looks, I would choose something else.</li>
            <li> I have gone through many curling irons in my life, but I have never used a curling wand. With the Infiniti Pro by Conair I get the best of both worlds. I was highly satisfied with the curling iron barrel. It worked as well as one should expect. The wand barrel, on the other hand, was amazing! While it took a little practice and help from the included finger protecting glove, I was left with the most beautiful curls! I have very thick hair, so the high temperature of the styler, along with the Tourmaline ceramic, helped create an attractive style without damaging my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this combo styler!</li>
            <li> Pros-&lt;br /&gt;includes two smooth barrels (1 inch clip and clip less)&lt;br /&gt;easy to switch out barrels&lt;br /&gt;1 inch clip barrel holds hair nice and tight&lt;br /&gt;multiple heat settings&lt;br /&gt;produces nice spiral curls or beachy waves&lt;br /&gt;light weight&lt;br /&gt;end of both barrels has nice plastic piece to hold on too&lt;br /&gt;good value for what your getting&lt;br /&gt;sits off counter to prevent table burn&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons-&lt;br /&gt;no heat protection glove for the clip less barrel (this would have been especially helpful if you need to change barrels quickly)&lt;br /&gt;end of both barrels has nice plastic piece to hold on too (can snag if you slide hair out instead of unwinding)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really curl my hair- and my hair is already curly on its own, so it doesn&#x27;t need much help. The attachment with the clamp only curls the bottom half (and not very well at that), and it leaves a definite kink where the clamp closes. The wand part works a bit better, but doesn&#x27;t make very defined curls.</li>
            <li> Great product! Delivered on time.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s working amazing, and inside the box there is a glove</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used the curling iron much, but the wand gives great curls that hold all day!</li>
            <li> This is just what I was looking for. The barrels are very smoth, and leaves your hair shiny with perfect curls. I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Love it!! Did exactly what I needed. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive about buying a 2-in 1 item but this is clearly a winner. I wanted to see a side-by-side comparison of the curl with both a regular curling iron with a clip vs a wand. I actually use both depending on the look that I want. The devices are easy to swap out, even if it warm. I was pleased that the temperature on both barrels get super hot so I don&#x27;t have to go over spots multiple times or wait for more than 10 seconds to achieve the wave/curl that I want.  Although the description doesn&#x27;t state so, there is a swivel cord so I have a tangle free experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product if you use both a wand and traditional curling iron. Plus it saves on drawer space!</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron! it heats up super fast, like a flat iron does, much faster than my old school curling irons with barrels and clips.  The four heat settings are great, too. I usually use 400 on my flat iron but found that I could go to the 330 with this and get great results, probably because I curl hair that is smoother texture than the frizzy hair I straighten with my flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The styling wand is for my daughter&#x27;s usage - my hair works ok with it, but I&#x27;m just not a fan. It&#x27;s easy enough to twist and switch the barrels. As other reviewers have noted, the 3 finger glove is really kind of silly - why not a full glove? I guess you typically use the first to fingers and thumb when curling but the others should be protected, too, as they can easily get in the way and get burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit is really lightweight, but it seems sturdy. My old school curling irons seemed much more substantial and weight, but the barrel on this feels like it has a nice solid grip to it. Will update after a few months to report on its wearability over time.</li>
            <li> I love the two barrels, just twist to switch!  So easy but wait till the barrel has cooled to switch.  There are 4 temperature settings up to 400, but 330 worked well for me.  The unit is lightweight but well made and has a 5&#x27; foot cord...love that!  The only item I question is the 3 finger heat resistant glove....I guess it doesn&#x27;t matter if the other 2 fingers get burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my sis. She loves it and says it&#x27;s nice being able to switch the wands back and fourth for different looks.</li>
            <li> Love it! Works great!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this Infiniti Pro by Conair Tourmaline Ceramic Combo Styler.  It includes both a traditional 1 inch curling barrel, plus a swappable barrel that tapers from 1/2 inch to 1 inch in diameter.  Of course, you have to wait for the barrel to cool before swapping it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has 4 temperature settings, which I really like.  My hair is fine, and I only need the lowest temperature setting.  It heats up extremely fast.  My hair is short, and I use the traditional barrel.  My daughter has long hair, and I tried the tapered barrel on her hair, and created some very interesting sausage curls.  Both of the barrels are coated with tourmaline ceramic, and the hair slides easily over it.  The swivel mounted cord is 5 feet long, which is more than sufficient for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set includes a heat resistant glove.  However, it only has 3 fingers and can only be worn on the left hand.  If you&#x27;re a left handed person, you&#x27;re out of luck.  The glove was difficult for me to keep on my hand since it only has 3 fingers, and I quickly gave up on it.  It&#x27;s a shame the manufacturer didn&#x27;t spend a few extra cents to include a full glove.</li>
            <li> I love the variety of ways this curling iron can be used. With shoulder-length straight hair I like to create waves. A woman friend from overseas stayed here and experimented with creating curls for her short hair. We both like the results. As promised it does heart up within 30 seconds so it is faster than me:-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because  the two barrels are ceramic, they can reduce frizz. I like the way I can experiment, rather fast, with looser or tighter curls.</li>
            <li> I really like that this offers you the ability to switch between a regular curling iron and a clipless barrel. I find that I get more use from the clipless barrel most days, but it&#x27;s nice to have the other available. Was a little weird to get used to switching them out, but once I did it, it seemed pretty easy. Good bargain and nice to have two products in one.</li>
