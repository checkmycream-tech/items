            <li>it true to the picture.</li>
            <li>It is bright hot pink without being neon and has a lovely semi-matte finish.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m light complected with olive skin and this pink has a blue undertone that is perfect on me.</li>
            <li>If you want it more shiny add a clear gloss over it.</li>
            <li>Worth the money</li>
            <li>Applies thickly into an ultra bright, striking finish.</li>
            <li>I purchased 8 limecrime lipsticks in total and so far I&#x27;m loving every last one low sheen and its the best 18 dollars</li>
            <li>It has a slight vanilla smell that is really pleasant.</li>
            <li>Its such a beautiful pink and it stays.</li>
            <li>It will nicely compliment all spring outfits with a splash of pink.</li>
            <li>.it is not the first time i order lipsticks i order before</li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t get it off!</li>
            <li>I absolutely  adore this shade from lime crime!</li>
            <li>This creamy lipstick is the perfect shade of pink for any age, you can wear it anywhere without looking like you rummaged through a little girls Barbie makeup set.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s pretty unusual for a lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a bright pink lipstick with blue based tones then this color is for you!</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t drying at all and wears really well.</li>

            <li>lipstick has a blue undertone which means this would look fabulous on any skin tone weather</li>
            <li>But I really, really wanted this color.</li>
            <li>but so far I&#x27;ve bought three different colors and love all three colors.</li>
            <li>It also works as a lipstain, so as it wears off it leaves your lips a vibrant fuchsia.</li>
            <li>a colour people would normally wear (I wore it on halloween as Nicki Minaj)</li>
            <li>I gave it four stars only because the price is a little steep, but the overall product is simply adorable!</li>
            <li>This pink lipstick was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>so I feel quite shy when wearing a bright fun pink.</li>
            <li>but even though I&#x27;m near geriatric</li>
            <li>I have a baby face that makes me look 15-16 years old</li>
            <li>but this lipstick melted completely</li>
            <li>It arrived early and was as advertised.  </li>
            <li>let me start by saying that i live in the middle east</li>
            <li>Now i want the pale pink because i love this brand</li>
            <li>It is vibrant and a pink that you will definitely notice.</li>

            <li> I have a baby face that makes me look 15-16 years old</li>
            <li> but this lipstick melted completely</li>
            <li> It arrived early and was as advertised.  </li>
            <li> let me start by saying that i live in the middle east</li>
            <li> Now i want the pale pink because i love this brand</li>
            <li> It is vibrant and a pink that you will definitely notice.</li>
            <li> It even stains your lips so it hardly comes off, even after rubbing with a tissue, which is what I did as I wanted to try it on right away, then had to run off to the office and</li>
            <li> Apply a lip gloss as this does not dry for a long time and you may stain you cloths.</li>
            <li> It is hard having extremely light skin with naturally dark burnt red lips because makeup looks too painted on me when clashed with my paleness</li>
            <li> It has a slight vanilla sweet smell, but it is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I wanted a lipstick that was long lasting and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Because its not as Matte as that and with its blue based undertones Dark skin divas can definitely rock this with no problem!</li>
            <li> Lipstick smells bad, good color, but it came half melted..</li>
            <li> formula is creamy and won&#x27;t dry out your lips.&lt;br /&gt;Without eating &amp; drinking</li>
            <li> I found this lipstick not as moisture as I thought it would be..to me it was dry on my lips</li>
            <li> I often have dry lips, that no amount of water or chapstick can cure.</li>
            <li> stays on all day, and doesn&#x27;t dry out your lips!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ever spent</li>
            <li> I used to be a pink pout kinda girl</li>
            <li> it is really PINK</li>
            <li> , you can&#x27;t go wrong unless you&#x27;re afraid of bright makeup.</li>
            <li> less then one star</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re pale or have deeper</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure this is</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t for the casual pink lipstick fan, this color will draw attention to your lips.</li>
            <li> i mean i couldn&#x27;t even save the lipstick</li>
            <li> or i apply a very small amount on to my finger then apply it that way</li>
            <li> /&gt;Color pay off is ridiculous, 1 stroke on your lips and the color is so livid &amp; vibrant!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wore it to a dress up event and instead of looking ridiculous like Nicki Minaj or a clown</li>
            <li> so I was especially shocked with how much this color complimented my skin tone.</li>
            <li> i would i am so angry because it is expensive</li>
            <li> so you must be fashionable to use it..and don&#x27;t be afraid!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have about seven lime crime lipsticks and there all great , I have Geradium but I wanted more a pinkish color and countessa is exactly that</li>
            <li> This pink lipstick was exactly what I was looking for! I love it! It goes on opaque &amp; stays that way. It also works as a lipstain, so as it wears off it leaves your lips a vibrant fuchsia. It has a slight vanilla sweet smell, but it is not overwhelming. I would definitely recommend using a lip liner to prevent feathering.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love bright pink lipsticks and this one is the best! I like to call it my &amp;#34;Nikki Minaj&amp;#34; Lipstick because it&#x27;s so bright. The color gets even better when you splash some gloss over it. This is my #1 lippy!</li>
            <li> Nice colour but really bright!! exactly like picture!! matte!! long-lasting! I&#x27;m not sure this is a colour people would normally wear (I wore it on halloween as Nicki Minaj) but if that&#x27;s the colour you want you get it!</li>
            <li> What a pop of color I&#x27;m a Mac girl so to find a brand comparable is great fast shipping and I luv the unicorn on the lipstick</li>
            <li> I purchased 8 limecrime lipsticks in total and so far I&#x27;m loving every last one low sheen and its the best 18 dollars I&#x27;ve ever spent I recommend limecrime and will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a bright pink lipstick with blue based tones then this color is for you! It is bright hot pink without being neon and has a lovely semi-matte finish. If you want it more shiny add a clear gloss over it. It isn&#x27;t drying at all and wears really well. This isn&#x27;t for the casual pink lipstick fan, this color will draw attention to your lips. The pictures are accurate and true to the color. It has a slight vanilla smell that is really pleasant. If you don&#x27;t mind the price (which I think is pretty decent for a good lipstick) then I would definitely suggest Lime Crime and this color.</li>
            <li> I gave 5 star because the color just fabulous, and it is really pretty on me:-) I had been looking this color on any store and couldn&#x27;t find one. Thanks to Amazon for selling this lipstick:-)</li>
            <li> Wow.  Very Pretty&lt;br /&gt;Used for work, but I believe it will be great for evening events.&lt;br /&gt;It is absolutely beautiful.</li>
            <li> Not tested on animals, vegan friendly &amp; made in the USA...how awesome is that??!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lipstick has a blue undertone which means this would look fabulous on any skin tone weather you&#x27;re pale or have deeper skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color pay off is ridiculous, 1 stroke on your lips and the color is so livid &amp; vibrant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula is creamy and won&#x27;t dry out your lips.&lt;br /&gt;Without eating &amp; drinking I dont have to touch up my lips after application for another 2-4hrs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has a kinda vanilla scent, packaging is to die for.&lt;br /&gt;I get constant compliments while wearing this.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a must have for any girl&#x27;s lipstick collection!</li>
            <li> I love my new lipstick love the color im so glad I bought it. Hesitated because I loved more than one color but so far I&#x27;ve bought three different colors and love all three colors. Goes on smoothly so i&#x27;m very happy with the purchase I&#x27;ve made.</li>
            <li> I found this lipstick not as moisture as I thought it would be..to me it was dry on my lips and I had to put balm over it ....I would not buy it again..........</li>
            <li> This color is super hot n sexy, if you are looking for a night out lipstick this is the one, is a must have.</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick! Became one of my favorite lipsticks ever. The color pay off is amazing and smooth to apply on the lips. I will definitely be purchasing this again. Worth the money</li>
            <li> I loved the pigment in the picture and the color it true to the picture. Its such a beautiful pink and it stays. It almost stains I had to use makeup removing wipes to get it off.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS! I gave it four stars only because the price is a little steep, but the overall product is simply adorable! Even the box it came in is freakin cute. The lipstick tube, also darling. I used to be a pink pout kinda girl but I&#x27;m now 22 so I feel quite shy when wearing a bright fun pink. It&#x27;s because my age but even though I&#x27;m near geriatric I have a baby face that makes me look 15-16 years old so I can pull it off. With my skin most bright colors don&#x27;t look right so I was especially shocked with how much this color complimented my skin tone. I&#x27;m light complected with olive skin and this pink has a blue undertone that is perfect on me. It is hard having extremely light skin with naturally dark burnt red lips because makeup looks too painted on me when clashed with my paleness but I need darker, brighter colors on my lips or else they won&#x27;t show up on darker pigmented kisser. See my dilemma? This creamy lipstick is the perfect shade of pink for any age, you can wear it anywhere without looking like you rummaged through a little girls Barbie makeup set. It doesn&#x27;t look tacky, it looks gorgeous. I wore it to a dress up event and instead of looking ridiculous like Nicki Minaj or a clown (what&#x27;s the difference?) I looked simply amazing and had women asking where I got my high end lipstick.</li>
            <li> I wanted a lipstick that was long lasting and moisturizing. I have found it with this lipstick. It is vibrant and a pink that you will definitely notice.It will nicely compliment all spring outfits with a splash of pink.</li>
            <li> Lipstick smells bad, good color, but it came half melted..</li>
            <li> let me start by saying that i live in the middle east so i knew that anything i order would take time until i receive it but this lipstick melted completely i mean i couldn&#x27;t even save the lipstick .it is not the first time i order lipsticks i order before and i received them with no problems .if i could give this seller and product less then one star i would i am so angry because it is expensive and i had to throw it in the garbage .</li>
            <li> Wonderfully bright just as the picture shows and just as I wanted.  Think I&#x27;d better buy more before it&#x27;s sold out!</li>
            <li> Omg I love this lipstick!! The color is not as matte looking as the picture but it is beautiful. I would recomend!!</li>
            <li> beautiful color. One of the prettiest pinks, bright, that I have purchased in long time, and I have many pinks. Love it.</li>
            <li> I never wear lipstick. I can&#x27;t stress that enough! I often have dry lips, that no amount of water or chapstick can cure. So lip liner and gloss is my fix. But I really, really wanted this color. And I heard it was great, plus it&#x27;s on Amazon, so you can&#x27;t go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVVVVVVVE this lipstick. The color is A+, just like the photo. The consistency, is wowwwww - so rich, creamy, smooth, moisturizing and opaque. It even stains your lips so it hardly comes off, even after rubbing with a tissue, which is what I did as I wanted to try it on right away, then had to run off to the office and oops- I really couldn&#x27;t get it off! That&#x27;s pretty unusual for a lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is it makes the yellow in teeth stand out. My teeth are whiter than most I would say, but I still am going to whiten my teeth just so this lipstick will look even better on me. Very fun color too, you can&#x27;t go wrong unless you&#x27;re afraid of bright makeup.</li>
            <li> I absolutely  adore this shade from lime crime! To me its BETTER than Macs Candy Yum Yum! Because its not as Matte as that and with its blue based undertones Dark skin divas can definitely rock this with no problem! The seller shipped this to me extremely quick! Only 3 days! Def Repurchase!</li>
            <li> I must say This lipstick goes on smooth.  it even smells good it doesn&#x27;t crack or chap my lips. I will continue to use this brand as long as they continue to put great products out . And shipping ! Yes on time with no hassle at all ! Love it !!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> love it, its just like the pic but i only use it at night time sice its so bright or i apply a very small amount on to my finger then apply it that way.. amazing color pay off!!!</li>
            <li> just the tone that is for this spring! so nice! it is really PINK so you must be fashionable to use it..and don&#x27;t be afraid!</li>
            <li> Beautiful color i love it.. Its like a barbie color.. Now i want the pale pink because i love this brand</li>
            <li> Applies thickly into an ultra bright, striking finish. Love it. Apply a lip gloss as this does not dry for a long time and you may stain you cloths.</li>
            <li> This is the hottiest color!!!!!!!!!! Super bright and it stains your lips so even if it&#x27;s been awhile since your last touch up, you stil have color on your lips!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> love that it&#x27;s so bright, doubles as a blush which is awesome and love that it&#x27;s blue based . :)</li>
            <li> my favorite lipstick! stays on all day, and doesn&#x27;t dry out your lips! I get so many complements on the color too!</li>
            <li> Love this lipstick!! Awesome color pay off and great lasting power. Plus it smells like vanilla cake!! I will be purchasing more!!</li>
            <li> This is a nice opaque lipstick and wears well but is a bit pricey. It is packaged nicely . I like the color but probably could have found it for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> Is my 3rd LimeCrime Lipstick and this is the most amazing, so stunning neon color! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> It arrived early and was as advertised.  My wife has since ordered 2 more times and every thing has been fine.</li>
