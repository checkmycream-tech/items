            <li>Amazing stuff!  </li>
            <li>So while it may do a good job at brightening up hair that needs it, I can&#x27;t be the one to say one way or another</li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo specifically because I wanted a good one that would hold color since I spend a fair amount of money adding both highlights and lowlights to my hair.  </li>
            <li>and she can mix it with another organic shampoo and get a good effect.  </li>
            <li>It smells really good too.</li>
            <li>Can be a tad drying so use some good conditioner afterward.</li>
            <li>Smells so awesome and clean.</li>

            <li>I really love this product and how shiny it leaves my hair!</li>
            <li>I have used the bamboo anti frizz duo and now use the shine duo and the anti-breakage thermal protectant, I love all of their products I have used!</li>
            <li>It is really fantastic for my hair, smells really nice and gives it a great shine and feel.</li>
            <li>Alterna&#x27;s is nice.</li>
            <li>Seriously, no shampoo I have ever tried has come close to making my hair smell this good and be this shiny!</li>
            <li>My hair is so healthy and shiny, and it is very important to me that the products I use on my skin and hair do not have Sulfates, Parabens, etc.</li>
            <li>Rich, pleasant aroma and performs well on fine hair.</li>
            <li>Love this product for my hair.</li>
            <li>just *looks* healthy and bouncy.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the smell and</li>
            <li>love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>but again more then one wash a week</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Darkening your hair color is always going to be more prone to fading, and I realize that,</li>
            <li>more controlled.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shampoo has wonderful potential, if you don&#x27;t have fine/thin hair</li>
            <li>This is a 5 star hair product love their line of hair care this shampoo has eco certified bamboo&amp; gooseberry</li>
            <li>what I like the most is it keeps my frizz under control</li>
            <li>I was really impressed by the bamboo shine conditioner, thinking of combine the shampoo with double the effect.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite  shampoo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many top brands like Matrix, Joico, even MoroccanOil and none of them provide the smoothness and softness of Alterna.</li>
            <li>This shampoo provides a nice lather and leaves my hair feeling clean.</li>
            <li>pleasant scent not overbearingly too strong, did not evoke an allergenic nose sniffling for me, does not over-lather - perfect for those who prefer less lather, very gentle shampoo.</li>
            <li>I bought this originally from my hair stylist at a salon, but the price on Amazon is better.</li>
            <li>Some healthy shampoos don&#x27;t foam up and even though they might work, that lack of bubbles always makes me question how clean my hair is</li>
            <li>do NOT buy this shampoo if you have strong coloured hair.</li>
            <li>Except for the color business, I would have liked it very much.  </li>
            <li>Except for the color business, I would have liked it very much.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks and feels super clean and light after I shower, with incredible shine, but my natural waves are there and my hair</li>
            <li>First I want to point out that if it weren&#x27;t for the one big, glaring problem with this shampoo, I would have given it four or five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For one thing, it does an excellent job of cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair and was worried that I&#x27;d sacrifice volume for shine, but that was not the case at all.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally very oily but with this stuff has never looked better!</li>
            <li>This is a great product- it leaves hair super soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Also sulfate free</li>
            <li>Or you could just use some cheap shampoo once every 2 weeks to do the trick.</li>
            <li>absolutely livid!!!</li>
            <li>I _had_ really great bright red hair (think fire engine red)</li>
            <li>I am so happy to say that not only does this one work, but works really well!</li>
            <li>It gets my hair super clean without stripping it to straw.</li>
            <li>Good product and would recommend it to anyone who doesn&#x27;t have fine/thin hair that washes it daily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, and it is incredible for fine and thin hair</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and tends to be fragile and Alterna has made it feel healthy and vibrant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally worth the splurge.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an attractive package, the bamboo shape is cute, but I do prefer a flip-top cap and a smaller aperture so that I can manage it with wet hands and squeezing out the desired amount is</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic and leaves my hair clean, soft, and super shiny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently using Beesential Natural Honey and Botanical Sulfate Free Shampoo which seems to be doing a better job at retaining the color of my hair.</li>
            <li>This shampoo and the Bamboo Shine conditioner make my hair so smooth and soft</li>
            <li>but I also tried a few samples of the Alterna Frizz control shampoo and conditioner and loved that one too.</li>
            <li>Leaves my (fine) hair really shiny and soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>It removed all the styling product from my hair and left it very clean without drying it out.  </li>
            <li>It obviously didn&#x27;t wreck my highlights - the color was removed by the dye, and since this isn&#x27;t a color-depositing shampoo, the highlights were fine.  </li>
            <li>Does a great job and leaves my hair very thick, yet manageable.</li>
            <li>I have fine long hair and it makes my hair look amazing and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down of feel greasy, while still adding shine.</li>
            <li>Together, it works very well for me.  </li>
            <li>The fact that it is also gluten free is a big plus for me!</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t really speak to the \\&quot;shine\\&quot; claims; my hair was shiny after using this but it tends to be shiny anyway.  </li>
            <li>but I wish the color didn&#x27;t bleed so much.</li>
            <li>i used this shampoo once because it said colour fast</li>
            <li>I highly recommend giving these a try!</li>
            <li>I color my hair and this shampoo seems to help maintain the color very well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Only need a grape sized amount to clean medium length hair.</li>
            <li>priced to high</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s now been several months since I switched to this line and love it so much, I got the other products in this line as well.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure thick if you are lucky enough to have it!</li>
            <li>Win-win as far as my hair is concerned!</li>
            <li>It does not make my hair \\&quot;squeaky\\&quot; after shampooing like some other brands which is a good thing as the \\&quot;squeaky\\&quot; feeling indicates that your hair is will be dried out.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this shampoo, especially since it can be VERY hard to find a good one for color treated hair.</li>
            <li>And this wasn&#x27;t a DIY job, my hair was professionally colored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I swim five miles a day and my hair gets full of all sorts of chemicals/salt (depending on where I am swimming), but it *also* gets dried out from the chlorine, so I need a shampoo that can get all the gunk out of it without leaving my hair looking and feeling like</li>
            <li>Furthermore, it doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down, and it clean well enough that I can skip a day between shampoos.  </li>
            <li>I instantly noticed my hairs new strength and shine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s floral, but with enough citrus and green tones that it doesn&#x27;t smell too flowery or feminine, just neutral and clean and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent is nearly identical to a line of personal care products sold at Target and elsewhere called Healing Garden Greenteatherapy.  </li>
            <li>But if you want a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t suck a $90 professional color job off your head in two minutes flat, then keep looking.</li>
            <li>But if you want a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t suck a $90 professional color job off your head in two minutes flat, then keep looking.</li>
            <li>I have really difficult hair so finding a good match with the right shampoo/ conditioner has been really tough.</li>
            <li>However, the first time I used this, when I turned around in the shower a mass of red was flowing down the drain!</li>

            <li> However, the first time I used this, when I turned around in the shower a mass of red was flowing down the drain!</li>
            <li> But it just like the normal shampoo.. a little bit overpriced.</li>
            <li> final gripe - and a minor one after all is said and done - is with the bottle.  </li>
            <li> My lowlights, on the other hand, were totally stripped out.  </li>
            <li> but since I currently use a (cheap drugstore) shampoo that maintains my lowlights for a few weeks after getting them, I was hoping for a shampoo that did at least as well if not better.  </li>
            <li> my hair and scalp  are dry and not much shine.</li>
            <li> Wish I hadn&#x27;t spent the money.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind shelling out a few extra bucks on hair products</li>
            <li> It now looks faded candy pink.  </li>
            <li> No more over dry or not-clean enough hair and in eco-friendly formula!</li>
            <li> My hair is healthier than with other shampoos.  </li>

            <li> Love this product for my hair.</li>
            <li> I swim five miles a day and my hair gets full of all sorts of chemicals/salt (depending on where I am swimming), but it *also* gets dried out from the chlorine, so I need a shampoo that can get all the gunk out of it without leaving my hair looking and feeling like hay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bamboo Shine is perfect. It gets my hair super clean without stripping it to straw. My hair looks and feels super clean and light after I shower, with incredible shine, but my natural waves are there and my hair just *looks* healthy and bouncy. I LOVE the smell and how thick the shampoo is, as well- a little goes a very long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(And yes, it does suds up. Some healthy shampoos don&#x27;t foam up and even though they might work, that lack of bubbles always makes me question how clean my hair is getting.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this shampoo. It&#x27;s totally worth the splurge.</li>
            <li> The shampoo does suds up when you mix water in as you&#x27;re washing your hair but it leaves a &amp;#34;heaviness&amp;#34; to you hair...I can only use it once a week.  I have thick wavy hair.  Wish I hadn&#x27;t spent the money.  It does make it shiny but again more then one wash a week and my hair gets some type of gunky build up on it.</li>
            <li> What can I say? I love this product. My hair is healthier than with other shampoos.  I instantly noticed my hairs new strength and shine. It smells great. If you don&#x27;t mind shelling out a few extra bucks on hair products I recommend trying this one. I don&#x27;t have frizzy hair but I also tried a few samples of the Alterna Frizz control shampoo and conditioner and loved that one too.</li>
            <li> I was getting unhappy with the products I&#x27;d been using, so my daughter told me to try this.  It&#x27;s now been several months since I switched to this line and love it so much, I got the other products in this line as well.  Together, it works very well for me.  Smells wonderful too!</li>
            <li> I really love this product and how shiny it leaves my hair! The fact that it is also gluten free is a big plus for me!</li>
            <li> First I want to point out that if it weren&#x27;t for the one big, glaring problem with this shampoo, I would have given it four or five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For one thing, it does an excellent job of cleaning.  It removed all the styling product from my hair and left it very clean without drying it out.  For another, the fragrance is very nice.  The scent is nearly identical to a line of personal care products sold at Target and elsewhere called Healing Garden Greenteatherapy.  It&#x27;s floral, but with enough citrus and green tones that it doesn&#x27;t smell too flowery or feminine, just neutral and clean and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t really speak to the \\&quot;shine\\&quot; claims; my hair was shiny after using this but it tends to be shiny anyway.  So while it may do a good job at brightening up hair that needs it, I can&#x27;t be the one to say one way or another whether it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for chopping off all the stars, though, is that its claims for color-fastness are dramatically overstated.  I bought this shampoo specifically because I wanted a good one that would hold color since I spend a fair amount of money adding both highlights and lowlights to my hair.  It obviously didn&#x27;t wreck my highlights - the color was removed by the dye, and since this isn&#x27;t a color-depositing shampoo, the highlights were fine.  My lowlights, on the other hand, were totally stripped out.  Darkening your hair color is always going to be more prone to fading, and I realize that, but since I currently use a (cheap drugstore) shampoo that maintains my lowlights for a few weeks after getting them, I was hoping for a shampoo that did at least as well if not better.  Yet they were gone!  And this wasn&#x27;t a DIY job, my hair was professionally colored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final gripe - and a minor one after all is said and done - is with the bottle.  It&#x27;s an attractive package, the bamboo shape is cute, but I do prefer a flip-top cap and a smaller aperture so that I can manage it with wet hands and squeezing out the desired amount is more controlled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, this isn&#x27;t a bad shampoo.  Except for the color business, I would have liked it very much.  If you want a shampoo that cleans well and nourishes your hair, this is an excellent choice.  But if you want a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t suck a $90 professional color job off your head in two minutes flat, then keep looking.Really, this isn&#x27;t a bad shampoo.

            <li> I love this shampoo and I use it everyday.  It is really fantastic for my hair, smells really nice and gives it a great shine and feel.</li>
            <li> Rich, pleasant aroma and performs well on fine hair.</li>
            <li> pleasant scent not overbearingly too strong, did not evoke an allergenic nose sniffling for me, does not over-lather - perfect for those who prefer less lather, very gentle shampoo. Only need a grape sized amount to clean medium length hair.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this shampoo, especially since it can be VERY hard to find a good one for color treated hair. However, the first time I used this, when I turned around in the shower a mass of red was flowing down the drain! It&#x27;s a good moisturizing shampoo though and does smell nice  but I wish the color didn&#x27;t bleed so much. I&#x27;m currently using Beesential Natural Honey and Botanical Sulfate Free Shampoo which seems to be doing a better job at retaining the color of my hair. Everyone has different types of hair though, so just because this one didn&#x27;t work for me doesn&#x27;t me it won&#x27;t work for you!</li>
            <li> This shampoo has wonderful potential, if you don&#x27;t have fine/thin hair like my wife does and and wash it every day.  It&#x27;s very good quality and she can mix it with another organic shampoo and get a good effect.  Good product and would recommend it to anyone who doesn&#x27;t have fine/thin hair that washes it daily.</li>
            <li> Ordered this and when I opened the box they had not secured the bottle and shampoo was ALL OVER! I had lost over an inch of product. I then used it and it is horrible. Super heavy and made my hair feel disgusting.</li>
            <li> This is a 5 star hair product love their line of hair care this shampoo has eco certified bamboo&amp; gooseberry its sulfate free adds shine and strengthening safe for colored treated hair ,has an awesome scent and what I like the most is it keeps my frizz under control they also make the bamboo for frizz too I have that also and works great .This leaves my hair with a glossy shine I think whoever uses this wont be disappointed .</li>
            <li> I was really impressed by the bamboo shine conditioner, thinking of combine the shampoo with double the effect.But it just like the normal shampoo.. a little bit overpriced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for years for a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; shampoo... I&#x27;ve probably tried just about every brand that you can get in regular stores. I have really difficult hair so finding a good match with the right shampoo/ conditioner has been really tough. I am so happy to say that not only does this one work, but works really well! No more over dry or not-clean enough hair and in eco-friendly formula! Win-win as far as my hair is concerned!</li>
            <li> Smells so awesome and clean. Also sulfate free so my hear is always radiant and shiny. It does build up after a while so you&#x27;ll need a clarifying shampoo to. Alterna&#x27;s is nice. Or you could just use some cheap shampoo once every 2 weeks to do the trick.</li>
            <li> I have used the bamboo anti frizz duo and now use the shine duo and the anti-breakage thermal protectant, I love all of their products I have used! My hair is naturally very oily but with this stuff has never looked better!</li>
            <li> I have been using Alterna&#x27;s Bamboo Shine Shampoo and Conditioner for years, and I will never use anything else.  My hair is so healthy and shiny, and it is very important to me that the products I use on my skin and hair do not have Sulfates, Parabens, etc.</li>
            <li> Beware may come with shampoo leaking it not taped.</li>
            <li> This is a great product- it leaves hair super soft and shiny.  I bought this originally from my hair stylist at a salon, but the price on Amazon is better.</li>
            <li> do NOT buy this shampoo if you have strong coloured hair. I _had_ really great bright red hair (think fire engine red) i used this shampoo once because it said colour fast etc.... the amount of  colour it stripped is appalling. It now looks faded candy pink.  absolutely livid!!!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. It smells fantastic and leaves my hair clean, soft, and super shiny. I have baby fine hair and was worried that I&#x27;d sacrifice volume for shine, but that was not the case at all. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> would not recommend. my hair and scalp  are dry and not much shine. will not purchase again. priced to high</li>
            <li> This is my favorite  shampoo. I have fine long hair and it makes my hair look amazing and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down of feel greasy, while still adding shine.</li>
            <li> No frizz with this shampoo. It smells really good too.</li>
            <li> Great Price.  Great for my hair</li>
            <li> This shampoo provides a nice lather and leaves my hair feeling clean. It does not make my hair \\&quot;squeaky\\&quot; after shampooing like some other brands which is a good thing as the \\&quot;squeaky\\&quot; feeling indicates that your hair is will be dried out. My hair is very fine and tends to be fragile and Alterna has made it feel healthy and vibrant. This shampoo and the Bamboo Shine conditioner make my hair so smooth and soft I am seriously impressed. I&#x27;ve used many top brands like Matrix, Joico, even MoroccanOil and none of them provide the smoothness and softness of Alterna. I highly recommend giving these a try!</li>
            <li> Leaves my (fine) hair really shiny and soft and manageable. I color my hair and this shampoo seems to help maintain the color very well.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff!  I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, and it is incredible for fine and thin hair and I&#x27;m sure thick if you are lucky enough to have it!</li>
            <li> I tried it… my hair felt oily. Not for me.</li>
            <li> Does a great job and leaves my hair very thick, yet manageable. Can be a tad drying so use some good conditioner afterward.</li>
            <li> Seriously, no shampoo I have ever tried has come close to making my hair smell this good and be this shiny! Furthermore, it doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down, and it clean well enough that I can skip a day between shampoos.  I never splurge on beauty products, but this is the exception for me.  I highly recommend!</li>
