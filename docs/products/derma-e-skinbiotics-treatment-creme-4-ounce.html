            <li>Also good for cuts.</li>
            <li>Seriously good stuff.</li>
            <li>Even my husband said my skin looked good.</li>

            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>This stuff has amazing healing power.</li>
            <li>THIS IS AMAZING.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff maintains a nice, silky texture for massage, and doesn&#x27;t break me out.  </li>
            <li>Since I started using Skinbiotics,I&#x27;ve been thrilled with how my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li>At 4oz its a nice sizednjar of product no skimping.</li>
            <li>I bought this cream because I heard that oregano and tea tree oil was effective in helping alleviate ezcema symptoms.</li>
            <li>I liked that it also had oil of oregano</li>
            <li>Yes, you can smell the oregano, but the smell dissipates after it absorbs and I quickly forget about it ever smelling when someone comments on how great my skin looks.</li>
            <li>It was light and smelled good.</li>
            <li>Just ordered more products from this line</li>
            <li>I love the texture and the smell.  </li>
            <li>This is the one product out of many that worked.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely glad to say this worked where nothing else did.</li>
            <li>It takes away most every rash</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>(I think cyclimycin is more for bacterial issues).</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff...</li>
            <li>It stung and made my pd flair up more.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not horrible smelling, just almost citrusy/spicy without it being a citrus scent or something.</li>
            <li>This lotion is fantastic!</li>
            <li>After about a month of using it 2x a day I can say that it has definitely alleviated the situation.  </li>
            <li>The pinkness ant itchiness has gone away for the most part.  </li>
            <li>Before, I would put make up on top of the rash (I know,</li>
            <li>Now, for the most part it doesn&#x27;t look like I have a rash at all.  </li>
            <li>For my skin, this was better than antibiotic creams.</li>
            <li>I have mostly been dealing with hormonal breakouts and cystic acne on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>I will be making sure I never run out of it.</li>
            <li>like Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;No more &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; product for me.&lt;br /&gt;Oh,</li>
            <li>Has a nice clean smell.</li>
            <li>Fairly natural.&lt;br /&gt;I use a D&#x27;arsonval device first, then this, to try to help with acne.</li>
            <li>Within just 3-4 days time of using the oil on my face (after washing it before bed) I started to see the redness and spots and inflammation reduced significantly!  </li>
            <li>It seems to be working much better for me than what the doctor prescribed, so I will stick with this, despite the strong smell.  </li>
            <li>Works nicely and was shipped quickly</li>
            <li>It does have a strong Tea Tree odor.</li>
            <li>It has oregano oil in it which was strong.</li>
            <li>all bow down in trembling fear before the awesome power of this cr&amp;egrave;me.</li>
            <li>I bought this cream to use for when I get breakouts (I have mild acne), but I found it did a much better job preventing razor bumps and soothing itchy skin</li>
            <li>Silky smooth treatment.</li>
            <li>I wanted a cream that contained Oil of Oregano and was happy to see that this not only contained the oregano oil, but tee tree oil as well.</li>
            <li>It has a light and creamy texture; it also moisturizes the skin well without drying it out.</li>
            <li>I use the lotion for just a regular moisturizer too for my hands and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a lot more success doing these life style</li>
            <li>I use this creme under Zeasob powder and I have been boil free for over a year.</li>
            <li>This creme is good, you can definitely smell the tea tree in it; it takes  some getting used to but eventually it gets better.</li>
            <li>I rarely leave ratings on products; but this one totally deserves another good review!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Change soaps, eliminate sulfates and other chemicals like that for your shampoo or conditioner (ideally eliminate conditioner as it can make your hair oily and cause oily skin), use fluoride free toothpaste</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and the smell is awesome and clean.</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t allergic to the ingredients, it&#x27;s worth a try!  </li>
            <li>me, but from what I can tell it has helped significantly.  </li>
            <li>I also use this when I have dry skin or irritations, and it works great.</li>
            <li>I now use this amazing product under my arms, where I got frequent infected hair follicles and ingrown hairs after shaving.</li>
            <li>So I did my own research and pretty much self diagnosed it as perioral dermatitis.</li>
            <li>I am now switching between using the oil and the cream, as the cream seems a bit more moisturizing than just the straight oil.  </li>
            <li>I literally waited 2 months, because I really wanted to make sure-</li>
            <li>It was just taking it&#x27;s sweet time going away the longer</li>
            <li>Mostly when I remember, haha.</li>
            <li>I was using cyclimycin lotion from the doctor, and it was helping some for a mild case of folliculitis.  </li>
            <li>The results seemed to be just okay using the prescription lotion, so I did some more research online, and found several people mention the derma-e Skinbiotics Oil and also this cream.  </li>
            <li>and he gave me the super strength steroid cream.</li>
            <li>I had pretty good skin when I was younger</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and my skin looks great.</li>
            <li>However, my skin is fairly sensitive to all of the additives in most junk on the market, so I purchased this product because it seemed to be the most natural.  </li>
            <li>So far, this is my favorite derma e product.  </li>
            <li>I wish if it was a bit cheaper, but it is worth the money</li>
            <li>So far, I love it.</li>
            <li>Being highly sensitive to smells, I find this cream to be a bit overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I like the cream form of this, not as drying as justvtsavtree oil, but have to say it does smell pungent, and kind of Italian food like with the oregano oil.</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth but there are still some redness, but overall I am very pleased to have found a natural solution to my skin issues, instead of the pricy steroid creams.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>While the smell is a bit strong, especially when you first apply it - the results are worth it!  </li>
            <li>Nothing worked for more than a short while, and any activity made it flare up for a week.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I could practically feel bacteria dying on my skin or something.</li>
            <li>the skin beneath is smooth is clear.  </li>
            <li>I think it may have been more fungal related, rather than bacterial.  </li>
            <li>arrived well packed and very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love it but will occasionally use it before bedtime, not in the morning though because I don&#x27;t like the way this sits under makeup.</li>
            <li>I first was introduced to this cream after a bikini wax.</li>
            <li>and I happened to read the back that it could be used for much more than post bikini waxing.</li>
            <li>I used this in conjunction with hydrocortisone cream and it seams to work pretty well.</li>
            <li>I had been developing dry patches from using Peter Thomas Roth Therapeutic Sulfur Mask (which is awesome) and this lotion made it a thing of the past.</li>
            <li>First off, It is much cheaper to purchase this on Amazon than in stores.</li>
            <li>Does a good job, but not sure it helps peripheral dermatitis which was why I bought it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week with the cleanser and most of my acne has already cleared up with no new issues being caused by the products.</li>
            <li>This creme rubs right in, feels mildly astringent and yes, has a tee tree odor, but given how nice my face looks, I&#x27;ll live with that one negative.</li>
            <li>Eventually, an allergist identified a sensitivity to candida, and my research showed me that oil of oregano is as effective at killing candida as the much more expensive and toxic prescrtiption drugs.</li>
            <li>This is my everything cream, the whole family uses it for any skin problem.</li>
            <li>Thanks a million.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really helpful for all sorts of skin conditions.  </li>
            <li>It works very well on the eczema on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;Product</li>
            <li>so my face was very irritated and itchy.</li>
            <li>My Husband really like this cream</li>
            <li>so I stopped sugars as much as I could.</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t really use it.</li>
            <li>My friend made a comment on how smooth my skin was looking in only after 3 days of using it and was wondering what I was using on my face.  </li>
            <li>Works great, but has strong unpleasant odor from the tea tree oil ingredient.</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t find the cream to be any more healing/soothing than other over-the-counter lotions.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a way to get rid of perioral dermatitis or managing it better than before, I would use this and other tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>- it has helped to prevent infection while also keeping my hands moisturized, which is fantastic, since normally it is necessary to forgo any and all hand creams when I have cat scratches on my hands, because normally anything that retains moisture on the skin will also retain germs in the skin.  </li>
            <li>The only downside is that it can feel a little greasy, but it&#x27;s worth it as it&#x27;s really effective at helping a variety of skin ailments.</li>
            <li>(I live with a recovering feral cat, so this happens often!)</li>
            <li>It slightly tingles when I put it on which I find refreshing.</li>
            <li>A PA that I work with suggested it was most likely some type of fungal infection, similar to athlete&#x27;s foot.  </li>
            <li>I am asked often how I maintain such amazingly soft and smooth skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really helping clear up my skin!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have tried every high quality product you can imagine and nothing helped.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I have used oatmeal soap, Gold Bond powder, athlete&#x27;s foot remedies, and gone to a doctor who gave me a prescription cream which initially worked, but my skin was too sensitive for long-term use and after initial good results, it came back</li>
            <li>This has been a fantastic use for this product for me, because now I don&#x27;t have to suffer with dry, itchy, cracking skin on my hands while waiting for my cat scratches to heal!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a week now and most of the breakout is gone.</li>
            <li>She is very prone to yeast and bacterial infections that sometimes take weeks to clear.</li>
            <li>a plus since I live in Flroid</li>
            <li>I was new to Derma-E products, and thought I would try their line of products.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have not had a problem using this.</li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The oil on the other hand is very strong and takes a long time for the smell to dissipate.</li>
            <li>It is the only thing that works, and it works well and fast!</li>
            <li>It burns a little because of the tea tree oil and the odor is strong.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it works quickly for a variety of skin needs.</li>
            <li>I have very acne-prone and irritation-prone skin, esp on my face and back.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used it for a rash my son developed on his legs</li>
            <li>I work at Whole Foods and have recently started using this product for acne.</li>
            <li>I completely changed soaps (changed to dove for my face since I was using acne wash) and backed off washing my face in the morning, that way the oils from the night would lubricate the rash.</li>
            <li>I have been using it now for about a month and can really see the different in the texture of my skin and</li>
            <li>, I am 56 years old.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried it on my 2 year old when she started to get a diaper rash.</li>
            <li>and they said I had an old batch.......</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way, and I love the smell.</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week and my skin is almost back to normal.</li>
            <li>I bought this product to treat a rash that has been on the back of my very athletic daughter&#x27;s legs for several months.  </li>
            <li>It smells strongly of tee tree oil and is on the thick side.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clearing nicely with very little irritation and much less redness.  </li>
            <li>My sister has been using the oil and has noticed a major improvement in her skin also.</li>
            <li>Within three days, there was no more itching, the lesions I had were healing, and new ones now are rare.</li>
            <li>Still dealing with a couple bumps and minor flakiness, but I would highly recommend this creme.</li>
            <li>Dont miff a higher price, its hard to find and sells out fast.</li>
            <li>The amount in the jar is very generous too, this will last you a long time.  </li>
            <li>even though I didn&#x27;t buy it from Amazon (got it from a local natural foods store), I made a point to look for it to leave a review.</li>
            <li>The spots aren&#x27;t gone yet but rumor is, it gets worse before it gets better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It started kind of like an eczema rash, small, tight, burning itching red pimples.</li>
            <li>I have had problem facial skin my entire adult life: acne, dry patches, rashes, hyper-sensitivity, etc.  </li>

            <li> (I think cyclimycin is more for bacterial issues).</li>
            <li> I love this cream.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff...</li>
            <li> It stung and made my pd flair up more.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not horrible smelling, just almost citrusy/spicy without it being a citrus scent or something.</li>
            <li> This lotion is fantastic!</li>
            <li> After about a month of using it 2x a day I can say that it has definitely alleviated the situation.  </li>
            <li> The pinkness ant itchiness has gone away for the most part.  </li>
            <li> Before, I would put make up on top of the rash (I know,</li>
            <li> Now, for the most part it doesn&#x27;t look like I have a rash at all.  </li>
            <li> For my skin, this was better than antibiotic creams.</li>
            <li> I have mostly been dealing with hormonal breakouts and cystic acne on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I will be making sure I never run out of it.</li>
            <li> like Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;No more &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; product for me.&lt;br /&gt;Oh,</li>
            <li> Has a nice clean smell.</li>
            <li> Fairly natural.&lt;br /&gt;I use a D&#x27;arsonval device first, then this, to try to help with acne.</li>
            <li> Within just 3-4 days time of using the oil on my face (after washing it before bed) I started to see the redness and spots and inflammation reduced significantly!  </li>
            <li> It seems to be working much better for me than what the doctor prescribed, so I will stick with this, despite the strong smell.  </li>
            <li> Works nicely and was shipped quickly</li>
            <li> It does have a strong Tea Tree odor.</li>
            <li> It has oregano oil in it which was strong.</li>
            <li> all bow down in trembling fear before the awesome power of this cr&amp;egrave;me.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream to use for when I get breakouts (I have mild acne), but I found it did a much better job preventing razor bumps and soothing itchy skin</li>
            <li> Silky smooth treatment.</li>
            <li> I wanted a cream that contained Oil of Oregano and was happy to see that this not only contained the oregano oil, but tee tree oil as well.</li>
            <li> It has a light and creamy texture; it also moisturizes the skin well without drying it out.</li>
            <li> I use the lotion for just a regular moisturizer too for my hands and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot more success doing these life style</li>
            <li> I use this creme under Zeasob powder and I have been boil free for over a year.</li>
            <li> This creme is good, you can definitely smell the tea tree in it; it takes  some getting used to but eventually it gets better.</li>
            <li> I rarely leave ratings on products; but this one totally deserves another good review!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Change soaps, eliminate sulfates and other chemicals like that for your shampoo or conditioner (ideally eliminate conditioner as it can make your hair oily and cause oily skin), use fluoride free toothpaste</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and the smell is awesome and clean.</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t allergic to the ingredients, it&#x27;s worth a try!  </li>
            <li> me, but from what I can tell it has helped significantly.  </li>
            <li> I also use this when I have dry skin or irritations, and it works great.</li>
            <li> I now use this amazing product under my arms, where I got frequent infected hair follicles and ingrown hairs after shaving.</li>
            <li> So I did my own research and pretty much self diagnosed it as perioral dermatitis.</li>
            <li> I am now switching between using the oil and the cream, as the cream seems a bit more moisturizing than just the straight oil.  </li>
            <li> I literally waited 2 months, because I really wanted to make sure-</li>
            <li> It was just taking it&#x27;s sweet time going away the longer</li>
            <li> Mostly when I remember, haha.</li>
            <li> I was using cyclimycin lotion from the doctor, and it was helping some for a mild case of folliculitis.  </li>
            <li> The results seemed to be just okay using the prescription lotion, so I did some more research online, and found several people mention the derma-e Skinbiotics Oil and also this cream.  </li>
            <li> and he gave me the super strength steroid cream.</li>
            <li> I had pretty good skin when I was younger</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and my skin looks great.</li>
            <li> However, my skin is fairly sensitive to all of the additives in most junk on the market, so I purchased this product because it seemed to be the most natural.  </li>
            <li> So far, this is my favorite derma e product.  </li>
            <li> I wish if it was a bit cheaper, but it is worth the money</li>
            <li> So far, I love it.</li>
            <li> Being highly sensitive to smells, I find this cream to be a bit overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I like the cream form of this, not as drying as justvtsavtree oil, but have to say it does smell pungent, and kind of Italian food like with the oregano oil.</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth but there are still some redness, but overall I am very pleased to have found a natural solution to my skin issues, instead of the pricy steroid creams.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> While the smell is a bit strong, especially when you first apply it - the results are worth it!  </li>
            <li> Nothing worked for more than a short while, and any activity made it flare up for a week.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I could practically feel bacteria dying on my skin or something.</li>
            <li> the skin beneath is smooth is clear.  </li>
            <li> I think it may have been more fungal related, rather than bacterial.  </li>
            <li> arrived well packed and very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love it but will occasionally use it before bedtime, not in the morning though because I don&#x27;t like the way this sits under makeup.</li>
            <li> I first was introduced to this cream after a bikini wax.</li>
            <li> and I happened to read the back that it could be used for much more than post bikini waxing.</li>
            <li> I used this in conjunction with hydrocortisone cream and it seams to work pretty well.</li>
            <li> I had been developing dry patches from using Peter Thomas Roth Therapeutic Sulfur Mask (which is awesome) and this lotion made it a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> First off, It is much cheaper to purchase this on Amazon than in stores.</li>
            <li> Does a good job, but not sure it helps peripheral dermatitis which was why I bought it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week with the cleanser and most of my acne has already cleared up with no new issues being caused by the products.</li>
            <li> This creme rubs right in, feels mildly astringent and yes, has a tee tree odor, but given how nice my face looks, I&#x27;ll live with that one negative.</li>
            <li> Eventually, an allergist identified a sensitivity to candida, and my research showed me that oil of oregano is as effective at killing candida as the much more expensive and toxic prescrtiption drugs.</li>
            <li> This is my everything cream, the whole family uses it for any skin problem.</li>
            <li> Thanks a million.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really helpful for all sorts of skin conditions.  </li>
            <li> It works very well on the eczema on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;Product</li>
            <li> so my face was very irritated and itchy.</li>
            <li> My Husband really like this cream</li>
            <li> so I stopped sugars as much as I could.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t really use it.</li>
            <li> My friend made a comment on how smooth my skin was looking in only after 3 days of using it and was wondering what I was using on my face.  </li>
            <li> Works great, but has strong unpleasant odor from the tea tree oil ingredient.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t find the cream to be any more healing/soothing than other over-the-counter lotions.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a way to get rid of perioral dermatitis or managing it better than before, I would use this and other tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - it has helped to prevent infection while also keeping my hands moisturized, which is fantastic, since normally it is necessary to forgo any and all hand creams when I have cat scratches on my hands, because normally anything that retains moisture on the skin will also retain germs in the skin.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that it can feel a little greasy, but it&#x27;s worth it as it&#x27;s really effective at helping a variety of skin ailments.</li>
            <li> (I live with a recovering feral cat, so this happens often!)</li>
            <li> It slightly tingles when I put it on which I find refreshing.</li>
            <li> A PA that I work with suggested it was most likely some type of fungal infection, similar to athlete&#x27;s foot.  </li>
            <li> I am asked often how I maintain such amazingly soft and smooth skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really helping clear up my skin!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried every high quality product you can imagine and nothing helped.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I have used oatmeal soap, Gold Bond powder, athlete&#x27;s foot remedies, and gone to a doctor who gave me a prescription cream which initially worked, but my skin was too sensitive for long-term use and after initial good results, it came back</li>
            <li> This has been a fantastic use for this product for me, because now I don&#x27;t have to suffer with dry, itchy, cracking skin on my hands while waiting for my cat scratches to heal!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a week now and most of the breakout is gone.</li>
            <li> She is very prone to yeast and bacterial infections that sometimes take weeks to clear.</li>
            <li> a plus since I live in Flroid</li>
            <li> I was new to Derma-E products, and thought I would try their line of products.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have not had a problem using this.</li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The oil on the other hand is very strong and takes a long time for the smell to dissipate.</li>
            <li> It is the only thing that works, and it works well and fast!</li>
            <li> It burns a little because of the tea tree oil and the odor is strong.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it works quickly for a variety of skin needs.</li>
            <li> I have very acne-prone and irritation-prone skin, esp on my face and back.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it for a rash my son developed on his legs</li>
            <li> I work at Whole Foods and have recently started using this product for acne.</li>
            <li> I completely changed soaps (changed to dove for my face since I was using acne wash) and backed off washing my face in the morning, that way the oils from the night would lubricate the rash.</li>
            <li> I have been using it now for about a month and can really see the different in the texture of my skin and</li>
            <li> , I am 56 years old.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried it on my 2 year old when she started to get a diaper rash.</li>
            <li> and they said I had an old batch.......</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week and my skin is almost back to normal.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to treat a rash that has been on the back of my very athletic daughter&#x27;s legs for several months.  </li>
            <li> It smells strongly of tee tree oil and is on the thick side.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clearing nicely with very little irritation and much less redness.  </li>
            <li> My sister has been using the oil and has noticed a major improvement in her skin also.</li>
            <li> Within three days, there was no more itching, the lesions I had were healing, and new ones now are rare.</li>
            <li> Still dealing with a couple bumps and minor flakiness, but I would highly recommend this creme.</li>
            <li> Dont miff a higher price, its hard to find and sells out fast.</li>
            <li> The amount in the jar is very generous too, this will last you a long time.  </li>
            <li> even though I didn&#x27;t buy it from Amazon (got it from a local natural foods store), I made a point to look for it to leave a review.</li>
            <li> The spots aren&#x27;t gone yet but rumor is, it gets worse before it gets better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It started kind of like an eczema rash, small, tight, burning itching red pimples.</li>
            <li> I have had problem facial skin my entire adult life: acne, dry patches, rashes, hyper-sensitivity, etc.  </li>
            <li> The cream absorbs quickly, but unfortunately leaves behind a very strong medicinal smell that doesn&#x27;t subside for hours.</li>
            <li> (I use Jason&#x27;s Sea Fresh natural paste which is also like SLS free), try cutting back on washing your face if possible, propose a change of laundry detergent to something less harsh is possible (or just change your pillow case frequently as saliva and oils from your hair could agitate the POD), drink lots of water, and cut back on sugars (maybe that&#x27;s just me).</li>
            <li> I stopped make up completely and tried other lotions.</li>
            <li> liberally applying this creme subdued the itching long enough for me to fall asleep, although it does nothing to address the larger problem which is being dealt with in the same manner that one deals with a candida infection.    </li>
            <li> The relief I get from this cream does not last as long as another brand I recently purchased from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This DMAE - Alpha Lipoic cream has a slight sting to it when putting it on but subsides totally in a couple of minutes, so I recommend not putting it near the eyes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now used it on several abrasions, sunburns and other general owies.  </li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I tried many products and most have only made my skin worse or feel greasy and unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> This becomes a very itchy rash, and extremely hard to get rid of, as the condition that creates it never goes away, especially during the summer months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot of cream, so it&#x27;ll last for a long time!</li>
            <li> I put some of this cream on, and the next day I saw healing happening, and by 4 days it was totally healed over, not even the redness was there from the tissue healing, but scare tissue was, to be expected.  </li>
            <li> I have some neuropathy problems over my whole body with itching and a burning pin prick sensation which is hard to control.</li>
            <li> Within a few days the itch went away completely and the redness eased a bit.  </li>
            <li> but after battling this for so long I decided to take a chance on derma e&#x27;s tea tree and e cleanser after coming across it at a store.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the redness we big busted ladies get under our breasts in the summer, but it also works on acne and any other skin condition you can think of.  </li>
            <li> It did not work for my psoriasis or dry skin.</li>
            <li> The cream also helps dry skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Remember, natural products usually don&#x27;t have a long shelf life.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> I apply this on my face every night and I have not had a single blemish or problem area on my face since then.</li>
            <li> Helped cure my dry skin and helps keep my cellulitis at bay!</li>
            <li> By the next day, her rash had shrunk by over half it&#x27;s size.  </li>
            <li> Yes, both tee tree oil and oil of oregano are fragrant, and normally I don&#x27;t mind their smell - but those odors combined with the base of the cream is just a bit too much for my nose (and the noses of those around me who can&#x27;t seem to get away from the odor if I&#x27;m near them).</li>
            <li> However, for some, this may work for other minor skin problems.</li>
            <li> (coconut oil, pure vitamin e, burt&#x27;s bees rescue ointment, desert essence tea tree oil ointment...) just made the swelling, itching, and redness worse.</li>
            <li> I bought this creme for my perioral dermatitis (extreme dry skin around the mouth and at sides of nose with blister-like raised bumps).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very often</li>
            <li> I feel like it has helped a few of my facial irritations.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really not all that blown away by the lotion.</li>
            <li> A few days after I had received this product, I noticed on the inside of my ear, a bleeding open area, Keratosis my doctor thought.</li>
            <li> and then pink skin started started showing which is a sign of healing.</li>
            <li> There was barely a pink spot there when she woke up.</li>
            <li> It started small and would only get a little bit bigger every season.</li>
            <li> I had a 20-year-old condition that involved excrutiatingly itchy bumps and that left me with scars up and down my arms, back, neck, etc, kept me up at night, and forced me to wear long-sleeved tops even in the hottest months.</li>
            <li> I use it on my kids for bug bites and other skin ailments.</li>
            <li> It was extremely uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> this is a creme base, which i think is better then the oil one.</li>
            <li> Her new rash was starting to look like a bad one she got a few months back</li>
            <li> I use it at night after I cleanse my face and it has calmed my skin down.</li>
            <li> cons: takes a while for it to work, and still not sure if my skin a dry because of this creme</li>
            <li> Dry skin itch no more.  </li>
            <li> I get small break outs from time to time and I also have slight rosacea in places as well as dry patches during the winter months.</li>
            <li> Bought this creme at Whole Foods for $21.95 - but I was desperate to find a product that would treat my eczema, rough red dry areas and not make my complexion look and feel worse.  </li>
            <li> By the end of the first day it was no longer painful and by the second day was already healing and closing up, no more pus</li>
            <li> weird new time of auto immune skin issue.</li>
            <li> If I use it on my whole face, it&#x27;ll dry my face out really bad.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in just a few days.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for something that wasn&#x27;t heavy or oily and this product is it.  </li>
            <li> Also, not sticky or too heavy.</li>
            <li> After a few days of use the rash is almost gone.</li>
            <li> After a round of antibiotics, my pd went away</li>
            <li> used to use it whenever it dried out on my skin.</li>
            <li> I was prescribed a few prescription creams which stopped working.</li>
            <li> While I find this product too heavy and greasy to use as a daily face moisturizer, it has become my go-to product to use in place of massage oils, which normally will cause my back and chest to break out terribly.  </li>
            <li> The smell to me isn&#x27;t awful at all nor is very strong.</li>
            <li> as all products like this claim it did help a little with some skin issues I have but not a miracle cure!</li>
            <li> I usually use an acne treatment on the areas it&#x27;s needed and then use this over it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit smelly, but it&#x27;s a small price to pay for this rash to fully disappear in a couple of weeks after struggling with this for over 5 years.</li>
            <li> Everyone said- hormones, I say they were too lazy to look into what was going on with me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It later, turned into extremely weird sections of abscesses, with hair follicles of course stuck in them</li>
            <li> I like Derma E in general but wasn&#x27;t crazy about this.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s been a hard adjustment.</li>
            <li> ; my skin didn&#x27;t react negatively in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was amazed as when this happens before it lasts for a couple of weeks and was usually getting worse and spreading not better.</li>
            <li> so I applied this in a thick layer all over the area three times per day.</li>
            <li> I recently had a small abcess/wound from a really bad acne flare</li>
            <li> However, this past season it got worse.</li>
            <li> I had a bad breakout on my neck and chin and was constantly itchy.</li>
            <li> I got diagnosed with perioral dermatitis in the beginning of the year and was having a tough time finding anything that didn&#x27;t irritate my poor face.</li>
            <li> I figured it couldn&#x27;t make things worse, so I tried it.</li>
            <li> My secret?</li>
            <li> But this year, it made it worse.</li>
            <li> Made it worse.</li>
            <li> The bumps have decreased in numbers as well.  </li>
            <li> No more!!!</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> , I was wrong again.</li>

            <li> I am so happy I found this creme. It smells awful, but it has cleared up the skin on my face when nothing else would. I use it everyday and my skin looks great.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Cleared up my dermatitis in no time! Miracle! Especially after everything I have tried! Just ordered more products from this line</li>
            <li> pros: Has tea tree oil. this is a creme base, which i think is better then the oil one. cons: takes a while for it to work, and still not sure if my skin a dry because of this creme</li>
            <li> So far, this is my favorite derma e product.  I love the texture and the smell.  Dry skin itch no more.  Also does seem to have some antibiotic properties.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I use it on my kids for bug bites and other skin ailments. I also use it for my toddler&#x27;s diaper rash. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;ll get rid of acne on its own, but it helps it a great deal. I usually use an acne treatment on the areas it&#x27;s needed and then use this over it. If I use it on my whole face, it&#x27;ll dry my face out really bad. The smell to me isn&#x27;t awful at all nor is very strong. The oil on the other hand is very strong and takes a long time for the smell to dissipate. It&#x27;s a lot of cream, so it&#x27;ll last for a long time! Great stuff with many uses!!</li>
            <li> This is my everything cream, the whole family uses it for any skin problem. You must have it in your medicine cabinet. I wish if it was a bit cheaper, but it is worth the money</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this! I got it for a persistent rash that would not go away.  This is the one product out of many that worked.  Since then I&#x27;ve used it for everything! Sunburn, bug bites, diaper rash... This stuff has amazing healing power.</li>
            <li> Cured a fungus rash that no doctor could ever get rid of. Thanks a million.</li>
            <li> as all products like this claim it did help a little with some skin issues I have but not a miracle cure!</li>
            <li> we had a bad case of mold in our home and even after the mold itself and all affected materials were removed, the mold lived on in our bodies. the molst annoying symptom was the itchy crawly feeling on my skin that worsened at night and was often bad enough to prevent even a horribly sleep-deprived mother of two from falling asleep or staying asleep. liberally applying this creme subdued the itching long enough for me to fall asleep, although it does nothing to address the larger problem which is being dealt with in the same manner that one deals with a candida infection.    this creme was also the only thing that i could put on my face (the mold was actually growing on my face at one point!) that did NOT further feed the fungus. everything else (coconut oil, pure vitamin e, burt&#x27;s bees rescue ointment, desert essence tea tree oil ointment...) just made the swelling, itching, and redness worse.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff! Helped cure my dry skin and helps keep my cellulitis at bay!</li>
            <li> I have very acne-prone and irritation-prone skin, esp on my face and back.  While I find this product too heavy and greasy to use as a daily face moisturizer, it has become my go-to product to use in place of massage oils, which normally will cause my back and chest to break out terribly.  This stuff maintains a nice, silky texture for massage, and doesn&#x27;t break me out.  Perfect!  I also have used it successfully as a hand moisturizer at times when I have cuts or scratches on my hands (I live with a recovering feral cat, so this happens often!) - it has helped to prevent infection while also keeping my hands moisturized, which is fantastic, since normally it is necessary to forgo any and all hand creams when I have cat scratches on my hands, because normally anything that retains moisture on the skin will also retain germs in the skin.  This has been a fantastic use for this product for me, because now I don&#x27;t have to suffer with dry, itchy, cracking skin on my hands while waiting for my cat scratches to heal!  Plus, no infected cat scratches, EVER, since using this product!</li>
            <li> If a woman sweats, the area under her lady lumps can develop an overgrowth of yeast. This becomes a very itchy rash, and extremely hard to get rid of, as the condition that creates it never goes away, especially during the summer months. I have used oatmeal soap, Gold Bond powder, athlete&#x27;s foot remedies, and gone to a doctor who gave me a prescription cream which initially worked, but my skin was too sensitive for long-term use and after initial good results, it came back and I had to stop using it because it stopped working and started to irritate my skin. I also all but boiled my bras in bleach and hypoallergenic detergents. Nothing worked for more than a short while, and any activity made it flare up for a week. It was extremely uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had heard of tea tree oil and wanted to use just that, but ran across this cream. I figured it couldn&#x27;t make things worse, so I tried it. Day and night I put it on. There&#x27;s a lot in the tub, so I was generous. I am extremely glad to say this worked where nothing else did. My skin cleared up, and the maddening itch went away. I now use it because I don&#x27;t want to see any sign of it coming back, not because it&#x27;s returning. Another great thing; my skin didn&#x27;t react negatively in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit smelly, but it&#x27;s a small price to pay for this rash to fully disappear in a couple of weeks after struggling with this for over 5 years.</li>
            <li> Bought this creme at Whole Foods for $21.95 - but I was desperate to find a product that would treat my eczema, rough red dry areas and not make my complexion look and feel worse.  Burt&#x27;s Bees actually caused my lips to blister and peel, so I was looking for a creme that had a simple list of ingredients, not a laundry list of botanicals, and contained tea tree oil.  Since I started using Skinbiotics,I&#x27;ve been thrilled with how my skin looks and feels. I use the creme at night and under sunscreen during the day.  Like other reviewers, I tried many products and most have only made my skin worse or feel greasy and unpleasant.  This creme rubs right in, feels mildly astringent and yes, has a tee tree odor, but given how nice my face looks, I&#x27;ll live with that one negative.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to treat a rash that has been on the back of my very athletic daughter&#x27;s legs for several months.  It started to become scabby and I got worried.  A PA that I work with suggested it was most likely some type of fungal infection, similar to athlete&#x27;s foot.  She recommended any over-the-counter anti-fungal or even Selsen Blue.  However, my skin is fairly sensitive to all of the additives in most junk on the market, so I purchased this product because it seemed to be the most natural.  It worked perfectly!  By the next day, her rash had shrunk by over half it&#x27;s size.  I&#x27;ve now used it on several abrasions, sunburns and other general owies.  It&#x27;s really helpful for all sorts of skin conditions.  It&#x27;s not very often I find a product like this that I&#x27;m just blown away by, so even though I didn&#x27;t buy it from Amazon (got it from a local natural foods store), I made a point to look for it to leave a review.</li>
            <li> I love it! A little bit goes a long way, and I love the smell. I feel like it has helped a few of my facial irritations.</li>
            <li> Seems to help kill skin bacteria. Also good for cuts. Has a nice clean smell. The first time I used it I could practically feel bacteria dying on my skin or something. Fairly natural.&lt;br /&gt;I use a D&#x27;arsonval device first, then this, to try to help with acne.</li>
            <li> Love this cream,its the best !</li>
            <li> How does this stuff work? It&#x27;s like magic! It takes away most every rash I have used it on!  It is like a jar of magic! I have very sensitive skin and have not had a problem using this. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have had problem facial skin my entire adult life: acne, dry patches, rashes, hyper-sensitivity, etc.  I have tried every high quality product you can imagine and nothing helped.  Then I found this product and the transformation has been stunning!  I noticed a difference in just a few days.  It is truly amazing stuff!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my (self-diagnosed) perioral dermatitis. I have dry/itchy patches around my mouth and nose. So far, I love it. The spots aren&#x27;t gone yet but rumor is, it gets worse before it gets better. I will post again in a month or so. Tea tree oil is a cure for so many ailments and this creme makes it the perfect consistency for this use.</li>
            <li> I am asked often how I maintain such amazingly soft and smooth skin. My secret? Organic, Cold-Pressed Coconut Oil applied immediately after my shower, followed by this Derma E product. I also use this when I have dry skin or irritations, and it works great. I love this product.</li>
            <li> I was using cyclimycin lotion from the doctor, and it was helping some for a mild case of folliculitis.  The results seemed to be just okay using the prescription lotion, so I did some more research online, and found several people mention the derma-e Skinbiotics Oil and also this cream.  I bought both - the oil and the cream.  While the smell is a bit strong, especially when you first apply it - the results are worth it!  Within just 3-4 days time of using the oil on my face (after washing it before bed) I started to see the redness and spots and inflammation reduced significantly!  It is a bit drying, and some flaking occurred, but as I wash off the flakes (a week later) the skin beneath is smooth is clear.  I think it may have been more fungal related, rather than bacterial.  (I think cyclimycin is more for bacterial issues). I am now switching between using the oil and the cream, as the cream seems a bit more moisturizing than just the straight oil.  It&#x27;s clearing nicely with very little irritation and much less redness.  It seems to be working much better for me than what the doctor prescribed, so I will stick with this, despite the strong smell.  (which does dissipate in a bit of time after the initial application.  If you aren&#x27;t allergic to the ingredients, it&#x27;s worth a try!  It&#x27;s really helping clear up my skin!  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that wasn&#x27;t heavy or oily and this product is it.  It was light and smelled good.</li>
            <li> I  have been meaning to leave a review on this. I literally waited 2 months, because I really wanted to make sure- it was working. THIS IS AMAZING. I have been battling a skin issue, NO DOCTOR NO DERMATOLOGIST. I never had acne- EVER, and all of a sudden , my skin started changed. Everyone said- hormones, I say they were too lazy to look into what was going on with me.&lt;br /&gt;It started kind of like an eczema rash, small, tight, burning itching red pimples. It later, turned into extremely weird sections of abscesses, with hair follicles of course stuck in them ( I assumed it was follicles ) I was wrong. I would get like gaping wholes, and boils, and it was HELL. My face would swell. With the boils, I thought it was MRSA, I was wrong again. I found out what I have is acne inversa- weird new time of auto immune skin issue. This is THE ONLY THING that has cleared it, and who ever invented this product, if I ever find you, I am going to hug you and kiss your feet, because your cream saved my face.&lt;br /&gt;SO THANK YOU.</li>
            <li> If you have ANY skin problems, this should be your go to product.  It clears or reduces several issues.  It does have a strong Tea Tree odor.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. It works very well on the eczema on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived well packed and very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> First off, It is much cheaper to purchase this on Amazon than in stores. This creme is good, you can definitely smell the tea tree in it; it takes  some getting used to but eventually it gets better. I was diagnosed with peri-oral dermatitis so my face was very irritated and itchy. This creme seemed to help. I use it at night after I cleanse my face and it has calmed my skin down.</li>
            <li> Silky smooth treatment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream for about two months now and I&#x27;m really not all that blown away by the lotion. I wanted a cream that contained Oil of Oregano and was happy to see that this not only contained the oregano oil, but tee tree oil as well. Both are great antiseptic agents and are known for their healing properties. The cream absorbs quickly, but unfortunately leaves behind a very strong medicinal smell that doesn&#x27;t subside for hours. Being highly sensitive to smells, I find this cream to be a bit overwhelming. Yes, both tee tree oil and oil of oregano are fragrant, and normally I don&#x27;t mind their smell - but those odors combined with the base of the cream is just a bit too much for my nose (and the noses of those around me who can&#x27;t seem to get away from the odor if I&#x27;m near them). I also didn&#x27;t find the cream to be any more healing/soothing than other over-the-counter lotions. I do like the Derma E products, but this is one that I won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.  It did not work for my psoriasis or dry skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream to use for when I get breakouts (I have mild acne), but I found it did a much better job preventing razor bumps and soothing itchy skin (I have horrible allergies). It has a light and creamy texture; it also moisturizes the skin well without drying it out. The only downside is that it can feel a little greasy, but it&#x27;s worth it as it&#x27;s really effective at helping a variety of skin ailments. I also love the smell! I rarely leave ratings on products; but this one totally deserves another good review!</li>
            <li> Miracle cream! I had a 20-year-old condition that involved excrutiatingly itchy bumps and that left me with scars up and down my arms, back, neck, etc, kept me up at night, and forced me to wear long-sleeved tops even in the hottest months. Five dermatologists diagnosed it incorrectly. Eventually, an allergist identified a sensitivity to candida, and my research showed me that oil of oregano is as effective at killing candida as the much more expensive and toxic prescrtiption drugs. Since you don&#x27;t want to put full-strenth oil of oregano on your skin (burns), and since I didn&#x27;t want my skin to be oily or stain my clothes, I looked until I found this cream. Bought one jar. Within three days, there was no more itching, the lesions I had were healing, and new ones now are rare. The cream smells nice, absorbs beautifully and has my skin looking better than it has looked in forever. Thank you, Derma E, for putting an end to my two-decades skin nightmare!    UPDATE: I now use this amazing product under my arms, where I got frequent infected hair follicles and ingrown hairs after shaving. No more!!! And the ingredients also are very effective at reducing odor -- a plus since I live in Flroid</li>
            <li> Love this stuff... Works nicely and was shipped quickly</li>
            <li> Seriously good stuff. Razor burn, bug bites, fungus, chronic acne -- all bow down in trembling fear before the awesome power of this cr&amp;egrave;me. Also, not sticky or too heavy.</li>
            <li> Does a good job, but not sure it helps peripheral dermatitis which was why I bought it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the redness we big busted ladies get under our breasts in the summer, but it also works on acne and any other skin condition you can think of.  It *does* have an oregano smell to it, but who cares.  It is the only thing that works, and it works well and fast!</li>
            <li> I had to write a review for this stuff because it&#x27;s so awesome for a multitude of conditions. You can literally put it on anything and it will help heal it. I had a really bad breakout caused by an allergic reaction to a medication I was on and NOTHING was clearing it up. It was just taking it&#x27;s sweet time going away the longer I was off the meds. Well, I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week and my skin is almost back to normal. It&#x27;s amazing. I&#x27;ve also used it for a rash my son developed on his legs and it began healing it in ONE use. After a few days of use the rash is almost gone. My sister has been using the oil and has noticed a major improvement in her skin also. The cream also helps dry skin. I had been developing dry patches from using Peter Thomas Roth Therapeutic Sulfur Mask (which is awesome) and this lotion made it a thing of the past. Even my husband said my skin looked good. I use the lotion for just a regular moisturizer too for my hands and it&#x27;s great. I want to buy this by the bucketful.</li>
            <li> I work at Whole Foods and have recently started using this product for acne. I came on Amazon to see if I could get it cheaper and decided to leave a review. I have tried everything internally and externally to help my acne. This stuff is the only thing that has ever worked. I also use their scar gel too with the cream after I shower in the morning. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and the smell is awesome and clean. Finally!!!</li>
            <li> Improved skin problem.</li>
            <li> I got diagnosed with perioral dermatitis in the beginning of the year and was having a tough time finding anything that didn&#x27;t irritate my poor face. I decided to give this a go since the description made me think that it might help my skin. Sadly this wasn&#x27;t the answer to my prayers. It stung and made my pd flair up more.  After a round of antibiotics, my pd went away and I decided to give this another try. It&#x27;s ok. It smells strongly of tee tree oil and is on the thick side. I don&#x27;t love it but will occasionally use it before bedtime, not in the morning though because I don&#x27;t like the way this sits under makeup. I like Derma E in general but wasn&#x27;t crazy about this.</li>
            <li> My Husband really like this cream he get a lot of cuts and sore and this seem to help him when i get sores i use it also seem to work well</li>
            <li> I have had a rash on my face every winter for years. It started small and would only get a little bit bigger every season. However, this past season it got worse. Of course I used OTC hydrocortisone cream which I swear used to work. But this year, it made it worse. I went to my doctor and asked for something and he gave me the super strength steroid cream. Made it worse. It was horrible and incredibly embarrassing! So I did my own research and pretty much self diagnosed it as perioral dermatitis. It had all the features. Burns when sweating, red and bumpy, peeling, going around the mouth/nose only. It was almost making its way up towards my eye and I&#x27;ve seen those pictures. It&#x27;s horribly embarrassing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I researched everything I could. Read it was yeast related so I stopped sugars as much as I could. Still was there. I didn&#x27;t even want to go to work. I stopped make up completely and tried other lotions. Still didn&#x27;t work. I completely changed soaps (changed to dove for my face since I was using acne wash) and backed off washing my face in the morning, that way the oils from the night would lubricate the rash. That was the only thing that seemed to help to cover it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not about to go into antibiotics as some dermatologists just do. Because antibiotics &#x3D; yeast infections for me and if there&#x27;s some correlation then I am not chancing that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then I found this lotion and oh. My. God. It worked out. I don&#x27;t have as bad of a problem now. It burns a little because of the tea tree oil and the odor is strong. But I&#x27;m used to tea tree oil lotions (the body shop has a good lotion with tea tree oil). It&#x27;s not horrible smelling, just almost citrusy/spicy without it being a citrus scent or something. It has oregano oil in it which was strong. I&#x27;m not too concerned about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use it whenever it dried out on my skin. Now I don&#x27;t really use it. Mostly when I remember, haha. If I do, it&#x27;s after I wash my face when I showerat night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has definitely improved, I&#x27;m praying that it stays this way throughout the winter. But anyway, tldr... This lotion is fantastic! If you are looking for a way to get rid of perioral dermatitis or managing it better than before, I would use this and other tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Change soaps, eliminate sulfates and other chemicals like that for your shampoo or conditioner (ideally eliminate conditioner as it can make your hair oily and cause oily skin), use fluoride free toothpaste (I use Jason&#x27;s Sea Fresh natural paste which is also like SLS free), try cutting back on washing your face if possible, propose a change of laundry detergent to something less harsh is possible (or just change your pillow case frequently as saliva and oils from your hair could agitate the POD), drink lots of water, and cut back on sugars (maybe that&#x27;s just me). I&#x27;ve had a lot more success doing these life style changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Used it for years! Great all around cream for burns itches bites, as a face cream etc. At 4oz its a nice sizednjar of product no skimping. Dont miff a higher price, its hard to find and sells out fast.</li>
            <li> I bought this creme for my perioral dermatitis (extreme dry skin around the mouth and at sides of nose with blister-like raised bumps).  After about a month of using it 2x a day I can say that it has definitely alleviated the situation.  The pinkness ant itchiness has gone away for the most part.  The bumps have decreased in numbers as well.  A month in, it hasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;cured&amp;#34; me, but from what I can tell it has helped significantly.  Before, I would put make up on top of the rash (I know, I know, you&#x27;re not supposed to) but it was so crusty that you could still see the bad texture of the rash under the make up.  Now, for the most part it doesn&#x27;t look like I have a rash at all.  If I stopped using it for a couple days though, the rash would come back.  The amount in the jar is very generous too, this will last you a long time.  Still dealing with a couple bumps and minor flakiness, but I would highly recommend this creme.</li>
            <li> This is used to help scalp psoriasis flare up. Works great, but has strong unpleasant odor from the tea tree oil ingredient.</li>
            <li> I was new to Derma-E products, and thought I would try their line of products. A few days after I had received this product, I noticed on the inside of my ear, a bleeding open area, Keratosis my doctor thought. I put some of this cream on, and the next day I saw healing happening, and by 4 days it was totally healed over, not even the redness was there from the tissue healing, but scare tissue was, to be expected.  I was amazed as when this happens before it lasts for a couple of weeks and was usually getting worse and spreading not better. It does have a tea tree oil smell, but I do not mind it at all.  I highly recommend this product.  I am also using the derma e derma e DMAE-Alpha Lipoic-C-Ester Firming Toner and DMAE - Alpha Lipoic - C-Ester Retexturizing Creme by Derma-E. This DMAE - Alpha Lipoic cream has a slight sting to it when putting it on but subsides totally in a couple of minutes, so I recommend not putting it near the eyes.  My friend made a comment on how smooth my skin was looking in only after 3 days of using it and was wondering what I was using on my face.  I have been using it now for about a month and can really see the different in the texture of my skin and my lines around my mouth, I am 56 years old.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this stuff for her acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I first was introduced to this cream after a bikini wax. They advised me to apply it to the area to reduce irritation and minimize chances of in-growns. They also gave me a sample size pack to re-apply at home and I happened to read the back that it could be used for much more than post bikini waxing. I get small break outs from time to time and I also have slight rosacea in places as well as dry patches during the winter months. I apply this on my face every night and I have not had a single blemish or problem area on my face since then. It slightly tingles when I put it on which I find refreshing. Yes, you can smell the oregano, but the smell dissipates after it absorbs and I quickly forget about it ever smelling when someone comments on how great my skin looks. I have been using it daily for a couple of months and I get a comment about my skin several times a week. I have used this on bug bites and sunburns with almost immediate relief. You will not regret buying this cream. I promise!</li>
            <li> I used to break out in boils on my chest from the heat and this treatment creme prevents them from occurring.  I use this creme under Zeasob powder and I have been boil free for over a year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of tea tree oil and it&#x27;s versatility for a while. I like the cream form of this, not as drying as justvtsavtree oil, but have to say it does smell pungent, and kind of Italian food like with the oregano oil. Other than that, it works quickly for a variety of skin needs. Great to have on hand</li>
            <li> great product, works well.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle. My acne sometimes gets infected. I was prescribed a few prescription creams which stopped working. I recently had a small abcess/wound from a really bad acne flare and I started getting nervous. I remembered I had this in my bathroom drawer so I applied this in a thick layer all over the area three times per day. By the end of the first day it was no longer painful and by the second day was already healing and closing up, no more pus and then pink skin started started showing which is a sign of healing. For my skin, this was better than antibiotic creams.</li>
            <li> I used this in conjunction with hydrocortisone cream and it seams to work pretty well. The relief I get from this cream does not last as long as another brand I recently purchased from Amazon. However, for some, this may work for other minor skin problems. I have some neuropathy problems over my whole body with itching and a burning pin prick sensation which is hard to control.</li>
            <li> Great product, excellent price, and fast delivery. All Good.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream because I heard that oregano and tea tree oil was effective in helping alleviate ezcema symptoms. I had a bad breakout on my neck and chin and was constantly itchy. The minute I applied it, it didn&#x27;t itch and it stopped the itching.  Within a few days the itch went away completely and the redness eased a bit.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a week now and most of the breakout is gone. My skin is smooth but there are still some redness, but overall I am very pleased to have found a natural solution to my skin issues, instead of the pricy steroid creams. This cream is definitely a good bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> I have had a lot of skin problems for the last couple of years since my 4th pregnancy. I had pretty good skin when I was younger so it&#x27;s been a hard adjustment. I also have very sensitive skin so a lot of stuff will fix one problem but create another. I have mostly been dealing with hormonal breakouts and cystic acne on my cheeks. I&#x27;ve tried dozens of different cleansers and creams, medicated and not. I really HATE the smell of tea tree oil but after battling this for so long I decided to take a chance on derma e&#x27;s tea tree and e cleanser after coming across it at a store. Within a week I could see a lot of improvement so I decided that I needed to get a moisturizer to pair with it. I decided to look online instead of buying the regular tea tree cream and came across this. I liked that it also had oil of oregano so I went with this. I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week with the cleanser and most of my acne has already cleared up with no new issues being caused by the products. Since the product is technically a &amp;#34;treatment cream&amp;#34; for bacteria, fungus, wounds, etc. I&#x27;ve also tried it on my 2 year old when she started to get a diaper rash. She is very prone to yeast and bacterial infections that sometimes take weeks to clear. Her new rash was starting to look like a bad one she got a few months back so I used this before bed. There was barely a pink spot there when she woke up. This stuff is fantastic, I highly recommend it. I will be making sure I never run out of it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from another online store.&lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed to find the consistency to be that of a liquid.&lt;br /&gt;Contacted Derma-e and they said I had an old batch.......&lt;br /&gt;Remember, natural products usually don&#x27;t have a long shelf life.&lt;br /&gt;They sent a replacement next day air!  No questions, no problem.&lt;br /&gt;Derma-e has acquired a customer for life.&lt;br /&gt;I have learned to only buy from the Derma-e web site or from a&lt;br /&gt;supplier that moves a great deal of products.....like Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;No more &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; product for me.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, the product itself is wonderful....just as everyone has said.&lt;br /&gt;I like that it has anti fungal properties......that actually work.</li>
