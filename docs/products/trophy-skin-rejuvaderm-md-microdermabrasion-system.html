            <li>Rejuvaderm is fantastic product!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how smooth it feels after a treatment.  </li>
            <li>I feel confident that I will be using this for years to come.  </li>
            <li>I hope my review helps others who may not be sure about trying this product.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and I saw noticeable results in the softness of my skin as well as fine lines and wrinkles on my forehead and around my eyes!  </li>
            <li>My skin felt softer and I found myself feeling more comfortable going without make up more often.</li>
            <li>My make up went on more smoothly</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m pretty impressed.  </li>
            <li>The microdermasion machine is lightweight, easy to use, easy to maintain.</li>
            <li>Easy and intuitive.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s a huge difference.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve got great skin.&amp;#34; My skin was ok before but between using this and one  of those motorized low cost circular brushes with some good facial cleanser</li>
            <li>my make up went on smoothly, which is the result I am used to from microdermabrasion.</li>
            <li>MD is fantastic and keeps my skin radiant and glowing.</li>
            <li>a week head to toe and have significantly lightened freckles and age spots as well as keeping fine lines at bay.</li>
            <li>The microdermabrasion is smoothing out my fine lines and wrinkles and also makes my skin feel really clean.  </li>
            <li>In reading the other testimonials and reviews, I wasn&#x27;t completely sure that I would be happy with purchasing a product like the Rejuvaderm MD, but....</li>
            <li>Scared at first because if you don&#x27;t do it right you can have big problems, but it was wonderful!</li>
            <li>I am so impressed with what this little machine does to my skin!  </li>
            <li>I have Trophy Skins original microdermabrasion machine.</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Also purchased an ultrasonic jewelry cleaner to clean the diamond tip as needed and this has worked like a charm.</li>
            <li>It is simple to use, effective and has done wonders for my fine and not so fine wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>Use the lowest setting first to become comfortable with using the product, then bump up the power as you see fit.  </li>
            <li>and my face has improved so much :)</li>
            <li>Super noisy and did not even try it as I know</li>
            <li>and I can see a tremendous difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t mind paying a few dollars more for an intuitive, easy-to-use product that provides good results.  </li>
            <li>I now have a more clear and radiant youthful face!</li>
            <li>After each session my skin was very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Great little device for home use.  </li>
            <li>If you really want a good exfoliation, you should definitely get a at home peel to exfoliate from below and</li>
            <li>have only had it for a week but its really nice and can see some improvements already.  </li>
            <li>When you are done with your session you can SEE the results right there on the filter.</li>
            <li>I did feel the results right away.</li>
            <li>Therefore, I tend to accumulate more dead skin cells than most people.</li>
            <li>I have only used the lowest setting and it is amazing how much skin was in the filter.</li>
            <li>Personally, I think that&#x27;s fine as that allows me to see the results, but if you think you won&#x27;t clean it don&#x27;t buy this device.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t honestly say how much the product is helping or whether it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve incorporated it into a more in-depth, daily facial routine now.</li>
            <li>For the future, I hope that trophy skin comes out with better diamond tips.</li>
            <li>They forewarn you that you might have a temporary reddening of the areas treated, but I found none of that to be the case even with the higher settings.</li>
            <li>After the first use, I could see and feel a difference.</li>
            <li>After using it on a regular basis, I noticed more improvements.</li>
            <li>Definitely seeing a difference and what&#x27;s even better; my friends have noticed a difference without me even soliciting an opinion from them.</li>
            <li>Glad I finally tried this.</li>
            <li>I will update my review more later.</li>
            <li>Very well made and worth the money.</li>
            <li>There were accidently two of these delivered and the first one I opened didn&#x27;t have the filters in the box.</li>
            <li>I definitely think it is better than the non- diamond head devices on the market</li>
            <li>If it does not keep removing skin after the first use I will return it, but I am hoping it is just a slower milder process</li>
            <li>I have only use it twice, but my skin looks and feels better.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the Stem Cell Serum, and may not, but I do use coconut oil as a moisturizer, and after each treatment, my skin soaks it up better than it did prior to doing any treatments.  </li>
            <li>My crows feet are noticeably less and even my husband the other day commented on how wonderful my skins looks!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it a few times now and love the way it&#x27;s clearing up my skin!  </li>
            <li>The new machine is even better, which I did not think possible!</li>
            <li>I have to say, that I have only had mine a week; and have only used it 3 times, and I love it!  </li>
            <li>so its really $300 bucks.</li>
            <li>I got the device straight off trophy skin October of 2014.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really tried the blackhead suction head that comes with the device.     </li>
            <li>If it lasts for more than 2 years then I would say that it was money well spent.</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant in buying and using this item.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I really needed something to exfoliate and resurface.</li>
            <li>I really like this device.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping ~ highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel much softer after use</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also lightweight and doesn&#x27;t take up much room in the cabinet.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;But I&#x27;m really stunned at how much difference just two treatments in one week can make.</li>
            <li>with all of these type of devices, it takes time to see real results.</li>
            <li>so I bought this intense moisturizer called Vichy night cream which seems to counteract the dryness.  </li>
            <li>i really feel and see a difference in my face and neck.</li>
            <li>I real treat for your face and neck...</li>
            <li>I originally purchased another brand which came with a rather large vacuum cleaner.</li>
            <li>I am not 100% certain that this product will bring my skin back to what it used to look like when I was 20, but with this being the very first time I have tried microdermabrasion, I don&#x27;t really know.  </li>
            <li>The machine is easy to use and small enough to store away easily!</li>
            <li>What I do know is, that this product is super easy to use, is not uncomfortable, and seems to be working (or at least doing what it is supposed to).  </li>
            <li>2nd day its amazing little machine worth the money.</li>
            <li>It takes off the dead skin, lessens fine lines and made the dark spots almost disappear :) also my pores are smaller, my makeup goes on so much better now.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve starting using this I&#x27;ve noticed my fine lines are slowly but surely disappearing as well as my blemishes are fading fast!  </li>
            <li>You need to be careful with the settings or you will scratch, but it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s simple to use and the delivery was extremely quick.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to everyone because it saves you time and money for going to the derma.</li>
            <li>I would personally highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I did not find it as easy to use as other reviewers did.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much Trophy Skin for making this product I am 40 years old now</li>
            <li>My skin condition is combination, meaning an oily T zone but normal everywhere else.</li>
            <li>Before using it, my skin was more textured and uneven.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li>/Age spots have reduced significantly, my smile lines are thinner, my skin looks healthier and much younger.  </li>
            <li>The Rejuvaderm MD is sloughing off the dead skin cells, and I think given some time, my skin will look better than it has in years.  </li>
            <li>I use it everyday and really can see a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>but the first time I used it my skin was definitely smoother.</li>
            <li>I have some fine lines and hyperpigmentation and this little machine works wonders.  </li>
            <li>Also, although I changed the filters after each use and cleared out the tube, I was VERY surprised when I put it in an ultrasonic cleaner after only 5 uses that there was so much residue.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the skin&#x27;s natural reaction to the stimulation.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s completely portable 3)</li>
            <li>No regrets for buying this product!!!</li>
            <li>My pores weren&#x27;t so big, I had no rough texture at all, my scars were fading, my skin looked more even, and I was noticing less breakouts.</li>
            <li>I actually clean mine every time I use my Rejuvaderm to get the dead skin cells off of the tips.</li>
            <li>The device does fill up with dead skin after one use so you have to take it apart and clean it thoroughly.</li>
            <li>I got it several weeks ago and finally started using it around the first week of May &#x27;14.</li>
            <li>This is a solid product and I highly recommend it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because by following the guidelines of using one filter per session, this could really be a costly proposition over time, given the price of extra filters.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it on my 12 year old and my 8 year old around his nose (only).</li>
            <li>I used to have fine lines under and around my eyes that are now hardly visible.  </li>
            <li>Be aware that it DOES NOT come with the other two tips as I assumed from the picture.  </li>
            <li>I used it right away and faithfully for a few months.  </li>
            <li>and I am hoping with continued use I will see more dramatic</li>
            <li>really like the fact that the wool filters are black.</li>
            <li>but I have not used it long enough to know if it will change any areas of dark spots or change the appearance of large pores.  </li>

            <li> have only had it for a week but its really nice and can see some improvements already.  </li>
            <li> When you are done with your session you can SEE the results right there on the filter.</li>
            <li> I did feel the results right away.</li>
            <li> Therefore, I tend to accumulate more dead skin cells than most people.</li>
            <li> I have only used the lowest setting and it is amazing how much skin was in the filter.</li>
            <li> Personally, I think that&#x27;s fine as that allows me to see the results, but if you think you won&#x27;t clean it don&#x27;t buy this device.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t honestly say how much the product is helping or whether it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve incorporated it into a more in-depth, daily facial routine now.</li>
            <li> For the future, I hope that trophy skin comes out with better diamond tips.</li>
            <li> They forewarn you that you might have a temporary reddening of the areas treated, but I found none of that to be the case even with the higher settings.</li>
            <li> After the first use, I could see and feel a difference.</li>
            <li> After using it on a regular basis, I noticed more improvements.</li>
            <li> Definitely seeing a difference and what&#x27;s even better; my friends have noticed a difference without me even soliciting an opinion from them.</li>
            <li> Glad I finally tried this.</li>
            <li> I will update my review more later.</li>
            <li> Very well made and worth the money.</li>
            <li> There were accidently two of these delivered and the first one I opened didn&#x27;t have the filters in the box.</li>
            <li> I definitely think it is better than the non- diamond head devices on the market</li>
            <li> If it does not keep removing skin after the first use I will return it, but I am hoping it is just a slower milder process</li>
            <li> I have only use it twice, but my skin looks and feels better.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the Stem Cell Serum, and may not, but I do use coconut oil as a moisturizer, and after each treatment, my skin soaks it up better than it did prior to doing any treatments.  </li>
            <li> My crows feet are noticeably less and even my husband the other day commented on how wonderful my skins looks!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times now and love the way it&#x27;s clearing up my skin!  </li>
            <li> The new machine is even better, which I did not think possible!</li>
            <li> I have to say, that I have only had mine a week; and have only used it 3 times, and I love it!  </li>
            <li> so its really $300 bucks.</li>
            <li> I got the device straight off trophy skin October of 2014.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really tried the blackhead suction head that comes with the device.     </li>
            <li> If it lasts for more than 2 years then I would say that it was money well spent.</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant in buying and using this item.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I really needed something to exfoliate and resurface.</li>
            <li> I really like this device.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping ~ highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel much softer after use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also lightweight and doesn&#x27;t take up much room in the cabinet.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;But I&#x27;m really stunned at how much difference just two treatments in one week can make.</li>
            <li> with all of these type of devices, it takes time to see real results.</li>
            <li> so I bought this intense moisturizer called Vichy night cream which seems to counteract the dryness.  </li>
            <li> i really feel and see a difference in my face and neck.</li>
            <li> I real treat for your face and neck...</li>
            <li> I originally purchased another brand which came with a rather large vacuum cleaner.</li>
            <li> I am not 100% certain that this product will bring my skin back to what it used to look like when I was 20, but with this being the very first time I have tried microdermabrasion, I don&#x27;t really know.  </li>
            <li> The machine is easy to use and small enough to store away easily!</li>
            <li> What I do know is, that this product is super easy to use, is not uncomfortable, and seems to be working (or at least doing what it is supposed to).  </li>
            <li> 2nd day its amazing little machine worth the money.</li>
            <li> It takes off the dead skin, lessens fine lines and made the dark spots almost disappear :) also my pores are smaller, my makeup goes on so much better now.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve starting using this I&#x27;ve noticed my fine lines are slowly but surely disappearing as well as my blemishes are fading fast!  </li>
            <li> You need to be careful with the settings or you will scratch, but it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Still, it&#x27;s simple to use and the delivery was extremely quick.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to everyone because it saves you time and money for going to the derma.</li>
            <li> I would personally highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I did not find it as easy to use as other reviewers did.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much Trophy Skin for making this product I am 40 years old now</li>
            <li> My skin condition is combination, meaning an oily T zone but normal everywhere else.</li>
            <li> Before using it, my skin was more textured and uneven.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li> /Age spots have reduced significantly, my smile lines are thinner, my skin looks healthier and much younger.  </li>
            <li> The Rejuvaderm MD is sloughing off the dead skin cells, and I think given some time, my skin will look better than it has in years.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday and really can see a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> but the first time I used it my skin was definitely smoother.</li>
            <li> I have some fine lines and hyperpigmentation and this little machine works wonders.  </li>
            <li> Also, although I changed the filters after each use and cleared out the tube, I was VERY surprised when I put it in an ultrasonic cleaner after only 5 uses that there was so much residue.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the skin&#x27;s natural reaction to the stimulation.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s completely portable 3)</li>
            <li> No regrets for buying this product!!!</li>
            <li> My pores weren&#x27;t so big, I had no rough texture at all, my scars were fading, my skin looked more even, and I was noticing less breakouts.</li>
            <li> I actually clean mine every time I use my Rejuvaderm to get the dead skin cells off of the tips.</li>
            <li> The device does fill up with dead skin after one use so you have to take it apart and clean it thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I got it several weeks ago and finally started using it around the first week of May &#x27;14.</li>
            <li> This is a solid product and I highly recommend it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because by following the guidelines of using one filter per session, this could really be a costly proposition over time, given the price of extra filters.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on my 12 year old and my 8 year old around his nose (only).</li>
            <li> I used to have fine lines under and around my eyes that are now hardly visible.  </li>
            <li> Be aware that it DOES NOT come with the other two tips as I assumed from the picture.  </li>
            <li> I used it right away and faithfully for a few months.  </li>
            <li> and I am hoping with continued use I will see more dramatic</li>
            <li> really like the fact that the wool filters are black.</li>
            <li> but I have not used it long enough to know if it will change any areas of dark spots or change the appearance of large pores.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is normal to get some slight tingling and / or redness on the treated areas.</li>
            <li> I do have one particular trouble spot (my T Zone) and it seems to be helping control my pores in that area.</li>
            <li> If for any reason you are not satisfied with your home beauty device, we&#x27;ll send you a full refund (less shipping &amp; handling fees).</li>
            <li> I used only once a week though cause I have limited time.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money as far as I was concerned.</li>
            <li> am a very pale skinned women of Irish decent and I didn&#x27;t have any of the red marks or problems other reviewers mentioned, but perhaps that is because I was careful and moved the device over the skin rather than let it rest in any one spot.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Rejuvaderm on the other hand is about the size of an electric toothbrush and has 5 built-in vacuum intensity settings.</li>
            <li> I give it 5 stars only because I have nothing negative to say after only 5 days.  </li>
            <li> Love it using now for about 2 weeks such noticeable glow and it slowly with each use getting rid of a scar I have between my eyes that stinks</li>
            <li> but overall I can&#x27;t believe how much dead skin cones off my face</li>
            <li> I include this process in my daily routine everyday.</li>
            <li> My skin seems to look a little rough and flaky for a few days following treatment</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the one under gilt has the same return policy though.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this every other day for two weeks</li>
            <li> I have only used it once, so not sure about results as of yet.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money</li>
            <li> have used it about 7 times and the diamond tip is already worn down and thus ineffective.</li>
            <li> My skin is clearer, brighter and less lines.</li>
            <li> So check before you use the device.&lt;br /&gt;I use to get microdermabrasion at the dermatologist and this device works but removes less layers of skin.</li>
            <li> The unit works by sucking up your skin and pulling it against the rough diamond surface surrounding the small opening.  </li>
            <li> little by little it&#x27;s getting to those surfaces , so those areas can get treatment.</li>
            <li> It took me a little to get used to it and</li>
            <li> A little pricier than some</li>
            <li> I could tell a difference within a few days of using it.</li>
            <li> however it dried my skin a bit</li>
            <li> 4 people in the past week and a half have said, &amp;#34;you&#x27;re 56?</li>
            <li> I noticed a small difference after the few use but nothing since then.</li>
            <li> Some discoloration seemed to fade, and my skin looked fresher, less dull.  </li>
            <li> I tried using it for a week but saw no real difference except a few broken capillaries which made me stop immediately.</li>
            <li> My skin complexion is hard to maintain and have had trouble all my life with blackheads, and sores and scars.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable results.  </li>
            <li> It has cleared up some small acne areas and literally has made extracting a breeze.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s $100 less expensive 2)</li>
            <li> I found this machine very hard on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> I called him dirty little nose before we received this device.  </li>
            <li> but I also bought the replacement and they send me the wrong one.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it died after 4 treatments.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I am EXTREMELY skeptical about buying products that know nothing about.  </li>
            <li> Worst case, send it back!</li>
            <li> Buy one you can not go wrong!!!</li>
            <li> I have horrible acne scarring and decades of sun damage on my chest and neck.  </li>
            <li> As damaged as my skin is, I figured that the worst that could happen is that it would stay damaged.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> After two applications of Rejuvaderm MD, I have seen the difference on my face. My skin has gotten smoother. I am satisfied with the performance of this. It&#x27;s very handy and easy to use. I highly recommend this to everyone because it saves you time and money for going to the derma.</li>
            <li> Love it using now for about 2 weeks such noticeable glow and it slowly with each use getting rid of a scar I have between my eyes that stinks forcwiman cause we battle wrinkles there with the madwrma what a difference already but overall I can&#x27;t believe how much dead skin cones off my face I use approx 2 to 3 tines a week and try not to use night before I have an event next day for renewal..just might be me but 2nd day its amazing little machine worth the money. My only thing was that it should of cone with precision &amp; body tip for price. that&#x27;s another $50 bucks for each tip so its really $300 bucks. I just got precision tip, but  I&#x27;ll have to wait till next month for the body tip.</li>
            <li> I did not find it as easy to use as other reviewers did. Also, although I changed the filters after each use and cleared out the tube, I was VERY surprised when I put it in an ultrasonic cleaner after only 5 uses that there was so much residue.  I cannot imagine only cleaning it with an ultrasonic cleaner once every 6 months. Perhaps that is why one of the reviewers felt it lost it&#x27;s effectiveness after a short time.</li>
            <li> I got the device straight off trophy skin October of 2014. I&#x27;ve gotten micros at spas for years now. I wanted something I could use at home to save time and money.    I would like to start off by saying that everyone&#x27;s skin is different. Something that works for me may not necessarily work out for you. Therefore, take what I say with a grain of salt.    My skin condition is combination, meaning an oily T zone but normal everywhere else. Therefore, I tend to accumulate more dead skin cells than most people. All in all, I truly like this product. It does what it says that it does. Definitely get the ultrasonic jewelry cleaner. I actually clean mine every time I use my Rejuvaderm to get the dead skin cells off of the tips. You don&#x27;t want to scrub it with anything bc you run the risk of brushing off the diamond crystals as well. I use mine once a week. The device helps to pull the blackheads out but it is not a miracle worker. The only way to get rid of blackheads is with a combo of the device&#x27;s suction and then a peel or extraction. I haven&#x27;t really tried the blackhead suction head that comes with the device.     IT doesn&#x27;t hurt to give this product a try. You can return it in 30 days if you don&#x27;t like it. Its on sale on Gilt for 125 too. I&#x27;m not sure if the one under gilt has the same return policy though.    If you really want a good exfoliation, you should definitely get a at home peel to exfoliate from below and then Rejuvaderm to exfoliate from above.    For the future, I hope that trophy skin comes out with better diamond tips. If it lasts for more than 2 years then I would say that it was money well spent.</li>
            <li> Product works great! Love how it makes my skin feel. Started with level 2 and didn&#x27;t see any redness.</li>
            <li> I got this product through a Groupon so I am told its non-refundable although their website says: All devices purchased from TrophySkin.com are covered under Our 30 Day Guarantee. If for any reason you are not satisfied with your home beauty device, we&#x27;ll send you a full refund (less shipping &amp; handling fees). Simply contact us within 30 days from your date of purchase to initiate your return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it about 7 times and the diamond tip is already worn down and thus ineffective. I noticed a small difference after the few use but nothing since then. Not worth the money plus I cant get a refund.</li>
            <li> Great, great product! I have some fine lines and hyperpigmentation and this little machine works wonders.  I&#x27;ve used it a few times now and love the way it&#x27;s clearing up my skin!  Very happy with the results!</li>
            <li> I loved the product! but I also bought the replacement and they send me the wrong one. I asked the one for the face and they send me the one for the body. NOT THAT GOOD</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product for two weeks so I can&#x27;t honestly say how much the product is helping or whether it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve incorporated it into a more in-depth, daily facial routine now. I do have one particular trouble spot (my T Zone) and it seems to be helping control my pores in that area. There are four settings and they suggest beginners start with the lowest or second lowest setting. I use the second and third settings with no problems. They forewarn you that you might have a temporary reddening of the areas treated, but I found none of that to be the case even with the higher settings. I gave it 4 stars because by following the guidelines of using one filter per session, this could really be a costly proposition over time, given the price of extra filters. Still, it&#x27;s simple to use and the delivery was extremely quick.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any change from this product.</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant in buying and using this item. However, once I did, I was relieved. The microdermasion machine is lightweight, easy to use, easy to maintain. I love it. I could tell a difference within a few days of using it. My skin complexion is hard to maintain and have had trouble all my life with blackheads, and sores and scars. I include this process in my daily routine everyday. I don&#x27;t know what I did before this came along (well, I almost pulled my hair out, and I intend on not living with it either.</li>
            <li> Great product. Lot of suction. Works perfectly.  Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the RejuvadermMD for quite some now. Before using it, my skin was more textured and uneven. I also had enlarged pores and some scarring.  I really needed something to exfoliate and resurface. After the first use, I could see and feel a difference. My skin was already smoother. After using it on a regular basis, I noticed more improvements. My pores weren&#x27;t so big, I had no rough texture at all, my scars were fading, my skin looked more even, and I was noticing less breakouts. I&#x27;m still using it and my skin is still in great condition.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product a week but the first time I used it my skin was definitely smoother. The instructions are very easy to read too. No regrets for buying this product!!!</li>
            <li> I got it several weeks ago and finally started using it around the first week of May &#x27;14. Easy and intuitive. Instructions are simple to follow. I originally purchased another brand which came with a rather large vacuum cleaner. Super noisy and did not even try it as I know I would never continue with something as bulky as that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rejuvaderm on the other hand is about the size of an electric toothbrush and has 5 built-in vacuum intensity settings. Definitely recommend starting on lowest setting. I&#x27;ve been using around my former crowsfeet and on some discolorations on my cheeks (face not butt - hehe). Definitely seeing a difference and what&#x27;s even better; my friends have noticed a difference without me even soliciting an opinion from them. 4 people in the past week and a half have said, &amp;#34;you&#x27;re 56? no you&#x27;re not. you&#x27;ve got great skin.&amp;#34; My skin was ok before but between using this and one  of those motorized low cost circular brushes with some good facial cleanser there&#x27;s a huge difference. Complexion is more evened out than ever and my skin just looks really good. This is a solid product and I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is normal to get some slight tingling and / or redness on the treated areas. That&#x27;s normal. It&#x27;s just the skin&#x27;s natural reaction to the stimulation. Goes away in a day or so. Glad I finally tried this. I&#x27;m a believer. You rock Rejuvaderm.</li>
            <li> I would personally highly recommend this product.  Since I&#x27;ve starting using this I&#x27;ve noticed my fine lines are slowly but surely disappearing as well as my blemishes are fading fast!  I used to have fine lines under and around my eyes that are now hardly visible.  I love the convenience of having it here at my house and I&#x27;ve been doing it 3, sometimes 4 times a week.</li>
            <li> I really like this device. It&#x27;s really effective. I&#x27;ve used it on my 12 year old and my 8 year old around his nose (only). I called him dirty little nose before we received this device.  As for myself I have some acne scarring&lt;br /&gt;and little by little it&#x27;s getting to those surfaces , so those areas can get treatment.</li>
            <li> My skin is clearer, brighter and less lines. Very easy to use and its the perfect size. Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Love this! Fast shipping ~ highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really liked the device but unfortunately it died after 4 treatments.</li>
            <li> This unit is very easy to use. My skin felt softer and I found myself feeling more comfortable going without make up more often. My make up went on more smoothly and I noticed a difference in the softness of my skin. Would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> I give it 5 stars only because I have nothing negative to say after only 5 days.  I have used it two times.  It makes my skin feel much softer after use but I have not used it long enough to know if it will change any areas of dark spots or change the appearance of large pores.  I will update my review more later.</li>
            <li> I love, love this product!! Very well made and worth the money. I&#x27;ve used twice and can tell a difference in my skin already. Love this and would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> There were accidently two of these delivered and the first one I opened didn&#x27;t have the filters in the box. So check before you use the device.&lt;br /&gt;I use to get microdermabrasion at the dermatologist and this device works but removes less layers of skin. I definitely think it is better than the non- diamond head devices on the market and I am hoping with continued use I will see more dramatic result.&lt;br /&gt;I am a very pale skinned women of Irish decent and I didn&#x27;t have any of the red marks or problems other reviewers mentioned, but perhaps that is because I was careful and moved the device over the skin rather than let it rest in any one spot. I followed the directions exactly.&lt;br /&gt;Two hours after I used it I went out for dinner and movie with friends and noticed that my face felt softer and my make up went on smoothly, which is the result I am used to from microdermabrasion. The device does fill up with dead skin after one use so you have to take it apart and clean it thoroughly. Personally, I think that&#x27;s fine as that allows me to see the results, but if you think you won&#x27;t clean it don&#x27;t buy this device. If it does not keep removing skin after the first use I will return it, but I am hoping it is just a slower milder process and I will review again after I have used it on a regular basise.&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile I have to mail back the device that came without the</li>
            <li> I use this system and love it!  It is so easy and the results are amazing.  I have used the system for three months and I can see a tremendous difference in my skin.  Sun/Age spots have reduced significantly, my smile lines are thinner, my skin looks healthier and much younger.  I use it everyday and really can see a huge difference.  The machine is easy to use and small enough to store away easily!</li>
            <li> Good product...easy to use!</li>
            <li> bought two by accident - wanted to return one and couldn&#x27;t after 30 days. So in keeping it, I used it. Scared at first because if you don&#x27;t do it right you can have big problems, but it was wonderful! Combined with drinking a gallon of water a day, I feel much younger.</li>
            <li> I have Trophy Skins original microdermabrasion machine. I am a beauty blogger who focuses on anti aging beauty [...] This is one of my favorite products. I use it once a week head to toe and have significantly lightened freckles and age spots as well as keeping fine lines at bay. The new machine is even better, which I did not think possible! 1) it&#x27;s $100 less expensive 2) it&#x27;s completely portable 3) it comes with a larger head for the body and a smaller one for areas that are smaller like the eye.&lt;br /&gt;Rejuvaderm MD is fantastic and keeps my skin radiant and glowing. With a 30 day money back guarantee there is zero downside. Absolutely worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Love the convenience and cost of using this at home.  It is simple to use, effective and has done wonders for my fine and not so fine wrinkles.  It&#x27;s also lightweight and doesn&#x27;t take up much room in the cabinet.  It actually seems to be polishing my skin.  Two pumps of argon oil and I&#x27;m good to head out the door--no makeup necessary!</li>
            <li> I found this machine very hard on my face and neck. The unit works by sucking up your skin and pulling it against the rough diamond surface surrounding the small opening.  I tried using it for a week but saw no real difference except a few broken capillaries which made me stop immediately. It was a waste of money as far as I was concerned.</li>
            <li> Have just used it a couple times but seems to have smoothed the skin on my face and intend to keep it up!!</li>
            <li> Amazing results in just a couple of uses. Pores visibly smaller, skin visibly smoother. Be aware that it DOES NOT come with the other two tips as I assumed from the picture.  You have to buy these for another $50 ea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;m really stunned at how much difference just two treatments in one week can make. I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this every other day for two weeks and I have definitely noticed a difference.  While my skin is not problem skin, there is always room for improvement, and I saw it with this product.  My skin looked smoother and the pores looked smaller.  Some discoloration seemed to fade, and my skin looked fresher, less dull.  I&#x27;m definitely impressed with this product and intend to continue using it.</li>
            <li> works great!  It took me a little to get used to it and have only had it for a week but its really nice and can see some improvements already.  Looking forward to seeing progress over time.  Trophy Skin has been really nice to email and see how I like it and although i haven&#x27;t needed it - it looks like with them contacting me, i would think their customer service would be top notch.</li>
            <li> Great for the price. Have to use it as part of a ritual to see results.</li>
            <li> The RejuvadermMD is so simple to use.&lt;br /&gt;Put in a filter, put on the tip, plug it in, turn on and Go!&lt;br /&gt;I really like the fact that the wool filters are black. When you are done with your session you can SEE the results right there on the filter. The suction on this is amazing, it does a fantastic job!&lt;br /&gt;As with all of these type of devices, it takes time to see real results. I did feel the results right away. After each session my skin was very smooth and soft. With continued use, my skin has better color and texture.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the money!</li>
            <li> Rejuvaderm is fantastic product!  It is easy to use and I saw noticeable results in the softness of my skin as well as fine lines and wrinkles on my forehead and around my eyes!  I would recommend this product to friends and will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> Great product and came in quickly. I have only used it once, so not sure about results as of yet. I would of liked a rechargeable unit or a longer cord.</li>
            <li> I have only use it twice, but my skin looks and feels better. I will be saving money on facials!</li>
            <li> This microdermabrasion works well however it dried my skin a bit so I bought this intense moisturizer called Vichy night cream which seems to counteract the dryness.  The two products work well together.  The microdermabrasion is smoothing out my fine lines and wrinkles and also makes my skin feel really clean.  My skin seems to look a little rough and flaky for a few days following treatment therefore I only perform the treatment once a week.  Once the flakiness is gone my skin looks radiant.</li>
            <li> Works great!! I used only once a week though cause I have limited time. It takes off the dead skin, lessens fine lines and made the dark spots almost disappear :) also my pores are smaller, my makeup goes on so much better now. I look and feel so much younger. Thank you so much Trophy Skin for making this product I am 40 years old now and my face has improved so much :)</li>
            <li> This product is the &amp;#34;ITEM&amp;#34; to have....OMG....i really feel and see a difference in my face and neck. I workout three times a week and after I work out I use this to workout my face!!!! It is light in weight..easy to use great instrutions easy to follow. I real treat for your face and neck...Buy one you can not go wrong!!!</li>
            <li> Works great! I now have a more clear and radiant youthful face! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I use it 2-3 times a week, see definite improvements in my skin. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable results.  I used it right away and faithfully for a few months.  This thing is truly amazing.  My crows feet are noticeably less and even my husband the other day commented on how wonderful my skins looks!  This was without any makeup.  It has cleared up some small acne areas and literally has made extracting a breeze.  You need to be careful with the settings or you will scratch, but it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great little device for home use.  A little pricier than some but I didn&#x27;t mind paying a few dollars more for an intuitive, easy-to-use product that provides good results.  Also purchased an ultrasonic jewelry cleaner to clean the diamond tip as needed and this has worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> I am so impressed with what this little machine does to my skin!  It&#x27;s amazing how smooth it feels after a treatment.  I am looking forward to seeing my age spots disappear, but I know that will take time.  I would give this product 5 stars, except the instructions are surprisingly incomplete.  I have no experience with microdermabrasion and did not feel the product manual or the videos on Trophy Skin&#x27;s website gave sufficient instruction.  Thankfully, I did find some videos on You Tube that helped me out.  I feel confident that I will be using this for years to come.  Great purchase!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for 10 days, and I have used it 3 times. I have only used the lowest setting and it is amazing how much skin was in the filter. My. Face has a beautiful finish, kind of a soft glow and very smooth. I love it!</li>
            <li> I have to say that I am EXTREMELY skeptical about buying products that know nothing about.  In reading the other testimonials and reviews, I wasn&#x27;t completely sure that I would be happy with purchasing a product like the Rejuvaderm MD, but....I have to say, that I have only had mine a week; and have only used it 3 times, and I love it!  I have horrible acne scarring and decades of sun damage on my chest and neck.  I am not 100% certain that this product will bring my skin back to what it used to look like when I was 20, but with this being the very first time I have tried microdermabrasion, I don&#x27;t really know.  What I do know is, that this product is super easy to use, is not uncomfortable, and seems to be working (or at least doing what it is supposed to).  My advice (as a novice) is to follow the directions!  Use the lowest setting first to become comfortable with using the product, then bump up the power as you see fit.  As damaged as my skin is, I figured that the worst that could happen is that it would stay damaged.  So far, I&#x27;m pretty impressed.  The Rejuvaderm MD is sloughing off the dead skin cells, and I think given some time, my skin will look better than it has in years.  I haven&#x27;t tried the Stem Cell Serum, and may not, but I do use coconut oil as a moisturizer, and after each treatment, my skin soaks it up better than it did prior to doing any treatments.  I hope my review helps others who may not be sure about trying this product.  Worst case, send it back!</li>
