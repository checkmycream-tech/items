            <li> A girl at work has this perfume but bought it at Kohls or something. The price for the bottle size is amazing. My only thing is that while it still smells good.... the scent seems to fade in a very short amount of time where as the girl at work can wear for the whole day and still smells strong! This product was described as &#x27;new&#x27; and the only thing missing was the plastic wrap/seal around the perfume box itself so FYI.</li>
