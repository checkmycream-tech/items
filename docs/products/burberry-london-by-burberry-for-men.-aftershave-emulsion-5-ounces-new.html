    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This has got to be the best smelling balm I have ever smelled.</li>
            <li>The scent of this aftershave is very pleasant, but wasn&#x27;t what I was after.  </li>
            <li>great size, great price!</li>
            <li>others might find this a great product and it WOULD work, but I&#x27;m&lt;br /&gt;outside</li>
            <li>and love this on him!!</li>
            <li>Hubby loves it and more importantly, SO DO I!!!!  </li>
            <li>We are both very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see ever not having a bottle of this stuff on the shelf  -love it!</li>
            <li>Nice consistency ...</li>
            <li>and oh boy am I glad, because he smells sooo good.  </li>
            <li>I will still be using it, but will likely continue elsewhere in my search for the perfect aftershave once it is finished!</li>
            <li>One things for sure</li>
            <li>you can get for around 10.00 or so, ok.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re going to buy a Burberry, make sure it&#x27;s BURBERRY LONDON.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s ok as it arrived well packaged.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>longer than I thought ,read reviews and I am satisfied by aftershave .&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>I liked this product so much I ordered the \\&quot;London\\&quot; cologne and bought an additional one of these for my Dad.  </li>
            <li>Very fresh smelling.  </li>
            <li>ORIGINAL PRODUCT DESCRIPTION DID NOT MENTION \\&quot;BALM\\&quot; AS SHOWN ABOVE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>sufficient skin conditioners for us guys that shave everyday and a nice cool exhilarating smell that lasts practically the whole day (passes the crowded evening rush hour NYC subway test).</li>
            <li>helps keep the face smooth after a nice wet shave.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a scent that wasn&#x27;t too sweet or flowery, but this one, though not quite so flowery, still smells a bit too much like flowers to meet my desires.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting a new, original product inside of new and original packaging.  </li>
            <li>It also soothes any razor burn etc very well.</li>
            <li>Burberry London is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I really like the scent and the emulsion/creme</li>
            <li>This is really what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Fast service.&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li>A very fine product that works well, but the top is a little loose, so you can smell it before opening.</li>
            <li>This fit in very well with my other after shave balms.</li>
            <li>after applying the lotion, my perfume was gone due to smelling strong.</li>
            <li>Ok price, but who can put a price on something your Dad can use everyday.</li>
            <li>A kind of smoky aroma, reminds me of the green Polo back in the 80s.  </li>
            <li>(and I&#x27;ve looked high and low) just don&#x27;t carry it much anymore.</li>
            <li>Would definitely purchase again, shipping was quick and look forward to trying a different fragrance the same way</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Even tried other similar products within the Burberry range</li>
            <li> other Burberry.....</li>
            <li> Only problem with this product is that it can be very difficult to find except for certain online websites.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to make a call on this, because I&#x27;m not one of those refined&lt;br /&gt;types, but have to say for the time it lasts....not real long...</li>
            <li> AND THE CONTENTS SEEM TO BE A THICK BALM INSTEAD OF THE EXPECTED</li>
            <li> My Dad loves this stuff, but it is hard to find in stores, found it here.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with the watered down smell of the product.  </li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x60;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, that is not what I received and I will not purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Burberry is semi expensive.</li>

            <li> I use this product along with several others on a daily basis.  This fit in very well with my other after shave balms.</li>
            <li> My Dad loves this stuff, but it is hard to find in stores, found it here. Ok price, but who can put a price on something your Dad can use everyday.</li>
            <li> I buy numerous shaving balms for comfort after shaving. This has got to be the best smelling balm I have ever smelled. It also soothes any razor burn etc very well. I liked this product so much I ordered the \\&quot;London\\&quot; cologne and bought an additional one of these for my Dad.  I can&#x27;t see ever not having a bottle of this stuff on the shelf  -love it!</li>
            <li> Burberry London is the real deal. Nice consistency ... sufficient skin conditioners for us guys that shave everyday and a nice cool exhilarating smell that lasts practically the whole day (passes the crowded evening rush hour NYC subway test). Bang for the buck ....</li>
            <li> The scent of this aftershave is very pleasant, but wasn&#x27;t what I was after.  I was looking for a scent that wasn&#x27;t too sweet or flowery, but this one, though not quite so flowery, still smells a bit too much like flowers to meet my desires.  I will still be using it, but will likely continue elsewhere in my search for the perfect aftershave once it is finished!</li>
            <li> Wanted my husband to try it....great size, great price! Would definitely purchase again, shipping was quick and look forward to trying a different fragrance the same way</li>
            <li> So-so scent.  A kind of smoky aroma, reminds me of the green Polo back in the 80s.  For the price, you can&#x60;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with the watered down smell of the product.  I also did not like the fact that the bottle came packaged in an un-original box labeled \\&quot;Tester - Not For Resale\\&quot;.  I was expecting a new, original product inside of new and original packaging.  Unfortunately, that is not what I received and I will not purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Hubby loves it and more importantly, SO DO I!!!!  He&#x27;s a yum yum  and love this on him!!</li>
            <li> I received product as requested, however, do not recall seeing TESTER in the ad. I will repackage it for gift giving, but I think I might have passed had I known it was a TESTER product.</li>
            <li> THIS ITEM ARRIVED IN A BOX BEARING THE WARNING: \\&quot;TESTER - NOT FOR SALE\\&quot; IN TWO LANGUAGES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE SCREW CAP WAS UNSEALED AND THE CONTENTS SEEM TO BE A THICK BALM INSTEAD OF THE EXPECTED \\&quot;AFTER SHAVE LOTION.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE ORIGINAL PRODUCT DESCRIPTION DID NOT MENTION \\&quot;BALM\\&quot; AS SHOWN ABOVE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE SELLER&#x27;S PRODUCT WARNINGS -- WHICH I HAD NOT READ BEFORE ORDERING -- ARE EXPLICIT AND WORRISOME.</li>
            <li> I bought Burberry London for my Husband and oh boy am I glad, because he smells sooo good.  It makes me want to get closer.  We are both very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to make a call on this, because I&#x27;m not one of those refined&lt;br /&gt;types, but have to say for the time it lasts....not real long...it&#x27;s pretty&lt;br /&gt;decent. One things for sure, it does make the skin feel a lil softer or at&lt;br /&gt;least that&#x27;s what I keep telling myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burberry is semi expensive. Maybe someone who works at an office close&lt;br /&gt;with others might find this a great product and it WOULD work, but I&#x27;m&lt;br /&gt;outside with others and for a while its there, but goes away sooner than&lt;br /&gt;later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can get for around 10.00 or so, ok. Don&#x27;t be fooled by Burbeery&lt;br /&gt;compared to Burberry LONDON. Different product altogether..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re going to buy a Burberry, make sure it&#x27;s BURBERRY LONDON.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other Burberry.....oh boy.</li>
            <li> A very fine product that works well, but the top is a little loose, so you can smell it before opening.</li>
            <li> Got this for Christmas and boy oh boy am I gald I did. I&#x27;ve used it twice now and my wife loves the smell. I really like the scent and the emulsion/creme helps keep the face smooth after a nice wet shave. I would purchase this by the gallon if I could!</li>
            <li> I like Burberry London for men and use it already about 5 years. Try it once and you will like the ambre strengths</li>
            <li> after applying the lotion, my perfume was gone due to smelling strong. so i sold my roommate. i dont want to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years. It&#x27;s the only one that suits me for medical reasons. Even tried other similar products within the Burberry range and I get a skin reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had to go to the USA to get hold dwindling worldwide stocks. However, the UK customs charged me c.15 GBP&lt;br /&gt;import duty. So please allow for this possibility when ordering from abroad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took 3 weeks to arrive but that&#x27;s ok as it arrived well packaged.</li>
            <li> This is the scent that my husband wears.  I absolutely love it.  Very fresh smelling.  Only problem with this product is that it can be very difficult to find except for certain online websites.  Stores around me (and I&#x27;ve looked high and low) just don&#x27;t carry it much anymore.</li>
            <li> This is really what I wanted. Fast service.&lt;br /&gt;Last longer than I thought ,read reviews and I am satisfied by aftershave .&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
