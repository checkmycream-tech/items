    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Philosophy products are some of the best in the cosmetics industry.</li>
            <li>I ordered this from another site (never know where you&#x27;ll find the best price), but wanted to leave a review.</li>
            <li>Very happy with it.</li>
            <li>This product showed up with an incredibly offensive smell.</li>
            <li>This product does have the recommended Ph for a AHA product, but lacks potency at around 5% rather than the ideal 10%.</li>
            <li>Great night cream.</li>
            <li>The smell is not that great either.</li>
            <li>I got this as a sample and love it !!</li>
            <li>The smell is interesting, and not the best.</li>
            <li>This night cream is a good example.</li>
            <li>Good luck</li>
            <li>but it defiantly does a good job.</li>
            <li>It feels really good on my face.</li>
            <li>I felt it was a good product</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>It is thicker than the original formula and leaves you with beautiful skin</li>
            <li>In A Jar was so good that this would be even better, but</li>
            <li>Its lilac plant (not the nice smelling flower).</li>
            <li>It just seems like they were selling very old lotion...because the brand is normally awesome.</li>
            <li>Rich night cream with pleasant smell that leaves your skin feeling hydrated and smooth in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I love this night cream, and I needed to get some pronto.  </li>
            <li>Love this cream.</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day and love to use it before I apply my foundation.</li>
            <li>okay,</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Ive been using these products for many years.</li>
            <li>It could be genetics, or the fact that Ive taken excellent care of my skin my entire life, or maybe just this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I use most of the Hope in a Jar moisturizers from Philosophy.  </li>
            <li>There are better products out there.</li>
            <li>I love it, you will too..</li>
            <li>Have used Philosphy products for years and love them.</li>
            <li>Love this cream.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>This feels so good as I&#x27;m getting ready for bed.</li>
            <li>In a Jar daytime cream before and love it and the clean smell.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I really needed a special night moisturizer, but I am very glad I decided to try it.</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite Philosophy product ever!</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I really feel my skin warm up when I use it, so</li>
            <li>Bought another jar from original outlet I&#x27;d purchased from before in November.  </li>
            <li>Its a unique texture that you have to try to believe.</li>
            <li>I originally used Miracle Worker Night and mistakenly bought this product not realizing my error.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten SO many compliments on it, and I work with 15 makeup artists who really know their skincare.</li>
            <li>This leaves my skin soft and kind of dewy/glowy.</li>
            <li>I have really come to like Philosophy moisturizers and am happy they are eliminating parabens, now if only they&#x27;d eliminate sulfates!</li>
            <li>I love the feel of this product but does anyone else notice a particular odor to the nighttime cream.  </li>
            <li>They have a medicinal smell, but not unpleasant.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and soaks right in, right away.</li>
            <li>It disappears quickly, however, and the results are well worth it.  </li>
            <li>I feel like my skin is looking more smooth, pores seem slightly smaller.</li>
            <li>Was not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my mid thirties, and have begun to notice fine lines and other signs of aging that do not make me happy.  </li>
            <li>it smells exactly like Elmer&#x27;s glue and goes on like it is glue.  </li>
            <li>sadly, no.</li>
            <li>I just recently tried this night moisturizer and its my favorite.</li>
            <li>Ive read where people have stated it has a funny smell.</li>
            <li>but Im thankful nonetheless. ; )</li>
            <li>I really recommend!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m pretty used to it.</li>
            <li>I am pretty light/fair, flush/redness and freckle.  </li>
            <li>I do have to make sure I wash it off in the morning, or I tend to break out a bit if left on all day.</li>
            <li>although the jar had a large air bubble in it, so it seemed as though the manufacturer was avoiding filling the container up.</li>
            <li>My skin is so much softer and smoother in the morning and the texture has approved alt</li>
            <li>Really makes your skin silky.</li>
            <li>It is very think and WILL NOT rub into my skin</li>
            <li>It is a slightly unusual smell</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It sinks in without laying on top of skin.</li>
            <li>Not a great smell but a great night cream.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using the nighttime one and it had a distinct odor of Body Odor, actual BO...</li>
            <li>After a week you will look forward to the herbal scents in this smooth cream salve, and it feels so comforting to reward your face after a long day.</li>
            <li>If I keep using this I will look older.</li>
            <li>Has anyone else noticed this odor in this particular item?</li>
            <li>I have always wanted to give their products a try, but have never been in a situation where I wanted to choose it over something else high end that I wanted.</li>
            <li>I will recommend this jar of philosophy to anyone my age 44 that wants soft skin even in the summer after you have been in the sun taking a tan use the night and the morning cream.</li>
            <li>This is a heavy night time moisturizer, but I love the way my skin feels in the morning.</li>
            <li>The price is doable and they live up to their promises.</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t feel like it moisturized my skin right away, but the next morning my skin feels extremely soft.</li>
            <li>I bought this moisturizer at Nordstrom for the first time last fall and have been using it ever since</li>
            <li>This is the second time I bought this product, but the first time through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The product appeared to be old.  </li>
            <li>if I&#x27;m complaining, just imagine how those sensitive to scented products would feel.</li>
            <li>Im highly sensitive to all smells and it doesnt bother me.</li>
            <li>Your skin looks radiant, soft and the tan wont peal off.</li>
            <li>wondering if maybe I got an old jar.</li>
            <li>This product leaves my skin very soft and a LITTLE goes a LONG way for sure.</li>
            <li>However, with use, it appears to have same effect on my skin as I recall from when I originally purchased from the other on-line/TV shopping outlet, so my worry has subsided on that front.  </li>
            <li>and I live where the humidity is very low.  </li>
            <li>When I am having an \\&quot;issue\\&quot; this seems to calm it and make it less noticeable overnight.    </li>
            <li>It is a pretty thick cream, and you do not need much (a plus).</li>
            <li>I hated Hope in a Jar for day, but this night cream is excellent!</li>
            <li>Who knows if it&#x27;s making me look younger, but at least my skin feels smooth the next morning.</li>

            <li> Who knows if it&#x27;s making me look younger, but at least my skin feels smooth the next morning.</li>
            <li> They definitely changed the packaging to the vacuum foil desk</li>
            <li> The main thing that made me feel this way is that the packaging is different than when I received in the past.  </li>
            <li> My skin drinks this in as if it was extra dry and thirsty.</li>
            <li> Extra moisture for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> That is not all though, this product will roll off the skin after it dries, so, so much for the weak AHA&#x27;s present in the formula.</li>
            <li> and usually I get people not believing I&#x27;m that old...</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this cream at night for a few weeks</li>
            <li> So be careful – it enables perpetual stress and sleeplessness.</li>
            <li> I had some spots where the skin on my face was rather rough.</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected.  </li>
            <li> but you don&#x27;t need to use much, so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t explain it other than to say I just don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> AND...NOT LIKE ANY OF THE OTHER PHILOSOPHY PRODUCTS I PURCHASED.</li>
            <li> Not at all like the other night/day creams.  </li>
            <li> Specifically, this had a foil vacuum seal where the past shipment had the plastic disk under the cap that could be replaced.  </li>
            <li> When I wake up the wrinkles are gone, and while they slowly creep up during the day, they are smoothed out again the next night.</li>
            <li> It smells like a sour kitchen sponge.</li>
            <li> I typically have combination skin but during the winter my skin drys up and peels ..</li>
            <li> I previously purchased from QVC.  </li>
            <li> The cream is not smooth and has an odor.  </li>
            <li> Not too heavy.</li>
            <li> and I just cant spend this much money for something that smells so bad.</li>
            <li> I am not one who usually has an aversion to scented products, so</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not authentic Philosophy product.</li>
            <li> The two biggest cons: Smells pretty awful (again, the glycolic acid!)</li>
            <li> Very thick.  </li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t broken out yet.</li>
            <li> My skin looked worse.</li>
            <li> It does smell HORRIBLE, so much</li>
            <li> This cream has an awful, unpreasant smell, much like mildew or worse.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I will be returning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard about things like this happening and needless to say I won&#x27;t be buying my beauty products on Amazon anymore.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bad.</li>
            <li> It has a scent that burs the eyes, it is that bad.</li>
            <li> Aside from the fact that it smells really bad.</li>
            <li> so I thought something had gone bad in it, but after some internet research I found out that is just the way the product smells.</li>
            <li> But this is awful.</li>
            <li> Aweful, awful smelling stuff.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this night cream, and I needed to get some pronto.  So ordering it from Amazon got it to me quicker than ordering from Philosophy!</li>
            <li> Love this cream. My skin is so much softer and smoother in the morning and the texture has approved alt</li>
            <li> I have never tried a philosophy product before trying this. Blasphemy, I know. I have always wanted to give their products a try, but have never been in a situation where I wanted to choose it over something else high end that I wanted. It is a pretty thick cream, and you do not need much (a plus). However, I don&#x27;t feel like it moisturized my skin right away, but the next morning my skin feels extremely soft. The smell is interesting, and not the best. I can&#x27;t explain it other than to say I just don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I got this as a sample and love it !! I typically have combination skin but during the winter my skin drys up and peels .. I use it twice a day and love to use it before I apply my foundation. Really makes your skin silky.</li>
            <li> I like this product okay, although the jar had a large air bubble in it, so it seemed as though the manufacturer was avoiding filling the container up.</li>
            <li> This product showed up with an incredibly offensive smell. ... not what you&#x27;d want all over your face.  It just seems like they were selling very old lotion...because the brand is normally awesome.</li>
            <li> I have used Hope in Jar for day before, and thought I would try the night version.  The smell is horrid.  Like burnt hair.  It disappears quickly, however, and the results are well worth it.  I&#x27;m in my mid thirties, and have begun to notice fine lines and other signs of aging that do not make me happy.  Hope in Jar (night) smooths, and brightens.  I wish Philosophy could do something about the stink, though.</li>
            <li> Philosophy products are some of the best in the cosmetics industry. The price is doable and they live up to their promises. This night cream is a good example. Makes your skin feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li> So far so good! I&#x27;ve only been using this cream at night for a few weeks but I haven&#x27;t broken out yet. I feel like my skin is looking more smooth, pores seem slightly smaller. Will keep using.</li>
            <li> Forget the smell. After a week you will look forward to the herbal scents in this smooth cream salve, and it feels so comforting to reward your face after a long day. When I wake up the wrinkles are gone, and while they slowly creep up during the day, they are smoothed out again the next night. So be careful – it enables perpetual stress and sleeplessness.</li>
            <li> I got this in a kit along with the purity cleanser and exfoliating cleanser..love those two.  But this is awful. It is very think and WILL NOT rub into my skin it smells exactly like Elmer&#x27;s glue and goes on like it is glue.  I used it for a couple of weeks to give it a chance... My skin looked worse. I&#x27;m 43 and usually I get people not believing I&#x27;m that old... If I keep using this I will look older. It&#x27;s bad. Maybe I got a defective one.  Good luck</li>
            <li> It might work, but after 1 application I will never know.  It smells like a sour kitchen sponge. Even my hands stink.</li>
            <li> The product appeared to be old.  The box was discolored.  The cream is not smooth and has an odor.  This HOPE in a JAR is HOPELESS... AND...NOT LIKE ANY OF THE OTHER PHILOSOPHY PRODUCTS I PURCHASED.</li>
            <li> The Smell! Yuck! I thought since the regular Hope In A Jar was so good that this would be even better, but sadly, no. It has a scent that burs the eyes, it is that bad. I am not one who usually has an aversion to scented products, so if I&#x27;m complaining, just imagine how those sensitive to scented products would feel. That is not all though, this product will roll off the skin after it dries, so, so much for the weak AHA&#x27;s present in the formula. This product does have the recommended Ph for a AHA product, but lacks potency at around 5% rather than the ideal 10%.</li>
            <li> It takes about a week for this product to make a diffrence in the smoothness of your skin but it defiantly does a good job. It does make you break out but thats because its cleaning out your pores. The draw back Is the smell. Its lilac plant (not the nice smelling flower). Yuck! I have just about finished off my sample and I just cant spend this much money for something that smells so bad.</li>
            <li> This feels so good as I&#x27;m getting ready for bed. My skin drinks this in as if it was extra dry and thirsty. It goes on smooth and soaks right in, right away. Love this product.</li>
            <li> I actually want a refund. This product is like a cement. Aside from the fact that it smells really bad.</li>
            <li> Ive been using these products for many years. I just recently tried this night moisturizer and its my favorite. The consistency is different and so it seems to last longer too. Ive read where people have stated it has a funny smell. Im highly sensitive to all smells and it doesnt bother me. It is a slightly unusual smell but if it works well who cares!&lt;br /&gt;Last night while out with friends a woman thought I was ten years younger than I am. It could be genetics, or the fact that Ive taken excellent care of my skin my entire life, or maybe just this moisturizer. I dont know...but Im thankful nonetheless. ; )</li>
            <li> Rich night cream with pleasant smell that leaves your skin feeling hydrated and smooth in the morning.  I really recommend!</li>
            <li> I use most of the Hope in a Jar moisturizers from Philosophy.  I previously purchased from QVC.  Additionally I now purchase from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I will be returning. It&#x27;s not authentic Philosophy product. I bought this moisturizer at Nordstrom for the first time last fall and have been using it ever since so I&#x27;m pretty used to it. This creme doesn&#x27;t have the same texture, color, or scent. I&#x27;ve heard about things like this happening and needless to say I won&#x27;t be buying my beauty products on Amazon anymore.</li>
            <li> Aweful, awful smelling stuff.  Not at all like the other night/day creams.  They have a medicinal smell, but not unpleasant.  This cream has an awful, unpreasant smell, much like mildew or worse.  It seems to slough the skin, but I will not be buying it ever again!  Save your $.  There are better products out there.</li>
            <li> Extra moisture for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I bought this product, but the first time through Amazon.  I have to say that I was concerned that this might not be officially Philosophy, but some knock off.  The main thing that made me feel this way is that the packaging is different than when I received in the past.  Specifically, this had a foil vacuum seal where the past shipment had the plastic disk under the cap that could be replaced.  However, with use, it appears to have same effect on my skin as I recall from when I originally purchased from the other on-line/TV shopping outlet, so my worry has subsided on that front.  I started using Philosophy products (basic facial care set) about 1 and 1/2 years ago and I do believe they have made a difference in my complexion.  I am pretty light/fair, flush/redness and freckle.  When I am having an \\&quot;issue\\&quot; this seems to calm it and make it less noticeable overnight.    Update:  2/22/15.  Bought another jar from original outlet I&#x27;d purchased from before in November.  They definitely changed the packaging to the vacuum foil desk so I&#x27;m now fully convinced that I&#x27;m getting official Philosophy product from this retailer...</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It feels really good on my face. And I feel like it helps my face at night get the moisture it needs.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite Philosophy product ever! I hated Hope in a Jar for day, but this night cream is excellent! I really feel my skin warm up when I use it, so I know the glycolic acid is in there doing its job, and its got such a creamy texture that it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;drip&amp;#34; off my skin at night...and yet, its not at all greasy! Its a unique texture that you have to try to believe. This is the only skincare product i&#x27;ve ever stuck to until I finished the entire jar, and now i&#x27;m just saving up for another one (its pricey!). I&#x27;ve gotten SO many compliments on it, and I work with 15 makeup artists who really know their skincare. The two biggest cons: Smells pretty awful (again, the glycolic acid!) and its pricey.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I really needed a special night moisturizer, but I am very glad I decided to try it. It is thicker than the original formula and leaves you with beautiful skin come morning. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Great night cream. Not too heavy. It sinks in without laying on top of skin. Keeps  skin moist overnight. Try it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this from another site (never know where you&#x27;ll find the best price), but wanted to leave a review. I originally used Miracle Worker Night and mistakenly bought this product not realizing my error. This product leaves my skin very soft and a LITTLE goes a LONG way for sure. Just a pea-sized dab otherwise you&#x27;ll probably feel greasy. It does smell HORRIBLE, so much so I thought something had gone bad in it, but after some internet research I found out that is just the way the product smells. You do get used to it, or just don&#x27;t use it beneath your nose. The smell does fade eventually. Also, note the bit about increasing sun sensitivity, but I haven&#x27;t had a problem. This leaves my skin soft and kind of dewy/glowy. I have really come to like Philosophy moisturizers and am happy they are eliminating parabens, now if only they&#x27;d eliminate sulfates!</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and I live where the humidity is very low.  I like this product because it puts some moisture back into my skin.  If you have oily skin you should probably use the regular hope in a jar, not the nighttime product.</li>
            <li> I had some spots where the skin on my face was rather rough. This stuff has worked for me. My skin looks polished and the tone is even. My complexion definitely looks &amp;#34;brighter.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s only 2oz but you don&#x27;t need to use much, so a little goes a long way. Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I first started using when I got a small sample w/ another purchase.  I felt it was a good product so that is why I bought the regular size. So far, so good!</li>
            <li> I will recommend this jar of philosophy to anyone my age 44 that wants soft skin even in the summer after you have been in the sun taking a tan use the night and the morning cream. Your skin looks radiant, soft and the tan wont peal off. I love it, you will too..</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this product but does anyone else notice a particular odor to the nighttime cream.  I&#x27;ve used the Hope In a Jar daytime cream before and love it and the clean smell.  This is my first time using the nighttime one and it had a distinct odor of Body Odor, actual BO...I thought maybe it was just my nose but I asked my husband and son to smell it also without telling them my thoughts and they said it smelled like BO....wondering if maybe I got an old jar. Has anyone else noticed this odor in this particular item?</li>
            <li> Was not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li> Very thick.  Not at all what I expected.  Clogs my pores.  Not distributors fault, just the product.</li>
            <li> Have used Philosphy products for years and love them. This is a heavy night time moisturizer, but I love the way my skin feels in the morning. Would not recommend for oily faces. I do have to make sure I wash it off in the morning, or I tend to break out a bit if left on all day. The smell is not that great either.</li>
            <li> Unfourtunately this wasn&#x27;t for me. I tried it for four weeks and it just made me breakout.</li>
            <li> this leaves my skin a bit itchy</li>
            <li> Love this cream. Who knows if it&#x27;s making me look younger, but at least my skin feels smooth the next morning.</li>
            <li> Not a great smell but a great night cream.</li>
