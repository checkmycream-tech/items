            <li>Love the color, great site to stock up on hard to find colors.</li>
            <li>I am looking at my nails in every different light and loving them every time.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty.  </li>
            <li>I am also a fan of dark polish, people notice your nails more often, because it stands out!!</li>
            <li>but well worth it</li>
            <li>not the color I expected but still love it !</li>
            <li>long lasting wear and great color..</li>
            <li>I like nail polish like that, and I was really tempted to keep this one for myself!  </li>
            <li>I love finding OPI on Amazon, because while I don&#x27;t usually purchase this brand for myself, I do for my family (nail polish snobs), and the price is so much better here than in the store.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t going to get this color at first, but then i just couldn&#x27;t resist.  </li>

            <li>This has easy applicant and long durability without chipping-</li>
            <li>Sometimes they are a little more on burgundy side, sometimes they are a little darker, but they look amazing every time.  </li>
            <li>Love the color on my dark skin.</li>
            <li>The picture on the website makes it seem more black, but in natural sunlight it looks like a really dark brown with a bit of sparkle to it.  </li>
            <li>The red shimmer only really shows up in well lighted areas.</li>

            <li> I thought I was receiving a black polish with reddish sparkles.</li>
            <li> In some lights it looks black, some it&#x27;s purplish, some it&#x27;s purplish red-black.  </li>

            <li> The picture on the website makes it seem more black, but in natural sunlight it looks like a really dark brown with a bit of sparkle to it.  In fluorescent light (i.e. bathroom, office) it looks more black.  I bought this along with Black Cherry Chutney and I Vant to Bite Your Neck.  This wasn&#x27;t the color I wanted, but it is still very nice and I will add it to my rotation.  It&#x27;s suitable for the office and out of office.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this color for YEARS and I just bought a bottle for my BFF and she loves it!  You have to apply two coats but it is a brownish/red color... Very pretty!</li>
            <li> This picture doesn&#x27;t show how red/burgundy this polish actually is. I thought I was receiving a black polish with reddish sparkles. the polish actually goes on and looks like a red wine color with sparkles.</li>
            <li> Love my opi love this color it&#x27;s like black red</li>
            <li> Oh a new favorite!  I like give me more but this one is so strange.  It changes under different lights</li>
            <li> Beautiful , have it on right now, it wears good doesn&#x27;t chip</li>
            <li> I love OPI nail polish... long lasting wear and great color..little on the high side but well worth it*</li>

            <li> Prompt delivery, excellent product</li>
            <li> Just the color I wanted! It goes with everything and is great on the toes too. Good color for winter too!</li>
            <li> I love this color.  Only wish it came in the OPI Axxium color line.  It is a deep crimson color w/black background.  Very pretty.  Sparkles in the sunlight too.  Very happy with this purchase and the seller.</li>
            <li> OPI has created another winner! This shade screams soir√©e!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rather dark for my personal taste. But it&#x27;s okay every now and then. The red shimmer only really shows up in well lighted areas.</li>
            <li> My trademark nail polish because it matches everything! This has easy applicant and long durability without chipping- it doesn&#x27;t look goth. buy from amazon it&#x27;s cheaper.</li>
            <li> not the color I expected but still love it !</li>
            <li> Absolutely love, love, love this POLISH. 2 coats and good to go. ALOT OF depth to the shine.</li>
            <li> Love the color on my dark skin. Product was just as described. No complaints</li>
            <li> Great color. Looks a tad bit lighter than in the photo but it&#x27;s still a lovely color! I wear it all the time.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite polish. I wear it year round.</li>
            <li> Well, the color doesn&#x27;t seem to be the same with what it look like on the pictures shown everywhere, but still good.</li>

            <li> I Love this nail polish.  It never chips or cracks no matter what I put it through.  I&#x27;m very Happy</li>
            <li> Met my expectations. Love it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a Christmas gift, and it&#x27;s just gorgeous.  In some lights it looks black, some it&#x27;s purplish, some it&#x27;s purplish red-black.
