            <li>I watched a YouTube clip for this cologne and this guy goes off telling the viewers that this is the greatest cologne ever.  </li>
            <li>product in excellent quality and without faults.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS COLOGNE!!!</li>
            <li>This a great buy at a great value!</li>

            <li>Definately a great going out cologne.  </li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>Great Product.  </li>
            <li>Found it at a great price here.  </li>
            <li>There must be something in this cologne that appeals a great deal to women.  </li>
            <li>This product is very great and smells wonderful and has helped me if I got to any special occasion.</li>
            <li>I still love Allure Blanche and consider Givenchy Pour Homme to be one of the best fragrances a guy can wear.  </li>
            <li>I originally had gone in with the intention of picking up the Versace por Homme that has great reviews here on Amazon, but after smelling it in person I wasn&#x27;t all that impressed.</li>
            <li>Both my date and girls at the party had made remarks about how great I smelled, can&#x27;t ask for more than that!</li>
            <li>/&gt;really good, good good good good, good good good ,,.&lt;br /&gt;try</li>
            <li>THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT TO OWN AND HAVE FOR YOURSELF.</li>
            <li>Like a good</li>
            <li>Also, a smell that costs a fortune, I should be trippin&#x27; with a smell, so good that is beyond measure.</li>
            <li>If you enjoy women telling you how good you smell, then this is the coglone for you!!</li>
            <li>My husband has been using Chanel Allure Sport for a couple of years, and I loved it.</li>
            <li>Scent wise</li>
            <li>Good scent from Chanel for me.&lt;br /&gt;Works</li>
            <li>The Ladies complement me all the time on how good it smells.  </li>
            <li>But I have to say that if you want to make a good impression with a lady, drop the CK Eternity and go for this Bleu De Chanel.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it, good treatment and commit an outrage.</li>
            <li>This is real, true and great.  </li>
            <li>The face of Bleu de Chanel is Gaspard Ulliel who most women find attractive with or without cologne.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t pay $120 for this stuff (even though it&#x27;s worth it; this is amazing cologne)!!!</li>
            <li>Great sexy scent.</li>
            <li>By buy from here I have save times,money and get what I want I recommend to every one out there that its want to smell sexy lol.</li>
            <li>THEY LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>At first I was not to impressed with this cologne.</li>
            <li>and I was pretty impressed.</li>
            <li>Amazing cologne.</li>
            <li>Seems a bit over the top, but this is the fabled House of Chanel.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed that it seems to kick in as it gets warm.</li>
            <li>will be a nice addition to my cologne.</li>
            <li>I just bought this and have recieved so many compliments on how good I smell.  </li>
            <li>she might express that I smell nice.</li>
            <li>People always ask me what kind of fragrance it is?&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a welcome break from Curve, Cool Water, Polo, Eternity, Joop, and Gaultier.  </li>
            <li>recommend any product higher than this incredible fragrance.</li>
            <li>and I just realized that this stuff is very strong.</li>
            <li>If you want a good cologne, try Calvin Klein Eternity or Davidoff Cool Water.  </li>
            <li>IM SURE ANYONE WHO ENJOYS</li>
            <li>But, like Armani&#x27;s Acqua di Gio, Bleu will find its way into millions of homes and waft across the landscape from Paris to Tokyo and the world will be a better place because of it.  </li>
            <li>In my top 5 but please dont buy from here.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this smell.  </li>
            <li>Again, Chanel hits a grand slam for the smelling sensory.  </li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite scent.</li>
            <li>I have never received more compliments on a cologne before.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic and people notice!</li>
            <li>I love Bleu and always receive compliments when I wear it.  </li>
            <li>If you pay more than $84.</li>
            <li>One squirt on the top of my hand</li>
            <li>and I am liking it more and more as I sit here.</li>
            <li>and they would gladly refund my money.  </li>
            <li>Let me preface this by saying that this is not, based on my personal taste, the best smelling cologne out there.</li>
            <li>the smell is elegant and lasts quite a while 3-8 hours depending on many factors.</li>
            <li>but the thing i can promise you is that the women love it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Therefore, though I&#x27;d love to add Bleu to my fragrance collection, I can&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>But it IS an excellent scent which will garner you plenty of female attention wherever you wear it....</li>
            <li>Most of the time a lady is wearing Chanel&lt;br /&gt;products</li>
            <li>it is just a warm wood/floral smooth fragrance and it&lt;</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this cologne.</li>
            <li>make sure the bottle&lt;</li>
            <li>and of course BOD MOST WANTED!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most Wanted is my everday body mist/shower in spray/scent.</li>
            <li>than when i wear MOST WANTED,and they all men and women ask me what it is..</li>
            <li>It works perfectly for days out on the boat, working in the office, grabbing lunch at a local cafe&#x27;, or grocery shopping.  </li>
            <li>The scent itself is so elegant and refined, that I sometimes spray my pillows with it at night to dream to this scent.</li>
            <li>my head, without a more descriptive term to associate with this product)</li>
            <li>-I&#x27;m glad he wrote that</li>
            <li>The scent of this perfume is absolutely fantastic!</li>
            <li>I took it to Bloomingdales and compared with an authentic one and found even more flaws.</li>
            <li>I have been able to wear this in a variety of environments including work, play, and outdoors for sport.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have received many compliments for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;it&#x27;s been pretty good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Strongly recommended this beautiful and wild fragrance.</li>
            <li>This is in my top 10 colognes if you Collect colognes this is a must have in your collection smells really good not to strong not to weak one of the best out there today must have</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very rich and appealing, flawlessly blending marine notes with a contemporary masculine structure.  </li>
            <li>love this perfume, smelled first time in one of the magazines,felt its one of the kind i have been looking for.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell cheap or overpowering like many others I smelled.</li>
            <li>wanted a light and appealing scent.</li>
            <li>All I can say is that this cologne is completely OVERRATED and the smell is not that great.  </li>
            <li>and It is still strong smelling</li>
            <li>it is not too strong but is still manly smelling.</li>
            <li>and it was fine.</li>
            <li>Got here to Afghanistan within a week and a half and smelt amazing!!!!  </li>
            <li>Has a nice clean crisp smell.</li>
            <li>You may pay a little more for this one, but it&#x27;s an awesome fragrance and worth it.  </li>
            <li>Cheap knockoff</li>
            <li>so I was worried i would pick a company with a genuine bottle.  </li>
            <li>but this item is out on the free market for</li>
            <li>the department store I went to they had a gift set with both a 3.4oz bottle and a 0.7oz travel spray + refill, it looks like this is also available on the Chanel website.</li>
            <li>favs, D&amp;G Light Blue,Burberry Touch and Brit, Gucci Homme and Versace.</li>
            <li>The smelling of this product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Personally I think it smells good, but it seems like most women think it smells fantastic.  </li>
            <li>The scent is light and manly combined with his body chemistry, he smells fantastc.</li>
            <li>It sure ain&#x27;t cheap, but it is worth every penny to have this.  </li>
            <li>They seem to absolutely love it, and it does smell good enough to wear.</li>
            <li>And I loved that cologne a lot, very sexy and worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>worth knowing youre getting your moneys worth and aunthenticity!!</li>
            <li>If you generally prefer masculine floral scents then this fragrance is perfect for you.</li>
            <li>A very cool, pleasant, passionate linguring scent that is........</li>
            <li>the old man is SEXY!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh and modern and will be liked or loved by the vast majority of people including the men who wear it and the women who follow in its wake.  </li>
            <li>I know right!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the original product &amp; not some cheap knock off (never happens right ???).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly one of the best marine colognes that is good for casual wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i even spray it on my pillow at nite sometimes because i love it that much.</li>
            <li>and it was lasting and smelled really good.  </li>
            <li>I am into the musky, semi sweet smells and this is in between</li>
            <li>We had tried this Eau de toilette in some different stores, and it has a really good smell,so</li>
            <li>A friend of mine has it and allowed me to pump a full Travalo-worth of Bleu for a test spin over a two week</li>
            <li>I found it to be a good value, especially if you can take advantage of in-store discounts.</li>
            <li>could do 2 full sprays with aqua di gio with no problem, but not this stuff</li>
            <li>The sample smelled good enough, so I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cheap sticker that peels right off.</li>
            <li>The perfume spray work fine the first week after them the spray was damage</li>
            <li>It is fresh and light with a distinct smell.  </li>
            <li>spray it on mildly</li>
            <li>I have had this issue before with ebay, and have found the only sure way to get a authentic item</li>
            <li>mild smell,&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;i wasnt a huge fan of this cologne at first.</li>
            <li>Been wanting it and very satisfied that I got it especially ordering online.</li>
            <li>Smelling it on the little paper strip I was FAR from impressed, but after applying it to my wrists it actually smells much better on the skin and gets even better after an hour or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Will be back for more!</li>
            <li>Is strong so be carefull on how much you use, but is well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Has a clean but very soft classic sense that seems unique in many Chanel scents for women or men alike</li>
            <li>/&gt;It may not be sharp or overbearing, but it is pleasant and versatile.  </li>
            <li>The secondary notes to the fragrance are amazing so even the lingering after-smell is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This clogne smells alright, but for the price that it&#x27;s worth, look someplace else.</li>
            <li>Yes it is Chanel but 79.00 USD doesn&#x27;t make a worth for it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s elegant and mature..</li>
            <li>This was actually my first time wearing cologne in several years and the first time I&#x27;ve gotten unsolicited comments about how good I smell, wearing this 1 night has me sold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it was powerful then</li>
            <li>, it is still powerful now..</li>
            <li>i always reply and smile.</li>
            <li>Now, those two colognes are worth the $$.</li>
            <li>younger girl)-she liked it a lot too-</li>
            <li>my nose and senses respond very positively to that.</li>
            <li>I usually wear CK1 in the day time but the Bleu Chanel colongne with the Bleu aftershave splash lotion is super great for the evening wear or club or lounges</li>
            <li>Apparently Chanel should&#x27;ve created something super unique and funky instead of a rich, smooth, appealing to the masses blue ladykiller scent.  </li>
            <li>right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now</li>
            <li>The description of the smell on the website was right on the money.</li>
            <li>Not to sure if \\&quot;men\\&quot; should do reviews on these items - my wife - whom I dearly love, suggested I do, since I bought this item at a Macy&#x27;s &amp; paid way less ...</li>
            <li>right then that this stuff is very strong and only need a little to smell good for hours.</li>
            <li>They couldn&#x27;t even get the bottle right as the real one is clear but tinted, has a magnetic top, etc.  </li>
            <li>From other reviews and from what I have so far I think this will probably have a great longevity.</li>
            <li>The main reason I&#x27;m writing this is b/c I started to feel like I was getting a headache+stuffy nose within 2 hours of putting it on(2 full sprays of Bleu)---I</li>
            <li>This is definitely going to be my new favorite cologne!</li>
            <li>I first discovered this scent through a friend.  </li>
            <li>My wife really loves it!</li>
            <li>Years ago I&#x27;ve bought my husband Clive Christian \\&quot;X\\&quot; cologne that cost in a range of $300+ for a bottle, or could be more these days.</li>
            <li>as i am writing this review, the price for this identical, possibly counterfeit product is $15 more not including tax and shipping.</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of most Chanel products.</li>
            <li>know (haha)!</li>
            <li>the extra bucks on gas and time on looking ok to go to the mall to buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
            <li>I used to wear Aqua di Gio as my every day fragrance, and more recently shifted to Wood DSquared.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>Bleu De Chanel is hands down my favorite cologne EVER!</li>
            <li>I love this scent so much, but it wouldn&#x27;t last longer than 1 hour!  </li>
            <li>I smelled a lot of colognes but this one seems more soft on the nose than most other similar marine fragrances, it has a nicer balance yet rich depth.</li>
            <li>Will buy for a veeeeery long time for sure.</li>
            <li>definitely would recommend to everyone,as it would just work for everyone nothing special but definitely worth the buy</li>
            <li>The overall effect isn&#x27;t the most original, but it works in practice, big time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>its much more cheaper and usually they have free shipping .....</li>
            <li>/&gt;i do see where some of these retailers r trying to get off on pricing it very high, but ive</li>
            <li>It hardly stay for about good three hours.  </li>
            <li>I was just asked by my wife to get this perfume for her, she used a small tester for some time and liked it very much.</li>
            <li>lesser priced but still great scent and quality,Curve (green bottle)</li>
            <li>sauce, the ingredients are not the whole story.  </li>
            <li>i am not a cologne connosieur so all i have to go by really is the feedback i get from women.</li>
            <li>that does&#x27;t even smell like the real thing.  </li>
            <li>and I can really smell it when it turns on.</li>
            <li>it smells very fruity but not in a feminine way at all.</li>
            <li>And delivery time was fast.  </li>
            <li>Chanel is really the boss when it comes to colognes.</li>
            <li>No matter how much of it was sprayed, after 1-2 minutes, you could not spell the fragrance at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>u kno if Bleu talks to u, its the real deal!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>thanks for the inventer of the product.</li>
            <li>its really nice!&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
            <li>i am sure other people will like the scent of this while i am wearing it.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s smell is not similar to the original</li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone that wants a new smell for men!</li>
            <li>It is so engaging, a little bit too powerful and dreamy too.</li>
            <li>Nuff said - head on over to Macy&#x27;s &amp; get for less :-)</li>
            <li>I just got this today at the mall, mainly because the lady working there recommended it-</li>
            <li>Just be careful as it is strong and if you over spray you might get a head ache and make people around you sneeze.</li>
            <li>for me, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this cologne.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this spray.  </li>
            <li>The proportion, quality, and finishing touches are critical and Chanel gets them exactly right.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s going to be my new signature scent.  </li>
            <li>I have been in the market for a new scent.</li>
            <li>and I new</li>
            <li>After reading alot of&lt;br /&gt;reviews about Bleu and wanting to add something new decided to purchase this and&lt;br</li>
            <li>was looking for a new cologne for my hubby.  </li>
            <li>but this is my new favourite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never gotten that high volume of compliments wearing any of the other colognes that I like better personally.</li>
            <li>I smell amazing when I wear it, and I&#x27;ve only had it for a few days.</li>
            <li>I got a great deal and spent 30% less although those guys took a month to send it to me from some far off European company.</li>
            <li>I also bought this directly from department store!</li>
            <li>after a day or two I got an email that said just to keep the product as they had become aware of an inferior product that had been shipped out and subsequently on checking the bank account</li>
            <li>first of all, i want to state that you do not want to buy this on amazon if the price is above $85.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Amazon&#x27;s customer server however, was terrific and greatly appreciated on helping to resolved this problem!</li>
            <li>Yo can buy Bleu direct from Chanel itself for $84.</li>
            <li>, i bought this directly off chanel&#x27;s website for $89.</li>
            <li>this cologne is refined, fruity and extremely classy.</li>
            <li>over all, i say get this cologne, wow the women</li>
            <li>I have tried every  conceivable fragrance out there for men I received some samples of this</li>
            <li>Upon further inspection, I noticed the bottle&#x27;s finishing weren&#x27;t smooth either and the scent was similar but not the same.</li>
            <li>let me first say is im not love with the scent when i first tried it.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Dolce and Gabbana light blue and the one as well as hugo Boss Dark Blue and this Bleu De Chanel</li>
            <li>Bottle caps isn&#x27;t magnetic like authentic one, box was missing some other details, etc..</li>
            <li>Anyway - my wife likes it &amp; it seems to last the entire day, which is the sign of a high quality product.</li>
            <li>His fame will only grow when \\&quot;La Princesse de Montpensier\\&quot; is released in France in early November 2010.  </li>
            <li>, I for one am not disappointed in the least with the scent of this gem.  </li>
            <li>I mean, I own Versace Pour Homme (2007), Perry Ellis 360 Red, CK Eternity Aqua, and other scents which are fairly similar and achieve the desired effect, but are not cost prohibitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First, this is not a very overwhelming scent which I like.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>One last thing I have been searching for something that will project far and last a long time.</li>
            <li>I personally prefer a much softer scent like Prada Infusion, or less commercial scent like BLV.     </li>
            <li>The scent is very up front and a little in your face.</li>

            <li> I watched a YouTube clip for this cologne and this guy goes off telling the viewers that this is the greatest cologne ever.  </li>
            <li> product in excellent quality and without faults.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS COLOGNE!!!</li>
            <li> This a great buy at a great value!</li>
            <li> and u save up on not using the good stuff! :p</li>
            <li> Definately a great going out cologne.  </li>
            <li> lol</li>
            <li> Great Product.  </li>
            <li> Found it at a great price here.  </li>
            <li> There must be something in this cologne that appeals a great deal to women.  </li>
            <li> This product is very great and smells wonderful and has helped me if I got to any special occasion.</li>
            <li> I still love Allure Blanche and consider Givenchy Pour Homme to be one of the best fragrances a guy can wear.  </li>
            <li> I originally had gone in with the intention of picking up the Versace por Homme that has great reviews here on Amazon, but after smelling it in person I wasn&#x27;t all that impressed.</li>
            <li> Both my date and girls at the party had made remarks about how great I smelled, can&#x27;t ask for more than that!</li>
            <li> /&gt;really good, good good good good, good good good ,,.&lt;br /&gt;try</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT TO OWN AND HAVE FOR YOURSELF.</li>
            <li> Like a good</li>
            <li> Also, a smell that costs a fortune, I should be trippin&#x27; with a smell, so good that is beyond measure.</li>
            <li> If you enjoy women telling you how good you smell, then this is the coglone for you!!</li>
            <li> My husband has been using Chanel Allure Sport for a couple of years, and I loved it.</li>
            <li> Scent wise</li>
            <li> Good scent from Chanel for me.&lt;br /&gt;Works</li>
            <li> The Ladies complement me all the time on how good it smells.  </li>
            <li> But I have to say that if you want to make a good impression with a lady, drop the CK Eternity and go for this Bleu De Chanel.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it, good treatment and commit an outrage.</li>
            <li> This is real, true and great.  </li>
            <li> The face of Bleu de Chanel is Gaspard Ulliel who most women find attractive with or without cologne.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t pay $120 for this stuff (even though it&#x27;s worth it; this is amazing cologne)!!!</li>
            <li> Great sexy scent.</li>
            <li> By buy from here I have save times,money and get what I want I recommend to every one out there that its want to smell sexy lol.</li>
            <li> THEY LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> At first I was not to impressed with this cologne.</li>
            <li> and I was pretty impressed.</li>
            <li> Amazing cologne.</li>
            <li> Seems a bit over the top, but this is the fabled House of Chanel.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed that it seems to kick in as it gets warm.</li>
            <li> will be a nice addition to my cologne.</li>
            <li> I just bought this and have recieved so many compliments on how good I smell.  </li>
            <li> she might express that I smell nice.</li>
            <li> People always ask me what kind of fragrance it is?&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a welcome break from Curve, Cool Water, Polo, Eternity, Joop, and Gaultier.  </li>
            <li> recommend any product higher than this incredible fragrance.</li>
            <li> and I just realized that this stuff is very strong.</li>
            <li> If you want a good cologne, try Calvin Klein Eternity or Davidoff Cool Water.  </li>
            <li> IM SURE ANYONE WHO ENJOYS</li>
            <li> But, like Armani&#x27;s Acqua di Gio, Bleu will find its way into millions of homes and waft across the landscape from Paris to Tokyo and the world will be a better place because of it.  </li>
            <li> In my top 5 but please dont buy from here.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this smell.  </li>
            <li> Again, Chanel hits a grand slam for the smelling sensory.  </li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite scent.</li>
            <li> I have never received more compliments on a cologne before.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic and people notice!</li>
            <li> I love Bleu and always receive compliments when I wear it.  </li>
            <li> If you pay more than $84.</li>
            <li> One squirt on the top of my hand</li>
            <li> and I am liking it more and more as I sit here.</li>
            <li> and they would gladly refund my money.  </li>
            <li> Let me preface this by saying that this is not, based on my personal taste, the best smelling cologne out there.</li>
            <li> the smell is elegant and lasts quite a while 3-8 hours depending on many factors.</li>
            <li> but the thing i can promise you is that the women love it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Therefore, though I&#x27;d love to add Bleu to my fragrance collection, I can&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> But it IS an excellent scent which will garner you plenty of female attention wherever you wear it....</li>
            <li> Most of the time a lady is wearing Chanel&lt;br /&gt;products</li>
            <li> it is just a warm wood/floral smooth fragrance and it&lt;</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this cologne.</li>
            <li> make sure the bottle&lt;</li>
            <li> and of course BOD MOST WANTED!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most Wanted is my everday body mist/shower in spray/scent.</li>
            <li> than when i wear MOST WANTED,and they all men and women ask me what it is..</li>
            <li> It works perfectly for days out on the boat, working in the office, grabbing lunch at a local cafe&#x27;, or grocery shopping.  </li>
            <li> The scent itself is so elegant and refined, that I sometimes spray my pillows with it at night to dream to this scent.</li>
            <li> my head, without a more descriptive term to associate with this product)</li>
            <li> -I&#x27;m glad he wrote that</li>
            <li> The scent of this perfume is absolutely fantastic!</li>
            <li> I took it to Bloomingdales and compared with an authentic one and found even more flaws.</li>
            <li> I have been able to wear this in a variety of environments including work, play, and outdoors for sport.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have received many compliments for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;it&#x27;s been pretty good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Strongly recommended this beautiful and wild fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is in my top 10 colognes if you Collect colognes this is a must have in your collection smells really good not to strong not to weak one of the best out there today must have</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very rich and appealing, flawlessly blending marine notes with a contemporary masculine structure.  </li>
            <li> love this perfume, smelled first time in one of the magazines,felt its one of the kind i have been looking for.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell cheap or overpowering like many others I smelled.</li>
            <li> wanted a light and appealing scent.</li>
            <li> All I can say is that this cologne is completely OVERRATED and the smell is not that great.  </li>
            <li> and It is still strong smelling</li>
            <li> it is not too strong but is still manly smelling.</li>
            <li> and it was fine.</li>
            <li> Got here to Afghanistan within a week and a half and smelt amazing!!!!  </li>
            <li> Has a nice clean crisp smell.</li>
            <li> You may pay a little more for this one, but it&#x27;s an awesome fragrance and worth it.  </li>
            <li> Cheap knockoff</li>
            <li> so I was worried i would pick a company with a genuine bottle.  </li>
            <li> but this item is out on the free market for</li>
            <li> the department store I went to they had a gift set with both a 3.4oz bottle and a 0.7oz travel spray + refill, it looks like this is also available on the Chanel website.</li>
            <li> favs, D&amp;G Light Blue,Burberry Touch and Brit, Gucci Homme and Versace.</li>
            <li> The smelling of this product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Personally I think it smells good, but it seems like most women think it smells fantastic.  </li>
            <li> The scent is light and manly combined with his body chemistry, he smells fantastc.</li>
            <li> It sure ain&#x27;t cheap, but it is worth every penny to have this.  </li>
            <li> They seem to absolutely love it, and it does smell good enough to wear.</li>
            <li> And I loved that cologne a lot, very sexy and worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> worth knowing youre getting your moneys worth and aunthenticity!!</li>
            <li> If you generally prefer masculine floral scents then this fragrance is perfect for you.</li>
            <li> A very cool, pleasant, passionate linguring scent that is........</li>
            <li> the old man is SEXY!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fresh and modern and will be liked or loved by the vast majority of people including the men who wear it and the women who follow in its wake.  </li>
            <li> I know right!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the original product &amp; not some cheap knock off (never happens right ???).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly one of the best marine colognes that is good for casual wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i even spray it on my pillow at nite sometimes because i love it that much.</li>
            <li> and it was lasting and smelled really good.  </li>
            <li> I am into the musky, semi sweet smells and this is in between</li>
            <li> We had tried this Eau de toilette in some different stores, and it has a really good smell,so</li>
            <li> A friend of mine has it and allowed me to pump a full Travalo-worth of Bleu for a test spin over a two week</li>
            <li> I found it to be a good value, especially if you can take advantage of in-store discounts.</li>
            <li> could do 2 full sprays with aqua di gio with no problem, but not this stuff</li>
            <li> The sample smelled good enough, so I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cheap sticker that peels right off.</li>
            <li> The perfume spray work fine the first week after them the spray was damage</li>
            <li> It is fresh and light with a distinct smell.  </li>
            <li> spray it on mildly</li>
            <li> I have had this issue before with ebay, and have found the only sure way to get a authentic item</li>
            <li> mild smell,&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;i wasnt a huge fan of this cologne at first.</li>
            <li> Been wanting it and very satisfied that I got it especially ordering online.</li>
            <li> Smelling it on the little paper strip I was FAR from impressed, but after applying it to my wrists it actually smells much better on the skin and gets even better after an hour or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Will be back for more!</li>
            <li> Is strong so be carefull on how much you use, but is well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> Has a clean but very soft classic sense that seems unique in many Chanel scents for women or men alike</li>
            <li> /&gt;It may not be sharp or overbearing, but it is pleasant and versatile.  </li>
            <li> The secondary notes to the fragrance are amazing so even the lingering after-smell is amazing.  </li>
            <li> This clogne smells alright, but for the price that it&#x27;s worth, look someplace else.</li>
            <li> Yes it is Chanel but 79.00 USD doesn&#x27;t make a worth for it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s elegant and mature..</li>
            <li> This was actually my first time wearing cologne in several years and the first time I&#x27;ve gotten unsolicited comments about how good I smell, wearing this 1 night has me sold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it was powerful then</li>
            <li> , it is still powerful now..</li>
            <li> i always reply and smile.</li>
            <li> Now, those two colognes are worth the $$.</li>
            <li> younger girl)-she liked it a lot too-</li>
            <li> my nose and senses respond very positively to that.</li>
            <li> I usually wear CK1 in the day time but the Bleu Chanel colongne with the Bleu aftershave splash lotion is super great for the evening wear or club or lounges</li>
            <li> Apparently Chanel should&#x27;ve created something super unique and funky instead of a rich, smooth, appealing to the masses blue ladykiller scent.  </li>
            <li> right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now</li>
            <li> The description of the smell on the website was right on the money.</li>
            <li> Not to sure if \\&quot;men\\&quot; should do reviews on these items - my wife - whom I dearly love, suggested I do, since I bought this item at a Macy&#x27;s &amp; paid way less ...</li>
            <li> right then that this stuff is very strong and only need a little to smell good for hours.</li>
            <li> They couldn&#x27;t even get the bottle right as the real one is clear but tinted, has a magnetic top, etc.  </li>
            <li> From other reviews and from what I have so far I think this will probably have a great longevity.</li>
            <li> The main reason I&#x27;m writing this is b/c I started to feel like I was getting a headache+stuffy nose within 2 hours of putting it on(2 full sprays of Bleu)---I</li>
            <li> This is definitely going to be my new favorite cologne!</li>
            <li> I first discovered this scent through a friend.  </li>
            <li> My wife really loves it!</li>
            <li> Years ago I&#x27;ve bought my husband Clive Christian \\&quot;X\\&quot; cologne that cost in a range of $300+ for a bottle, or could be more these days.</li>
            <li> as i am writing this review, the price for this identical, possibly counterfeit product is $15 more not including tax and shipping.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of most Chanel products.</li>
            <li> know (haha)!</li>
            <li> the extra bucks on gas and time on looking ok to go to the mall to buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
            <li> I used to wear Aqua di Gio as my every day fragrance, and more recently shifted to Wood DSquared.</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> Bleu De Chanel is hands down my favorite cologne EVER!</li>
            <li> I love this scent so much, but it wouldn&#x27;t last longer than 1 hour!  </li>
            <li> I smelled a lot of colognes but this one seems more soft on the nose than most other similar marine fragrances, it has a nicer balance yet rich depth.</li>
            <li> Will buy for a veeeeery long time for sure.</li>
            <li> definitely would recommend to everyone,as it would just work for everyone nothing special but definitely worth the buy</li>
            <li> The overall effect isn&#x27;t the most original, but it works in practice, big time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> its much more cheaper and usually they have free shipping .....</li>
            <li> /&gt;i do see where some of these retailers r trying to get off on pricing it very high, but ive</li>
            <li> It hardly stay for about good three hours.  </li>
            <li> I was just asked by my wife to get this perfume for her, she used a small tester for some time and liked it very much.</li>
            <li> lesser priced but still great scent and quality,Curve (green bottle)</li>
            <li> sauce, the ingredients are not the whole story.  </li>
            <li> i am not a cologne connosieur so all i have to go by really is the feedback i get from women.</li>
            <li> that does&#x27;t even smell like the real thing.  </li>
            <li> and I can really smell it when it turns on.</li>
            <li> it smells very fruity but not in a feminine way at all.</li>
            <li> And delivery time was fast.  </li>
            <li> Chanel is really the boss when it comes to colognes.</li>
            <li> No matter how much of it was sprayed, after 1-2 minutes, you could not spell the fragrance at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> u kno if Bleu talks to u, its the real deal!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> thanks for the inventer of the product.</li>
            <li> its really nice!&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
            <li> i am sure other people will like the scent of this while i am wearing it.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s smell is not similar to the original</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone that wants a new smell for men!</li>
            <li> It is so engaging, a little bit too powerful and dreamy too.</li>
            <li> Nuff said - head on over to Macy&#x27;s &amp; get for less :-)</li>
            <li> I just got this today at the mall, mainly because the lady working there recommended it-</li>
            <li> Just be careful as it is strong and if you over spray you might get a head ache and make people around you sneeze.</li>
            <li> for me, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this cologne.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this spray.  </li>
            <li> The proportion, quality, and finishing touches are critical and Chanel gets them exactly right.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s going to be my new signature scent.  </li>
            <li> I have been in the market for a new scent.</li>
            <li> and I new</li>
            <li> After reading alot of&lt;br /&gt;reviews about Bleu and wanting to add something new decided to purchase this and&lt;br</li>
            <li> was looking for a new cologne for my hubby.  </li>
            <li> but this is my new favourite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never gotten that high volume of compliments wearing any of the other colognes that I like better personally.</li>
            <li> I smell amazing when I wear it, and I&#x27;ve only had it for a few days.</li>
            <li> I got a great deal and spent 30% less although those guys took a month to send it to me from some far off European company.</li>
            <li> I also bought this directly from department store!</li>
            <li> after a day or two I got an email that said just to keep the product as they had become aware of an inferior product that had been shipped out and subsequently on checking the bank account</li>
            <li> first of all, i want to state that you do not want to buy this on amazon if the price is above $85.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Amazon&#x27;s customer server however, was terrific and greatly appreciated on helping to resolved this problem!</li>
            <li> Yo can buy Bleu direct from Chanel itself for $84.</li>
            <li> , i bought this directly off chanel&#x27;s website for $89.</li>
            <li> this cologne is refined, fruity and extremely classy.</li>
            <li> over all, i say get this cologne, wow the women</li>
            <li> I have tried every  conceivable fragrance out there for men I received some samples of this</li>
            <li> Upon further inspection, I noticed the bottle&#x27;s finishing weren&#x27;t smooth either and the scent was similar but not the same.</li>
            <li> let me first say is im not love with the scent when i first tried it.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Dolce and Gabbana light blue and the one as well as hugo Boss Dark Blue and this Bleu De Chanel</li>
            <li> Bottle caps isn&#x27;t magnetic like authentic one, box was missing some other details, etc..</li>
            <li> Anyway - my wife likes it &amp; it seems to last the entire day, which is the sign of a high quality product.</li>
            <li> His fame will only grow when \\&quot;La Princesse de Montpensier\\&quot; is released in France in early November 2010.  </li>
            <li> , I for one am not disappointed in the least with the scent of this gem.  </li>
            <li> I mean, I own Versace Pour Homme (2007), Perry Ellis 360 Red, CK Eternity Aqua, and other scents which are fairly similar and achieve the desired effect, but are not cost prohibitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First, this is not a very overwhelming scent which I like.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> One last thing I have been searching for something that will project far and last a long time.</li>
            <li> I personally prefer a much softer scent like Prada Infusion, or less commercial scent like BLV.     </li>
            <li> The scent is very up front and a little in your face.</li>
            <li> When I take my work tshirt off and put on my casual tshirt from the morning to go back home, I am always in love with the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was the only person that felt sick from using too much-</li>
            <li> it wasnt harsh, ultra manly and strong like how i usually want my cologne to be</li>
            <li> and it just set itself apart  from the rest  of the other manufactures by far.  </li>
            <li> (due to) the explosion of sales of items purported to be Chanel and frequently counterfeit over the Internet.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last that long on your skin or clothing.</li>
            <li> The bottle received was old or seemed to have been watered down.  </li>
            <li> On other days wear other colognes but this is my new favourite alongside Armani Code, Aqua, Fierce and even Pulse Axe deo spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s old or expired or watered down, but compared to my other Bleu De Chanel (Chanel bought cologne) it smells different, doesn&#x27;t last at all, and was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time as well.</li>
            <li> Item also arrived earlier than I expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While browsing the counter I approached a cute customer who was nearby and asked her if she had any opinions on men&#x27;s cologne and she launched into telling me how obsessed she was with the Bleu de Chanel scent (even comparing it with a lot of other fragrances, this girl knew her stuff!).</li>
            <li> only problem is that the price for this fragrance is heavily inflated (obviously considering it&#x27;s from Chanel).  </li>
            <li> In my view, product is not worth it for a somewhat similar fragrance which is already out there.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s tough to buy a scent completely on the opinions of other people considering that it is completely subjective.</li>
            <li> I had a previous bottle of same product from macy&#x27;s  </li>
            <li> Ed Hardy (blue bottle) CK Be (black bottle)</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m a little nervous as the only result of this transaction</li>
            <li> curious, it retails for $79.00, who are these schmuck e-tailors selling this for $150.00 plus?</li>
            <li> The notes include citrus, jasmine, nutmeg, pink pepper, grapefruit, labdanum, ginger, vetiver, mint, patchouli, sandalwood, and cedar.  </li>
            <li> I waited a few days and went back today and tested it on my skin not a card.</li>
            <li> but after wearing it for a few days, i finally understood.</li>
            <li> The emblem on the cap is off center.</li>
            <li> Did not smell as expected.</li>
            <li> I walked around the mall for a bit to see how it would dry down</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> its not a sharp smell in the least.</li>
            <li> Gaspard also appears in the so-called \\&quot;film\\&quot; or advertisement promoting Bleu which was directed by none other than Martin Scorsese.  </li>
            <li> The other comfort I have is that since I bought this @Macy&#x27;s ...</li>
            <li> I first tried it on because the sales girl at Dillard&#x27;s directed me to it after I asked her about another cologne, stating she was obsessed with the scent.     </li>
            <li> Also if the scent is wearing off after 5 minutes the seller must be watering it down.</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a watered down bottle.</li>
            <li> about average, you won&#x27;t find this bottle half price anywhere.</li>
            <li> less then what is posted here.</li>
            <li> At the end of my day changing out of my clothes&lt;br /&gt;can still slightly smell the scent on my clothes.  </li>
            <li> It dies down a little when its not on.</li>
            <li> i have tons of female friends and some of them are hard to get a compliment from but one was just at macys and told me she saw it and is buying it for me!</li>
            <li> I even took that little card they spray the cologne on to ask someone else&#x27;s opinion(a</li>
            <li> Might be the reason it was a few dollars cheaper.</li>
            <li> because the smell would disappeared after 5 minutes you wear on!and unfortunately you can only smell the alcohol of it...  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna try 1 small spray tomorrow+see</li>
            <li> if I feel crappy again-I&#x27;ll try to add on to this review tomorrow to say if 1 small spray made me sick also-I really like the smell, so</li>
            <li> we were not really satisfied with our purchase,I think it was a fake one or had been in stock for a long time!</li>
            <li> dont buy it on amazon its very expensive buy directly from chanel.com</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive but it does long.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother buying it on this website, you&#x27;ll save at least $25+ by going to Macy&#x27;s and getting it.</li>
            <li> bottle is very small but at 3.4oz is what one should expect.</li>
            <li> with you in a subtle way.</li>
            <li> Had smelt samples before, and this possibly could have been a bad or off bottle.</li>
            <li> This is a fake product.  </li>
            <li> I had read about the fake bottles of this being sent out</li>
            <li> sorry Amazon ...</li>
            <li> is I have a useless product and this distributor now has a debit card number .</li>
            <li> YOU CANNOT GO WRONG purchasing this product, however I would not purchase it from Amazon for $105-$111.00 for a 3.4oz bottle when I can buy it from the department store for $115.00 and have the 5oz bottle.</li>
            <li> This product is a fake.</li>
            <li> and so i think that this product is very poor quality</li>
            <li> i am disappointed, becouse quality of this product is poor.</li>
            <li> the women go crazy over it.</li>
            <li> I try to contact the distribuitor and was impossible.</li>
            <li> But if they don&#x27;t, too bad.  </li>
            <li> i was shocked to see the price on this cologne.</li>
            <li> OMG, this cologne will be complimented on until you are sick of compliments.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT TO OWN AND HAVE FOR YOURSELF. IM SURE ANYONE WHO ENJOYS THE LIGHTER SENT WILL BE HEAVILY IMPRESSED WITH THIS FRAGRANCE</li>
            <li> I first discovered this scent through a friend.  I got a whiff of it and HAD to know what it was!  That very same evening, I ordered it online.  I think it&#x27;s going to be my new signature scent.  I LOVE THIS COLOGNE!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome fragrance killer smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just curious, it retails for $79.00, who are these schmuck e-tailors selling this for $150.00 plus?</li>
            <li> love this perfume, smelled first time in one of the magazines,felt its one of the kind i have been looking for. dont buy it on amazon its very expensive buy directly from chanel.com its much more cheaper and usually they have free shipping .....definitely would recommend to everyone,as it would just work for everyone nothing special but definitely worth the buy</li>
            <li> You may pay a little more for this one, but it&#x27;s an awesome fragrance and worth it.  My wife really loves it!</li>
            <li> Bleu de Chanel is a woody aromatic fragrance for men.  It&#x27;s fresh and modern and will be liked or loved by the vast majority of people including the men who wear it and the women who follow in its wake.  There is nothing disagreeable in this delightful cocktail by master blender Jacques Polge.  The notes include citrus, jasmine, nutmeg, pink pepper, grapefruit, labdanum, ginger, vetiver, mint, patchouli, sandalwood, and cedar.  Like a good B&amp;eacute;chamel sauce, the ingredients are not the whole story.  The proportion, quality, and finishing touches are critical and Chanel gets them exactly right.  The face of Bleu de Chanel is Gaspard Ulliel who most women find attractive with or without cologne.  His fame will only grow when \\&quot;La Princesse de Montpensier\\&quot; is released in France in early November 2010.  Gaspard also appears in the so-called \\&quot;film\\&quot; or advertisement promoting Bleu which was directed by none other than Martin Scorsese.  Seems a bit over the top, but this is the fabled House of Chanel.  I still love Allure Blanche and consider Givenchy Pour Homme to be one of the best fragrances a guy can wear.  But, like Armani&#x27;s Acqua di Gio, Bleu will find its way into millions of homes and waft across the landscape from Paris to Tokyo and the world will be a better place because of it.  Do yourself a favor and get Bleu for your guy.  It&#x27;s a welcome break from Curve, Cool Water, Polo, Eternity, Joop, and Gaultier.  Macy&#x27;s sells a 3.4 oz bottle of Bleu for $79.</li>
            <li> it is aromatic but it spoiled my shirts leaving marks of the perfume on my shirt.. and it is expansive ...</li>
            <li> i am not a cologne connosieur so all i have to go by really is the feedback i get from women. THEY LOVE IT! i have tons of female friends and some of them are hard to get a compliment from but one was just at macys and told me she saw it and is buying it for me! i even spray it on my pillow at nite sometimes because i love it that much. and even in my beard at nite.</li>
            <li> This is a fake product.  Cheap knockoff that does&#x27;t even smell like the real thing.  They couldn&#x27;t even get the bottle right as the real one is clear but tinted, has a magnetic top, etc.  Don&#x27;t be fooled.</li>
            <li> Amazing cologne. In my top 5 but please dont buy from here. Just went to Sephora and bought it for 59.00!!! Don&#x27;t fall for this price</li>
            <li> i was shocked to see the price on this cologne. it is $84 at my local Macy&#x27;s and Von Maur dept stores. Don&#x27;t pay $120 for this stuff (even though it&#x27;s worth it; this is amazing cologne)!!!</li>
            <li> I had read about the fake bottles of this being sent out so I was worried i would pick a company with a genuine bottle.  This is real, true and great.  i am sure other people will like the scent of this while i am wearing it.  But if they don&#x27;t, too bad.  I LOVE this smell.  I will put it on for myself.  In 1969 I got my girlfriend a bottle of Chanel #5.  That was the best smelling perfume i have ever smelled for a woman.  Again, Chanel hits a grand slam for the smelling sensory.  It sure ain&#x27;t cheap, but it is worth every penny to have this.  Thank you Chanel and thank you dear wife for letting me spend the money.</li>
            <li> Not to sure if \\&quot;men\\&quot; should do reviews on these items - my wife - whom I dearly love, suggested I do, since I bought this item at a Macy&#x27;s &amp; paid way less ... sorry Amazon ... but this item is out on the free market for less then what is posted here. The other comfort I have is that since I bought this @Macy&#x27;s ... it&#x27;s the original product &amp; not some cheap knock off (never happens right ???). Anyway - my wife likes it &amp; it seems to last the entire day, which is the sign of a high quality product. Nuff said - head on over to Macy&#x27;s &amp; get for less :-)</li>
            <li> This cologne is the perfect cologne. Been wanting it and very satisfied that I got it especially ordering online. I remembered the smell from a friend and that&#x27;s all it took for me to order a year later</li>
            <li> I smelled a lot of colognes but this one seems more soft on the nose than most other similar marine fragrances, it has a nicer balance yet rich depth. Doesn&#x27;t smell cheap or overpowering like many others I smelled. Has a clean but very soft classic sense that seems unique in many Chanel scents for women or men alike I noticed, like an aromatic powder that is energizing to the senses. It&#x27;s certainly one of the best marine colognes that is good for casual wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this from Macys for $84.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite scent. Women will ALWAYS ask what it is you are wearing. Don&#x27;t bother buying it on this website, you&#x27;ll save at least $25+ by going to Macy&#x27;s and getting it.</li>
            <li> I love this scent so much, but it wouldn&#x27;t last longer than 1 hour!  I also bought this directly from department store!</li>
            <li> This clogne smells alright, but for the price that it&#x27;s worth, look someplace else. It doesn&#x27;t last that long on your skin or clothing. Also, a smell that costs a fortune, I should be trippin&#x27; with a smell, so good that is beyond measure. Like, I should get a nose orgasm.</li>
            <li> I have never received more compliments on a cologne before. It smells fantastic and people notice! Lasts a long time as well.</li>
            <li> I love Bleu and always receive compliments when I wear it.  A little goes a long way. It is fresh and light with a distinct smell.  A note though about the seller and their price; it is way inflated.  Yo can buy Bleu direct from Chanel itself for $84. It has never retailed for $156! Never!  If you pay more than $84., you are being robbed.</li>
            <li> Yes it is Chanel but 79.00 USD doesn&#x27;t make a worth for it.  It hardly stay for about good three hours.  In my view, product is not worth it for a somewhat similar fragrance which is already out there.</li>
            <li> I have been in the market for a new scent. At first I was not to impressed with this cologne. While at Macy&#x27;s and smelling tons of cologne it was one of the last scents I smelled. My nose was shot after about an hour of smelling and testing. I waited a few days and went back today and tested it on my skin not a card. I walked around the mall for a bit to see how it would dry down and I was pretty impressed. One squirt on the top of my hand and it was lasting and smelled really good.  I decided to take a chance and bought it. I got home and sprayed one squirt on both my wrists and one on the neck and I just realized that this stuff is very strong. As I sat in my office working my eyes started to water and I new right then that this stuff is very strong and only need a little to smell good for hours. I have had it on for about 3 hours now and It is still strong smelling and I am liking it more and more as I sit here. I have noticed that it seems to kick in as it gets warm. I have my heater on in my shop and I can really smell it when it turns on. It dies down a little when its not on. Just thought that I would toss that info in. I am into the musky, semi sweet smells and this is in between and I like it. I have been using Dolce and Gabbana light blue and the one as well as hugo Boss Dark Blue and this Bleu De Chanel will be a nice addition to my cologne. One last thing I have been searching for something that will project far and last a long time. From other reviews and from what I have so far I think this will probably have a great longevity. Just be careful as it is strong and if you over spray you might get a head ache and make people around you sneeze.</li>
            <li> The scent is intoxicating. Years ago I&#x27;ve bought my husband Clive Christian \\&quot;X\\&quot; cologne that cost in a range of $300+ for a bottle, or could be more these days. And I loved that cologne a lot, very sexy and worth the money spent. But these days I don&#x27;t think I can afford such a splurge. So I&#x27;ve bought this one because it resembles that \\&quot;X\\&quot; by Clive Christian. Perhaps it&#x27;s just to me, but I think it smells just identical, just a bit weaker. I gave it to my hubby for Valentines, and literally was following him everywhere. Great sexy scent.</li>
            <li> the product came from Apollo distributors. it sprayed out with no scent beyond rubbing alcohol. I had a previous bottle of same product from macy&#x27;s  and it was fine. this packaging had &amp;#34;knock-off&amp;#34; written all over it . I emailed and called the distributor and spoke with an individual who apologized;couldn&#x27;t understand how there could be a problem and he was going to get me a shipping label so I could send it back and they would gladly refund my money.  after a day or two I got an email that said just to keep the product as they had become aware of an inferior product that had been shipped out and subsequently on checking the bank account( I used a debit card)the refund was there.  but what a runaround and i&#x27;m a little nervous as the only result of this transaction is I have a useless product and this distributor now has a debit card number .</li>
            <li> This is one of the best scents ever!  I just bought this and have recieved so many compliments on how good I smell.  Is strong so be carefull on how much you use, but is well worth the price.  If you enjoy women telling you how good you smell, then this is the coglone for you!!</li>
            <li> we were not really satisfied with our purchase,I think it was a fake one or had been in stock for a long time! because the smell would disappeared after 5 minutes you wear on!and unfortunately you can only smell the alcohol of it...  We had tried this Eau de toilette in some different stores, and it has a really good smell,so I think the problem was this specific one which we had bought!</li>
            <li> Let me preface this by saying that this is not, based on my personal taste, the best smelling cologne out there. The scent is very up front and a little in your face. I personally prefer a much softer scent like Prada Infusion, or less commercial scent like BLV.     However, I have been told by every girl and woman I run into that I smell amazing when I wear it, and I&#x27;ve only had it for a few days. I&#x27;ve never gotten that high volume of compliments wearing any of the other colognes that I like better personally. I first tried it on because the sales girl at Dillard&#x27;s directed me to it after I asked her about another cologne, stating she was obsessed with the scent.     So basically, that does it for me, and it will probably be my go to cologne in the future. After all, isn&#x27;t the point of wearing cologne to impress women? If they like it, it doesn&#x27;t matter if I prefer another scent.</li>
            <li> The way the label was affixed to the bottle initially made me suspicious, however, the scent was indeed that of Bleu De Chanel!!</li>
            <li> first of all, i want to state that you do not want to buy this on amazon if the price is above $85. including tax and shipping (in the u.s.), i bought this directly off chanel&#x27;s website for $89. as i am writing this review, the price for this identical, possibly counterfeit product is $15 more not including tax and shipping. so from a bargain shopper to another... do not buy from amazon right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now for the review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i wasnt a huge fan of this cologne at first. it wasnt harsh, ultra manly and strong like how i usually want my cologne to be but after wearing it for a few days, i finally understood. this cologne is refined, fruity and extremely classy. it smells very fruity but not in a feminine way at all. its not a sharp smell in the least. it smells like something a man such a james bond would wear to a ball although you could wear this for any occasion, all day. dont let the simple looking bottle fool you. the smell is elegant and lasts quite a while 3-8 hours depending on many factors. over all, i say get this cologne, wow the women but dont buy from amazon at this current price of $105+ shipping + tax.</li>
            <li> This is in my top 10 colognes if you Collect colognes this is a must have in your collection smells really good not to strong not to weak one of the best out there today must have</li>
            <li> let me first say is im not love with the scent when i first tried it.  but the thing i can promise you is that the women love it.  I get a ton of compliments on it  from work gym school.  It&#x27;s expensive but it does long.  Definately a great going out cologne.  Im a burberry touch, versace aux fraische guy but this is a definite scent to add to your collection..  It&#x27;s elegant and mature..</li>
            <li> I have tried every  conceivable fragrance out there for men I received some samples of this and it just set itself apart  from the rest  of the other manufactures by far.  I will order it again count on it</li>
            <li> By buy from here I have save times,money and get what I want I recommend to every one out there that its want to smell sexy lol.</li>
            <li> This must be the best men&#x27;s fragrance...ever... My husband has been using Chanel Allure Sport for a couple of years, and I loved it. But Bleu de Chanel...OMG. I can&#x27;t get my nose away from my husband. He calls this fragrance a \\&quot;baby maker\\&quot;... LOL&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t recommend any product higher than this incredible fragrance.</li>
            <li> this fragrance gets a lot of flak on various fragrance review sites for supposedly not living up to what some \\&quot;expected\\&quot; Chanel to release a couple years ago.  Apparently Chanel should&#x27;ve created something super unique and funky instead of a rich, smooth, appealing to the masses blue ladykiller scent.  A friend of mine has it and allowed me to pump a full Travalo-worth of Bleu for a test spin over a two week period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I for one am not disappointed in the least with the scent of this gem.  It&#x27;s very rich and appealing, flawlessly blending marine notes with a contemporary masculine structure.  The overall effect isn&#x27;t the most original, but it works in practice, big time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is that the price for this fragrance is heavily inflated (obviously considering it&#x27;s from Chanel).  I mean, I own Versace Pour Homme (2007), Perry Ellis 360 Red, CK Eternity Aqua, and other scents which are fairly similar and achieve the desired effect, but are not cost prohibitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, though I&#x27;d love to add Bleu to my fragrance collection, I can&#x27;t.  But it IS an excellent scent which will garner you plenty of female attention wherever you wear it.... bank on it...</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of most Chanel products. Most of the time a lady is wearing Chanel&lt;br /&gt;products my nose and senses respond very positively to that. After reading alot of&lt;br /&gt;reviews about Bleu and wanting to add something new decided to purchase this and&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s been pretty good. First, this is not a very overwhelming scent which I like.&lt;br /&gt;I spray it on mildly and so I have not recv&#x27;d alot of verbal comopliments  unless&lt;br /&gt;a lady friend is hugging me she might express that I smell nice. And that is more&lt;br /&gt;what I was looking for versus a trail of odor following me when I pass by. The&lt;br /&gt;spray bottle is very small but at 3.4oz is what one should expect. The price point&lt;br /&gt;was about average, you won&#x27;t find this bottle half price anywhere. If you do, let&lt;br /&gt;me know (haha)! Scent wise it is just a warm wood/floral smooth fragrance and it&lt;br /&gt;stays with you in a subtle way. At the end of my day changing out of my clothes&lt;br /&gt;can still slightly smell the scent on my clothes.  Good scent from Chanel for me.&lt;br /&gt;Works for me, highly recommend. After placing order arrived in 5 days.</li>
            <li> My daughter works for Chanel in the U.S. and a 3.4 oz. bottle retails for $84.00. Also if the scent is wearing off after 5 minutes the seller must be watering it down. Do not buy this.</li>
            <li> was looking for a new cologne for my hubby.  wanted a light and appealing scent. chanel de bleu is flattering to his body chemistry. the old man is SEXY!</li>
            <li> I was just asked by my wife to get this perfume for her, she used a small tester for some time and liked it very much. We were floored to find out this is a mens perfume lol</li>
            <li> Great Product.  Been wanting this cologne for awhile now.  Found it at a great price here.  And delivery time was fast.  The Ladies complement me all the time on how good it smells.  Highly recommend this cologne.</li>
            <li> What an awesome cologne. I got a great deal and spent 30% less although those guys took a month to send it to me from some far off European company. Anyway, forget my shipping experience, this cologne is a delight. When I take my work tshirt off and put on my casual tshirt from the morning to go back home, I am always in love with the fragrance. It is so engaging, a little bit too powerful and dreamy too. Chanel is really the boss when it comes to colognes. I had Allure Homme for three years but this is my new favourite. The bottle is nice and cold to hold and sort of completes the mood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this for two days a week usage and not every day usage. On other days wear other colognes but this is my new favourite alongside Armani Code, Aqua, Fierce and even Pulse Axe deo spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strongly recommended this beautiful and wild fragrance.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this spray.  My wife loves it and I get compliments every time I wear it.  Has a nice clean crisp smell.</li>
            <li> This a great buy at a great value! This is definitely going to be my new favorite cologne! Will be back for more!</li>
            <li> i am disappointed, becouse quality of this product is poor. it&#x27;s smell is not similar to the original and so i think that this product is very poor quality</li>
            <li> I ordered this after testing the scent in person at a local store. The bottle received was old or seemed to have been watered down.  No matter how much of it was sprayed, after 1-2 minutes, you could not spell the fragrance at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon&#x27;s customer server however, was terrific and greatly appreciated on helping to resolved this problem!</li>
            <li> This scent is awesome and I love it. I usually wear CK1 in the day time but the Bleu Chanel colongne with the Bleu aftershave splash lotion is super great for the evening wear or club or lounges the women go crazy over it. Simply Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Will buy for a veeeeery long time for sure. Try it out if you dont believe me because im picky when it comes to scents but I promise you will not be disapointed!!!</li>
            <li> The description of the smell on the website was right on the money. Love this cologne. Item also arrived earlier than I expected.</li>
            <li> So I purchased this yesterday from a local department store. I originally had gone in with the intention of picking up the Versace por Homme that has great reviews here on Amazon, but after smelling it in person I wasn&#x27;t all that impressed. I guess it&#x27;s tough to buy a scent completely on the opinions of other people considering that it is completely subjective. Also everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different so as always YMMV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While browsing the counter I approached a cute customer who was nearby and asked her if she had any opinions on men&#x27;s cologne and she launched into telling me how obsessed she was with the Bleu de Chanel scent (even comparing it with a lot of other fragrances, this girl knew her stuff!). Smelling it on the little paper strip I was FAR from impressed, but after applying it to my wrists it actually smells much better on the skin and gets even better after an hour or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give it a try that night for a date and afterwards a dinner party with some friends. Both my date and girls at the party had made remarks about how great I smelled, can&#x27;t ask for more than that! This was actually my first time wearing cologne in several years and the first time I&#x27;ve gotten unsolicited comments about how good I smell, wearing this 1 night has me sold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the department store I went to they had a gift set with both a 3.4oz bottle and a 0.7oz travel spray + refill, it looks like this is also available on the Chanel website. I found it to be a good value, especially if you can take advantage of in-store discounts. Happy hunting!</li>
            <li> Es un excelente producto, lo recomiendo mucho y es exactamente como lo descrito por el vendedor, tambien el empaque fue adecuado y llegó en buenas condiciones, sin daños ni problemas</li>
            <li> so, i bought this cologne, the day it came out. i bought a 3.4oz bottle, for $100 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;i do see where some of these retailers r trying to get off on pricing it very high, but ive&lt;br /&gt;had my bottle going onto my second yr now.. it was powerful then, it is still powerful now..&lt;br /&gt;spend the extra bucks on gas and time on looking ok to go to the mall to buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;its worth knowing youre getting your moneys worth and aunthenticity!! make sure the bottle&lt;br /&gt;cape snaps back at u!!! u kno if Bleu talks to u, its the real deal!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;other favs, D&amp;G Light Blue,Burberry Touch and Brit, Gucci Homme and Versace. lesser priced but still great scent and quality,Curve (green bottle) Ed Hardy (blue bottle) CK Be (black bottle) and of course BOD MOST WANTED!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bod Most Wanted is my everday body mist/shower in spray/scent. i have never EVER gotten so much&lt;br /&gt;attention than when i wear MOST WANTED,and they all men and women ask me what it is.. its smells&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;expensive\\&quot; NOPE, only 7 bucks a big bottle for the month.. and u save up on not using the good stuff! :p</li>
            <li> Bought this from Wholesale123 and found upon arrival that it was counterfeit. I have had this issue before with ebay, and have found the only sure way to get a authentic item is to buy from chanel.com</li>
            <li> This is now my every day fragrance.  It works perfectly for days out on the boat, working in the office, grabbing lunch at a local cafe&#x27;, or grocery shopping.  I used to wear Aqua di Gio as my every day fragrance, and more recently shifted to Wood DSquared. If you generally prefer masculine floral scents then this fragrance is perfect for you. The secondary notes to the fragrance are amazing so even the lingering after-smell is amazing.  I definitely recommend this one for every day use - no need to over do it.</li>
            <li> I can appreciate the subtleness of any fragrance, but Bleu de Chanel has to be the weakest eau de toilette I have ever tried in my life in terms of lasting power. Maybe I got a watered down bottle. The scent itself is so elegant and refined, that I sometimes spray my pillows with it at night to dream to this scent. In the morning, however, it is always gone. I only wish it were stronger.</li>
            <li> The perfume spray work fine the first week after them the spray was damage, I need to know what i need to do to repair the product or change urgent, please let me know same via or send me an e-mail to mas_j@bellsouth.net, please this review need an Urgent attention. I try to contact the distribuitor and was impossible.</li>
            <li> The smelling of this product is fantastic. People always ask me what kind of fragrance it is?&lt;br /&gt;Only BLUE CHANEL i always reply and smile. thanks for the inventer of the product. Will never stop using it.</li>
            <li> I watched a YouTube clip for this cologne and this guy goes off telling the viewers that this is the greatest cologne ever.  So, I was persuaded and decided to try it for myself.  All I can say is that this cologne is completely OVERRATED and the smell is not that great.  I will probably never wear this cologne ever again - but I will just keep it for collection sake...but no, I don&#x27;t recommend this cologne at all.  If you want a good cologne, try Calvin Klein Eternity or Davidoff Cool Water.  Now, those two colognes are worth the $$.</li>
            <li> Here are my 3 P&#x27;s....Bleu De Chanel is hands down my favorite cologne EVER! A very cool, pleasant, passionate linguring scent that is........(shaking my head, without a more descriptive term to associate with this product) I have bought 6 bottles within the last 3 years. I know right! YOU CANNOT GO WRONG purchasing this product, however I would not purchase it from Amazon for $105-$111.00 for a 3.4oz bottle when I can buy it from the department store for $115.00 and have the 5oz bottle. OMG, this cologne will be complimented on until you are sick of compliments. But it, buy, buy it, buy it.</li>
            <li> This product is very great and smells wonderful and has helped me if I got to any special occasion. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> This product is a fake. The emblem on the cap is off center. The cap broke when I took it off the bottle. The label on the bottle isn&#x27;t even printed on. It&#x27;s a cheap sticker that peels right off.</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s old or expired or watered down, but compared to my other Bleu De Chanel (Chanel bought cologne) it smells different, doesn&#x27;t last at all, and was a complete waste of money. I don&#x27;t blame the seller.</li>
            <li> I just got this today at the mall, mainly because the lady working there recommended it-I even took that little card they spray the cologne on to ask someone else&#x27;s opinion(a younger girl)-she liked it a lot too-The main reason I&#x27;m writing this is b/c I started to feel like I was getting a headache+stuffy nose within 2 hours of putting it on(2 full sprays of Bleu)---I could do 2 full sprays with aqua di gio with no problem, but not this stuff-I read someone else&#x27;s review saying kinda the same thing-I&#x27;m glad he wrote that b/c I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was the only person that felt sick from using too much- I&#x27;m gonna try 1 small spray tomorrow+see if I feel crappy again-I&#x27;ll try to add on to this review tomorrow to say if 1 small spray made me sick also-I really like the smell, so I hope it doesn&#x27;t-</li>
            <li> Got here to Afghanistan within a week and a half and smelt amazing!!!!  Would recommend to anyone that wants a new smell for men!</li>
            <li> The scent of this perfume is absolutely fantastic! It was recommended for a friend and women say its also afrodisiac. ;-)</li>
            <li> my husband loves this cologne. it is not too strong but is still manly smelling. he gets lots of compliments</li>
            <li> There must be something in this cologne that appeals a great deal to women.  Personally I think it smells good, but it seems like most women think it smells fantastic.  I bought it because I saw the commercials and then I found a sample in a magazine.  The sample smelled good enough, so I decided to try it.  Compared to my CK Eternity, I still prefer my CK as a matter of personal choice.  But I have to say that if you want to make a good impression with a lady, drop the CK Eternity and go for this Bleu De Chanel.  They seem to absolutely love it, and it does smell good enough to wear.</li>
            <li> COUNTERFEIT COLOGNE!!! BUYERS BEWARE!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchased this item, noticed that the BLEU DE CHANEL on the bottle was not evenly printed. Upon further inspection, I noticed the bottle&#x27;s finishing weren&#x27;t smooth either and the scent was similar but not the same.I took it to Bloomingdales and compared with an authentic one and found even more flaws. Bottle caps isn&#x27;t magnetic like authentic one, box was missing some other details, etc..&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Chanel and they said: &amp;#34;Chanel can no longer provide verbal or written authentication of a product..... (due to) the explosion of sales of items purported to be Chanel and frequently counterfeit over the Internet.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contacting amazon to report this seller!!!!!</li>
            <li> its really nice!&lt;br /&gt;its mild smell,&lt;br /&gt;really good, good good good good, good good good ,,.&lt;br /&gt;try it ,,,,yup ppppp</li>
            <li> I have been able to wear this in a variety of environments including work, play, and outdoors for sport.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may not be sharp or overbearing, but it is pleasant and versatile.  I have received many compliments for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That and the fact that I am not allergic to it is a big plus!</li>
            <li> Did not smell as expected. Had smelt samples before, and this possibly could have been a bad or off bottle. Might be the reason it was a few dollars cheaper. I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> I recommend it, good treatment and commit an outrage. Rapid sending and without promblemas. product in excellent quality and without faults.</li>
            <li> I purchased Bleu for a colleague. The scent is light and manly combined with his body chemistry, he smells fantastc.</li>
