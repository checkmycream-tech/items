            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Promptly delivered and exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>These glass droppers were exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Easily breakable if not careful!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed I cannot use it on my lemon oil, because of it&#x27;s acidity, it will decay the rubber seal around the bulb -- so I highly recommend these on certain types of oils (probably not citrus varieties)  to dispense right out of the bottle!</li>
            <li>they are good quality however they don&#x27;t fit right on my small essential oil  bottles.</li>
            <li>Sometimes the oil still drips out too much for my needs, like when I want just a dab for a blemish.  </li>

            <li>They work great, I just ordered the wrong size of bottles to use them on</li>
            <li>Love the little glass droppers!</li>
            <li>These little droppers are great for the small bottles and are made well, last a long time and actually suck a full tube of liquid up with each squeeze and holds it there!</li>
            <li>They are fantastic, no more wasted drops and makes my loading capsules much easier and faster!!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them for regularly used bottles and loading veggie caps.</li>
            <li>I started using Young Living Essential Oils and to make dispensing easier</li>

            <li> love these for my essential oil bottles.  Fit doTerra bottles just fine</li>
            <li> Super helpful. They are fantastic, no more wasted drops and makes my loading capsules much easier and faster!!! I highly recommend them for regularly used bottles and loading veggie caps.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed.  Some essential oils come with a plastic drip controller in the neck of the 10 ml bottle.  Sometimes the oil still drips out too much for my needs, like when I want just a dab for a blemish.  I remove the drip controller and replace the original screw on cap with one of these glass droppers from Plant Therapy.  Perfect fit.  Perfect control  with dispensing.</li>

            <li> Exactly as described. Well packaged and arrived with no damage.</li>
            <li> These little darlings are very hard to find.  I like using the 10 ml amber bottles for storing facial serums and the droppers are ideal for distribution.</li>
            <li> They work great, I just ordered the wrong size of bottles to use them on</li>
            <li> fit doTerra bottles perdectly</li>

            <li> Perfectly happy with products and delivery</li>
            <li> I needed these . Lots of oils I ordered had no reducers or droppers. Now I can accurately measure them...</li>
            <li> Very small opening. Easily breakable if not careful!</li>
            <li> arrived quick and just what I was expecting</li>
            <li> I used these glass droppers in my essential oils, and they worked well, as long as the bottle remains upright. But if you travel with your oil bottles or knock them over, be prepared for them to leak oil all over the place.</li>
            <li> Great Price. Great quality. Fits on standard 15ml essential oils. Perfect for dropping oils into empty capsules.</li>
            <li> Will order more, great droppers :)</li>
