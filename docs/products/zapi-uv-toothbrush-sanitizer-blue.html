            <li>LOL!   </li>
            <li>Great product, works great!</li>
            <li>What a great idea.</li>
            <li>because as my brush scrapes through the opening I think \\&quot;great</li>
            <li>Great idea; inferior product.</li>
            <li>It came from a retail store, so we got a great deal on it.  </li>
            <li>but if nothing else is a good place to keep my toothbrush that seems cleaner than just sitting on the sink in a dixie cup.</li>
            <li>This sounds like a great idea, it&#x27;s a cute product, but the manufacturing quality control just isn&#x27;t there.    </li>
            <li>+ dollars to stare at a colored, lead-weighted egg that has a bright LED but non-functioning UV light, this toy is for you.    </li>
            <li>which what is the point if the light doesnt come one  to sanitze them!</li>
            <li>It is so aggravating because some times the UV light comes on after placing the brush in the unit and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li>So glad I bought it - one of my favorite things.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for our teenage daughter, I have recommended this product to my friends and family.</li>
            <li>The opening for the toothbrush won&#x27;t easily accept wider head brushes.</li>
            <li>This would be fine if Violight sold replacement lights.  </li>
            <li>I work on computers, I could replace the UV light even though there are some fine wires.  </li>
            <li>It&lt;br /&gt;Appears to be cheaply made</li>
            <li>I bought one and the UV light doesn&#x27;t function.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes the light comes on, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>but the light still will not come on.  </li>
            <li>, I take a q-tip to clean around the light, etc.  and submerge what I can in bleachy water.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited about this item.</li>
            <li>I liked the way it looked and was excited to be able to use my travel sanitizer, which happens to be a different model, just for travel.  </li>
            <li>a place to hold the toothbrush plus keeping it clean.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not even sure that the UV light is real.</li>
            <li>With the egg shaped one, there is no way to get inside and clean.</li>
            <li>I also would prefer a flat-bottom unit that does not rock around on the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good concept, especially for germ-a-phobes like me, but I think the design needs some work.</li>
            <li>My biggest dissappointment in this product is how quickly the batteries die and have to be replaced.</li>
            <li>And it went through a set of batteries too quickly.</li>

            <li>This product has not worked consistently.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it actually \\&quot;sanitizes anything, but I know for sure it EATS BATTERIES</li>
            <li>Pretty colors though.</li>
            <li>This rocks, yes you do have to clean it frequently and take it apart.  </li>
            <li>Just buy a cover for your toothbrush, that&#x27;ll work fine, be much cheaper, and last longer.</li>
            <li>I found that a pain but wants mastered tolerable.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have the battery problem the others did, but I did experience the light not working properly almost every time.  </li>
            <li>The unit is cheaply made chinese junk</li>
            <li>I started out with the travel case, which does not use nearly as much battery life.</li>
            <li>Still leaks water into the unit and makes for build up of moisture and subsequently mold/mildew if you don&#x27;t take it apart frequently to clean it.</li>
            <li>The light, and pretty much any other access point that water can get through</li>
            <li>and they had to send us new ones; because they dont always like to work!</li>
            <li>ALIVE!!</li>
            <li>For the money this costs it should have a life span of more than a few weeks.</li>
            <li>I like my Zapi, its cute and green.</li>
            <li>New batteries did not&lt;br /&gt;help</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how this happens since it doesn&#x27;t work most of the time.   </li>
            <li>I had bronchitis last year for the first time.  </li>
            <li>Light bulb on it broke in less than 3 months of me owning it</li>
            <li>The idea of this is fantastic; but we have had ours for just a little over a year</li>
            <li>and again the new ones we got are only about 3 months old and from day one they were figidiety;</li>
            <li>well except for the little blue light on the front.</li>
            <li>and before that the thing ate through batteries like no other.</li>
            <li>So as many other people have mentioned, this thing just sucks the life out of batteries.</li>

            <li> Not worth what is being charged for this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth a star.</li>
            <li> Totally not worth it.</li>
            <li> The Zapi worked well for two weeks and then shut down.</li>
            <li> What an extreme waste of money.</li>
            <li> I am going to take my Phillips expensive toothbrush back, because I prefer manual toothbrushes instead and can actually count two minutes without an on/off switch.  </li>
            <li> My two Zapi&#x27;s quit working in less than a year.  </li>
            <li> The piece of rubber that grasps the brush seems to stretch out and not hold the brush tight.</li>
            <li> * Wastes batteries.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the Zapi.  </li>
            <li> Looks like the UV lamp is missing.  </li>
            <li> dont waste your $ or incur the purchase return/hassle</li>
            <li> NOT TRUE!</li>
            <li> I would say that with the egg shaped unit I have to recharge at least once a month, if not more.</li>
            <li> Of course you will be frustrated if you are not using rechargeable and are spending lots of money on new batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Excess water MUST be shaken from the tooth brush and the drip tray MUST be cleaned at least once a week.</li>
            <li> If it  is dirty it won&#x27;t work simple as that</li>
            <li> Just have common sense and wash your tooth brush with soap and water after every use.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this product doesn&#x27;t even deserve 1 star.</li>
            <li> What a poor execution of an idea.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 2 of these and both have failed within weeks of purchase.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sad to say that we won&#x27;t be buying another.  </li>
            <li> The product is terrible for electric toothbrushes too; because if you look at it; its and egg; not too heavy; you put a eletric toothbrush in there and it tips over 95% of the time!</li>
            <li> Bad drainage.</li>
            <li> PATHETICALLY BAD PRODUCT!  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Horrible design</li>
            <li> Terrible idea; it says would work with all toothbrushes!</li>
            <li> They are a terrible company and you are throwing your money away to buy anything from them!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> The Zapi worked well for two weeks and then shut down. New batteries did not&lt;br /&gt;help; letting in dry out for a week did not help; shaking did not help.  It&lt;br /&gt;Appears to be cheaply made, I do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> What a great idea. What a poor execution of an idea. Who was in charge of product development? I would recommend they actually should have tried to use the device before they put it on the market. Zero stars.     Key points:   * Wastes batteries. I&#x27;m not sure how this happens since it doesn&#x27;t work most of the time.   * The light, and pretty much any other access point that water can get through, it will and does. Which makes the actual usage intermitent. I found that if you let it dry out for a few days it will usually dry enough for it to work again. Shaking helps - sometimes. But, isn&#x27;t the point to be using it every time you use your toothbrush? Critics may say, \\&quot;shake the toothbrush off before you put it away\\&quot;. Been there. Done that. As carefull as I am, water leaks in, accumulates and compromises the usability.   * For the money this costs it should have a life span of more than a few weeks. A disclaimer should be included as to how long the unit will actually operate in regular use. This unit is virtually disposable given it&#x27;s life span.     I recieved Violight as a gift some time after the one I purchased gave out - which lasted about 5 weeks. The new one was no better and lasted about 6 weeks. I also recieved the Zapi UV Toothbrush Sanitizer, also by Violight, as a gift; it lasted about 4 weeks. They didn&#x27;t learn anything from the failures of the first effort. Still leaks water into the unit and makes for build up of moisture and subsequently mold/mildew if you don&#x27;t take it apart frequently to clean it. The opening for the toothbrush won&#x27;t easily accept wider head brushes. Horrible design because as my brush scrapes through the opening I think \\&quot;great it&#x27;s going to be cleaned off... but what about when I pull it back through?\\&quot;...     Final review - Violight, go back to the drawing board. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the Zapi.  I bought one and the UV light doesn&#x27;t function.  This would be fine if Violight sold replacement lights.  I work on computers, I could replace the UV light even though there are some fine wires.  But no, I don&#x27;t even have that option.  I am calling tomorrow, but since I never registered for the warranty, I am not hopeful.  This sounds like a great idea, it&#x27;s a cute product, but the manufacturing quality control just isn&#x27;t there.    If you want to blow $20+ dollars to stare at a colored, lead-weighted egg that has a bright LED but non-functioning UV light, this toy is for you.    Otherwise, pass on by.    Violight:  Are you reading these reviews?  When are you going to get your manufacturing act together?  When are you going to offer an easier way to get a replacement bulb on your other units?    Eric</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this item. a place to hold the toothbrush plus keeping it clean.  After a couple weeks I noticed there was mildew growing at the bottom form all the water.  Bad drainage. This is actually less sanitary then just keeping it out in the open air.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have only used the Zapi 2 times and it broke! The light doesn&#x27;t go on and of course original pkging gone at this point - really disappointed!</li>
            <li> The idea of this is fantastic; but we have had ours for just a little over a year and they had to send us new ones; because they dont always like to work! which what is the point if the light doesnt come one  to sanitze them! and again the new ones we got are only about 3 months old and from day one they were figidiety; if thats a word! LOL!   The product is terrible for electric toothbrushes too; because if you look at it; its and egg; not too heavy; you put a eletric toothbrush in there and it tips over 95% of the time! Terrible idea; it says would work with all toothbrushes! NOT TRUE! my suggestion find something else to sanitze your toothbrush and save your 25 bucks!</li>
            <li> My biggest dissappointment in this product is how quickly the batteries die and have to be replaced. The sanitizer itself does work well when used properly. Excess water MUST be shaken from the tooth brush and the drip tray MUST be cleaned at least once a week. I have not seen any mold on my sanitizer but then again I have been following the recommended maintenance.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work.  Looks like the UV lamp is missing.  Plan to return it.</li>
            <li> This worked well, I guess. But it stopped working after about two weeks. Have not opened the second one I bought.</li>
            <li> Stopped working before very long.</li>
            <li> This product has not worked consistently.  Sometimes the light comes on, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t. And it went through a set of batteries too quickly.</li>
            <li> I had bronchitis last year for the first time.  Now I am running scared that it will get me again this year so I purchased the Zapi to sanitize my toothbrush.  It is so aggravating because some times the UV light comes on after placing the brush in the unit and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t! I waste so much time positioning and repositioning the darn brush.  I push it back into the \\&quot;holding slot\\&quot; but the light still will not come on.  I like the idea 100% of killing the germs but the product needs some work!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for the holidays. I liked the way it looked and was excited to be able to use my travel sanitizer, which happens to be a different model, just for travel.  This product is easy to clean but it drains batteries amazingly fast. If I don&#x27;t take the batteries out every morning and evening I change them almost every week.   If not for that, and my lack of investment in battery companies, I would like this product.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these as gifts; they each worked ONE time!  I replaced the batteries and still they did not work. What an extreme waste of money. Great idea; inferior product.</li>
            <li> This product never worked...well except for the little blue light on the front. The lightbulb never came on. Luckily, it was easy to send the product back and get a full refund. Not worth what is being charged for this product.</li>
            <li> I like my Zapi, its cute and green. I guess you never know if it is cleaning all the germs but if nothing else is a good place to keep my toothbrush that seems cleaner than just sitting on the sink in a dixie cup.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 2 of these and both have failed within weeks of purchase. dont waste your $ or incur the purchase return/hassle</li>
            <li> Gets the job done, it burns batteries fast but their not that expensive and a bit of a problem cleaning it as you need a knife or something sharp to pop the bottom of the ball out so you can slip the area the brush sits in out for cleaning. I found that a pain but wants mastered tolerable.</li>
            <li> we got our zapi last year at Christmas and it has finally given up.  I agree with all the other reviews, it is junk.  I didn&#x27;t have the battery problem the others did, but I did experience the light not working properly almost every time.  It came from a retail store, so we got a great deal on it.  I got online to replace it, but finding that it is the product and not where it came from tells me that this is not the product for ANYONE!!!  It falls over all of the time and I&#x27;m sad to say that we won&#x27;t be buying another.  It&#x27;s not worth a star.</li>
            <li> I am going to take my Phillips expensive toothbrush back, because I prefer manual toothbrushes instead and can actually count two minutes without an on/off switch.  This rocks, yes you do have to clean it frequently and take it apart.  If it  is dirty it won&#x27;t work simple as that, I take a q-tip to clean around the light, etc.  and submerge what I can in bleachy water.  So glad I bought it - one of my favorite things.</li>
            <li> Purchased a Zapi toothbrush sanitizer as a Christmas gift for my wife. She likes it  because of the pretty color and pretty light on the front. I don&#x27;t know if it actually \\&quot;sanitizes anything, but I know for sure it EATS BATTERIES ALIVE!! I put in three AAA batteries a month. And that is using the unit twice a day. I would advise rechargeable batteries for this product. Pretty colors though.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this product doesn&#x27;t even deserve 1 star. The unit is cheaply made chinese junk and I&#x27;m not even sure that the UV light is real. Everything the previous negative reviews mentioned is true. Stay away!</li>
            <li> This is perfect for our teenage daughter, I have recommended this product to my friends and family. Great product, works great!</li>
            <li> PATHETICALLY BAD PRODUCT!  The customer service dept. virtually sneers at you if you call.  They are a terrible company and you are throwing your money away to buy anything from them!  Heed my warning and avoid them like the plague!</li>
            <li> Just have common sense and wash your tooth brush with soap and water after every use.</li>
            <li> So as many other people have mentioned, this thing just sucks the life out of batteries. I started out with the travel case, which does not use nearly as much battery life. I would say that with the egg shaped unit I have to recharge at least once a month, if not more. Of course you will be frustrated if you are not using rechargeable and are spending lots of money on new batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually prefer the travel unit. With the egg shaped one, there is no way to get inside and clean. The piece of rubber that grasps the brush seems to stretch out and not hold the brush tight. I also would prefer a flat-bottom unit that does not rock around on the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good concept, especially for germ-a-phobes like me, but I think the design needs some work. I recommend the travel unit over this one.</li>
            <li> My two Zapi&#x27;s quit working in less than a year.  I think the bulb burns out with no way to replace it.</li>
            <li> This one is for my husband, and he is actually using the product.</li>
            <li> Bought this through a groupon deal a while back. Light bulb on it broke in less than 3 months of me owning it and before that the thing ate through batteries like no other. Totally not worth it. Just buy a cover for your toothbrush, that&#x27;ll work fine, be much cheaper, and last longer.</li>
