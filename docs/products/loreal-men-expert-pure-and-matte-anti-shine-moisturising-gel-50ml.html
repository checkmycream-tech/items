            <li>This is the best product I&#x27;ve found for it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s simply awesome..  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t work in a very ideal environment so that&#x27;s telling.</li>
            <li>Because there is no sunscreen in it, it&#x27;s probably best used for going out in the evening.</li>
            <li>A great product.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>and they work great together if you have oily skin</li>
            <li>Good moisturizer with a great guy smell and a good matte look.</li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really good on skin</li>
            <li>Compared to high end products like Shieldo anti shine, which is the best product every but has been discontinued,  I&#x27;d say it gets lower than a three...</li>
            <li>however its cheap and smells nice</li>
            <li>but I love the stuff.</li>
            <li>I now combine these steps with another L&#x27;Oreal product: Revitalift Miracle Blur, as man who once used make up (I am not afraid to admit it), these 3 steps have help me greatly to eliminate the shine on my face and keep a smooth complexion with out the help of make up.</li>
            <li>My head was so much more Matte for a guy not named Matt</li>
            <li>Smells clean and has a refreshing feeling.</li>
            <li>Does seem to hydrate well and does make your skin smell quite good, but my main reason for purchasing this was for the matte anti-shine claim........</li>
            <li>Works great but only lasts a couple hours for me.</li>
            <li>I wish this was available for sale in stores in the U.S.</li>
            <li>Really works and has a nice cooling feel when applied.</li>
            <li>It works very nicely to keep the shine down and it has a really nice clean smell to it.</li>
            <li>It is light and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>The only thing not to like is the price for the size tube you get, but it is a good product and it&#x27;s worth paying up for it.</li>
            <li>(is this the right word for it?)</li>
            <li>I use the same exfoliate (pure &amp; matte), then I apply this moisturizer and it keeps me shine free for most of the day.</li>
            <li>My bald head can be, well, glaringly apparent most times...  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it does exactly what it says it does.  </li>
            <li>smells good (not strong at all) and keeps your face fresh and matte pretty much a whole day.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>is one drawback to this very convenient (and macho) style.</li>
            <li>Leaves as good a matte finish on my shaved head as any other stuff but limited availability.</li>
            <li>It does a decent job of managing oil and shine throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I was looking for this particular moisturizer for some time now, I live in Mexico and L&#x27;Oreal stopped carrying this product</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find this in the stores where I live</li>
            <li>Had to order on Amazon because U.S. stores don&#x27;t carry it anymore, I was very surprised though that my order came within a week considering it was shipped from the U.K.</li>
            <li>I have naturally oily skin.</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy this product until I find something else to stop the shine completely.</li>
            <li>This product applies well as an almost clear gel, absorbs well into the skin and leaves no mess.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these products and will definitely reorder when I run out.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin, and this lotion does not dry.</li>

            <li> Wish it came in a larger size doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> I believe shine comes from 2 conditions, skin that is too dry or too oily.  </li>
            <li> Unlike some other products, you don&#x27;t feel there is a layer of cake</li>
            <li> I just need a dab everyday so it&#x27;ll go a long way.</li>

            <li> About 2 years ago, I buzzed my hair down to 1/16&amp;#34; - 1/4&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I use it on my head and it keeps my skin moisturized and the shine down!</li>
            <li> Waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> The tubes are small</li>
            <li> Too bad L&#x27;oreal has discontinued this product. :-(</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I use it on my head and it keeps my skin moisturized and the shine down! I would purchase this product again!</li>
            <li> Came upon this product when I went to visit China and was amazed by how well it actually works: smells good (not strong at all) and keeps your face fresh and matte pretty much a whole day. Had to order on Amazon because U.S. stores don&#x27;t carry it anymore, I was very surprised though that my order came within a week considering it was shipped from the U.K.</li>
            <li> Good product but does not last the entire work day.</li>
            <li> I would order this again . It&#x27;s really good on skin but it isn&#x27;t that big . Otherwise 5 stars .</li>
            <li> I shave my head so I bought this to cut down the shine.  I think it actually made my head shinier.  Used it once, and probably won&#x27;t use it again.  Waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it does exactly what it says it does.  Compared to high end products like Shieldo anti shine, which is the best product every but has been discontinued,  I&#x27;d say it gets lower than a three...however its cheap and smells nice</li>
            <li> I am a male with shiny forehead and have tried several products on my forehead and nose areas. The only product that worked well was by Claron&#x27;s Mens Products, but this has been discontinued, so I have been trying others. This product applies well as an almost clear gel, absorbs well into the skin and leaves no mess. However, after several hours the shine starts to come back, so will not use again.</li>
            <li> Does seem to hydrate well and does make your skin smell quite good, but my main reason for purchasing this was for the matte anti-shine claim........ which did NOT work.</li>
            <li> It reduces the &#x27;shine&#x27; if you have an oily skin. It is light and absorbs quickly. Unlike some other products, you don&#x27;t feel there is a layer of cake (is this the right word for it?) on your face. Of course, like any skin product it may or may not match your skin type.</li>
            <li> Works great but only lasts a couple hours for me. Buy a $h17load of it.  The tubes are small but I love the stuff.</li>
            <li> I have naturally oily skin. This is the best product I&#x27;ve found for it. Too bad L&#x27;oreal has discontinued this product. :-(</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It works very nicely to keep the shine down and it has a really nice clean smell to it. The only thing not to like is the price for the size tube you get, but it is a good product and it&#x27;s worth paying up for it.</li>
            <li> A great product. Moisturizes your face after a shower, but also prevents your face from getting greasy as the day goes on.</li>
            <li> Keeps the shine away. Great product.</li>
            <li> Leaves as good a matte finish on my shaved head as any other stuff but limited availability.</li>
            <li> I wish this was available for sale in stores in the U.S. They used to carry something similar but took it off the shelves. It does a decent job of managing oil and shine throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I was looking for this particular moisturizer for some time now, I live in Mexico and L&#x27;Oreal stopped carrying this product and I just had to have it again. It leaves a matte finish on my skin, since I have an oily face this helps me a lot. I use the same exfoliate (pure &amp; matte), then I apply this moisturizer and it keeps me shine free for most of the day. I now combine these steps with another L&#x27;Oreal product: Revitalift Miracle Blur, as man who once used make up (I am not afraid to admit it), these 3 steps have help me greatly to eliminate the shine on my face and keep a smooth complexion with out the help of make up. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find this in the stores where I live so I had to order it through Amazon. Good moisturizer with a great guy smell and a good matte look. I just need a dab everyday so it&#x27;ll go a long way. Bought some of the Loreal charcoal face wash also and they work great together if you have oily skin like I do. I highly recommend these products and will definitely reorder when I run out.</li>
            <li> This product works not at all for me.  I believe shine comes from 2 conditions, skin that is too dry or too oily.  I have oily skin, and this lotion does not dry.</li>
            <li> This is it!!  My bald head can be, well, glaringly apparent most times...  I wasn&#x27;t going to go the makeup route, found this and it&#x27;s simply awesome..  knocked the shine off my coconut and lasts all day..  and I don&#x27;t work in a very ideal environment so that&#x27;s telling.</li>
            <li> About 2 years ago, I buzzed my hair down to 1/16&amp;#34; - 1/4&amp;#34;. Scalp shine as the day wears on is one drawback to this very convenient (and macho) style. This is the only product I&#x27;ve tried (out of 4 or 5) that actually results in a matte finish. Because there is no sunscreen in it, it&#x27;s probably best used for going out in the evening. Really works and has a nice cooling feel when applied.</li>
            <li> It helps reduce the shine a little which was my main concern. Smells clean and has a refreshing feeling.I will continue to buy this product until I find something else to stop the shine completely.</li>
            <li> My head was so much more Matte for a guy not named Matt</li>
            <li> Have used this product in the past but my local store stopped carrying it.,ordered online. Wish it came in a larger size doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
