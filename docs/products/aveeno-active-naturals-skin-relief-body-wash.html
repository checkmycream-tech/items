            <li>If your skin is sensitive, this is product for you.</li>
            <li>Aveeno is one of my fav brands for face or skin and having it for sensitive skin helps me out</li>
            <li>This product is difficult to find and I love it!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> LOVE this body wash. Especially in winter. Skin doesn&#x27;t flake or dry out,</li>
            <li> I am allergic to fragrances, so I got this because it is fragrance free.  However, I still had an allergic reaction to it, and it smells bad to boot.  I would definitely not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, and just recently broke up due to trying a new shampoo, and I&#x27;ve been miserable for about a week, I finally broke down and bought something, after being told Aveeno would help. It seems to be helping with my rash and it really makes me skin soft, the only complaint I have is it smells a little funny. But still well worth the price.</li>
            <li> We have used Aveeno Active Naturals Skin Relief body wash for a couple of years now and we love it.</li>
            <li> This is the only body wash we use in this house.  All four females LOVE IT!  It is great on even the most sensitive skin among us.  It is gentle but leaves us feeling clean and our skin is so soft.  I wouldn&#x27;t even want to try anything else.  As far as the scent, well, there really isn&#x27;t a scent in this product.  The other varieties from Aveeno (with fragrance) I have not liked.  So I use this one and then after I shower I use Bath and Body Works Cucumber Melon lotion for a nice light scent on the skin.  I really don&#x27;t think you can find anything better, whether you have sensitive skin or not.</li>
            <li> My daughter has eczema and I thought I had to buy expensive body wash including this one.  But I could&#x27;nt keep up so I decided to start buying dove soap I use both the sensitive and the winter care bars and found them cheaper than  buying this body wash, and I think the dove bars are just as effective.</li>
            <li> This product is difficult to find and I love it! I have multiple environmental allergies and this was recommended by my allergist. I have NO itching when I consistently use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Aveeno body washes for years.  This one is my favorite. It has a fresh clean scent.</li>
            <li> Sensitivity to all perfumes and products that contain them is a constant problem for myself and other members of my family. Ecxema is also an issue. This body wash is perfect. It is truly unscented with a subtle soap smell when using it that disappears afterward. It lathers and cleans well so I do not need to use a lot. It soothes the skin and has a hydrating effect without being oily or greasy. It is the only body wash two of my grandchildren (both todlers) can use that does not aggravate their excema and we have tried Dove and other soaps. Three bottles for this price saved me some money. It arrived as expected, on time and was well packaged.</li>
            <li> great for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Products were as described and were exactly what we wanted.  They were also delivered in a timely  manner.</li>
            <li> If your skin is sensitive, this is product for you. It&#x27;s fragrance free and very gentle. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> My son is in long tearm caere and this helps with his scally skin.</li>
            <li> Aveeno is one of my fav brands for face or skin and having it for sensitive skin helps me out</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this is great for my condition.  It actually lathers, unlike others I have tried.  My skin feels very soft and seems to be less dry.</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected and works great.</li>
            <li> I hate using lotions.  They make me feel clammy and sweaty to be honest so I loathe to have it on my skin.  I have tried all kinds of body washes to help with my skin being so dry and this product is the best I have found.  It&#x27;s Expensive and I wish there was something better that did as good a job as this does but there just isn&#x27;t one that I know of.</li>
            <li> Great stuff for the skin when your showering,cleans well!</li>
            <li> This product met all my needs for a fragrance-free body wash.  It will be the product I use from now on..</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Came in quickly and was as advertised</li>
            <li> Great for fragrance free healthy washing.</li>
