            <li>My under eyes feel refreshed and look so much better.</li>

            <li>I have used this and can see them softening right after use!!</li>
            <li>Right before He!!</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy, cool and refreshing.</li>
            <li>I can say that it is the best product to reduce dark spots and circles under the eye and you no need to worry about side effects,no side effects with this product</li>
            <li>Use this hydrating eye gel to give thirsty eyes a cool, refreshing drink.</li>
            <li>I have bags and fine wrinkles as well as the start of that looseness in the eyelid skin that comes with age.</li>
            <li>When I use this eye gel (in the morning and at night), I can tell a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>After one week of use I noticed a huge difference in the color of his circles, and the depth.</li>
            <li>* free sample provided</li>
            <li>and so my eyeliner glides on smoothly.</li>
            <li>This whole product line has been amazing to me.  </li>
            <li>This product goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin oily at all.  </li>
            <li>This product was obtained for free in exchange for my review.</li>
            <li>is a fantastic product</li>
            <li>But so far so good.</li>
            <li>I use it on my clean face at night before I go to bed and look great the next morning.  </li>
            <li>Rich in hyaluronic acid and collagen, this product is better than higher end &amp;#34;sensitive natural&amp;#34; products.</li>
            <li>It feels cool when I put it on, and it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>After a week, I noticed a significant change in his eyes.</li>
            <li>I originally received it as a promotional gift with purchase.</li>
            <li>I have &amp;#34;fat padding&amp;#34; under my eyes (many people do) and according to more than one M.D., no cream or gel is going to completely get rid of my undereye puffiness.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be purchasing a full size of this, loving it!</li>
            <li>Goes on super smoothly with a neutral scent.</li>
            <li>Only been using it for about 2 months, but I&#x27;m very happy thus far.</li>
            <li>I cannot help falling in love with the silky and velvet touch around my eyes after applying this light weight but very moisture gel texture eye product.</li>
            <li>the ingredients are natural and safe!</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference right away!</li>
            <li>Full of hyaluronic acid which is the star of the product .</li>
            <li>True story.</li>
            <li>This eye gel is light weight, absorbs quickly, and REALLY works!</li>
            <li>It is my new favorite eye serum.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li>After trying several more natural options that didn&#x27;t do much for me, I was so thrilled to find this one!</li>
            <li>I think, and the price is fair for high end eye treatments in general.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight and very soothing to the eyes.</li>
            <li>I have only used this eye gel for a week and it is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This is a gentle, lightly moisturizing eye gel..</li>
            <li>Skingenixx anti aging eye gel really works and diminishes puffiness of my &amp;#34;morning eyes&amp;#34; - my foundation goes on smoothly and my eye makeup does not rub off under my eyes.</li>
            <li>Most of them, even all natural ones irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t wait to invest in the full size of this because today was my first time using this,</li>
            <li>This eye gel has great ingredients in it and it doesn&#x27;t cost way too much like some other creams do.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cake and adds just the right amount of moisture.</li>
            <li>This product is definitely worth trying, it worked very well for me!</li>
            <li>Not irritating and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>How many of us battle those fine lines around the eyes along with those dark circles?  </li>
            <li>I have been purchasing a bit more makeup as I get older but, as a rule, it gets old and has to be discarded before I use it up.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I really notice a difference!</li>
            <li>I make sure to pack this as a travel essential as well</li>
            <li>It really moisturizes the skin under my eyes!</li>
            <li>This hyaluronic eye gel leaves my skin incredibly soft and smooth throughout the day, and it never causes my under-eye makeup to clump.</li>
            <li>i used this stuff for the first time</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how the company does it, but for me it really has a very real effect.</li>
            <li>This is the first eye gel I can say I really like.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for two weeks now and noticed something odd but amazing.</li>
            <li>Skingenixx anti-aging eye gel helped me with puffy morning eyes daily and over about a 2-week time frame has improved the fine lines and smoothness around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>My eyes appeared so much brighter.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>&amp; I don&#x27;t need nearly as much concealer as I used to.</li>
            <li>at the beginning I did not think much of it.</li>
            <li>This eye gel has lightened up my whole eye area</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I use it in the morning while getting ready for work.</li>
            <li>You only need a tiny amount, so it&#x27;s very cost effective.</li>
            <li>You have control over how much comes out of the bottle each time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple of months now and feel it really works on keeping my lids hydrated, which is a feat for any eye cream in AZ.</li>
            <li>My eyes have always been very puffy in the mornings.</li>
            <li>and I really saw a difference in my under eyes.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have purchased any Skingenixx product and I am completely SOLD.</li>
            <li>I also think it helps with dark circles, but nothing that I&#x27;ve found is magic in that arena.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and makes my eye area feel moisturized without being too rich or heavy.</li>
            <li>This really helps with the dryness and the collagen helps promote new skin on my eye area .</li>
            <li>This anti aging gel works however and it&#x27;s better than most expensive gels.</li>
            <li>This also helps to make me look younger and most people want to look younger.</li>
            <li>This is my second time purchasing this product and I will be back for more.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone who has signs of aging under and around the eye.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I know I have had this problem and many of us want something that will help take care of these little issues, and Skingenixct s a proven treatment that can help.  </li>
            <li>I have only been using this anti aging gel for a little while, and confess freely that I purchased it after getting a free gift that included a sample.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other products and this is really the only one that does what it says and</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to everyone and am excited to try the other products in this line.</li>
            <li>I had bought a new product.</li>
            <li>I also believe that it causes new hair growth and now I  don&#x27;t end up with a handful of hair after shampooing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many of the expensive brands and when I found out the product I used for years wasn&#x27;t cruelty free, I switched immediately.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and is so lightweight that you forgot you even put it on, except when you see the results!  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>, I needed a little help with the fine lines.</li>
            <li>This lightweight formula makes the skin around my eyes soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I use it several times a day, but I don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>I am 58 years old and showing signs of tiredness in and around my eyes, I use this product morning and evening.  </li>
            <li>and I thought the photo was an old photo of myself</li>
            <li>I got this for my guy because he has always had big issues with under-eye bags and is very wrinkled at 27.</li>
            <li>wow as a bonus</li>
            <li>I have used 100&#x27;s of different products but this is promising.</li>
            <li>Not harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li>I am in my early 30s and started using this eye gel about a month ago.</li>
            <li>Holy mackerel was I wow&#x27;d</li>
            <li>I received this gel today and thought I&#x27;d do my nightly routine a bit early to see if I noticed anything before bed.</li>
            <li>It is light and I only use a little in every application.</li>
            <li>Given my experiences, I was very surprised that this product actually does noticeably reduce my undereye puffiness!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say how much money I spent or products I returned trying to resolve these eye issues.</li>
            <li>I have young skin with very tiny wrinkles; this plumps the area up well.</li>
            <li>but it also contains natural ingredients equally as beneficial such as Aloe and Jojoba.</li>
            <li>I have been using this eye gel for over 3wks and my eye area is never dry, feels moisturized and not oily.</li>
            <li>I have been using Skingenixx Anti-Aging Eye Gel with Collagen for about a month &amp; the dark circles have really reduced</li>
            <li>even at 22 I am getting some pretty harsh wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
            <li>This is my first everyday eye product.</li>
            <li>Worth the price since a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Skingenixx Anti-Aging Eye Gel with Collagen, Hyaluronic Acid, Green Tea and Matrixyl 3000 Super Peptide Complex has worked very well for me!</li>
            <li>Having not used it for very long, I&#x27;m am surprised to see that it is making a difference in the under-eye bags.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, and it only takes a small amount to do the job!</li>
            <li>All you need is as little, if you put too much on it will burn.</li>
            <li>There is no more puffiness, fine lines and dark circles are diminished and I wake up looking refreshed.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for daily use, dark circles, puffiness, or redness.</li>

            <li> This eye gel is lovely - feels good - does not feel particularly greasy if one applies it sparingly, and makes the skin feel softer.</li>
            <li> I have used this and can see them softening right after use!!</li>
            <li> Right before He!!</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy, cool and refreshing.</li>
            <li> I can say that it is the best product to reduce dark spots and circles under the eye and you no need to worry about side effects,no side effects with this product</li>
            <li> Use this hydrating eye gel to give thirsty eyes a cool, refreshing drink.</li>
            <li> I have bags and fine wrinkles as well as the start of that looseness in the eyelid skin that comes with age.</li>
            <li> When I use this eye gel (in the morning and at night), I can tell a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> After one week of use I noticed a huge difference in the color of his circles, and the depth.</li>
            <li> * free sample provided</li>
            <li> and so my eyeliner glides on smoothly.</li>
            <li> This whole product line has been amazing to me.  </li>
            <li> This product goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin oily at all.  </li>
            <li> This product was obtained for free in exchange for my review.</li>
            <li> is a fantastic product</li>
            <li> But so far so good.</li>
            <li> I use it on my clean face at night before I go to bed and look great the next morning.  </li>
            <li> Rich in hyaluronic acid and collagen, this product is better than higher end &amp;#34;sensitive natural&amp;#34; products.</li>
            <li> It feels cool when I put it on, and it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> After a week, I noticed a significant change in his eyes.</li>
            <li> I originally received it as a promotional gift with purchase.</li>
            <li> I have &amp;#34;fat padding&amp;#34; under my eyes (many people do) and according to more than one M.D., no cream or gel is going to completely get rid of my undereye puffiness.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be purchasing a full size of this, loving it!</li>
            <li> Goes on super smoothly with a neutral scent.</li>
            <li> Only been using it for about 2 months, but I&#x27;m very happy thus far.</li>
            <li> I cannot help falling in love with the silky and velvet touch around my eyes after applying this light weight but very moisture gel texture eye product.</li>
            <li> the ingredients are natural and safe!</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference right away!</li>
            <li> Full of hyaluronic acid which is the star of the product .</li>
            <li> True story.</li>
            <li> This eye gel is light weight, absorbs quickly, and REALLY works!</li>
            <li> It is my new favorite eye serum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li> After trying several more natural options that didn&#x27;t do much for me, I was so thrilled to find this one!</li>
            <li> I think, and the price is fair for high end eye treatments in general.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight and very soothing to the eyes.</li>
            <li> I have only used this eye gel for a week and it is amazing.  </li>
            <li> This is a gentle, lightly moisturizing eye gel..</li>
            <li> Skingenixx anti aging eye gel really works and diminishes puffiness of my &amp;#34;morning eyes&amp;#34; - my foundation goes on smoothly and my eye makeup does not rub off under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Most of them, even all natural ones irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t wait to invest in the full size of this because today was my first time using this,</li>
            <li> This eye gel has great ingredients in it and it doesn&#x27;t cost way too much like some other creams do.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cake and adds just the right amount of moisture.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely worth trying, it worked very well for me!</li>
            <li> Not irritating and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> How many of us battle those fine lines around the eyes along with those dark circles?  </li>
            <li> I have been purchasing a bit more makeup as I get older but, as a rule, it gets old and has to be discarded before I use it up.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I really notice a difference!</li>
            <li> I make sure to pack this as a travel essential as well</li>
            <li> It really moisturizes the skin under my eyes!</li>
            <li> This hyaluronic eye gel leaves my skin incredibly soft and smooth throughout the day, and it never causes my under-eye makeup to clump.</li>
            <li> i used this stuff for the first time</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how the company does it, but for me it really has a very real effect.</li>
            <li> This is the first eye gel I can say I really like.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for two weeks now and noticed something odd but amazing.</li>
            <li> Skingenixx anti-aging eye gel helped me with puffy morning eyes daily and over about a 2-week time frame has improved the fine lines and smoothness around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> My eyes appeared so much brighter.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> &amp; I don&#x27;t need nearly as much concealer as I used to.</li>
            <li> at the beginning I did not think much of it.</li>
            <li> This eye gel has lightened up my whole eye area</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I use it in the morning while getting ready for work.</li>
            <li> You only need a tiny amount, so it&#x27;s very cost effective.</li>
            <li> You have control over how much comes out of the bottle each time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple of months now and feel it really works on keeping my lids hydrated, which is a feat for any eye cream in AZ.</li>
            <li> My eyes have always been very puffy in the mornings.</li>
            <li> and I really saw a difference in my under eyes.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have purchased any Skingenixx product and I am completely SOLD.</li>
            <li> I also think it helps with dark circles, but nothing that I&#x27;ve found is magic in that arena.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and makes my eye area feel moisturized without being too rich or heavy.</li>
            <li> This really helps with the dryness and the collagen helps promote new skin on my eye area .</li>
            <li> This anti aging gel works however and it&#x27;s better than most expensive gels.</li>
            <li> This also helps to make me look younger and most people want to look younger.</li>
            <li> This is my second time purchasing this product and I will be back for more.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone who has signs of aging under and around the eye.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I know I have had this problem and many of us want something that will help take care of these little issues, and Skingenixct s a proven treatment that can help.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using this anti aging gel for a little while, and confess freely that I purchased it after getting a free gift that included a sample.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other products and this is really the only one that does what it says and</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to everyone and am excited to try the other products in this line.</li>
            <li> I had bought a new product.</li>
            <li> I also believe that it causes new hair growth and now I  don&#x27;t end up with a handful of hair after shampooing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many of the expensive brands and when I found out the product I used for years wasn&#x27;t cruelty free, I switched immediately.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and is so lightweight that you forgot you even put it on, except when you see the results!  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> , I needed a little help with the fine lines.</li>
            <li> This lightweight formula makes the skin around my eyes soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I use it several times a day, but I don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> I am 58 years old and showing signs of tiredness in and around my eyes, I use this product morning and evening.  </li>
            <li> and I thought the photo was an old photo of myself</li>
            <li> I got this for my guy because he has always had big issues with under-eye bags and is very wrinkled at 27.</li>
            <li> wow as a bonus</li>
            <li> I have used 100&#x27;s of different products but this is promising.</li>
            <li> Not harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 30s and started using this eye gel about a month ago.</li>
            <li> Holy mackerel was I wow&#x27;d</li>
            <li> I received this gel today and thought I&#x27;d do my nightly routine a bit early to see if I noticed anything before bed.</li>
            <li> It is light and I only use a little in every application.</li>
            <li> Given my experiences, I was very surprised that this product actually does noticeably reduce my undereye puffiness!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how much money I spent or products I returned trying to resolve these eye issues.</li>
            <li> I have young skin with very tiny wrinkles; this plumps the area up well.</li>
            <li> but it also contains natural ingredients equally as beneficial such as Aloe and Jojoba.</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye gel for over 3wks and my eye area is never dry, feels moisturized and not oily.</li>
            <li> I have been using Skingenixx Anti-Aging Eye Gel with Collagen for about a month &amp; the dark circles have really reduced</li>
            <li> even at 22 I am getting some pretty harsh wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> This is my first everyday eye product.</li>
            <li> Worth the price since a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Skingenixx Anti-Aging Eye Gel with Collagen, Hyaluronic Acid, Green Tea and Matrixyl 3000 Super Peptide Complex has worked very well for me!</li>
            <li> Having not used it for very long, I&#x27;m am surprised to see that it is making a difference in the under-eye bags.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly, and it only takes a small amount to do the job!</li>
            <li> All you need is as little, if you put too much on it will burn.</li>
            <li> There is no more puffiness, fine lines and dark circles are diminished and I wake up looking refreshed.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for daily use, dark circles, puffiness, or redness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using eye gels that cost up to three times as much as this one, and they pale in comparison.</li>
            <li> I have always had significant puffiness and darkness, but it has been made worse by the fact that I have an infant.</li>
            <li> Only use a tiny bit as it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It attacked morning puffiness, dark circles and brightened my eye area considerably with just a sample.</li>
            <li> After using this pretty consistently at least 1x a day (at night)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sticking with this eye gel for as long as I can repurchase it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking into other products by the same brand.</li>
            <li> I only use a little bit to dab under my eye area and that&#x27;s enough to moisturize my under-eye area!</li>
            <li> My eyes are always dry</li>
            <li> So I bought this for my bf who had deep dark circles under his eyes, for as long as I&#x27;ve known him.</li>
            <li> I had some missing eyelashes in a few spots that are now not only not missing but longer!</li>
            <li> Not only did my dark shadows vanish after using my skin around my eyes were refreshed .</li>
            <li> I tried everything for dark circles (cover ups and treatments) and finally realized the problem was puffiness at the bottom of the eye orbit that makes a shadow...</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> I bought it after doing tons of research(because eye products are super expensive ).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 50 and have tried numerous products from the most expensive to the less expensive drug store brands and nothing compares to this, plus it&#x27;s all natural ingredients!</li>
            <li> I often use it in the morning when my eyes feel puffy or even dry due to weather changes.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried samples of other brands, and they just don&#x27;t hold up to this one.</li>
            <li> It seems like a lot of other brands sting my eyes (perhaps the fragrance?) or irritate the skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I had issues with other eye products migrating into my eyes and making them burn halfway through the day.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, around my eyes are a little bit dry</li>
            <li> Got a sample of the SKingenixx anti aging gel with my order of the toner and holy cow this works.</li>
            <li> I have dark circles and under eye puffiness that refuse to go away.</li>
            <li> and I can still get the dark circles on my eyes</li>
            <li> I have hereditary dark circles, but this eye gel is working wonders on them.</li>
            <li> My dark circles have faded.</li>
            <li> the dark circles and puffy eyes are gone.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Lately, however, late-blooming vanity has had me scrutinizing the dark circles under my eyes - which are actually hereditary in my family.</li>
            <li> None seemed to really help without being way too expensive.</li>
            <li> Cleared up dark circles around my eyes in 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> My dark circles are genetic and my under eye puffiness is from restless nights while completing my thesis.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s like I&#x27;ve never had dark circles and as if I get 8 hours of sleep every night.</li>
            <li> My dark circles are also lightening up</li>
            <li> It hydrates my lids, making the dark circles appear less dark.</li>
            <li> I sleep late and wake-up early, and this helps a lot with puffiness and the dark circles are slowly lightening.</li>
            <li> Holy cow!</li>
            <li> Way less than half of what I was spending and</li>
            <li> I have significantly less puffiness around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Having very sensitive skin is difficult to find products that don&#x27;t irritate.</li>
            <li> It does seem a little sticky when it goes on</li>
            <li> I use it regularly and am convinced it has, at the very least, slowed my hair loss.</li>
            <li> I am not using it everyday, because I don&#x27;t need to</li>
            <li> I no longer need to use harsh chemicals</li>
            <li> My husband also noticed a difference after a few days as well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to  Skingenixx facial toner as well - give it a try!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have terrible dark circles and only mildly puffy eyes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Skingenixx under eye gel for 3 weeks  and my dark circles and puffiness are slowly diminishing.</li>
            <li> My dark circles are almost gone and the puffiness is a thing of the past!</li>
            <li> so am anxious to see what her long-term results will be.</li>
            <li> Not sure about wrinkles yet.....time will tell.</li>
            <li> Got this as a point perk, and when I use it at night I wake up and the dark circles are gone!!!</li>
            <li> you have nothing to lose but a few wrinkles and the look of tired eyes.  </li>
            <li> Unbelievable results!</li>
            <li> No more!</li>
            <li> A LITTLE GOES A LOOOONNNNGGGG WAY!!!</li>
            <li> My eyes are exposed to sun, pollen, and dehydration, so by the end of the day, they used to look haggard and tired.  </li>
            <li> but, I have never like seeing myself in photos because my eyes look so tired, but today my daughter in law sent me a photo she took with me and</li>
            <li> and I can see a dramatic difference since using it.</li>
            <li> I have seen dramatic results when I look in the mirror.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed each time and do not ever let myself run out anymore.</li>
            <li> and if you know me, it takes an awful lot to do that.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My eyes appeared so much brighter.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my mom and she likes it. She has a lot of puffiness under her eyes and it seems to be helping. She&#x27;s only used it a couple weeks so am anxious to see what her long-term results will be. I just ordered one for myself, too, but haven&#x27;t tried it yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* free sample provided</li>
            <li> The longer I use this product the more results I notice. I love all the Skingenixx products. I&#x27;m 50 and have tried numerous products from the most expensive to the less expensive drug store brands and nothing compares to this, plus it&#x27;s all natural ingredients! I will never use another brand.This gel lifted my upper eyelid, taking away the &#x27;hooded&#x27; look and so my eyeliner glides on smoothly. Unbelievable results! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Having very sensitive skin is difficult to find products that don&#x27;t irritate. I have been using this eye gel for over 3wks and my eye area is never dry, feels moisturized and not oily. Rich in hyaluronic acid and collagen, this product is better than higher end &amp;#34;sensitive natural&amp;#34; products. A little goes a long way and will definitely repurchase. I&#x27;m looking into other products by the same brand.</li>
            <li> This whole product line has been amazing to me.  This eye gel has helped me quite a bit because I work outside.  My eyes are exposed to sun, pollen, and dehydration, so by the end of the day, they used to look haggard and tired.  Since I&#x27;ve started using this, that&#x27;s all changed.  I use it on my clean face at night before I go to bed and look great the next morning.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I feel like even at 22 I am getting some pretty harsh wrinkles around my eyes. I have used this and can see them softening right after use!! I am not using it everyday, because I don&#x27;t need to but I can see it already doing some amazing work for my skin. Great product.</li>
            <li> I have not had the best experiences with any eye gel product: most stay on the surface of the skin, do not absorb, and feel slimy. That is NOT the case with this product. This is the first time I have purchased any Skingenixx product and I am completely SOLD. This night gel absorbs AMAZINGLY during the night and I can see a dramatic difference since using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every morning and night. I am quite pleased with it! It has the best ingredients for anti aging- hyaluronic acid and collagen,  pleasant scent and it absorbs perfectly and quickly. My under eyes feel refreshed and look so much better. I&#x27;m sticking with this eye gel for as long as I can repurchase it. It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve tried in my life.</li>
            <li> This eye gel is light weight, absorbs quickly, and REALLY works! It hydrates well and I have seen a big difference in my under eye skin, smoother and softer looking. I highly recommend it to anyone who has signs of aging under and around the eye.</li>
            <li> I have dark circles and under eye puffiness that refuse to go away. I have used many expensive serums, gels and creams and none have worked for me. This anti aging gel works however and it&#x27;s better than most expensive gels. I sleep late and wake-up early, and this helps a lot with puffiness and the dark circles are slowly lightening.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many eye serums and had almost given up until I found this and read the reviews. So, thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Only been using about 2 weeks but already see a difference--I use morning and evening. The texture is great. It&#x27;s light weight and very soothing to the eyes. Not irritating and absorbs quickly. I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li> I have been using Skingenixx Anti-Aging Eye Gel with Collagen for about a month &amp; the dark circles have really reduced &amp; I don&#x27;t need nearly as much concealer as I used to. This lightweight formula makes the skin around my eyes soft and moisturized. It also keeps my eye shadow stay on longer! Worth the price since a little goes a long way. This is terrific!!!</li>
            <li> This product goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin oily at all.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and is so lightweight that you forgot you even put it on, except when you see the results!  Skingenixx anti-aging eye gel helped me with puffy morning eyes daily and over about a 2-week time frame has improved the fine lines and smoothness around my eyes.  This product is definitely worth trying, it worked very well for me!</li>
            <li> I can say that it is the best product to reduce dark spots and circles under the eye and you no need to worry about side effects,no side effects with this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Skingenixx under eye gel for 3 weeks  and my dark circles and puffiness are slowly diminishing. I can&#x27;t say how much money I spent or products I returned trying to resolve these eye issues.</li>
            <li> I no longer need to use harsh chemicals and I can still get the dark circles on my eyes/face to disappear. My eyes are always dry but this helps me get the moisture that it needs. This also helps to make me look younger and most people want to look younger. If you want to reverse your age I think this will be the perfect choice for you.</li>
            <li> I have only used this eye gel for a week and it is amazing.  I use it night and morning and already under my eyes are brighter and softer. Only use a tiny bit as it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is a gentle, lightly moisturizing eye gel.. I LOVE this-the packaging is great (sturdy, chic, and dispenses well). The fragrance is mild-anise I think, and the price is fair for high end eye treatments in general. I have young skin with very tiny wrinkles; this plumps the area up well. It feels so good I use it several times a day, but I don&#x27;t need much. The pump dispenser is a nice touch, because it spits out the perfect amount.</li>
            <li> My husband  bought this product for me. I have used it for almost two weeks and I will give you details in this review I wish I had read from somebody before. I love the product! at the beginning I did not think much of it. I have not gotten great compliments yet but I myself have seen a difference and to me that is what matters. I am 58 years old and showing signs of tiredness in and around my eyes, I use this product morning and evening.  I put it around my eyes, bottom and eyelids, also on my forehead and cheeks and I have truly seen a difference. In the morning after I put it on I wait a minute and then put my moisturizer and foundation, the way my skin looks makes me happy, not only that but, I have never like seeing myself in photos because my eyes look so tired, but today my daughter in law sent me a photo she took with me and my granddaughter two weeks ago and I thought the photo was an old photo of myself, I could not believe how I like the way my photo looked, this proved to me, this product works! and the only thing I can say is this serum has made a difference, whatever it is in it, it works! I will definitely continue to buy it and recommend it to others. If you are in the same situation I was, give it a try! you have nothing to lose but a few wrinkles and the look of tired eyes.  Thank you for making this product!</li>
            <li> I just recently purchased this product. It helps with puffiness and lines around the eyes! It does seem a little sticky when it goes on but it&#x27;s a great product! I really notice a difference!</li>
            <li> Wow! Got this as a point perk, and when I use it at night I wake up and the dark circles are gone!!! Its also good for fine lines. All you need is as little, if you put too much on it will burn. Great product, can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I have &amp;#34;fat padding&amp;#34; under my eyes (many people do) and according to more than one M.D., no cream or gel is going to completely get rid of my undereye puffiness. That said, I have tried countless creams, gels, refridgerated masks, tea bags, cucumbers, etc. They all promise to reduce undereye bags. I guess the must for some people, but not for me. Given my experiences, I was very surprised that this product actually does noticeably reduce my undereye puffiness! As I said, it doesn&#x27;t eliminate it (only a surgery called blepheroplasty would do that). I don&#x27;t know how the company does it, but for me it really has a very real effect.</li>
            <li> This is the first eye gel I can say I really like. Most of them, even all natural ones irritate my eyes. But this one doesn&#x27;t and it&#x27;s actually making a difference. I also am in love with their anti aging serum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eye gel for about 2 months now. It is by far the BEST eye gel EVER!! Now that I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s, I began to notice &amp;#34;bags&amp;#34; under my eyes. When I use this eye gel (in the morning and at night), I can tell a HUGE difference. NO BAGS!!!</li>
            <li> This eye gel has lightened up my whole eye area and I look bright eyed every morning. My husband also noticed a difference after a few days as well and I hadn&#x27;t even mentioned to him I had bought a new product. I highly recommend this product to everyone and am excited to try the other products in this line.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this. It diminishes the lines around my mouth</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.  It feels cool when I put it on, and it goes on smoothly. A little goes a long way.  I also think it helps with dark circles, but nothing that I&#x27;ve found is magic in that arena. Anyway, this stuff is great!</li>
            <li> I just love how this gel feels on my lids and it does everything it says it does and then some. I have been using it for two weeks now and noticed something odd but amazing. I had some missing eyelashes in a few spots that are now not only not missing but longer! Yes this made my eyelashes grow! It&#x27;s the only thing I have been using on my eyes.</li>
            <li> This product was obtained for free in exchange for my review. I was told that I would not be able to find a better product at this price, and she is correct! I have been very happy with the results - better results than with the $50 eye cream I&#x27;ve been using. I have recommended this product to everyone I know since I saw a difference using this product after one week. I love it!</li>
            <li> I got this for my guy because he has always had big issues with under-eye bags and is very wrinkled at 27. After a week, I noticed a significant change in his eyes. They&#x27;ve lightened and the bags are visibly reduced. He still has his wrinkles, but perhaps they&#x27;ll start to fade after longer use.</li>
            <li> This eye gel has great ingredients in it and it doesn&#x27;t cost way too much like some other creams do. It absorbs quickly and makes my eye area feel moisturized without being too rich or heavy. I will keep buying this.</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye gel for about 4 weeks. I&#x27;ve tried samples of other brands, and they just don&#x27;t hold up to this one. It seems like a lot of other brands sting my eyes (perhaps the fragrance?) or irritate the skin around my eyes. I have hereditary dark circles, but this eye gel is working wonders on them. It hydrates my lids, making the dark circles appear less dark.</li>
            <li> I am impressed at how well the product penetrates and how gentle it is; no sting, no bad smell, etc. After using it for a week, I noticed that my eyelids appeared brighter and lighter. My dark circles have faded. I originally received it as a promotional gift with purchase. I have ran out a couple of times and  attempted to temporarily replace it with another similarly named product. I was disappointed each time and do not ever let myself run out anymore. It feels like giving your skin a drink of water. I highly recommend it for daily use, dark circles, puffiness, or redness.</li>
            <li> So I bought this for my bf who had deep dark circles under his eyes, for as long as I&#x27;ve known him. We&#x27;ve finally become close enough where I can suggest he&#x27;d change his facecare routine. After one week of use I noticed a huge difference in the color of his circles, and the depth. I do believe it has also reduced the visibility of his crows feet. He is 29 and I&#x27;m going to keep buying this product to keep him looking 29!</li>
            <li> Love this eye serum. I have bags and fine wrinkles as well as the start of that looseness in the eyelid skin that comes with age. This product helps mimimize all that. It is my new favorite eye serum.</li>
            <li> Got a sample of the SKingenixx anti aging gel with my order of the toner and holy cow this works. It attacked morning puffiness, dark circles and brightened my eye area considerably with just a sample. It has hyaluronic acid which is known for younger looking eyes.  I am buying a bottle for myself!</li>
            <li> This eye gel  is amazing and has collagen as well as hyaluronic acid ! It takes away the puffy, sleepy eye just like that! I hope to never be without it. I have tried many other products and this is really the only one that does what it says and wow as a bonus it&#x27;s a product I can feel good about using. I have been using it for two months.</li>
            <li> How many of us battle those fine lines around the eyes along with those dark circles?  I know I have had this problem and many of us want something that will help take care of these little issues, and Skingenixct s a proven treatment that can help.  Not only does it contain ingredients such a collagen which helps to improve the look of the skin but it also contains natural ingredients equally as beneficial such as Aloe and Jojoba.</li>
            <li> Use this hydrating eye gel to give thirsty eyes a cool, refreshing drink. This product leans more on the natural side and the formula is oil-free and light-weight; ideal for any skin type as well.</li>
            <li> I used to have to wake up every morning and put a cooling eye mask to get rid of the bags under my eyes. No more! There is no more puffiness, fine lines and dark circles are diminished and I wake up looking refreshed. I don&#x27;t even have to use the roll on under eye stuff I used to use every morning. This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> This stuff really absorbs and does WONDERFUL things for you. I loved it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Gel.&lt;br /&gt;It has helped reduce the wrinkles on my face.&lt;br /&gt;And the dark circles and puffy eyes are gone.&lt;br /&gt;This is a fantastic product and I give it a five star rating.&lt;br /&gt;I was given a discount for giving my honest and unbiased opinion which has not been influenced in any way.</li>
            <li> I got a mini sample of this anti aging gel  with my last purchase of a cleanser from Skingenixx and I love it. I use this 1-2x a day, after toning, before moisturizing and it definitely makes a difference. I used to wake up with puffy, &amp;#34;baggy&amp;#34; eyes all the time (waking up at 4am for work didn&#x27;t help!). After using this pretty consistently at least 1x a day (at night) I can honestly say I&#x27;ve noticed a difference.I haven&#x27;t begun to get wrinkles just yet, but with this stuff, it seems like that won&#x27;t be a worry anytime soon! Will definitely be purchasing a full size of this, loving it!</li>
            <li> This anti aging eye gel is awesome. Full of hyaluronic acid which is the star of the product . This is my first everyday eye product. I bought it after doing tons of research(because eye products are super expensive ). I have combination skin, around my eyes are a little bit dry and i have buffy bags in the morning. This really helps with the dryness and the collagen helps promote new skin on my eye area . Everybody says I look great!</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing a bit more makeup as I get older but, as a rule, it gets old and has to be discarded before I use it up. Lately, however, late-blooming vanity has had me scrutinizing the dark circles under my eyes - which are actually hereditary in my family. I have only been using this anti aging gel for a little while, and confess freely that I purchased it after getting a free gift that included a sample. This eye gel is lovely - feels good - does not feel particularly greasy if one applies it sparingly, and makes the skin feel softer. Having not used it for very long, I&#x27;m am surprised to see that it is making a difference in the under-eye bags. Thank you Skingenixx</li>
            <li> Love this product! it has a great texture, goes on nicely and does not leave a sticky feeling on my face. I use it in the morning while getting ready for work. I make sure to pack this as a travel essential as well anytime I go somewhere. This is something anyone over the age of 30 needs in their life. :)</li>
            <li> This is really refreshing gel for eyes and has made my eyes look brighter in two weeks of use at night. I often use it in the morning when my eyes feel puffy or even dry due to weather changes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this product! I&#x27;m very big on skincare and have used several different brands--especially high-end brands. I love how this has a pretty good rating on Amazon, is inexpensive, and contains hyaluronic acid, collagen peptides and green tea, the best ingredients for beautiful skin! I only use a little bit to dab under my eye area and that&#x27;s enough to moisturize my under-eye area!</li>
            <li> You only need a tiny amount, so it&#x27;s very cost effective. Goes on super smoothly with a neutral scent. It really moisturizes the skin under my eyes! Only been using it for about 2 months, but I&#x27;m very happy thus far. Has collagen which renews the eye area giving off a youthful look. I recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> One of the greatest products out there. Not only did my dark shadows vanish after using my skin around my eyes were refreshed . An excellent product to use as an always.  I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Holy cow! Okay so I can&#x27;t wait to invest in the full size of this because today was my first time using this, and so I posted a before and after picture on my Facebook. My friend was arguing with me saying that it was a Photoshopped image, she didn&#x27;t even believe it was my eyes!!!!!</li>
            <li> This actually shows some noticeable improvement in lines and darkness around the eyes. I cannot help falling in love with the silky and velvet touch around my eyes after applying this light weight but very moisture gel texture eye product. Definitely my favorite.Nice smooth finish. I have used 100&#x27;s of different products but this is promising.</li>
            <li> I get puffy eyes from not sleeping enough and have tried several cream.  None seemed to really help without being way too expensive. This cream works! I noticed a difference right away! I finally do not look like a zombie ☺</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using eye gels that cost up to three times as much as this one, and they pale in comparison. This hyaluronic eye gel leaves my skin incredibly soft and smooth throughout the day, and it never causes my under-eye makeup to clump. This is a great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> Besides the fact that i like the moisturizer, I love the way it is dispensed. You have control over how much comes out of the bottle each time. Alot of the eye lotions - you can&#x27;t control.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many of the expensive brands and when I found out the product I used for years wasn&#x27;t cruelty free, I switched immediately. After trying several more natural options that didn&#x27;t do much for me, I was so thrilled to find this one! It doesn&#x27;t cake and adds just the right amount of moisture. I have combination skin and being in my mid- forties, I needed a little help with the fine lines. This eye gel does just the trick! This is my second time purchasing this product and I will be back for more. I&#x27;ve become quite fond of all the products I&#x27;ve tried by this company. I&#x27;m very impressed with the prices too! Way less than half of what I was spending and the ingredients are natural and safe!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple of months now and feel it really works on keeping my lids hydrated, which is a feat for any eye cream in AZ. I dab it on before putting anything else on my face and it feels great! I&#x27;m addicted to  Skingenixx facial toner as well - give it a try!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I had issues with other eye products migrating into my eyes and making them burn halfway through the day.Not this one! It absorbs quickly, and it only takes a small amount to do the job! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Not harsh on my skin. Cleared up dark circles around my eyes in 2 weeks. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 30s and started using this eye gel about a month ago. It&#x27;s really  nice and light, no scent. I don&#x27;t have terrible dark circles and only mildly puffy eyes so this is perfect for me. It feels refreshing. I use morning and night and it does work a bit like a primer for my undereye concealer. I will keep using this</li>
            <li> My dark circles are genetic and my under eye puffiness is from restless nights while completing my thesis. I decided to Skingenixx under eye gel  and it&#x27;s like I&#x27;ve never had dark circles and as if I get 8 hours of sleep every night.</li>
            <li> So I either never had bags under my eyes or this gel is a miracle. Holy mackerel was I wow&#x27;d and if you know me, it takes an awful lot to do that. I never write reviews, ever, but I just had to for this. I received this gel today and thought I&#x27;d do my nightly routine a bit early to see if I noticed anything before bed. Right before He!!&#x27;s Kitchen I washed up, moisturized, eye gelled and then totally forgot about it. Watched my show, go potty and go to bed. Then it dawned on me to take a peek. So I did and the bags were virtually gone. True story. Goes on coos and a bit tingly (in a good way) and as everyone else has said, A LITTLE GOES A LOOOONNNNGGGG WAY!!! I could tell just by the feel of it. I only wish I took a before and after picture to post.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for just over a week now, and I am definitely seeing results. I have significantly less puffiness around my eyes. I have always had significant puffiness and darkness, but it has been made worse by the fact that I have an infant. I am really impressed with how well this product has reduced the darkness and puffiness in my eye area.</li>
            <li> I am glad to see Skingenixx carrying this product, since it is difficult to find shampoos for thinning hair. I use it regularly and am convinced it has, at the very least, slowed my hair loss. I also believe that it causes new hair growth and now I  don&#x27;t end up with a handful of hair after shampooing.</li>
            <li> I love this under eye gel. It is full of the best anti aging ingredients - collagen, hyaluronic acid and peptides. It is light and I only use a little in every application. I have seen dramatic results when I look in the mirror. It&#x27;s so easy, cool and refreshing. Even my husband uses it! I can see even more results on him.</li>
            <li> Skingenixx Anti-Aging Eye Gel with Collagen, Hyaluronic Acid, Green Tea and Matrixyl 3000 Super Peptide Complex has worked very well for me! My eyes have always been very puffy in the mornings. But, since using this product, my eyes looks great! My dark circles are almost gone and the puffiness is a thing of the past! I would definitely say 5 stars!!</li>
            <li> Skingenixx anti aging eye gel really works and diminishes puffiness of my &amp;#34;morning eyes&amp;#34; - my foundation goes on smoothly and my eye makeup does not rub off under my eyes. My dark circles are also lightening up so I know it is very effective.</li>
            <li> I literally could not believe my eyes.... I am 47 and my face looks much younger with the exception of under my eyes. I tried everything for dark circles (cover ups and treatments) and finally realized the problem was puffiness at the bottom of the eye orbit that makes a shadow...NOTHING would fix that. Until I tried Skingenixx under eye gel. A-MAZING!! Try it, you will love it!</li>
            <li> i used this stuff for the first time and I really saw a difference in my under eyes. They seem brighter, and does help with puffiness. Not sure about wrinkles yet.....time will tell. I&#x27;ve only used this product for a week. But so far so good.</li>
