            <li>It has a nice scent to it as well.</li>

            <li>Love Loma products.  </li>
            <li>It does seem like it now behaves much better and looks healthier and shinier</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the product.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell and it truly was moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Great product, very moisturizing shampoo</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t wait to try more products.</li>
            <li>Really love this.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the great price and keep it up...</li>
            <li>I will be ordering from you if you do! :)</li>
            <li>i love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Not too sure if I like the scent of it.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and condition are okay.  </li>
            <li>But their other products are great!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried just about every hair product out there that doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell to it.  </li>
            <li>For my fine, highlighted, thinning hair this product works for me.</li>
            <li>They are sulfate free to help prevent color from fading as well as dryness.</li>
            <li>Such a great product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to comb through right after using the conditioner.</li>
            <li>Delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>This is why I gave these only 4 out of 5 stars, but I still highly recommend them to anyone who wants a great smelling, healthy, and color-safe shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Favorite new shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel soft, healthy, and a million bucks.</li>
            <li>I also love the silky soft felling of my hair after using both the products.  </li>
            <li>I have bleach highlights and this keeps it soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel as light and soft on my hair as the original Loma Organic product.</li>
            <li>I love how this is organic and leaves my hair feeling so clean and not oily or dry.</li>
            <li>The first batch of is this that I  bought from amazon in November was just like the batch from the salon.</li>
            <li>But for the price, I would expect the shine and silky feel to last more than a day.</li>
            <li>Have been trying different shampoos and conditioners and I am okay with this.</li>
            <li>Actually I like the conditioner better than the shampoo.</li>
            <li>Was pleasantly surprised when I dried it and found this great feeling hair.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair super soft</li>
            <li>the real deal, thanks</li>
            <li>Ships fast as well.</li>
            <li>Had bought through a salon and the owner, who is very organics savvy, raved about it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m already low on conditioner than I am on shampoo and if you use a lot each time you wash your hair, then you might go through these fairly quickly than you&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>This shampoo &amp; conditioner are high quality and organic.  </li>
            <li>My hair is so soft after using this conditioner!</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>It is soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>It is a little bit expensive, but for an organic product that is vegan and not tested on animals (but still makes my curly, color-treated hair nice and smooth)</li>
            <li>I have super long dry hair</li>
            <li>My only recommendation is that Loma offer a volumizing set as well because my already flat and volumeless hair remains exactly the same after using these.</li>
            <li>I bought these products because my hairdresser uses them at her salon, but I&#x27;m going to start shopping around again for a shampoo and conditioner that offers the same benefits AND volume as well.</li>
            <li>Again, I still recommend these products as my hair is now healthier than it has ever been and if Loma ever offers a volumizing shampoo and conditioner, then I will go back to buying from them.</li>
            <li>Fortunately for me, I only wash my hair 2-3 times a week as recommended by my hairdresser so they&#x27;ve lasted a long time; I purchased them from Amazon in late March.</li>

            <li> All natural and not too expensive.</li>
            <li> Its not a light conditioner, but I put it on the ends, and all over just twice a week.</li>
            <li> I have dry, curly, frizzy hair that I&#x27;ve hated to wear curly my entire life.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the product changed or if I got  a fake.</li>

            <li> The first batch of is this that I  bought from amazon in November was just like the batch from the salon. The batch I bought two weeks ago is different. This batch leaves my hair feeling terribly dry and my face and neck have been breaking out in all areas this comes in contact with. The bottles have different text on them, and this batch did not have batch code stamped on the bottom of the bottle. Not sure if the product changed or if I got  a fake.</li>
            <li> was recommended by my hair stylist and it smells amazing...</li>
            <li> These were sold as Organic although Not all ingredients are organic. Loma has changed all their products, and non is all organic anymore. It doesn&#x27;t feel as light and soft on my hair as the original Loma Organic product.</li>
            <li> This shampoo &amp; conditioner are high quality and organic.  They are sulfate free to help prevent color from fading as well as dryness.</li>
            <li> Love this product - awesome smell.  Delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and I&#x27;ve tried just about every hair product out there that doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell to it.  This product smells great and works great.  I use the Curly Curvaceous styling gel as well</li>
            <li> Liked better in salon. Not hanging same effect at home.</li>
            <li> It seems to be different from the shampoo I bought before.</li>
            <li> I was asked to order this for someone.</li>
            <li> Love Loma products.  All natural and not too expensive.</li>
            <li> Best shampoos and conditioners ever!! I have dry, curly, frizzy hair that I&#x27;ve hated to wear curly my entire life. I&#x27;ve always straightened it because the curls always got too unruly and messy and ugly. But since using this shampoo, when I wear it curly, I get so many compliments!! It does seem like it now behaves much better and looks healthier and shinier so I can wear it curly without worrying it will turn into an afro.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me to try by my Salon, I love the product! It makes my hair feel soft, healthy, and a million bucks. Its not a light conditioner, but I put it on the ends, and all over just twice a week.</li>
            <li> I have used this on my colored hair for about a year now</li>
            <li> the real deal, thanks</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the product.  I also love the silky soft felling of my hair after using both the products.  But for the price, I would expect the shine and silky feel to last more than a day.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and it truly was moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Great product, very moisturizing shampoo</li>
            <li> For my fine, highlighted, thinning hair this product works for me. Give my hair moisture without weighing it down. I&#x27;ve used this product for several years.</li>
            <li> Love! Smells nice, my hair is healthier &amp; shinier!</li>
            <li> I have super long dry hair this stuff is amazing can&#x27;t wait to try more products.</li>
            <li> Really love this. Leaves hair super soft</li>
            <li> The best shampoo and conditioner!  Love the smell!</li>
            <li> Product arrived earlier than I expected and no damage.  This product was recommend to me by my hairdresser and I love it.  I will definitely be order other products from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;Sara</li>
            <li> Makes my colored-treated and highlighted hair feel like silk! It&#x27;s a bonus that these products are organic and smell amazing too.</li>
            <li> makes my hair feel soft and manageable - excellent product</li>
            <li> This moisturizing shampoo and conditioner smell really good, have a wonderful consistency to them, are healthy for your scalp, great for colored hair like mine, and really do replenish and moisturize giving you silky, shiny hair in the end. My only recommendation is that Loma offer a volumizing set as well because my already flat and volumeless hair remains exactly the same after using these. I still have to buy other products to give my hair lift and volume. The only other option is a daily shampoo and conditioner Loma makes which doesn&#x27;t offer volume either. This is why I gave these only 4 out of 5 stars, but I still highly recommend them to anyone who wants a great smelling, healthy, and color-safe shampoo and conditioner. I bought these products because my hairdresser uses them at her salon, but I&#x27;m going to start shopping around again for a shampoo and conditioner that offers the same benefits AND volume as well. One last thing. the bottles themselves are skinner than in the picture as they are only 12 oz. bottles each which makes them kind of pricey then. I&#x27;m already low on conditioner than I am on shampoo and if you use a lot each time you wash your hair, then you might go through these fairly quickly than you&#x27;d like. Fortunately for me, I only wash my hair 2-3 times a week as recommended by my hairdresser so they&#x27;ve lasted a long time; I purchased them from Amazon in late March. Again, I still recommend these products as my hair is now healthier than it has ever been and if Loma ever offers a volumizing shampoo and conditioner, then I will go back to buying from them.</li>
            <li> These products are awesome! My hair is the best it&#x27;s ever been. I was told about these from my hairdresser but it&#x27;s quite a bit more expensive in the salon. This is the only product I will use on my hair now. Thanks for the great price and keep it up...I will be ordering from you if you do! :)</li>
            <li> The BEST shampoo and Creme Rinse I have EVER used. This is my second order of Loma ..LOVE it!</li>
            <li> The shampoo seems to be a different consistency than the one I bought at the salon.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my stylist and it is wonderful. My hair loves it and responds well to it. It has a nice scent to it as well.</li>
            <li> Love this products!  My hair is so soft after using this conditioner!</li>
            <li> Such a great product. It moisturizers without weighing it down. Ships fast as well.</li>
            <li> I love how this is organic and leaves my hair feeling so clean and not oily or dry.</li>
            <li> Really great smell! I have tried every single organic shampoo and this one still leaves my hair dry. I have to also use a spray conditioner after the shower to even brush my hair. The smell is amazing though.</li>
            <li> Smells so good and it ACTUALLY moisturizes my hair. It&#x27;s easy to comb through right after using the conditioner. I have bleach highlights and this keeps it soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair with some grey colored blonde every eight weeks.  This shampoo and conditioer makes it feel like my hair did when I was a teenager. It is soft and silky.  Was pleasantly surprised when I dried it and found this great feeling hair.  Love, Love, Love it!</li>
            <li> wow! i love this shampoo and conditioner. It is a little bit expensive, but for an organic product that is vegan and not tested on animals (but still makes my curly, color-treated hair nice and smooth) I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Shampoo and conditioner make your hair feel great both in and out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Favorite new shampoo and conditioner.  Great for color-treated hair.</li>
            <li> Luv luv this product.</li>
            <li> Have been trying different shampoos and conditioners and I am okay with this. Actually I like the conditioner better than the shampoo. Both products are a little thicker than what I&#x27;m use to. Not too sure if I like the scent of it.</li>
            <li> LOVE all Loma products!!!</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing. Love this product.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing. Good lather. Only down fall is it leaves my hair feeling dry.</li>
            <li> Love this Shampoo!! Totally recommend it!</li>
            <li> Had bought through a salon and the owner, who is very organics savvy, raved about it.  Nice to find it through Amazon.  I like how my hair feels and looks.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I have extensions and it is wonderful.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and condition are okay.  But their other products are great!</li>
