            <li>It has proven to be very protective along with entertaining!</li>
            <li>could this fit a&lt;br /&gt;iPhone 5C?</li>
            <li>I purchased this as a backup, in case something happens to my primary case, so I have not used it yet.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good and it came early.</li>
            <li>/&gt;TL; DR cute case but does not protect phone from cracking, phone cracked on first drop</li>
            <li>I got tons of comments on how neat an cool</li>
            <li>This case is so cool.</li>
            <li>Liquid can move freely, add much fun to you</li>
            <li>The case is very pretty.</li>
            <li>so much fun to look at</li>
            <li>The glitter moves around in liquid, making it fun for kids as well.</li>
            <li>Other than that , this product is good .</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem like the most indestructible plastic material, but I generally keep my phone in a padded pocket in my purse, so I&#x27;m not overly concerned.</li>
            <li>I like it very much, I will need something to protect the screen so it wont get scratched.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a real conversation maker!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t care floor it that much!</li>
            <li>So pretty, i can&#x27;t stop playing with it.</li>
            <li>Price was too much for this.</li>
            <li>The quality of the case for protection is probably just okay, but I&#x27;m not too rough with my phone.</li>
            <li>High glitter!</li>
            <li>But my only downside is that there&#x27;s no lip that holds your phonr secure.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of the glitter pencil cases I had back in elementary school in the 90s!  </li>
            <li>Such a fun case!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing but hard to get off sometimes</li>
            <li>It was okay for a few weeks</li>
            <li>It is very pretty and mesmerizing, but after a few days I started noticing air bubbles.</li>
            <li>Apple iPhone 5 5S Made of hard plastic which is safe and protective,</li>
            <li>This was a gift for a friends 12 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>It is a hard case and could be easily cracked.</li>

            <li> It is a hard case and could be easily cracked.</li>
            <li> Cool product, hard to get case off phone though.</li>
            <li> Worth the small price.</li>
            <li> Too much glitter hard to see the stars maybe make it with different colors or less glitter.</li>
            <li> The glitter seems to clump up in the middle of the case, so all of the movement (the very little amounts of movement) from the glitter is barely visible.</li>
            <li> Save your money, my case is almost all dry after a month.</li>
            <li> Not the look I expected.</li>
            <li> Be careful</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very please with the whimsical nature of this product.</li>
            <li> then I noticed there was less water</li>
            <li> Several months after having the phone, I would answer or pick it up and have this nasty chemical smell on my hand, finally after several weeks I looked down and all of  the liquid was completely gone out of the case!</li>
            <li> Not your everyday phone cover.</li>
            <li> Does not fit iphone 5c.</li>
            <li> This is 2nd case i bought with false listing.</li>
            <li> However it is really hard to get on the phone and really hard to get off.</li>
            <li> But the water leaking out slowly over time scared me, for myself and my phone.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty disappointed!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for a secret Santa swap and I couldn&#x27;t stop playing with it.</li>
            <li> No telling what the liquid is made of, but it smelled terrible!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Good quality and very cool phone case.  love it!</li>
            <li> product arrived as shown, i love the glitter and design and it moves well, but about an hour after putting it on my phone I dropped it (I&#x27;ve had my iphone for almost a year, dropped many times, no cracks) and my screen now has a crack across the middle. I did expect the case was not so durable, but first drop!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL; DR cute case but does not protect phone from cracking, phone cracked on first drop</li>
            <li> This glitter kind of sticks to the inside so you cannot see the effect</li>
            <li> Cool product, hard to get case off phone though.</li>
            <li> Bought for my 7th grade daughter and all her friends are so jealous! Worth the small price.</li>
            <li> It was okay for a few weeks then I noticed there was less water and it was leaking. It was otherwise a good case because I dropped it a lot</li>
            <li> The case is very pretty. However it is really hard to get on the phone and really hard to get off. After about 24 hours of being on my phone an air bubble appeared and now the glitter sticks.</li>
            <li> The water or &amp;#34;quicksand&amp;#34; evaporates about a week After you get it. I messaged them on Amazon to return and never got a message back. Save your money, my case is almost all dry after a month.</li>
            <li> Case fits snug. case did start to leak over time and then air bubbles would be inside the case and ruin the appearance. No damage was done to my phone but there was liquid on it when I took off the case</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s glamorous , no doubt ! But the only thing is that the glitter gets stuck to the plastic quite often so I have to keep tapping it to make it move . Other than that , this product is good .</li>
            <li> My daughter loved the case and it was very pretty but it broke in only one month&#x27;s time.</li>
            <li> I love it.... it&#x27;s such a neat looking case.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it beacuase the glitter stop moving from the case</li>
            <li> Dose it protect the front of the phone?</li>
            <li> Not your everyday phone cover. It&#x27;s a real conversation maker!</li>
            <li> Too much glitter hard to see the stars maybe make it with different colors or less glitter. Price was too much for this. Didn&#x27;t care floor it that much!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this phone case almost a week. It is very pretty and mesmerizing, but after a few days I started noticing air bubbles. Now there is definitely a big air bubble, so water is either leaking or evaporating. I haven&#x27;t contacted the seller yet.</li>
            <li> so much fun to look at, I&#x27;m getting lots of compliments!</li>
            <li> Several months after having the phone, I would answer or pick it up and have this nasty chemical smell on my hand, finally after several weeks I looked down and all of  the liquid was completely gone out of the case! No telling what the liquid is made of, but it smelled terrible! Definitely a neat idea and I got tons of compliments. But the water leaking out slowly over time scared me, for myself and my phone.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s good and it came early.</li>
            <li> This case is so cool. It looks just like the photo. The glitter moves around in liquid, making it fun for kids as well. The quality of the case for protection is probably just okay, but I&#x27;m not too rough with my phone.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot! Very cool!</li>
