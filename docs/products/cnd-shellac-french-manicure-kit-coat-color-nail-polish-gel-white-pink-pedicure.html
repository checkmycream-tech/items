            <li>Hoping for more colors to be added to the line!!</li>
            <li>Shellac is a good gel polish.</li>
            <li>I saw some good reviews and thought to give it a try.</li>
            <li>so I could do my own fill-in two weeks after my shellac manicure.</li>
            <li>ICAN DO MY OWN PROFFESIONAL MANICURE AND POLISH</li>
            <li>CND Shellac goes on very easily, just like nail polish, and lasts for weeks.</li>
            <li>I love this polish.</li>
            <li>much better than just gel color nail polish, lasts longer.</li>
            <li>, I AM SO EXCITED  CAN&#x27;T</li>
            <li>It lasts a good two weeks and probably longer if I left it on, but I am always excited to change colors.</li>
            <li>i just need more practice applying the white part of the nails.</li>
            <li>This set of bottles is at a good price (less than $30) and Shellac&#x27;s terrific, but be aware steps 5 &amp; 6 should be done after steps 7 &amp; 8 and not in the order stated.</li>
            <li>The white gel in this kit is really more of an off white color which is why I gave it 3 stars.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I expected more white and more pink color.</li>
            <li>I clean my hands all day long and they keep on shining.</li>
            <li>This product won&#x27;t cure under a LED light, I followed every steps closed</li>
            <li>Nice combination for French manicure but Pink polish is too clear.</li>
            <li>Not quite as long as I hoped but got a full week out of it without it peeling.</li>
            <li>Product shipped &amp; was delivered quickly, especially being right before Christmas.</li>
            <li>White &amp; pink colors are accurate for French manicure you would get at a salon.</li>
            <li>The pink is pretty..</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>I bought the uv light, base coat and top coat.</li>
            <li>I also used base and top coat as well as a uv light.</li>
            <li>Initial cost was somewhat expensive but for as many times as I&#x27;ve painted nails so far</li>
            <li>This white color is half opak and clear pink is to clear almost clear.</li>

            <li> Nice combination for French manicure but Pink polish is too clear.</li>
            <li> Just what i wanted to touch up my salon shellac.</li>
            <li> This is the best shellac I have tried. It lasts a good two weeks and probably longer if I left it on, but I am always excited to change colors. I have tried other gels, etc, and none last like CND. I highly recommend this product. Hoping for more colors to be added to the line!!</li>
            <li> I like it. it works well.</li>
            <li> the shellac last longer then the shellac I was using before</li>
            <li> great product.great service.</li>
            <li> I expected more white and more pink color. This white color is half opak and clear pink is to clear almost clear.</li>

            <li> just what I wanted.  thank you</li>
            <li> i think all the cnd gel polishes are very good.  i just need more practice applying the white part of the nails.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get studio white.. It is not white it&#x27;s off white. Instead buy cream puff which ironically is white!! The pink is pretty.. Shellac is a good gel polish.</li>
            <li> I am a nurse and this nail polish does not come off with the alcohol based sanitizer that we use. I clean my hands all day long and they keep on shining.</li>
            <li> I love this polish. It stays on just as long as going to the salon. I bought the uv light, base coat and top coat. Initial cost was somewhat expensive but for as many times as I&#x27;ve painted nails so far I&#x27;ve already saved myself a lot of money!</li>
            <li> The white gel in this kit is really more of an off white color which is why I gave it 3 stars. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> CND Shellac goes on very easily, just like nail polish, and lasts for weeks. A few times I was on vacation for 4 weeks and the polish survived very well.</li>
            <li> I bought these so I could do my own fill-in two weeks after my shellac manicure. They work perfectly. Now I can extend my shellac manicure at least another two weeks and maybe longer.  I also used base and top coat as well as a uv light. I have invested quite a bit of money, but at $35 per manicure I will break even within a year.</li>
            <li> much better than just gel color nail polish, lasts longer. Not quite as long as I hoped but got a full week out of it without it peeling. White &amp; pink colors are accurate for French manicure you would get at a salon.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE SAME PRODUCT NAIL SHOPS USE NOW ICAN DO MY OWN PROFFESIONAL MANICURE AND POLISH, I AM SO EXCITED  CAN&#x27;T WAIT FOR MY FRIENDS TO TRY IT</li>
            <li> This is awesome polish. I like doing nails and this polish stays on and does not chip.</li>
            <li> Product shipped &amp; was delivered quickly, especially being right before Christmas. It was exactly what I expected. I&#x27;ve used it once &amp; it performs just like I&#x27;d had my nails done at a salon.</li>
            <li> I saw some good reviews and thought to give it a try. This product won&#x27;t cure under a LED light, I followed every steps closed and it didn&#x27;t work. I had to take it off and reply, wasted two hours. It&#x27;s also a non-returnable item, what a waster of money, energy and time!</li>
