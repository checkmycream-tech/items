            <li>This product looks good but not as emphasized.</li>

            <li>And a bit more glittery than I had hoped.</li>
            <li>I love wearing it; it just lights up my skin.</li>
            <li>This product I cannot say enough it gives you a perfect glow!!  </li>
            <li>This is not going to be my favorite luminizer.  </li>
            <li>on top of foundation, under blush and 3.</li>
            <li>on top of foundation and blush.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t stay on for more than five minutes</li>
            <li>I think I was expecting something a bit better with the price tag.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>It is okay.</li>
            <li>I wanted it to be better for the price...</li>
            <li>This product really doesn&#x27;t do much of a great job as a highlighter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, not a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; like Taylor Swift and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just OK for the price.</li>
            <li>LOVE THEIR PRODUCTS AND LOVE THIS LUMINIZER, MAKES</li>
            <li>I am glad to change my review.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love RMS Beauty makeup. 1</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>more can I ask for?  </li>
            <li>Fantastic!  </li>
            <li>and really really lovely  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite RMS product.  </li>
            <li>Although I love them all.</li>
            <li>I was expecting so much more from this product.</li>
            <li>stuff does what it says, It makes me look like I have really healthy, dewy skin.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love it</li>
            <li>Very glad I finally purchased it after reading so many great reviews about it.</li>
            <li>It has pretty good staying power too - I find myself not needing to reapply at all or maybe</li>
            <li>It gives your face a beautiful natural glow and lasts a while too.  </li>
            <li>This highlighter gives you a really great, natural dewy glow.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using it most on my nose and cheeks.</li>
            <li>Just like the un-cover up, it blends seamlessly and it has a pearlescent shimmer which works great with all undertones and skintones.</li>
            <li>It has a great consistency, can be layered and is all natural.  </li>
            <li>the other wonderful</li>
            <li>This is fantastic - everything I expected and best when applied sparingly.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you get the full size of this product.  </li>
            <li>So far loving both this and the RMS concealer!</li>
            <li>Really bummed because this is my favorite highlighter I have ever used!  </li>
            <li>and the list goes on and on...lovely stuff and takes so little and looks wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of finger application with all of my makeup and RMS Beauty</li>
            <li>It makes a huge difference in the way my makeup looks.</li>
            <li>Give a light illumination.  </li>
            <li>I purchased it because it is supposed to light up your face, so-to-speak, without being garish.</li>
            <li>I feel 10 years younger, and it does a great job on those cheekbones --</li>
            <li>THE SKIN GLOW , GOES ON SMOOTHLY</li>
            <li>I would be happy to come back and edit my review if I see a change.</li>
            <li>great luminizer without any fear of big chunks of glitter or being too sparkly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and smooth with not too much shine</li>
            <li>This is a nice product, but really I don&#x27;t see a significant difference on my face between this product and Nars Copacabana illuminator.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to highlighting and was happy to find this super easy to use either with a brush or fingertip; the oils make it melt easily into the skin, which make for a dewy glow that looks really natural, like your skin is just healthy, not shimmery or overdone.</li>
            <li>Awesome organic cosmetic product which gives natural glow, works and feels great for whose with dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have never been so excited about a makeup product.  </li>
            <li>many and many love it, but it was so EXTREMELY sheer</li>
            <li>Amazing product as it really does illuminate your face with just the right amount of light.  </li>
            <li>this make-up does what I always wanted make-up to do, what I always believed make-up SHOULD do - it brings out my own natural beauty without creating a mask!</li>
            <li>I had read wonderful things about this product, but it is hard to apply and I didn&#x27;t see any difference when added to my makeup.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping for this one amazing, natural, organic product for my face.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>I would also say that I don&#x27;t use this much for evening wear; it just has more of a daytime feel.</li>
            <li>It does absolutely nothing more than a swipe of coconut oil would do.</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite illuminizer.</li>
            <li>SInce going Vegan I am more health concious and only use safe products now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even quite sure what is so genius about this; it just makes you look BETTER without being obvious.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been super overwhelmed by highlighters</li>
            <li>Also love rms products because they are all natural, melt into the skin and come in eco friendly glass pots.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite new make up company.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite highlighter.</li>
            <li>It will last a long time tol, its just beautiful!</li>
            <li>And I love that it&#x27;s made with natural ingredients!</li>
            <li>This is such a pretty color and a great idea but in the end is very sticky.</li>
            <li>I would originally give this product one-star, but the reason I added another star was that is product is surprisingly pretty on your cupid&#x27;s bow (upper-lip).</li>
            <li>I keep having to peel little strands of hair off of my face, it seems to attract any fly aways and hold on.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural, which I love.</li>
            <li>But overall nice.</li>
            <li>Do something else and come back to blend it in after it warms and it blends in nicely.</li>
            <li>And the Nars product is a far greater value for the money.</li>
            <li>I run a soft brush over the top and apply over my makeup....</li>
            <li>but finally gave in since so many people rave about it.</li>
            <li>This product was quite pretty...</li>
            <li>I personally like my highlighters to be noticeable and a prominent feature of my make up.</li>
            <li>Second time I have ordered it - love the way it makes my face glow.</li>
            <li>love using this highlighter at the inner corners of my eyes or under the brow bone.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wanting this product for a while ever since I first heard of RMS Beauty.</li>
            <li>I really did!</li>
            <li>This was my first RMS product and it opened my eyes to all</li>
            <li>Such a minimal but beautiful addition to my skin.</li>
            <li>A few pats along the cheek and brow bones and you&#x27;re good to go.  </li>
            <li>Really beautiful effect on the skin, due to the solid wax balm-like consistency.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s subtle and makes you look dewy and happy.  </li>
            <li>I was very apprehensive about spending so much on this but its worth it.</li>
            <li>I bought EstÃ©e Lauder illumine for less money and a nice look</li>
            <li>but I certainly read them.</li>
            <li>Really pretty high lighter.</li>
            <li>It really does something for your face.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see it doing anything on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have as much bronze in it as I was expecting.</li>
            <li>If anything, this is a very GREASY product, so it looks like you have vaseline on your face instead of a highlighter.</li>
            <li>When applied to the cupid&#x27;s bow it blends really well with lipsticks.</li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t do much for me and is a bit on the greasy side.  </li>
            <li>It uses organic ingredients, a real plus.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really do much.</li>
            <li>I expected more brightening results.</li>
            <li>I LOVE knowing that there are absolutely no toxic ingredients in it.</li>
            <li>Wife loves this product says it really helps her skin</li>
            <li>but this one has so much hype surrounding it</li>
            <li>Absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really tell that it makes much of a difference on my face.  </li>
            <li>Found this product really didn&#x27;t cause much or any illumination on me.</li>
            <li>I would advise - don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li>I wear juice beauty&#x27;s glow highlighter on my cheeks for a really amazingly fresh natural blush.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;AMAZON was kind enough to give me back part of my purchase price.</li>
            <li>The first few times I wore it, my coworkers asked me what moisturizer I was using or whether I was eating more vegetables because my skin looked &amp;#34;movie</li>
            <li>This is also the first time in my life I&#x27;m actually having FUN playing and experimenting with my makeup.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use a tiny dab of Mary Lou luminizer on my cheek bones and get a far better result for far cheaper.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a super natural looking highlighter, and you can only see it glow under natural DIRECT light.</li>
            <li>though a bit wet feeling throughout the day as many of the natural products are.  </li>
            <li>OK, barely equal to items similar and a 1/4 of the cost.</li>
            <li>I had heard this is one of the main products they use in the JCrew photo shoots.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Will most likely not repurchase but it will be a very long time before I run out.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not something I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li>as I said I can&#x27;t live without it....</li>
            <li>though it&#x27;s a very subtle luminizer, it does look good.</li>
            <li>It looks very natural while still being noticeable.</li>
            <li>It gives skin a natural glow, bringing light to the face, without the shimmering side effect of other luminizers.</li>
            <li>The RMS concealer is outstanding though, this product was just not suitable for my skintone.</li>
            <li>(such a high price tag!)</li>
            <li>There are no glitter chunks, just natural, dewy radiance.</li>
            <li>The fact that is is natural is a bonus too.</li>
            <li>This product heightens your natural radiance</li>
            <li>Gives my skin a natural youthful glow that is fading from my natural complexion.  </li>
            <li>Really natural.</li>
            <li>It gives you a natural glow.</li>
            <li>Not too greasy, but a natural glow.</li>
            <li>Really wish they could make a similar product with ingredients that are lower on the comedogenic chart :</li>
            <li>in all, rms gets a 5 star for application, appearance and pigment but 2 stars for causing severe acne breakouts on someone that does not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This line is definitely professional.  </li>
            <li>professional stuff</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>definitely think it&#x27;s worth it to splurge for it if you will really get some use out of it, and I think it&#x27;ll last me a very long time too.</li>
            <li>I simply cannot live without this.  </li>
            <li>I use this everyday and feel so lucky to have found it.</li>
            <li>How are there no other reviews for this yet on here?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was surprised by how a very small amount of this product applied sparingly to the inner eye, above the top lip and on the cheek bones, lit up my face without being perceptible.  </li>
            <li>The same effect can be achieved with many other products at less cost.</li>
            <li>this is apparently what the j crew models wear on their faces and putting some just under my check bones</li>
            <li>I could barely see it at all.</li>
            <li>Only downside is the relatively short shelf life because of the natural ingredients and exclusion of preservatives etc.</li>
            <li>There is definitely a shine/shimmer to this product, but it&#x27;s still natural looking enough that I wear it every day.  </li>
            <li>I do like this product and luckily because you only need a little bit it will last a long time.</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a very long way, so I feel it&#x27;s worth the price tag.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> how great it makes my skin look.</li>
            <li> The product itself is great</li>
            <li> Itâ€™s buildable, so you can control the amount of shine, and it works great with all skin tones.</li>
            <li> This luminizer has great reviews which helped me decide to purchase it.  </li>
            <li> Great for a glowy look</li>
            <li> I saw comments about how great it was in Town and Country and decided to try it...</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> I gifted it to my friend who also thinks this is the best highlighter.  </li>
            <li> It is so nice on any skin type!</li>
            <li> Adds that perfect glow to make your skin look healthy and plump.</li>
            <li> Not the best reason to select a cosmetic but after researching the brand and falling in love with this product I am a convert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I hoped no one would noticed but one of my friends said &amp;#34;you are glowing.&amp;#34; This product is wonderful because if you are after a natural, sublte look...then, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> This product looks good but not as emphasized.</li>
            <li> It gives the perfect, luminescent, believable, healthy looking glow.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I found it, thanks for Deliciously Ella for the recommendation on her blog:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super impressed with the consistency and</li>
            <li> I saw my reflection on my car window and was super impressed with the glow of my skin!</li>
            <li> Watch this space (if you have nothing better to do, lol).  </li>
            <li> It catches the light beautifully and realistically.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite highlighter!</li>

            <li> Could wear this with no makeup and look great - perfect for a day outdoors or laid back.</li>
            <li> It needs to warm up a bit on your skin before blending.  </li>
            <li> It looks nice</li>
            <li> When I do, it looks nice</li>
            <li> A nice product.</li>
            <li> Nice dewy glow effect.</li>
            <li> Loving all the rms beauty products.</li>
            <li> then there is her wonderful red lipstick that looks great on anyone....</li>

            <li> The combo gives me the best most natural look I have ever had.  </li>
            <li> Save your money and just buy a very cheap creamy frosty eye shadow</li>
            <li> Put it in the corner of your eyes, the bridge of your nose, the top of your cheekbones and by the cupid heart of your lip.</li>
            <li> I am SO glad I did.</li>
            <li> Love love love.</li>
            <li> A stick would have been better</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and light,  and gives you that dewy glow anywhere you apply it.</li>
            <li> And a bit more glittery than I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I love wearing it; it just lights up my skin.</li>
            <li> This product I cannot say enough it gives you a perfect glow!!  </li>
            <li> This is not going to be my favorite luminizer.  </li>
            <li> on top of foundation, under blush and 3.</li>
            <li> on top of foundation and blush.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t stay on for more than five minutes</li>
            <li> I think I was expecting something a bit better with the price tag.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> It is okay.</li>
            <li> I wanted it to be better for the price...</li>
            <li> This product really doesn&#x27;t do much of a great job as a highlighter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, not a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; like Taylor Swift and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just OK for the price.</li>
            <li> LOVE THEIR PRODUCTS AND LOVE THIS LUMINIZER, MAKES</li>
            <li> I am glad to change my review.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love RMS Beauty makeup. 1</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> more can I ask for?  </li>
            <li> Fantastic!  </li>
            <li> and really really lovely  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite RMS product.  </li>
            <li> Although I love them all.</li>
            <li> I was expecting so much more from this product.</li>
            <li> stuff does what it says, It makes me look like I have really healthy, dewy skin.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love it</li>
            <li> Very glad I finally purchased it after reading so many great reviews about it.</li>
            <li> It has pretty good staying power too - I find myself not needing to reapply at all or maybe</li>
            <li> It gives your face a beautiful natural glow and lasts a while too.  </li>
            <li> This highlighter gives you a really great, natural dewy glow.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using it most on my nose and cheeks.</li>
            <li> Just like the un-cover up, it blends seamlessly and it has a pearlescent shimmer which works great with all undertones and skintones.</li>
            <li> It has a great consistency, can be layered and is all natural.  </li>
            <li> the other wonderful</li>
            <li> This is fantastic - everything I expected and best when applied sparingly.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you get the full size of this product.  </li>
            <li> So far loving both this and the RMS concealer!</li>
            <li> Really bummed because this is my favorite highlighter I have ever used!  </li>
            <li> and the list goes on and on...lovely stuff and takes so little and looks wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of finger application with all of my makeup and RMS Beauty</li>
            <li> It makes a huge difference in the way my makeup looks.</li>
            <li> Give a light illumination.  </li>
            <li> I purchased it because it is supposed to light up your face, so-to-speak, without being garish.</li>
            <li> I feel 10 years younger, and it does a great job on those cheekbones --</li>
            <li> THE SKIN GLOW , GOES ON SMOOTHLY</li>
            <li> I would be happy to come back and edit my review if I see a change.</li>
            <li> great luminizer without any fear of big chunks of glitter or being too sparkly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and smooth with not too much shine</li>
            <li> This is a nice product, but really I don&#x27;t see a significant difference on my face between this product and Nars Copacabana illuminator.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to highlighting and was happy to find this super easy to use either with a brush or fingertip; the oils make it melt easily into the skin, which make for a dewy glow that looks really natural, like your skin is just healthy, not shimmery or overdone.</li>
            <li> Awesome organic cosmetic product which gives natural glow, works and feels great for whose with dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have never been so excited about a makeup product.  </li>
            <li> many and many love it, but it was so EXTREMELY sheer</li>
            <li> Amazing product as it really does illuminate your face with just the right amount of light.  </li>
            <li> this make-up does what I always wanted make-up to do, what I always believed make-up SHOULD do - it brings out my own natural beauty without creating a mask!</li>
            <li> I had read wonderful things about this product, but it is hard to apply and I didn&#x27;t see any difference when added to my makeup.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping for this one amazing, natural, organic product for my face.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> I would also say that I don&#x27;t use this much for evening wear; it just has more of a daytime feel.</li>
            <li> It does absolutely nothing more than a swipe of coconut oil would do.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite illuminizer.</li>
            <li> SInce going Vegan I am more health concious and only use safe products now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even quite sure what is so genius about this; it just makes you look BETTER without being obvious.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been super overwhelmed by highlighters</li>
            <li> Also love rms products because they are all natural, melt into the skin and come in eco friendly glass pots.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite new make up company.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite highlighter.</li>
            <li> It will last a long time tol, its just beautiful!</li>
            <li> And I love that it&#x27;s made with natural ingredients!</li>
            <li> This is such a pretty color and a great idea but in the end is very sticky.</li>
            <li> I would originally give this product one-star, but the reason I added another star was that is product is surprisingly pretty on your cupid&#x27;s bow (upper-lip).</li>
            <li> I keep having to peel little strands of hair off of my face, it seems to attract any fly aways and hold on.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural, which I love.</li>
            <li> But overall nice.</li>
            <li> Do something else and come back to blend it in after it warms and it blends in nicely.</li>
            <li> And the Nars product is a far greater value for the money.</li>
            <li> I run a soft brush over the top and apply over my makeup....</li>
            <li> but finally gave in since so many people rave about it.</li>
            <li> This product was quite pretty...</li>
            <li> I personally like my highlighters to be noticeable and a prominent feature of my make up.</li>
            <li> Second time I have ordered it - love the way it makes my face glow.</li>
            <li> love using this highlighter at the inner corners of my eyes or under the brow bone.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting this product for a while ever since I first heard of RMS Beauty.</li>
            <li> I really did!</li>
            <li> This was my first RMS product and it opened my eyes to all</li>
            <li> Such a minimal but beautiful addition to my skin.</li>
            <li> A few pats along the cheek and brow bones and you&#x27;re good to go.  </li>
            <li> Really beautiful effect on the skin, due to the solid wax balm-like consistency.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle and makes you look dewy and happy.  </li>
            <li> I was very apprehensive about spending so much on this but its worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought EstÃ©e Lauder illumine for less money and a nice look</li>
            <li> but I certainly read them.</li>
            <li> Really pretty high lighter.</li>
            <li> It really does something for your face.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see it doing anything on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have as much bronze in it as I was expecting.</li>
            <li> If anything, this is a very GREASY product, so it looks like you have vaseline on your face instead of a highlighter.</li>
            <li> When applied to the cupid&#x27;s bow it blends really well with lipsticks.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t do much for me and is a bit on the greasy side.  </li>
            <li> It uses organic ingredients, a real plus.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really do much.</li>
            <li> I expected more brightening results.</li>
            <li> I LOVE knowing that there are absolutely no toxic ingredients in it.</li>
            <li> Wife loves this product says it really helps her skin</li>
            <li> but this one has so much hype surrounding it</li>
            <li> Absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really tell that it makes much of a difference on my face.  </li>
            <li> Found this product really didn&#x27;t cause much or any illumination on me.</li>
            <li> I would advise - don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> I wear juice beauty&#x27;s glow highlighter on my cheeks for a really amazingly fresh natural blush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;AMAZON was kind enough to give me back part of my purchase price.</li>
            <li> The first few times I wore it, my coworkers asked me what moisturizer I was using or whether I was eating more vegetables because my skin looked &amp;#34;movie</li>
            <li> This is also the first time in my life I&#x27;m actually having FUN playing and experimenting with my makeup.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use a tiny dab of Mary Lou luminizer on my cheek bones and get a far better result for far cheaper.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a super natural looking highlighter, and you can only see it glow under natural DIRECT light.</li>
            <li> though a bit wet feeling throughout the day as many of the natural products are.  </li>
            <li> OK, barely equal to items similar and a 1/4 of the cost.</li>
            <li> I had heard this is one of the main products they use in the JCrew photo shoots.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Will most likely not repurchase but it will be a very long time before I run out.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not something I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li> as I said I can&#x27;t live without it....</li>
            <li> though it&#x27;s a very subtle luminizer, it does look good.</li>
            <li> It looks very natural while still being noticeable.</li>
            <li> It gives skin a natural glow, bringing light to the face, without the shimmering side effect of other luminizers.</li>
            <li> The RMS concealer is outstanding though, this product was just not suitable for my skintone.</li>
            <li> (such a high price tag!)</li>
            <li> There are no glitter chunks, just natural, dewy radiance.</li>
            <li> The fact that is is natural is a bonus too.</li>
            <li> This product heightens your natural radiance</li>
            <li> Gives my skin a natural youthful glow that is fading from my natural complexion.  </li>
            <li> Really natural.</li>
            <li> It gives you a natural glow.</li>
            <li> Not too greasy, but a natural glow.</li>
            <li> Really wish they could make a similar product with ingredients that are lower on the comedogenic chart :</li>
            <li> in all, rms gets a 5 star for application, appearance and pigment but 2 stars for causing severe acne breakouts on someone that does not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This line is definitely professional.  </li>
            <li> professional stuff</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> definitely think it&#x27;s worth it to splurge for it if you will really get some use out of it, and I think it&#x27;ll last me a very long time too.</li>
            <li> I simply cannot live without this.  </li>
            <li> I use this everyday and feel so lucky to have found it.</li>
            <li> How are there no other reviews for this yet on here?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was surprised by how a very small amount of this product applied sparingly to the inner eye, above the top lip and on the cheek bones, lit up my face without being perceptible.  </li>
            <li> The same effect can be achieved with many other products at less cost.</li>
            <li> this is apparently what the j crew models wear on their faces and putting some just under my check bones</li>
            <li> I could barely see it at all.</li>
            <li> Only downside is the relatively short shelf life because of the natural ingredients and exclusion of preservatives etc.</li>
            <li> There is definitely a shine/shimmer to this product, but it&#x27;s still natural looking enough that I wear it every day.  </li>
            <li> I do like this product and luckily because you only need a little bit it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a very long way, so I feel it&#x27;s worth the price tag.</li>
            <li> The RMS products are expensive, but a little goes a long way and so lovely!  </li>
            <li> It was smaller than I expected for the price</li>
            <li> complete waste of money</li>
            <li> Does not last as long as I would have expected.</li>
            <li> Bonus that it&#x27;ll last forever due to that.</li>
            <li> It feels like dry Chapstick.</li>
            <li> This product is made for dry skin, not normal or combination.</li>
            <li> I normally never write reviews</li>
            <li> This is not your average luminizer, itâ€™s something else entirely.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical at first (especially considering the price!), but after using I am a believer!!  </li>
            <li> but if it&#x27;s used by celebrities then it&#x27;s expected.  </li>
            <li> A total waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I expected it to be creamier.  </li>
            <li> I never really see anything going on.  </li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s not much product.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully, not much is needed per application.</li>
            <li> I would say you&#x27;d need to apply this a few times throughout the day to get a lasting effect.</li>
            <li> little bit of highlighter goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It is a small pot, but a little does go a long way and will last quite awhile.</li>
            <li> I hope it worked well for other people.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, on any other part of the face (bridge of the nose, eye lids, cheekbones, forehead)</li>
            <li> I prefer other highlighter like Dior amber diamond or becca opal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try other products from this line.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is the price.  </li>
            <li> Despite the comments about it being a small container, a little goes a long way, and I think the price tag shouldn&#x27;t be a deterrent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little product that packs a lot of punch.</li>
            <li> just a little bit of the &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like dewy, supple, youthful complexion in a little pot.</li>
            <li> They got it to me in a timely fashion and even included a little bonus inside for me!&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try mixing it in with a little blush to see if that works, but using it alone or over my blush is futile.</li>
            <li> It takes so little.  </li>
            <li> Very dry and hard to use.</li>
            <li> I bought into the hype and it is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I must be missing a trick to the application or something,</li>
            <li> not impressed at all, barely see the product once once applied.</li>
            <li> Adds very little of anything to the makeup arsenal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not sure it&#x27;s a necessity for me.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> but it is really small.</li>
            <li> And the bottle is thick and there is very little in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really liked using brushes on my face, even with routine washing, they always seem to cause breakouts.  </li>
            <li> May be a little too luminous for some looking for a very subtle effect.</li>
            <li> it is very small for the cost&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> The problem is that it is so subtle that it does not seem to do anything at all.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a highlighter that will give you a serious glow, look somewhere else--this isn&#x27;t going to deliver.</li>
            <li> Again, it&#x27;s subtle, but I didn&#x27;t need racing stripes anyway.</li>
            <li> It is perfectly subtle and gives your skin a dewey youthful glow.  </li>
            <li> It leaves somewhat of a subtle sheen, but nothing I&#x27;d rave about.</li>
            <li> I have very, very delicate skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and waxy and I find it difficult to apply.  </li>
            <li> This is what yuo call false advertising.</li>
            <li> BUT..... I never get acne, EVER and after continued use of this product in conjunction with other rms products I have gotten really bad cystic acne that stayed around until I stopped using rms products.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t use a lot of product, but it&#x27;s a bit expensive for a very small pot.  </li>
            <li> I am light/med olive and unfortunately it didn&#x27;t show up on me at all.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the secret weapon for highlighting!  </li>
            <li> considering the price and size which is small, I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Also, as the months go by, the coconut oil starts smelling rather stale.</li>
            <li> and it is too expensive for that!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite expensive but GET IT!</li>
            <li> Deeply disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Awful product.</li>
            <li> this is the worst I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say that this is awful either</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little product that packs a lot of punch. It was smaller than I expected for the price but if it&#x27;s used by celebrities then it&#x27;s expected.  You don&#x27;t have to use a lot. It&#x27;s natural, which I love. Put it in the corner of your eyes, the bridge of your nose, the top of your cheekbones and by the cupid heart of your lip. It really does something for your face.</li>
            <li> Perfect amount of metallic shimmer!  I always worry that highlighters are too sparkly but this product is perfect!  Also love rms products because they are all natural, melt into the skin and come in eco friendly glass pots.</li>
            <li> I went back and forth over buying it (such a high price tag!) but finally gave in since so many people rave about it. I am SO glad I did. I did a lot of research about all the different highlighters and luminizers out there and watched a lot of youtube videos and was overwhelmed at the amount of choices but I do not need to look anymore. I will stick with this stuff for life.  It gives the perfect, luminescent, believable, healthy looking glow.    It catches the light beautifully and realistically. It looks very natural while still being noticeable. I apply it with my ring finger and dab it on my cheekbones, cupids bow, inner corner of eyes, and brow bone. It gives me a nice boost of confidence.  There are no glitter chunks, just natural, dewy radiance. It has pretty good staying power too - I find myself not needing to reapply at all or maybe just once during the day.  I have never been so excited about a makeup product.  The fact that is is natural is a bonus too.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! It gives your face a beautiful natural glow and lasts a while too.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. Love love love.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product if your skin is on the fair to light side. I am light/med olive and unfortunately it didn&#x27;t show up on me at all. The RMS concealer is outstanding though, this product was just not suitable for my skintone.</li>
            <li> I like it!! Not giving it a 5 because of application. A stick would have been better</li>
            <li> Awful product. It came damage. I was hoping for this one amazing, natural, organic product for my face. I hope it worked well for other people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have not received a feedback from this seller.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the secret weapon for highlighting!  I&#x27;m so happy I found it, thanks for Deliciously Ella for the recommendation on her blog: http://deliciouslyella.com/natural-beauty-my-make-up-bag/.  I gifted it to my friend who also thinks this is the best highlighter.  It&#x27;s nice and light,  and gives you that dewy glow anywhere you apply it. I forgot to add that you can apply it occasionally, if required, but it&#x27;s not necessary.  I&#x27;m a huge fan of finger application with all of my makeup and RMS Beauty is the best for that technique.  I&#x27;ve never really liked using brushes on my face, even with routine washing, they always seem to cause breakouts.  I will recommend this to everyone and anyone looking for a great highlighter!</li>
            <li> considering the price and size which is small, I was disappointed.  The same effect can be achieved with many other products at less cost.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  I literally could not tell a bit of difference when wearing this product.  A total waste of money.  I bought EstÃ©e Lauder illumine for less money and a nice look</li>
            <li> not impressed at all, barely see the product once once applied. complete waste of money</li>
            <li> Goes on beautifully and really gives a nice healthy glow.</li>
            <li> This product was quite pretty...though a bit wet feeling throughout the day as many of the natural products are.  And a bit more glittery than I had hoped. But overall nice.</li>
            <li> This highlighter gives you a really great, natural dewy glow. I love wearing it; it just lights up my skin. The first few times I wore it, my coworkers asked me what moisturizer I was using or whether I was eating more vegetables because my skin looked &amp;#34;movie star-esque.&amp;#34; I would agree with the comments that it doesn&#x27;t have the best staying power, and I have to reapply to some areas during the day. Despite the comments about it being a small container, a little goes a long way, and I think the price tag shouldn&#x27;t be a deterrent. I would also say that I don&#x27;t use this much for evening wear; it just has more of a daytime feel. And I love that it&#x27;s made with natural ingredients! Can&#x27;t recommend enough.</li>
            <li> It was alright, not the best though.</li>
            <li> Give a light illumination.  This is my favorite new make up company.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite highlighter! And great ingredients too!</li>
            <li> I purchased it because it is supposed to light up your face, so-to-speak, without being garish. The problem is that it is so subtle that it does not seem to do anything at all.</li>
            <li> This product I cannot say enough it gives you a perfect glow!!  Tyler Swift wears this product and now I know why.  It is so nice on any skin type!</li>
            <li> This is not going to be my favorite luminizer.  The texture is nothing like I thought it would be.  I expected it to be creamier.  It&#x27;s thick and waxy and I find it difficult to apply.  It feels like dry Chapstick.</li>
            <li> OK, barely equal to items similar and a 1/4 of the cost. Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Awesome organic cosmetic product which gives natural glow, works and feels great for whose with dry and sensitive skin. I use over Un Cover-Up-22.</li>
            <li> I was totally underwhelmed by this- I don&#x27;t really see it doing anything on my skin.  I tried it 1. under everything 2. on top of foundation, under blush and 3. on top of foundation and blush. I&#x27;ve tried it on my eye lids, lips and brow bones.  I never really see anything going on.  I would not recommend this to any of my friends.  I use a tiny dab of Mary Lou luminizer on my cheek bones and get a far better result for far cheaper.</li>
            <li> I had read wonderful things about this product, but it is hard to apply and I didn&#x27;t see any difference when added to my makeup.  If you use a powder foundation, this will not work.  It is too sticky.  I then tried a liquid foundation, but I felt I had pancake makeup on and there was no &amp;#34;luminating effect&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic - everything I expected and best when applied sparingly.  Bonus that it&#x27;ll last forever due to that.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite highlighter. SInce going Vegan I am more health concious and only use safe products now. It took a while but I finally found this. I was very apprehensive about spending so much on this but its worth it. It will last a long time tol, its just beautiful!</li>
            <li> When I apply makeup, I do use RMS Luminizer to bring brightness to my cheekbones.  Then I forget about my face for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> This product heightens your natural radiance&lt;br /&gt;and adds moisture organically that lasts the entire day.&lt;br /&gt;I have never used a product that produced such a&lt;br /&gt;dramatic effect.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect luminizer.  A few pats along the cheek and brow bones and you&#x27;re good to go.  Friends have even commented on the glowiness of my skin when I use this.  The only complaint I have is the price.  You don&#x27;t use a lot of product, but it&#x27;s a bit expensive for a very small pot.  I would buy it again, however!</li>
            <li> It does absolutely nothing more than a swipe of coconut oil would do.It feels sticky and it gives the effect of greasy skin not highlighted cheeks.</li>
            <li> Gives my skin a natural youthful glow that is fading from my natural complexion.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Amazing product as it really does illuminate your face with just the right amount of light.  I feel 10 years younger, and it does a great job on those cheekbones -- a must buy!!</li>
            <li> Really natural. Could wear this with no makeup and look great - perfect for a day outdoors or laid back.</li>
            <li> I normally never write reviews but I certainly read them. I really love this product. It gives you a natural glow. I hoped no one would noticed but one of my friends said &amp;#34;you are glowing.&amp;#34; This product is wonderful because if you are after a natural, sublte look...then, it&#x27;s perfect. I enjoy using it most on my nose and cheeks.</li>
            <li> This is such a pretty color and a great idea but in the end is very sticky. I keep having to peel little strands of hair off of my face, it seems to attract any fly aways and hold on.&lt;br /&gt;I will use it for lip only and it is too expensive for that!</li>
            <li> just a little bit of the &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; look. this is apparently what the j crew models wear on their faces and putting some just under my check bones gives me a bit of definition and shape to my face</li>
            <li> this is the worst I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- it provides no luminosity or glow&lt;br /&gt;- it is not a powder&lt;br /&gt;- it is very small for the cost&lt;br /&gt;- it doesn&#x27;t stay on for more than five minutes</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite illuminizer. It&#x27;s subtle and makes you look dewy and happy.  I use this everyday and feel so lucky to have found it. I&#x27;ll always have this in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> I think I was expecting something a bit better with the price tag. Works okay. Doesn&#x27;t have as much bronze in it as I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Product works wonderfully! Not too greasy, but a natural glow. Best highlighter I have ever used. Absolutely love it, will purchase again!</li>
            <li> It is okay. I wanted it to be better for the price...</li>
            <li> My favorite beauty product!</li>
            <li> Should have left it for the professionals.  I bought into the hype and it is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Really pretty high lighter.</li>
            <li> This product really doesn&#x27;t do much of a great job as a highlighter. It&#x27;s def over-hyped. I personally like my highlighters to be noticeable and a prominent feature of my make up. If you are looking for a highlighter that will give you a serious glow, look somewhere else--this isn&#x27;t going to deliver. I wouldn&#x27;t say that this is awful either, it&#x27;s a super natural looking highlighter, and you can only see it glow under natural DIRECT light. Otherwise (once indoors) it looks like you have nothing on. If anything, this is a very GREASY product, so it looks like you have vaseline on your face instead of a highlighter. I would originally give this product one-star, but the reason I added another star was that is product is surprisingly pretty on your cupid&#x27;s bow (upper-lip). When applied to the cupid&#x27;s bow it blends really well with lipsticks. However, on any other part of the face (bridge of the nose, eye lids, cheekbones, forehead) it doesn&#x27;t look like anything but grease. Not recommended for normal/oily/combination skin types.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what all the hype is about.  This product didn&#x27;t do much for me and is a bit on the greasy side.  I prefer other highlighter like Dior amber diamond or becca opal.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical at first (especially considering the price!), but after using I am a believer!!  I&#x27;m not even quite sure what is so genius about this; it just makes you look BETTER without being obvious.  It is in an absurdly tiny vial so there&#x27;s not much product.  Thankfully, not much is needed per application.</li>
            <li> It uses organic ingredients, a real plus.  You have to use a TON of it to see results, but I do have very fair skin.  It&#x27;s ok, not a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; like Taylor Swift and the lot says, but it does give a teensy bit of glow.</li>
            <li> This was a sample size for THIRTY EIGHT DOLLARS. What a ripoff. But Amazon gave me a $20 refund.  Do NOT buy this product</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really do much.</li>
            <li> Totally underwhelmed by this tiny overpriced over-hyped product. Adds very little of anything to the makeup arsenal. Save your money and just buy a very cheap creamy frosty eye shadow and you&#x27;ll have the same thing.</li>
            <li> Make sure you get the full size of this product.  I got a 0.15 gram sample size when it should have been much larger for FORTY FOUR DOLLARS&lt;br /&gt;$44. I cannot believe that the reseller had the nerve to send this out for that price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AMAZON was kind enough to give me back part of my purchase price.</li>
            <li> so awesome. little bit of highlighter goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Really beautiful effect on the skin, due to the solid wax balm-like consistency. It&#x27;s like dewy, supple, youthful complexion in a little pot. Only downside is the relatively short shelf life because of the natural ingredients and exclusion of preservatives etc. But it&#x27;s a beautiful product. A little bit goes a very long way, so I feel it&#x27;s worth the price tag.</li>
            <li> Second time I have ordered it - love the way it makes my face glow.</li>
            <li> I like this Luminizer. It give the cheeks a finished glow.</li>
            <li> Just like the un-cover up, it blends seamlessly and it has a pearlescent shimmer which works great with all undertones and skintones.</li>
            <li> I expected more brightening results. It&#x27;s just OK for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried the product twice since receiving it.  It needs to warm up a bit on your skin before blending.  So, just dab it on cheek bones.  Do something else and come back to blend it in after it warms and it blends in nicely.</li>
            <li> LOVE THEIR PRODUCTS AND LOVE THIS LUMINIZER, MAKES THE SKIN GLOW , GOES ON SMOOTHLY&lt;br /&gt;GREAT FOR ALL SKIN COLORS</li>
            <li> Very dry and hard to use.</li>
            <li> I do like this product and luckily because you only need a little bit it will last a long time. I&#x27;m just not sure it&#x27;s a necessity for me. It looks nice but I can definitely do without it. If I&#x27;m rushing I just don&#x27;t have time to apply this. When I do, it looks nice but it&#x27;s not something I can&#x27;t live without. Will most likely not repurchase but it will be a very long time before I run out.</li>
            <li> Maybe I can come back with an update after wearing it for a while, but I could literally see no difference using this AT ALL. Nothing. Zip. Nada. Zilch. I must be missing a trick to the application or something, &#x27;cuz I&#x27;m not getting the huzzahs this product is getting. :shrug: I would be happy to come back and edit my review if I see a change. Watch this space (if you have nothing better to do, lol).  EDIT: I am glad to change my review. I have continued to use this and though it&#x27;s a very subtle luminizer, it does look good. Again, it&#x27;s subtle, but I didn&#x27;t need racing stripes anyway.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love RMS Beauty makeup. 1) I LOVE knowing that there are absolutely no toxic ingredients in it. And 2) I feel like this make-up does what I always wanted make-up to do, what I always believed make-up SHOULD do - it brings out my own natural beauty without creating a mask! This is also the first time in my life I&#x27;m actually having FUN playing and experimenting with my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love using this highlighter at the inner corners of my eyes or under the brow bone.  All the RMS Beauty products seem to impart a healthy, dewy glow and the Living Luminizer is no exception!  There is definitely a shine/shimmer to this product, but it&#x27;s still natural looking enough that I wear it every day.  The RMS products are expensive, but a little goes a long way and so lovely!  I imagine this jar will last me a year.</li>
            <li> Wife loves this product says it really helps her skin</li>
            <li> Really bummed because this is my favorite highlighter I have ever used!  It is perfectly subtle and gives your skin a dewey youthful glow.  Application is very easy.....BUT..... I never get acne, EVER and after continued use of this product in conjunction with other rms products I have gotten really bad cystic acne that stayed around until I stopped using rms products.  Really wish they could make a similar product with ingredients that are lower on the comedogenic chart :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, rms gets a 5 star for application, appearance and pigment but 2 stars for causing severe acne breakouts on someone that does not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I&#x27;m new to highlighting and was happy to find this super easy to use either with a brush or fingertip; the oils make it melt easily into the skin, which make for a dewy glow that looks really natural, like your skin is just healthy, not shimmery or overdone.</li>
            <li> A nice product. Very easy to apply. Nice dewy glow effect. Does not last as long as I would have expected. May be a little too luminous for some looking for a very subtle effect. I plan to keep using</li>
            <li> Love this product! Easy to apply, however don&#x27;t forget to blend! I would say you&#x27;d need to apply this a few times throughout the day to get a lasting effect. The perfect dewey complexion-ifier!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting this product for a while ever since I first heard of RMS Beauty. I&#x27;ve never been super overwhelmed by highlighters but this one has so much hype surrounding it and it definitely lives up to it!! I&#x27;m super impressed with the consistency and how great it makes my skin look. I saw my reflection on my car window and was super impressed with the glow of my skin! :) definitely think it&#x27;s worth it to splurge for it if you will really get some use out of it, and I think it&#x27;ll last me a very long time too. So far loving both this and the RMS concealer!</li>
            <li> 1.  The product itself is great and I would recommend it to any and everyone.&lt;br /&gt;2.  The seller is top-notch!  They got it to me in a timely fashion and even included a little bonus inside for me!&lt;br /&gt;What more can I ask for?  Absolutely nothing.  I would definitely purchase goods from this seller again!</li>
            <li> I use it everyday! Adds that perfect glow to make your skin look healthy and plump.</li>
            <li> Best. Luminizer. Ever.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product, but really I don&#x27;t see a significant difference on my face between this product and Nars Copacabana illuminator. And the Nars product is a far greater value for the money.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really tell that it makes much of a difference on my face.  It&#x27;s nice and smooth with not too much shine</li>
            <li> It looks bigger in the picture but it is really small. And the bottle is thick and there is very little in it. If yuo have oily skin dont buy it. This product looks good but not as emphasized. I will not buy it again. Just using since i bought it. Lesson learned: Don&#x27;t be brainwashed by the advertising. This is what yuo call false advertising. I will not recommend it to anyone but rather say go to the mall or the drugstore.</li>
            <li> I seem to be in the minority, but this product does nothing for me. A swipe of coconut oil is a heck of a lot cheaper and yields the results I was hoping to get from the Living Luminizer. I&#x27;m going to try mixing it in with a little blush to see if that works, but using it alone or over my blush is futile.</li>
            <li> Just like they promise. A wounderful shine to your complexion!</li>
            <li> Found this product really didn&#x27;t cause much or any illumination on me. Was wanting something to avoid the disco ball glitter and ended up going with Becca. I see it works for many and many love it, but it was so EXTREMELY sheer I could barely see it at all.</li>
            <li> This stuff is gold!  It brightens up and makes your skin glow. Fantastic!  I&#x27;m going to try other products from this line. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is not your average luminizer, itâ€™s something else entirely. It gives skin a natural glow, bringing light to the face, without the shimmering side effect of other luminizers. Itâ€™s buildable, so you can control the amount of shine, and it works great with all skin tones. Itâ€™s a basic in any makeup bag.</li>
            <li> one of the best luminizer ever; yes, pricey but it was the best product I&#x27;ve found!</li>
            <li> Loving all the rms beauty products. I almost have every one of them. Very happy with the colors textures and all natural. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite expensive but GET IT! It makes a huge difference in the way my makeup looks. Now it glows &amp;#34;naturally&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> Perfect for getting a glow on mature skin.</li>
            <li> This luminizer has great reviews which helped me decide to purchase it.  It has a great consistency, can be layered and is all natural.  I just don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s for me.</li>
            <li> Great for a glowy look</li>
            <li> This line is definitely professional.  I simply cannot live without this.  I have very, very delicate skin.  I run a soft brush over the top and apply over my makeup....good bye wrinkles and sallowness  and hello sunshine!  It takes so little.  That coupled with her oil....as I said I can&#x27;t live without it....any of it...then there is her wonderful red lipstick that looks great on anyone....and the list goes on and on...lovely stuff and takes so little and looks wonderful.  I saw comments about how great it was in Town and Country and decided to try it...Thank God!  Nothing works on my skin....after thousands of dollars and decades of trying,  I finally find RMS....professional stuff and really really lovely  and ....Made in the USA!</li>
            <li> Disappears on brown skin</li>
            <li> great luminizer without any fear of big chunks of glitter or being too sparkly. Very glad I finally purchased it after reading so many great reviews about it. It is a small pot, but a little does go a long way and will last quite awhile.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by how a very small amount of this product applied sparingly to the inner eye, above the top lip and on the cheek bones, lit up my face without being perceptible.  Wow.  I would advise - don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> Over-rated, but used with ease of mind knowing its made w/safe ingredients</li>
            <li> This is my favorite RMS product.  Although I love them all.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like it. I really did! This product is made for dry skin, not normal or combination. It leaves somewhat of a subtle sheen, but nothing I&#x27;d rave about. Also, as the months go by, the coconut oil starts smelling rather stale. Deeply disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was expecting so much more from this product.</li>
            <li> How are there no other reviews for this yet on here?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is awesome.  I wear juice beauty&#x27;s glow highlighter on my cheeks for a really amazingly fresh natural blush.  Then on the tops of my cheek bones, brow bone, cupid&#x27;s blow, eye lids and a tap on my chin I use RMS living luminizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff does what it says, It makes me look like I have really healthy, dewy skin.  People complement my skin all the time.  Great product!</li>
            <li> This was my first RMS product and it opened my eyes to all the other wonderful products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked this up bc I had heard this is one of the main products they use in the JCrew photo shoots.  Not the best reason to select a cosmetic but after researching the brand and falling in love with this product I am a convert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now have the bronzer and the lip to cheek.  The combo gives me the best most natural look I have ever had.  Just LOVE!</li>
            <li> Such a minimal but beautiful addition to my skin. Absolutely love it</li>
