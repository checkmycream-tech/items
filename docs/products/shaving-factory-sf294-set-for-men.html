            <li>Its a great kit for the price.</li>
            <li>However, if $20 bucks is all you have to spend, it is a great value.  </li>
            <li>this is a great way to start.</li>
            <li>The blades worked great, but I haven&#x27;t tried any others yet</li>
            <li>What this photo does not show is the great case the razor came in .</li>

            <li>but he was happy.</li>
            <li>But a great purchase for someone just wanting to try out a DE razor.</li>
            <li>The soap is great - You don&#x27;t need a mug or anything.</li>
            <li>This is not just great as a started kit</li>
            <li>The brush works great and the arko is great.  </li>
            <li>it works great on my face and my head</li>
            <li>This kit is great for the price and works like a charm.</li>
            <li>the shaver is very nice</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy to report that the shave was awesome, incredibly close, smooth and no nicks.  </li>
            <li>Best shave of my life, way better than when I was using a 4-blade razor.</li>
            <li>Awesome, so glad I made the leap.</li>
            <li>The brush is good.</li>
            <li>Over all good kit.  </li>
            <li>Like others have said, this is a  good intro to DE shaving.</li>
            <li>Razor handle seems like it was built well and will hold up, Razor&#x27;s are of a good quility but can be alittle agressive</li>
            <li>The shaving brush is good for beginners</li>
            <li>Good choice.</li>
            <li>Bought 2 of these ( One as a Birthday Gift for Father in Law, who has used SR&#x27;s for over 40 years and loved this kit ).</li>
            <li>Derby Blades are good</li>
            <li>Good quality razor ,</li>
            <li>Good beginner set.</li>
            <li>The razor has flaws but it&#x27;s a good price if you want to give DE a try.</li>
            <li>Being a newbie with these razors, the weight felt good in my hand</li>
            <li>the price the set is a good way to decide without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li>but this soap is Great and Lathers up very easy, smells great and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all ( Most soaps or shaving creams do irritate my skin ).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good price for a nice starter kit, I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone looking to dump their cartridge razors.</li>
            <li>The handle is weighted quite nicely for the price, and the brush is good for a beginners brush.</li>
            <li>I love the rest of it!</li>
            <li>Now I have a shaving bowl, stand, more soap and a badger brush as well!</li>
            <li>Excellent product everything came promptly and was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>The 10 pack of blades was a nice addition if you shave a lot.</li>
            <li>I liked the derby blades that came with the kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice starter razor for anyone intersed in this style of shaving.</li>
            <li>Nice shave, soap smells nice.</li>
            <li>Nice price, would buy again.</li>
            <li>The silo doors work perfectly and it has decent weight and build quality.</li>
            <li>The brush is excellent to start with, and the razor handle is high quality.</li>
            <li>Sure, it&#x27;s not the Rolls Royce of safety razors, and is perhaps more of a Toyota, but for an entry level system the price can&#x27;t be beat and from an esthetics stand point it looks quite good.  </li>
            <li>The soap works best if you apply it directly to your face, then use the brush to make a lather.</li>
            <li>Works well - much better than the plastic store kind.</li>
            <li>Very nice well worth the money...</li>
            <li>I also really enjoy the smell of the Arko soap, very mild but much more pleasant than canned gels.</li>
            <li>The razor is okay, and works well.</li>
            <li>I bought this kit as an entry into safety razors, and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I love the butterfly handle and the brush.  </li>
            <li>,  the  Blades  are  ok,  I thought this might be  better quality,  I must say NO ,</li>
            <li>Love tha Arko soap and the boar brush.</li>
            <li>This is where I noticed a discrepancy in what many reviews state.</li>
            <li>And remember,when it comes to shaving soaps,gels,creams and razors,it&#x27;s all about preference,so play around with different brands to see what works best for you.</li>
            <li>but the handle should have more heft.  </li>
            <li>He was so pleased.</li>
            <li>the soap is ok and the razors don&#x27;t for in the case</li>
            <li>I was considering getting a safety razor but wasn&#x27;t sure I would like shaving this way.  </li>
            <li>Take my word for it, all the newer type multi-blade razors are way better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure he will love it .</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d probably invest in a better brush</li>
            <li>safety razor is okay...</li>
            <li>but this has more of a safety on it.&lt;br /&gt;Somehow</li>
            <li>More blade need to be exposed.</li>
            <li>i wasnt sure how i would like it</li>
            <li>the blades were ok</li>
            <li>but i got some better ones from my barber.</li>
            <li>I did like the Derby blades, however, and count Arko as my favorite go to for shave soap.</li>
            <li>The thing I like best about it is that it doesn&#x27;t gum up the razor like regular foam does.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The razor stick itself is just OK.</li>
            <li>brush is just OK.</li>
            <li>perfect, simple, affordable way to start shaving this way.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love this and can&#x27;t wait to upgrade.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t gush enough lol!</li>
            <li>and I asked myself if there was a better way......</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m also able to confirm that those marketing guys at Gillette and Schick have done a number on us).</li>
            <li>I found that they cut me more than sharper blades like feather</li>
            <li>but maybe that&#x27;s because I had to apply more pressure to get the whiskers cut.</li>
            <li>My beard/skin just likes feather and wilkinson sword blades much better.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Safety Razor is Great ( Butterfly Umbrella opening ) easy to replace blades and seems very durable.</li>
            <li>Great Starter kit for new Safety Razor Users.</li>
            <li>Am I becoming my grandfather?  </li>
            <li>its a good start kit for anyone wants to get int DE shaving.</li>
            <li>With this cheap kit, I&#x27;ve probably had the best shave of my life, and that with a single edge blade.  </li>
            <li>The arko soap has a pleasant, normal soap aroma.</li>
            <li>the brush is decent, id say its excellent starter and worth the price for the shave alone, u can get better soap and brush for not that much.</li>
            <li>I like the parker-esk butterfly blade head for easy replacement.</li>
            <li>Arko soap is a popular choice on Amazon and Derby are good middle of the road blades.  </li>
            <li>The boar bristle brush was no match for a quality badger brush, and the soap stick was ok, but I needed to get the special twist container to hold it.  </li>
            <li>The device works well, the soap is easy to lather with the brush, and the blades are fine.</li>
            <li>The Arko shaving stick is pretty nice.</li>
            <li>I have to work on the technique to get faster, but for my first time, I had no cuts and a nice close, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>the brush is fine</li>
            <li>My first shave was fine, but I felt it was only as smooth as the best cartridge razor I had tried......</li>
            <li>The little razor has worked great!  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much!!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too impressed with the razor because it bends the razor and doesn&#x27;t give a great shave without cutting me.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I took my time with the shave and was happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Overall I think this is a great entry level kit.</li>
            <li>side with the light crowd.  </li>
            <li>ARKO Soap is Great (would have got 5 stars if a box &amp;#34;as shown&amp;#34; of ARKO sticks were part of kit ) only comes with 1 stick</li>
            <li>I really like it, and it made the shaving process much more enjoyable.</li>
            <li>I myself started with Sensor Excel&#x27;s and gradually got sucked into the cycle of paying more, and more for cartridges that work reasonably for a week or so, and then start to lose their edge.....</li>
            <li>I bought a small soup mug to Lather the ARKO stick ( nice soup mug for $1 at dollar store, lol ).</li>
            <li>exactly what I was looking for, even better.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I bought this kit to see if I liked shaving with a double edged safety razor, before committing and spending more money.  </li>
            <li>2 clean shaves with 3 passes/ each shave.</li>
            <li>it is not giving a clean shave as a Gillette razor.</li>
            <li>Nothing really special.</li>
            <li>This is great for a beginning wet shaver.</li>
            <li>yet good quality double edged razor.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have an extra $25 to upgrade the razor and brush, then this is a good deal.  </li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t go into this process thinking that the razor (or brush) is as good as it gets because it definitely is not.</li>
            <li>Much easier to use and much more forgiving than the razor with this kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After just one use, I really like the merkur 180, way more than the razor in this kit.</li>
            <li>Solid chrome, good brush</li>
            <li>brush is good enough</li>
            <li>So far I have liked the kit.</li>
            <li>My experience with this product with the Dorco ST300 100t blades was not bad.  </li>
            <li>Not a fan of the included razors or the soap, but the razor holder and brush are not bad.  </li>
            <li>Luckily I had an alum block to stop the bleeding.  </li>
            <li>Ordered a chrome stand to go with, looks super in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, and lathers up pretty well.</li>
            <li>The blade provided are pretty cheaply made, but what do you expect for the price?</li>
            <li>One actually said he had been looking for something like this for a long time and was very happy with it.</li>
            <li>maybe  good  for a teen ager,  not  fo rmen with large  hands</li>
            <li>Great price if you&#x27;re unsure and don&#x27;t want to waste a ton of money, and you&#x27;re getting well regarded products for your money.  </li>
            <li>Nice basic kit for trying a safety razor.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re curious about using the old-man style shaver this is a good bet.</li>
            <li>Shaving is now fun for me.</li>
            <li>if you are looking for one long term and already know you like this kind of setup, I would look elsewhere</li>
            <li>This is definitely a good starter kit for anyone who wants to get into wet shaving.</li>
            <li>Very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Showered, wet my face with warm water, and rubbed the arko stick on my face then used brush to work into a lather as intended.</li>
            <li>My total spend on all the items in this kit cost more than twice the price.  </li>
            <li>The Shaving Factory cut my face more, and left the skin sore and irritated.  </li>
            <li>this is my first safety razor purchase.</li>
            <li>it is pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely getting better with use (I have owned this set for about 3 months now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the Gillette&#x27;s, the Schick&#x27;s and most recently the Dorco razor systems....</li>
            <li>(You really don&#x27;t need a stack of 3,4,5,6,7,8, etc!).</li>
            <li>The old Gillette razor gave a more comfortable shave, and didn&#x27;t irritate the skin, and the facial cuts were pretty much non-exisitant.</li>
            <li>would certainly recommend this produce to anyone looking for am&lt;br /&gt;inexpensive</li>
            <li>The razor itself is quite nice, and certainly I think if you&#x27;re new to the whole safety razor school of shaving, you&#x27;ll likely be pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>If you want to try out DE shaving then this set will do just fine to let you decide if you want to go the traditional shaving route.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got this razor for my friend as a gift and he really like it.</li>
            <li>The razor feels cheap IF you are a current safety razor user.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Parker and Edwin Jager razors and both are much heavier.  </li>
            <li>The twist open head is not as smooth as a Parker.  </li>
            <li>REALLY like it.</li>
            <li>Also they send you some really stinky shaving soap.</li>
            <li>But I can say that I&#x27;m much happier using this than I ever was using cartridge razors.</li>
            <li>the handle doesn&#x27;t provide much grip when shaving cream gets on it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would I buy it again as a cheap replacement or recommend it for starting?</li>
            <li>i really like the handle.</li>
            <li>My shaves are so much closer than the multi-blade track razors.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think there was much there for the price</li>
            <li>I really like the brush.</li>
            <li>The brush is okay, but it feels a bit rough.</li>
            <li>The razor was better than expected.</li>
            <li>Got this as gifts for all the men in my family and they really appreciated it.</li>
            <li>I was really hesitant to use the razor again, but convinced myself that I needed to just be more careful.  </li>
            <li>I threw all of my old safety razors away a while back, (Which I deeply regret) and forgot how good they worked.</li>
            <li>Fine shaving , brought back a long lost era of fine shaving for real men</li>
            <li>I used all the blades, which were all extremely sharp, and most of the arko foam.</li>
            <li>I plan on purchasing a DE Blade sample kit (to try other blades, Feather / Wilkinson / etc.), A Razor and Brush holder ( right now they sit in Mug), A steam free Mirror ( that attaches to wall and extends with scissor arm ).</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a very cost effective way to learn how to wet shave -</li>
            <li>And I did get better, with less blood loss.  </li>
            <li>Only taking one star for the stinky brush, but might change that if I can get rid of it quickly</li>
            <li>i wouldn&#x27;t of chopped it an stuck it in a soap cup,but nonetheless it does alright on building a decent lather and</li>
            <li>This is a decent entry level kit, that is for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my most recent trip to the store left me with sticker shock</li>
            <li>I suspect if more guys tried safety razors such as this, they too would have the same opinion.  </li>
            <li>I thought this was a great price for a basic starter kit, but I was not pleased over all, as I had already puchased a Feather Popular razor and badger brush for my previous first investment in wet shaving.</li>
            <li>High quality components.  </li>
            <li>Good investment for someone with a tough beard.</li>
            <li>After a shower, a few strokes of the Arko soap directly by rubbing the stick into my stubble with the warm, wet brush produces a rich lather.  </li>
            <li>well this is my first double blade and was going to go the straight razor route</li>
            <li>but now i stopped using a shave soap and use normal foam to save time.</li>
            <li>The cylinder shaped cream is cheap and from a foreign country.</li>
            <li>I snagged a couple of times on my neck but as my hands were new to this</li>
            <li>Today I tried my new Merker 180 with the derby blade.</li>
            <li>New generation.  </li>
            <li>New word...</li>
            <li>A new Derby blade mounted into the razor</li>
            <li>Tried a few different ones before I found one I liked.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t disappointed but wondered whether this was the best that I could do with the new system.  </li>
            <li>I am new to world of safety razors and so many reviews of the nicer more expensive razors seem to be so point, counterpoint that I just decided to start with something basic.  </li>
            <li>My first shave left my skin feeling softer and smoother than the Gillette Fusion does.</li>
            <li>First time user of a double edge razor.</li>
            <li>This was my first foray into the world of double edge shaving.</li>
            <li>This is my first safety razor and I have to say that I won&#x27;t be going back to multi blade razors.</li>
            <li>I have been  used to using a  single edge straight razor,  and when I open the parcel,  and see the flimsy loose  gearing  clasp assembly that holds the  blade,  the  brush is  cute,  and</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell this is the cheapest you can get with the items you will need to give this style of shaving a try</li>
            <li>one day he wished he had one of the old fashioned shaving kits.  </li>
            <li>The distance between the blade and the razor was wider than the old Gillette travel razor that I already owned.  </li>
            <li>This product would be great for men with thin facial hair or women with facial hair.</li>
            <li>It is a cheap started kit, and I have used it a few times.</li>
            <li>the angle you hold the safety razor relative to your face is incredibly important, and I likely didn&#x27;t have the correct one when shaving initially.  </li>
            <li>The brush feels cheap, I&#x27;m not sure if the brush is natural (boar or badger)</li>
            <li>Of course don&#x27;t expect the razor to last forever but its a decent starter.</li>
            <li>likely will use this for a little while and upgrade to one of the name brands that folks talk about, but if you&#x27;re wondering what safety razors are all about and want to experience the best shave a man really can get, you could do a lot worse than spend $20 on this system (....and throwing those other systems into the trash!)</li>
            <li>Buying the &amp;#34;higher quality&amp;#34; versions of any of these things that come in the shave set can be very expensive, so this is a great way to figure out if using a safety razor is for you.</li>
            <li>but at what I paid I am not naive enough to order a burger and expect filet mignon.</li>
            <li>using the butterfly mechanism is easy, but be careful as the blades are incredibly sharp.  </li>
            <li>It does dry your face out a bit, so I would also recommend a gentle moisturizer or balm after shaving.</li>
            <li>i think the razor sticks out a little more on one side than the other</li>
            <li>However the brush is cheap and the bristles are extremely ridged and rough.</li>
            <li>finally, the lather brush seems decent enough,able to hold water well enough though I believe it is a boar brush,would of prefered a badger brush,but again,good for what you pay for and are getting.</li>
            <li>I use it every day only cut myself once so far</li>
            <li>THE BRUSH HAS A VERY NOTICEABLE, OVERPOWERING GAMEY SMELL WHEN WET.</li>
            <li>also it is making my skin very rough.&lt;br /&gt;the shaving cream is not foaming as expected</li>
            <li>far, I&#x27;ve only used the system twice</li>
            <li>very well.you may not get the closest shave due to how the blade sit in the razor.</li>
            <li>After reading up on technique a little bit, I gave it a try for the first time today.</li>
            <li>I had purchased this kit as my first foray into wet shaving, I&#x27;m not sure I would be as much of a devotee as I am today.  </li>
            <li>brush is ok ,a little stiff for my liking or would have given overall rating of 5.</li>

            <li> Good quality and excellent price for all those thinking of using a safety razor.</li>
            <li> Perfect price for a good shave.</li>
            <li> The Arko shave soap is great stuff</li>
            <li> Its a great kit for the price.</li>
            <li> However, if $20 bucks is all you have to spend, it is a great value.  </li>
            <li> this is a great way to start.</li>
            <li> The blades worked great, but I haven&#x27;t tried any others yet</li>
            <li> What this photo does not show is the great case the razor came in .</li>
            <li> but besides that its a great buy ..</li>
            <li> Brush works great</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price.</li>
            <li> The price is great for what u get.the arko soap lather</li>
            <li> the price, this is a great value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li> but he was happy.</li>
            <li> But a great purchase for someone just wanting to try out a DE razor.</li>
            <li> The soap is great - You don&#x27;t need a mug or anything.</li>
            <li> This is not just great as a started kit</li>
            <li> The brush works great and the arko is great.  </li>
            <li> it works great on my face and my head</li>
            <li> This kit is great for the price and works like a charm.</li>
            <li> the shaver is very nice</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy to report that the shave was awesome, incredibly close, smooth and no nicks.  </li>
            <li> Best shave of my life, way better than when I was using a 4-blade razor.</li>
            <li> Awesome, so glad I made the leap.</li>
            <li> The brush is good.</li>
            <li> Over all good kit.  </li>
            <li> Like others have said, this is a  good intro to DE shaving.</li>
            <li> Razor handle seems like it was built well and will hold up, Razor&#x27;s are of a good quility but can be alittle agressive</li>
            <li> The shaving brush is good for beginners</li>
            <li> Good choice.</li>
            <li> Bought 2 of these ( One as a Birthday Gift for Father in Law, who has used SR&#x27;s for over 40 years and loved this kit ).</li>
            <li> Derby Blades are good</li>
            <li> Good quality razor ,</li>
            <li> Good beginner set.</li>
            <li> The razor has flaws but it&#x27;s a good price if you want to give DE a try.</li>
            <li> Being a newbie with these razors, the weight felt good in my hand</li>
            <li> the price the set is a good way to decide without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li> but this soap is Great and Lathers up very easy, smells great and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all ( Most soaps or shaving creams do irritate my skin ).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good price for a nice starter kit, I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone looking to dump their cartridge razors.</li>
            <li> The handle is weighted quite nicely for the price, and the brush is good for a beginners brush.</li>
            <li> I love the rest of it!</li>
            <li> Now I have a shaving bowl, stand, more soap and a badger brush as well!</li>
            <li> Excellent product everything came promptly and was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> The 10 pack of blades was a nice addition if you shave a lot.</li>
            <li> I liked the derby blades that came with the kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice starter razor for anyone intersed in this style of shaving.</li>
            <li> Nice shave, soap smells nice.</li>
            <li> Nice price, would buy again.</li>
            <li> The silo doors work perfectly and it has decent weight and build quality.</li>
            <li> The brush is excellent to start with, and the razor handle is high quality.</li>
            <li> Sure, it&#x27;s not the Rolls Royce of safety razors, and is perhaps more of a Toyota, but for an entry level system the price can&#x27;t be beat and from an esthetics stand point it looks quite good.  </li>
            <li> The soap works best if you apply it directly to your face, then use the brush to make a lather.</li>
            <li> Works well - much better than the plastic store kind.</li>
            <li> Very nice well worth the money...</li>
            <li> I also really enjoy the smell of the Arko soap, very mild but much more pleasant than canned gels.</li>
            <li> The razor is okay, and works well.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit as an entry into safety razors, and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I love the butterfly handle and the brush.  </li>
            <li> ,  the  Blades  are  ok,  I thought this might be  better quality,  I must say NO ,</li>
            <li> Love tha Arko soap and the boar brush.</li>
            <li> This is where I noticed a discrepancy in what many reviews state.</li>
            <li> And remember,when it comes to shaving soaps,gels,creams and razors,it&#x27;s all about preference,so play around with different brands to see what works best for you.</li>
            <li> but the handle should have more heft.  </li>
            <li> He was so pleased.</li>
            <li> the soap is ok and the razors don&#x27;t for in the case</li>
            <li> I was considering getting a safety razor but wasn&#x27;t sure I would like shaving this way.  </li>
            <li> Take my word for it, all the newer type multi-blade razors are way better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure he will love it .</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d probably invest in a better brush</li>
            <li> safety razor is okay...</li>
            <li> but this has more of a safety on it.&lt;br /&gt;Somehow</li>
            <li> More blade need to be exposed.</li>
            <li> i wasnt sure how i would like it</li>
            <li> the blades were ok</li>
            <li> but i got some better ones from my barber.</li>
            <li> I did like the Derby blades, however, and count Arko as my favorite go to for shave soap.</li>
            <li> The thing I like best about it is that it doesn&#x27;t gum up the razor like regular foam does.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The razor stick itself is just OK.</li>
            <li> brush is just OK.</li>
            <li> perfect, simple, affordable way to start shaving this way.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love this and can&#x27;t wait to upgrade.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t gush enough lol!</li>
            <li> and I asked myself if there was a better way......</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m also able to confirm that those marketing guys at Gillette and Schick have done a number on us).</li>
            <li> I found that they cut me more than sharper blades like feather</li>
            <li> but maybe that&#x27;s because I had to apply more pressure to get the whiskers cut.</li>
            <li> My beard/skin just likes feather and wilkinson sword blades much better.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Safety Razor is Great ( Butterfly Umbrella opening ) easy to replace blades and seems very durable.</li>
            <li> Great Starter kit for new Safety Razor Users.</li>
            <li> Am I becoming my grandfather?  </li>
            <li> its a good start kit for anyone wants to get int DE shaving.</li>
            <li> With this cheap kit, I&#x27;ve probably had the best shave of my life, and that with a single edge blade.  </li>
            <li> The arko soap has a pleasant, normal soap aroma.</li>
            <li> the brush is decent, id say its excellent starter and worth the price for the shave alone, u can get better soap and brush for not that much.</li>
            <li> I like the parker-esk butterfly blade head for easy replacement.</li>
            <li> Arko soap is a popular choice on Amazon and Derby are good middle of the road blades.  </li>
            <li> The boar bristle brush was no match for a quality badger brush, and the soap stick was ok, but I needed to get the special twist container to hold it.  </li>
            <li> The device works well, the soap is easy to lather with the brush, and the blades are fine.</li>
            <li> The Arko shaving stick is pretty nice.</li>
            <li> I have to work on the technique to get faster, but for my first time, I had no cuts and a nice close, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> the brush is fine</li>
            <li> My first shave was fine, but I felt it was only as smooth as the best cartridge razor I had tried......</li>
            <li> The little razor has worked great!  </li>
            <li> Thank you very much!!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too impressed with the razor because it bends the razor and doesn&#x27;t give a great shave without cutting me.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I took my time with the shave and was happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Overall I think this is a great entry level kit.</li>
            <li> side with the light crowd.  </li>
            <li> ARKO Soap is Great (would have got 5 stars if a box &amp;#34;as shown&amp;#34; of ARKO sticks were part of kit ) only comes with 1 stick</li>
            <li> I really like it, and it made the shaving process much more enjoyable.</li>
            <li> I myself started with Sensor Excel&#x27;s and gradually got sucked into the cycle of paying more, and more for cartridges that work reasonably for a week or so, and then start to lose their edge.....</li>
            <li> I bought a small soup mug to Lather the ARKO stick ( nice soup mug for $1 at dollar store, lol ).</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for, even better.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit to see if I liked shaving with a double edged safety razor, before committing and spending more money.  </li>
            <li> 2 clean shaves with 3 passes/ each shave.</li>
            <li> it is not giving a clean shave as a Gillette razor.</li>
            <li> Nothing really special.</li>
            <li> This is great for a beginning wet shaver.</li>
            <li> yet good quality double edged razor.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have an extra $25 to upgrade the razor and brush, then this is a good deal.  </li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t go into this process thinking that the razor (or brush) is as good as it gets because it definitely is not.</li>
            <li> Much easier to use and much more forgiving than the razor with this kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After just one use, I really like the merkur 180, way more than the razor in this kit.</li>
            <li> Solid chrome, good brush</li>
            <li> brush is good enough</li>
            <li> So far I have liked the kit.</li>
            <li> My experience with this product with the Dorco ST300 100t blades was not bad.  </li>
            <li> Not a fan of the included razors or the soap, but the razor holder and brush are not bad.  </li>
            <li> Luckily I had an alum block to stop the bleeding.  </li>
            <li> Ordered a chrome stand to go with, looks super in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, and lathers up pretty well.</li>
            <li> The blade provided are pretty cheaply made, but what do you expect for the price?</li>
            <li> One actually said he had been looking for something like this for a long time and was very happy with it.</li>
            <li> maybe  good  for a teen ager,  not  fo rmen with large  hands</li>
            <li> Great price if you&#x27;re unsure and don&#x27;t want to waste a ton of money, and you&#x27;re getting well regarded products for your money.  </li>
            <li> Nice basic kit for trying a safety razor.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re curious about using the old-man style shaver this is a good bet.</li>
            <li> Shaving is now fun for me.</li>
            <li> if you are looking for one long term and already know you like this kind of setup, I would look elsewhere</li>
            <li> This is definitely a good starter kit for anyone who wants to get into wet shaving.</li>
            <li> Very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Showered, wet my face with warm water, and rubbed the arko stick on my face then used brush to work into a lather as intended.</li>
            <li> My total spend on all the items in this kit cost more than twice the price.  </li>
            <li> The Shaving Factory cut my face more, and left the skin sore and irritated.  </li>
            <li> this is my first safety razor purchase.</li>
            <li> it is pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely getting better with use (I have owned this set for about 3 months now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Gillette&#x27;s, the Schick&#x27;s and most recently the Dorco razor systems....</li>
            <li> (You really don&#x27;t need a stack of 3,4,5,6,7,8, etc!).</li>
            <li> The old Gillette razor gave a more comfortable shave, and didn&#x27;t irritate the skin, and the facial cuts were pretty much non-exisitant.</li>
            <li> would certainly recommend this produce to anyone looking for am&lt;br /&gt;inexpensive</li>
            <li> The razor itself is quite nice, and certainly I think if you&#x27;re new to the whole safety razor school of shaving, you&#x27;ll likely be pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> If you want to try out DE shaving then this set will do just fine to let you decide if you want to go the traditional shaving route.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got this razor for my friend as a gift and he really like it.</li>
            <li> The razor feels cheap IF you are a current safety razor user.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Parker and Edwin Jager razors and both are much heavier.  </li>
            <li> The twist open head is not as smooth as a Parker.  </li>
            <li> REALLY like it.</li>
            <li> Also they send you some really stinky shaving soap.</li>
            <li> But I can say that I&#x27;m much happier using this than I ever was using cartridge razors.</li>
            <li> the handle doesn&#x27;t provide much grip when shaving cream gets on it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would I buy it again as a cheap replacement or recommend it for starting?</li>
            <li> i really like the handle.</li>
            <li> My shaves are so much closer than the multi-blade track razors.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think there was much there for the price</li>
            <li> I really like the brush.</li>
            <li> The brush is okay, but it feels a bit rough.</li>
            <li> The razor was better than expected.</li>
            <li> Got this as gifts for all the men in my family and they really appreciated it.</li>
            <li> I was really hesitant to use the razor again, but convinced myself that I needed to just be more careful.  </li>
            <li> I threw all of my old safety razors away a while back, (Which I deeply regret) and forgot how good they worked.</li>
            <li> Fine shaving , brought back a long lost era of fine shaving for real men</li>
            <li> I used all the blades, which were all extremely sharp, and most of the arko foam.</li>
            <li> I plan on purchasing a DE Blade sample kit (to try other blades, Feather / Wilkinson / etc.), A Razor and Brush holder ( right now they sit in Mug), A steam free Mirror ( that attaches to wall and extends with scissor arm ).</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a very cost effective way to learn how to wet shave -</li>
            <li> And I did get better, with less blood loss.  </li>
            <li> Only taking one star for the stinky brush, but might change that if I can get rid of it quickly</li>
            <li> i wouldn&#x27;t of chopped it an stuck it in a soap cup,but nonetheless it does alright on building a decent lather and</li>
            <li> This is a decent entry level kit, that is for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my most recent trip to the store left me with sticker shock</li>
            <li> I suspect if more guys tried safety razors such as this, they too would have the same opinion.  </li>
            <li> I thought this was a great price for a basic starter kit, but I was not pleased over all, as I had already puchased a Feather Popular razor and badger brush for my previous first investment in wet shaving.</li>
            <li> High quality components.  </li>
            <li> Good investment for someone with a tough beard.</li>
            <li> After a shower, a few strokes of the Arko soap directly by rubbing the stick into my stubble with the warm, wet brush produces a rich lather.  </li>
            <li> well this is my first double blade and was going to go the straight razor route</li>
            <li> but now i stopped using a shave soap and use normal foam to save time.</li>
            <li> The cylinder shaped cream is cheap and from a foreign country.</li>
            <li> I snagged a couple of times on my neck but as my hands were new to this</li>
            <li> Today I tried my new Merker 180 with the derby blade.</li>
            <li> New generation.  </li>
            <li> New word...</li>
            <li> A new Derby blade mounted into the razor</li>
            <li> Tried a few different ones before I found one I liked.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t disappointed but wondered whether this was the best that I could do with the new system.  </li>
            <li> I am new to world of safety razors and so many reviews of the nicer more expensive razors seem to be so point, counterpoint that I just decided to start with something basic.  </li>
            <li> My first shave left my skin feeling softer and smoother than the Gillette Fusion does.</li>
            <li> First time user of a double edge razor.</li>
            <li> This was my first foray into the world of double edge shaving.</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor and I have to say that I won&#x27;t be going back to multi blade razors.</li>
            <li> I have been  used to using a  single edge straight razor,  and when I open the parcel,  and see the flimsy loose  gearing  clasp assembly that holds the  blade,  the  brush is  cute,  and</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell this is the cheapest you can get with the items you will need to give this style of shaving a try</li>
            <li> one day he wished he had one of the old fashioned shaving kits.  </li>
            <li> The distance between the blade and the razor was wider than the old Gillette travel razor that I already owned.  </li>
            <li> This product would be great for men with thin facial hair or women with facial hair.</li>
            <li> It is a cheap started kit, and I have used it a few times.</li>
            <li> the angle you hold the safety razor relative to your face is incredibly important, and I likely didn&#x27;t have the correct one when shaving initially.  </li>
            <li> The brush feels cheap, I&#x27;m not sure if the brush is natural (boar or badger)</li>
            <li> Of course don&#x27;t expect the razor to last forever but its a decent starter.</li>
            <li> likely will use this for a little while and upgrade to one of the name brands that folks talk about, but if you&#x27;re wondering what safety razors are all about and want to experience the best shave a man really can get, you could do a lot worse than spend $20 on this system (....and throwing those other systems into the trash!)</li>
            <li> Buying the &amp;#34;higher quality&amp;#34; versions of any of these things that come in the shave set can be very expensive, so this is a great way to figure out if using a safety razor is for you.</li>
            <li> but at what I paid I am not naive enough to order a burger and expect filet mignon.</li>
            <li> using the butterfly mechanism is easy, but be careful as the blades are incredibly sharp.  </li>
            <li> It does dry your face out a bit, so I would also recommend a gentle moisturizer or balm after shaving.</li>
            <li> i think the razor sticks out a little more on one side than the other</li>
            <li> However the brush is cheap and the bristles are extremely ridged and rough.</li>
            <li> finally, the lather brush seems decent enough,able to hold water well enough though I believe it is a boar brush,would of prefered a badger brush,but again,good for what you pay for and are getting.</li>
            <li> I use it every day only cut myself once so far</li>
            <li> THE BRUSH HAS A VERY NOTICEABLE, OVERPOWERING GAMEY SMELL WHEN WET.</li>
            <li> also it is making my skin very rough.&lt;br /&gt;the shaving cream is not foaming as expected</li>
            <li> far, I&#x27;ve only used the system twice</li>
            <li> very well.you may not get the closest shave due to how the blade sit in the razor.</li>
            <li> After reading up on technique a little bit, I gave it a try for the first time today.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this kit as my first foray into wet shaving, I&#x27;m not sure I would be as much of a devotee as I am today.  </li>
            <li> brush is ok ,a little stiff for my liking or would have given overall rating of 5.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say if they&#x27;re better or worse than other types of blades.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really go wrong if you want to dip  your feet into double edge shaving without a huge investment.</li>
            <li> my bathroom looking like a scene from american psycho and me being the victim didn&#x27;t appeal to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the double edged safety razor has made a come back, and after reading the experience of other guys and doing some research online, I decided to spend $20 on this kit instead of $40 on cartridge razor refils.&lt;br /&gt;Thus</li>
            <li> Prep of your facial hair prior to cutting is important with safety razors and there is a lot of advice</li>
            <li> , I should of spent the extra money and got a quality razor.  </li>
            <li> I could no longer find generic replacements for my cartridge razor, so I decided to try wet shaving with a safety razor.</li>
            <li> I recommend to anyone just starting SR wet shaving.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up buying a merkur long handled razor</li>
            <li> Only draw backs are, it doesn&#x27;t give a extremely close shave b/c you are not supposed to shave against the grain, and it is very time consuming, and when you need to shave in a hurry that is not a good thing.</li>
            <li> because there is nothing wrong with the product per se, I just got a wild hair to go back to the old safety razors</li>
            <li> but when I used it, it left a big hole in the center of the brush and applying the soap felt stiff.  </li>
            <li> I got a pack of 100 blades of the same brand, and they are very sharp compared to the ones included in this set.</li>
            <li> Some say it&#x27;s too rough.  </li>
            <li> I like it rough.  </li>
            <li> Ordered this kit to give the &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; safety razor wet shaving method a try.</li>
            <li> Because of the lighter weight, it was harder to shave with.  </li>
            <li> Just kidding but not really.</li>
            <li> i mean nothing beats and old fashioned razor shave, and this set delivers well.  </li>
            <li> i used it the other day....</li>
            <li> , I grew up knowing no better,  having seen my father use those blue disposable razors.  </li>
            <li> This sytem has cut cost down a lot.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it turned my face into a bloody mess with numerous small nicks, and a couple of larger ones.</li>
            <li> Its consistency is chalky and bland.</li>
            <li> the only thing is that you have to shave slow and not go to fast, so you dont end up cutting</li>
            <li> soap was useless for me, left my face really dry.</li>
            <li> The blades are a bit harsh.</li>
            <li> so it was messy as well.</li>
            <li> i bought this set because i was tired of razor burn from cartrige razors i am empressed with the double edge safety razor i do not burn my face</li>
            <li> The blades seem a little bit dull compared to other blades.</li>
            <li> It was pretty bad.</li>
            <li> It gets a little gunked up, and is sometimes hard to rinse out.</li>
            <li> this butterfly safety razor was really hard to use, unforgiving and prone to cut.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was defective, or just hard to use.</li>
            <li> it was drying and hard to get foamy</li>
            <li> I did some reading and found that this is somewhat common</li>
            <li> Came late and broke.</li>
            <li> Brush sucks everything else ROCKS!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on some medication that results in my skin being very, very sensitive and resulted in very bad razor burn and razor bumps when using a 5 blade razor.</li>
            <li> The razor is really awful, much too aggressive for me, nor did I care for the scratchy brush.</li>
            <li> Changed my shaving game, without a doubt.</li>
            <li> so my comments should not be used to base the usage on shaving other areas.</li>
            <li> I blame merely myself.  </li>
            <li> Difficult</li>
            <li> I think it means mediocre.</li>
            <li> So I got tired of buying cartridges and went for it!</li>
            <li> Gentlemen, those adverts claim that the expensive cartridge razors are &amp;#34;....</li>
            <li> and it was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> and I end up cutting myself.</li>
            <li> There seems to be a bit of a learning curve here as I am still cutting myself</li>
            <li> cut my face up badly.</li>
            <li> and i used to get it bad.</li>
            <li> Arko soap was drying and smelled horrible, I used it once and threw it out.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This shaving set can get you using a safety razor affordably. The lather is lathery, the shave brush is brushy, and the razor is quite functional. Buying the &amp;#34;higher quality&amp;#34; versions of any of these things that come in the shave set can be very expensive, so this is a great way to figure out if using a safety razor is for you.</li>
            <li> I got this razor for my friend as a gift and he really like it. He likes the blade it takes longer to use....I recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I ordered this kit based on the price.  The razor is okay, and works well. The 10 pack of blades was a nice addition if you shave a lot. However the brush is cheap and the bristles are extremely ridged and rough. The cylinder shaped cream is cheap and from a foreign country. Its consistency is chalky and bland. I tossed everything but the razor and extra blades. Should have just got those.</li>
            <li> Like the razor.  The brush is good. Some say it&#x27;s too rough.  I like it rough.  The blades are a bit harsh. Tried a few different ones before I found one I liked.  The Arko soap smells Manly.  But it&#x27;s not for everyone.  Over all good kit.  I&#x27;d buy again</li>
            <li> its a good start kit for anyone wants to get int DE shaving. The Arko shave soap is great stuff got a box for the rest of the year.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit as an entry into safety razors, and I absolutely love it. My first shave left my skin feeling softer and smoother than the Gillette Fusion does. I also really enjoy the smell of the Arko soap, very mild but much more pleasant than canned gels. Overall, this is a very cost effective way to learn how to wet shave - I am sold on the idea. This is how shaving ought to be.</li>
            <li> I use it every day only cut myself once so far but that was because I was rushing. I can see using this from here on out.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the soap, but I love the rest of it! Best shave of my life, way better than when I was using a 4-blade razor.</li>
            <li> got it for my husband and he says that it gets a close shave and reduces razer burn  all together</li>
            <li> As I have been looking to replace my routine with a double edge blade, I had finally decided to go with a starter kit.  I am new to world of safety razors and so many reviews of the nicer more expensive razors seem to be so point, counterpoint that I just decided to start with something basic.  My experience with this product with the Dorco ST300 100t blades was not bad.  I snagged a couple of times on my neck but as my hands were new to this I blame merely myself.  I love the butterfly handle and the brush.  Something about it harkens my mind back to when I was a kid watching my grandfather shave.  The smell of the shaving soap was reminiscent as well.  Am I becoming my grandfather?  I will not go back to disposable razors!</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband and he loves it. The best shave he&#x27;s had in years. Good investment for someone with a tough beard.</li>
            <li> I have been  used to using a  single edge straight razor,  and when I open the parcel,  and see the flimsy loose  gearing  clasp assembly that holds the  blade,  the  brush is  cute,  and maybe  good  for a teen ager,  not  fo rmen with large  hands,  the  Blades  are  ok,  I thought this might be  better quality,  I must say NO ,</li>
            <li> This is a great starter kit, all the items are excellent. Love tha Arko soap and the boar brush.</li>
            <li> Perfect starter kit, has everything you need to shave like a sir. The brush is excellent to start with, and the razor handle is high quality.</li>
            <li> Like others have said, this is a  good intro to DE shaving. Its a great kit for the price. Razor Blades are inexpensive also compared to cartridges.</li>
            <li> Ordered this kit to give the &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; safety razor wet shaving method a try. After reading up on technique a little bit, I gave it a try for the first time today. Showered, wet my face with warm water, and rubbed the arko stick on my face then used brush to work into a lather as intended. This is where I noticed a discrepancy in what many reviews state. The arko soap has a pleasant, normal soap aroma. THE BRUSH HAS A VERY NOTICEABLE, OVERPOWERING GAMEY SMELL WHEN WET. I did some reading and found that this is somewhat common and I&#x27;m currently soaking it in dish soap/vinegar solution, we&#x27;ll see how it works. Overall, I took my time with the shave and was happy with the results. I have to work on the technique to get faster, but for my first time, I had no cuts and a nice close, comfortable shave. Overall I think this is a great entry level kit. Great price if you&#x27;re unsure and don&#x27;t want to waste a ton of money, and you&#x27;re getting well regarded products for your money.  Only taking one star for the stinky brush, but might change that if I can get rid of it quickly</li>
            <li> First time user of a double edge razor. Was just what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;I would certainly recommend this produce to anyone looking for am&lt;br /&gt;inexpensive yet good quality double edged razor.</li>
            <li> I decided to change to this because I would go through a razor a week.  This sytem has cut cost down a lot.</li>
            <li> that was a present and exactly what I was looking for, even better. I made my friend very happy. I will recommended to any body because is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a good starter kit for anyone who wants to get into wet shaving. As far as I can tell this is the cheapest you can get with the items you will need to give this style of shaving a try but I would recommend if that if you decide to stick with it,buy a stand for your lather brush and razor. Razor handle seems like it was built well and will hold up, Razor&#x27;s are of a good quility but can be alittle agressive so you may want to switch to a different brand,shaving soap is alright,not the best but not the worst, Had I known it&#x27;s a type you apply an lathing on your face,i wouldn&#x27;t of chopped it an stuck it in a soap cup,but nonetheless it does alright on building a decent lather and finally, the lather brush seems decent enough,able to hold water well enough though I believe it is a boar brush,would of prefered a badger brush,but again,good for what you pay for and are getting. Over all This is the cheapest set up I&#x27;ve found so far that will give you a idea of what wet shaving is all about and if you don&#x27;t like it,least you didn&#x27;t pay a butt load of money like some of the kits I&#x27;ve found were. And remember,when it comes to shaving soaps,gels,creams and razors,it&#x27;s all about preference,so play around with different brands to see what works best for you.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive introduction to safety razors.  I purchased this kit for my wife who kept using my razor.  I like the parker-esk butterfly blade head for easy replacement. Arko soap is a popular choice on Amazon and Derby are good middle of the road blades.  The brush feels cheap, I&#x27;m not sure if the brush is natural (boar or badger) but when I used it, it left a big hole in the center of the brush and applying the soap felt stiff.  I read the reviews for this razor with reviewers arguing back and forth about the weight of the razor and I side with the light crowd.  The razor feels cheap IF you are a current safety razor user.  I&#x27;ve used Parker and Edwin Jager razors and both are much heavier.  Not just the head but the handle should have more heft.  The twist open head is not as smooth as a Parker.  Because of the lighter weight, it was harder to shave with.  I&#x27;ve gotten use to using just the weight of the razor to apply pressure against my skin and with this razor I had to apply extra pressure to ensure a close shave. .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had purchased this kit as my first foray into wet shaving, I&#x27;m not sure I would be as much of a devotee as I am today.  However, if $20 bucks is all you have to spend, it is a great value.  My total spend on all the items in this kit cost more than twice the price.  If you don&#x27;t have an extra $25 to upgrade the razor and brush, then this is a good deal.  You will eventually upgrade if you stick with it.  Just don&#x27;t go into this process thinking that the razor (or brush) is as good as it gets because it definitely is not.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit to see if I liked shaving with a double edged safety razor, before committing and spending more money.  The first time I used it, it turned my face into a bloody mess with numerous small nicks, and a couple of larger ones. It was pretty bad. Luckily I had an alum block to stop the bleeding.  I was really hesitant to use the razor again, but convinced myself that I needed to just be more careful.  And I did get better, with less blood loss.  What I found was this butterfly safety razor was really hard to use, unforgiving and prone to cut. I don&#x27;t know if it was defective, or just hard to use. The boar bristle brush was no match for a quality badger brush, and the soap stick was ok, but I needed to get the special twist container to hold it.  I liked the derby blades that came with the kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got an Art of Shaving - Sandalwood kit for Christmas. I really like it, and it made the shaving process much more enjoyable. Today I tried my new Merker 180 with the derby blade. REALLY like it. Much easier to use and much more forgiving than the razor with this kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In retrospect, I should of spent the extra money and got a quality razor.  After just one use, I really like the merkur 180, way more than the razor in this kit.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my brother for Christmas.  He remembers our Grandfather, we called him Dad, using this.  It held very pleasant memories for him and me.  He made a comment one day he wished he had one of the old fashioned shaving kits.  I went to Amazon and found this.  He was so pleased.</li>
            <li> the shaver and the case are the best part of the deal. the soap is ok and the razors don&#x27;t for in the case the brush is decent, id say its excellent starter and worth the price for the shave alone, u can get better soap and brush for not that much. id say id buy it again</li>
            <li> I was considering getting a safety razor but wasn&#x27;t sure I would like shaving this way.  The I found this and thought how can I lose? For 20 bucks I&#x27;ll risk it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it! Great shave, razor works great, great starter kit!  Now I have a shaving bowl, stand, more soap and a badger brush as well! I won&#x27;t go back. The little razor has worked great!  And I have only two razor blades out of the 10 it comes with.  I have had it for around 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are thinking about safety razor shaving this is a great way to start.</li>
            <li> Difficult because there is nothing wrong with the product per se, I just got a wild hair to go back to the old safety razors and it was a disappointment. Take my word for it, all the newer type multi-blade razors are way better. This thing cut the heck out of my face. Also they send you some really stinky shaving soap. I went back to my Mach 3 razors.</li>
            <li> Like a couple of the reviews above, I decided to get this kit to try out double-edge shaving. I was not disappointed. The handle feels sturdy, I like the twist-to-open style. The blades worked great, but I haven&#x27;t tried any others yet so I can&#x27;t say if they&#x27;re better or worse than other types of blades. But I can say that I&#x27;m much happier using this than I ever was using cartridge razors. It&#x27;s a good price for a nice starter kit, I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone looking to dump their cartridge razors.</li>
            <li> A christmas gift for my son - in law I&#x27;m sure he will love it . What this photo does not show is the great case the razor came in .</li>
            <li> The shaving brush is good for beginners but I&#x27;d probably invest in a better brush eventually.&lt;br /&gt;The shaving stick smells like household cleaners, but does a wonderful job when used with a shaving oil.&lt;br /&gt;The safety razor is okay...the handle doesn&#x27;t provide much grip when shaving cream gets on it and I end up cutting myself.</li>
            <li> Excellent product everything came promptly and was exactly as advertised. I would recommend this product to anyone. Thank you very much!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice starter razor for anyone intersed in this style of shaving. My only problem is the hadle on the brush cracked.</li>
            <li> well this is my first double blade and was going to go the straight razor route but this has more of a safety on it.&lt;br /&gt;Somehow my bathroom looking like a scene from american psycho and me being the victim didn&#x27;t appeal to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow back to the product, it works and does the intended result. There seems to be a bit of a learning curve here as I am still cutting myself but I think it is bc the blades aren&#x27;t the greatest unsurprisingly. Nor is the brush, razor, etc but at what I paid I am not naive enough to order a burger and expect filet mignon. Still it delivers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy it again as a cheap replacement or recommend it for starting? Probably.&lt;br /&gt;But if you are looking for one long term and already know you like this kind of setup, I would look elsewhere</li>
            <li> Like the kit at the price versus the more expensive ones.  I wanted to get back into using these types of shavers again, but didnt want to spend big money just yet, so I went with this kit.  Good choice.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas present for my boyfriend. He likes the razor. Haven&#x27;t used the soap as of yet, but the razor is doing well.</li>
            <li> the shaver is very nice i used it the other day.... the only thing is that you have to shave slow and not go to fast, so you dont end up cutting you&#x27;re self... but besides that its a great buy .. for now..</li>
            <li> Just what I ordered. I could no longer find generic replacements for my cartridge razor, so I decided to try wet shaving with a safety razor. I did not want to spend a lot of money, so I found this kit. The device works well, the soap is easy to lather with the brush, and the blades are fine. The soap works best if you apply it directly to your face, then use the brush to make a lather. It does dry your face out a bit, so I would also recommend a gentle moisturizer or balm after shaving.</li>
            <li> Excellent kit. Recommend for any one!</li>
            <li> Bought 2 of these ( One as a Birthday Gift for Father in Law, who has used SR&#x27;s for over 40 years and loved this kit ). Great Starter kit for new Safety Razor Users. I recommend to anyone just starting SR wet shaving. Safety Razor is Great ( Butterfly Umbrella opening ) easy to replace blades and seems very durable. Derby Blades are good ( I have not tried others yet ) 2 clean shaves with 3 passes/ each shave. Brush works great (have not tried others yet ) holds lather and spreads evenly across face. ARKO Soap is Great (would have got 5 stars if a box &amp;#34;as shown&amp;#34; of ARKO sticks were part of kit ) only comes with 1 stick but this soap is Great and Lathers up very easy, smells great and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all ( Most soaps or shaving creams do irritate my skin ). I bought a small soup mug to Lather the ARKO stick ( nice soup mug for $1 at dollar store, lol ). I plan on purchasing a DE Blade sample kit (to try other blades, Feather / Wilkinson / etc.), A Razor and Brush holder ( right now they sit in Mug), A steam free Mirror ( that attaches to wall and extends with scissor arm ). Over All Great Starter Kit for a Great Price!</li>
            <li> High quality components.  Very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Awsome product. Good quality and excellent price for all those thinking of using a safety razor.</li>
            <li> handle started to corrode after a year of use.  soap was useless for me, left my face really dry.</li>
            <li> Works well - much better than the plastic store kind.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t complain. Great product for a great price.</li>
            <li> Came late and broke. Next time definetly spending the extra$$ for  quality. Swiss, american, german, yes China, Mexico, Pakistan no</li>
            <li> The distance between the blade and the razor was wider than the old Gillette travel razor that I already owned.  The Shaving Factory cut my face more, and left the skin sore and irritated.  The old Gillette razor gave a more comfortable shave, and didn&#x27;t irritate the skin, and the facial cuts were pretty much non-exisitant.</li>
            <li> My son received this for Christmas.  He said it was &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34;.  New generation.  New word... I think it means mediocre.</li>
            <li> The price is great for what u get.the arko soap lather very well.you may not get the closest shave due to how the blade sit in the razor. More blade need to be exposed.</li>
            <li> i have used it twice after the purchase. it is not giving a clean shave as a Gillette razor. also it is making my skin very rough.&lt;br /&gt;the shaving cream is not foaming as expected so i have to use a lot of it.</li>
            <li> cut my face up badly. This product would be great for men with thin facial hair or women with facial hair.</li>
            <li> this is my first safety razor purchase. i wasnt sure how i would like it so i didnt want to invest a lot of money. i really like the handle. it is pretty sturdy. the blades were ok but i got some better ones from my barber. i did not like the arko soap. it was drying and hard to get foamy and i dont have a handle for it so it was messy as well. the brush is fine but now i stopped using a shave soap and use normal foam to save time. i will continue to use this razor because i dont get razor burn anymore and i used to get it bad. i think the razor sticks out a little more on one side than the other so i dont get to use both sides equally but that is not a problem to me. i would suggest this to anyone who is looking to test the waters of safety razors.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the included razors or the soap, but the razor holder and brush are not bad.  I guess I should say I use this on my face so my comments should not be used to base the usage on shaving other areas.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a great price for a basic starter kit, but I was not pleased over all, as I had already puchased a Feather Popular razor and badger brush for my previous first investment in wet shaving. The razor is really awful, much too aggressive for me, nor did I care for the scratchy brush. I did like the Derby blades, however, and count Arko as my favorite go to for shave soap.</li>
            <li> This was my first foray into the world of double edge shaving. I purchased some feather blades to go along with this set. The Arko shaving stick is pretty nice. It goes on smooth, and lathers up pretty well. I wish they made a menthol version. The thing I like best about it is that it doesn&#x27;t gum up the razor like regular foam does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor stick itself is just OK. The metal veneer on it has already started to peel, after about  4 months of regular use. This is a decent entry level kit, that is for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is just OK. It gets a little gunked up, and is sometimes hard to rinse out. It too, needs replacing after about 4 months of regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, this is a great value. You can&#x27;t really go wrong if you want to dip  your feet into double edge shaving without a huge investment.</li>
            <li> Nice basic kit for trying a safety razor. I may eventually opt for a longer handle razor, but this package still serves me well to this day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li> My shaves are so much closer than the multi-blade track razors.  I don&#x27;t see myself going back to track razors again unless it is an emergency.</li>
            <li> I picked this up to try out the safety razors and it did not disappoint.  If you&#x27;re curious about using the old-man style shaver this is a good bet.</li>
            <li> It is what my son wanted for Christmas. I didn&#x27;t think there was much there for the price but he was happy.</li>
            <li> Item as described. Delivered on time. I would refer a friend.</li>
            <li> Nice shave, soap smells nice. Nice price, would buy again. Ordered a chrome stand to go with, looks super in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> It is a cheap started kit, and I have used it a few times. If you know how to use it correctly you get a very good shave. I&#x27;m on some medication that results in my skin being very, very sensitive and resulted in very bad razor burn and razor bumps when using a 5 blade razor. Only draw backs are, it doesn&#x27;t give a extremely close shave b/c you are not supposed to shave against the grain, and it is very time consuming, and when you need to shave in a hurry that is not a good thing. I used all the blades, which were all extremely sharp, and most of the arko foam. The handle is weighted quite nicely for the price, and the brush is good for a beginners brush. Switched to disposable 2 blade razors b/c  that is what the dermatologist recommended, plus a topical antibiotic, until I get off my medication. But a great purchase for someone just wanting to try out a DE razor. Great experience!</li>
            <li> Good quality razor ,well balanced .&lt;br /&gt;the brush is ok ,a little stiff for my liking or would have given overall rating of 5.</li>
            <li> Best purchase I made this year. Fine shaving , brought back a long lost era of fine shaving for real men</li>
            <li> Good beginner set. I really like the brush. The razor has flaws but it&#x27;s a good price if you want to give DE a try.</li>
            <li> Brush sucks everything else ROCKS!</li>
            <li> This is great for a beginning wet shaver. The brush is okay, but it feels a bit rough. It&#x27;s definitely getting better with use (I have owned this set for about 3 months now. The soap is great - You don&#x27;t need a mug or anything. Just rub the stick on your face and lather it up with the brush. The razor is just a razor. Nothing really special. The blades seem a little bit dull compared to other blades. I got a pack of 100 blades of the same brand, and they are very sharp compared to the ones included in this set.</li>
            <li> Nothing, and i mean nothing beats and old fashioned razor shave, and this set delivers well.  Step back in time and try this out.</li>
            <li> perfect, simple, affordable way to start shaving this way. I&#x27;m sticking with Shaving Factory!</li>
            <li> So I got tired of buying cartridges and went for it! I am so glad I did. Shaving is now fun for me. Everything came packaged so well. I love this and can&#x27;t wait to upgrade. This is not just great as a started kit it is just great! Awesome, so glad I made the leap. I can&#x27;t gush enough lol!</li>
            <li> Very nice well worth the money... Solid chrome, good brush</li>
            <li> Gentlemen, those adverts claim that the expensive cartridge razors are &amp;#34;....the best a man can get&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;ve tried the Gillette&#x27;s, the Schick&#x27;s and most recently the Dorco razor systems....but I&#x27;m sad to say that I think we&#x27;ve been sold a lie!&lt;br /&gt;Like many guys, I grew up knowing no better,  having seen my father use those blue disposable razors.  I myself started with Sensor Excel&#x27;s and gradually got sucked into the cycle of paying more, and more for cartridges that work reasonably for a week or so, and then start to lose their edge.....my most recent trip to the store left me with sticker shock and I asked myself if there was a better way......unbeknownst to me there has been a renaissance of the razor technology my grandfathers generation used.....the double edged safety razor has made a come back, and after reading the experience of other guys and doing some research online, I decided to spend $20 on this kit instead of $40 on cartridge razor refils.&lt;br /&gt;Thus far, I&#x27;ve only used the system twice and I have to say, I&#x27;m really impressed.  (I&#x27;m also able to confirm that those marketing guys at Gillette and Schick have done a number on us). With this cheap kit, I&#x27;ve probably had the best shave of my life, and that with a single edge blade.  (You really don&#x27;t need a stack of 3,4,5,6,7,8, etc!). Prep of your facial hair prior to cutting is important with safety razors and there is a lot of advice online so you become accustomed to the process.  After a shower, a few strokes of the Arko soap directly by rubbing the stick into my stubble with the warm, wet brush produces a rich lather.  A new Derby blade mounted into the razor using the butterfly mechanism is easy, but be careful as the blades are incredibly sharp.  The razor itself is quite nice, and certainly I think if you&#x27;re new to the whole safety razor school of shaving, you&#x27;ll likely be pleasantly surprised.  Being a newbie with these razors, the weight felt good in my hand but hey, I understand this ispersonal. Sure, it&#x27;s not the Rolls Royce of safety razors, and is perhaps more of a Toyota, but for an entry level system the price can&#x27;t be beat and from an esthetics stand point it looks quite good.  My first shave was fine, but I felt it was only as smooth as the best cartridge razor I had tried......I wasn&#x27;t disappointed but wondered whether this was the best that I could do with the new system.  By day two though, I had worked out my error.....the angle you hold the safety razor relative to your face is incredibly important, and I likely didn&#x27;t have the correct one when shaving initially.  No such problem on day two though, and I&#x27;m happy to report that the shave was awesome, incredibly close, smooth and no nicks.  You could actually hear it cut as it glided across my face.  I wish I&#x27;d discovered safety razors twenty five years ago.....&lt;br /&gt;I likely will use this for a little while and upgrade to one of the name brands that folks talk about, but if you&#x27;re wondering what safety razors are all about and want to experience the best shave a man really can get, you could do a lot worse than spend $20 on this system (....and throwing those other systems into the trash!) I won&#x27;t be going back to a cartridge razor ever again.  I suspect if more guys tried safety razors such as this, they too would have the same opinion.  Give it a go.....if you don&#x27;t like it you&#x27;ve only lost twenty bucks, but you never know.....you might find shaving is actually a pleasureable experience and does need to cost the earth!</li>
            <li> Ordered 3 sets...one for each of my sons.  I did 21 years in the USAF shaving with Bic, Mach 3s or 5s or whatever they want to call the disposables.  Wished I&#x27;d had these during that time...</li>
            <li> If you want to try out DE shaving then this set will do just fine to let you decide if you want to go the traditional shaving route.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is good enough its on par IMO to the van der hagen boar. The razor was better than expected. The silo doors work perfectly and it has decent weight and build quality. Of course don&#x27;t expect the razor to last forever but its a decent starter. The derby blades are gonna be hit or miss depending on your beard and skin type. I found that they cut me more than sharper blades like feather but maybe that&#x27;s because I had to apply more pressure to get the whiskers cut. My beard/skin just likes feather and wilkinson sword blades much better. Arko soap was drying and smelled horrible, I used it once and threw it out. Proraso is the best value shaving cream I&#x27;ve found so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price the set is a good way to decide without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li> Changed my shaving game, without a doubt. This is my first safety razor and I have to say that I won&#x27;t be going back to multi blade razors. The blades this uses are way cheaper anyways.</li>
            <li> I love it.  wish i had started shaving my head with this stuff years ago.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too impressed with the razor because it bends the razor and doesn&#x27;t give a great shave without cutting me.  The brush works great and the arko is great.  I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of the Derby extra razor blades, but that could be from the razor itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up buying a merkur long handled razor and it was night and day difference.  It gave me the best shave that I have ever had.</li>
            <li> i bought this set because i was tired of razor burn from cartrige razors i am empressed with the double edge safety razor i do not burn my face i did cut my self a couple if times till i got used to it works great on my face and my head i rate it four starz because i do not like the smellof the arko</li>
            <li> I have always used mach threes and decided to try this to save money. So far I have liked the kit. I recomend the arko soap and brush to everyone, even if you use mach type razors. I like the brush, I am contemplating getting a second that is a bit stiffer. I also like the fact that my wife does not use this razor, with the mach threes it was like sharing it with Chewbacca. Just kidding but not really.</li>
            <li> Got this as gifts for all the men in my family and they really appreciated it. One actually said he had been looking for something like this for a long time and was very happy with it.</li>
            <li> As advertised excellent product for the price.</li>
            <li> Perfect price for a good shave. I switched back to safety razors because I was so tiered of the rising costs of razors now. I threw all of my old safety razors away a while back, (Which I deeply regret) and forgot how good they worked. This kit is great for the price and works like a charm. I would advise buying the Wilkeson blades though. The blade provided are pretty cheaply made, but what do you expect for the price?</li>
