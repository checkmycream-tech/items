            <li>it&#x27;s particularly nice in the winter as a countermeasure to static.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>Helps control and give a healthy look.</li>
            <li>I really LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>you love</li>
            <li>musky smells, you will love this.</li>
            <li>Make it unscented for me, ok?</li>
            <li>Then I run a comb through it a couple more times while it&#x27;s drying.</li>
            <li>I love this hair oil.</li>
            <li>The Dove Restorative Treatment with Anatolian Pomegranate Seed Oil was more of a &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; for my hair (meaning to seal moisture in my hair, that I&#x27;ve already added).</li>
            <li>Suave also has a spray nozzle, but it does have a cap, which makes it much more convenient to place it in a drawer or tuck it into a container under the sink.</li>
            <li>ok, but it was too oily for me.</li>
            <li>Smells ok.</li>
            <li>I love this sample of Dove Restorative Treatment with Anatolian Pomegranate Seed Oil.  </li>
            <li>Instead I use this as a pre-poo before shampooing and it works a lot better for me that way and my hair does not feel weighed</li>
            <li>and I just love</li>
            <li>I would prefer a better product in a plastic bottle.</li>
            <li>understand that people who have a bit more hair on the top of their heads than I might have more to do.  </li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair is more wavy but also frizzes, and I was blown away when I applied this to her bed-head hair.  </li>
            <li>so I was pleased to see an oil.</li>
            <li>dry.&lt;br /&gt;However, I might even recommend this great new Dove treatment to people with frizzy hair!  </li>
            <li>I do not normally go out on a limb like that, but this softness and great absorption power really makes your hair feel really wonderfully</li>
            <li>is that Anatolian pomegranates have a legend of being grown from the original seeds taken aboard Noah&#x27;s Ark that landed in nearby mountains of Ararat (part of the Anatolian Plateau!).  </li>
            <li>There is some coconut oil, which can be absorbed by the hair, and is the fifth ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most enjoyable thing about this product is its smell.</li>
            <li>The oil soothes my scalp and helps make it easy to style my hair, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use a moroccan oil knock off which did a decent job, but not as good  as Dove.  </li>
            <li>I love Dove products and generally have good luck with them.</li>
            <li>I like thinking about this exceptionally fine oil</li>
            <li>The smell alone would be a huge selling point, but this product delivers on every level.</li>
            <li>And, for me, price is a huge issue.</li>
            <li>My hair is silkier, shinier, healthier, and smells unbelievably fantastic.</li>
            <li>It does smell fantastic and make my hair shine.  </li>
            <li>I never thought I could find a product I would prefer to my beloved Bed Head Ego Boost, but this has completely won my heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First of all I have to say that I have been a huge fan of the Dove soaps for many years and when this product came out, I was looking forward to using it.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients got me excited.</li>
            <li>Both times I didn&#x27;t notice a significant difference in quality or texture.</li>
            <li>I do like a lot of the Dove product line, so I was excited to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This works great for my hair if I don&#x27;t blow dry it</li>
            <li>But as with many, it just wasn&#x27;t thought out very far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Her hair is so gorgeous, but it definitely had a luster and shine to it that hadn&#x27;t had before!</li>
            <li>I think if you have really damaged hair you may see better results.  </li>
            <li>truly \\&quot;dry\\&quot; oil should be much lighter, and even better if it comes in a spray bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The result is nice soft manageable hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad product, just not for me or my hair.</li>
            <li>(I love going barefoot) and was surprised at how smooth and youthful it made my skin</li>
            <li>I smooth some in after a shower and it holds and restores luster just as well as the higher priced ones I have also used.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t weigh you hair down and gives it a great shine and feel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found the Dove Restorative Treatment with Anatolian Pomegranate Seed Oil to be exactly what I needed!  </li>
            <li>oil itself is supposed to be a light, dry oil with a nice scent,</li>
            <li>This is a nice compliment when I need a little more</li>
            <li>/&gt;This isn&#x27;t my favorite hair oil (that honor goes to the Macadamia brand), but it is very affordable--after using it each day for a month, I still have more than 3/4 of the bottle left.</li>
            <li>Once my hair dries, it feels soft, silky and has a healthy shine.  </li>
            <li>With the rise in popularity of Moroccan Argan oil and the like, Dove has entered the market with an effective, lower-priced alternative that performs very similarly.  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;d laugh and say, I can&#x27;t help it it smells</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend my absolute favorite Kerastase Elixir Ultime.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll just cut right to the chase on this one.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think 3-4 pumps is the right amount</li>
            <li>, it comes in an easy to dispense bottle which is a nice size and a little will go along way.</li>
            <li>anyone interested in trying hair oils, at this price point, its worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For highlighted or bleached hair</li>
            <li>highly recommend this very useful product to everyone.</li>
            <li>My hair tends to go from healthy to dry quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time I tried it, I put about 6 drops into my hands, rubbed them together, and then worked the oil into my hair.  </li>
            <li>the plus side, you get a lot for the money, but I personally think you&#x27;ll get more out of the &amp;#34;oil mist&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it claims.</li>
            <li>The results were much better, and about equal to what I was getting from Suave.</li>
            <li>I guess it depends on exactly how you use this oil to determine if its for you or not.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She washed her hair and put the product in the first time as she was drying it with the blow dryer.</li>
            <li>asked her to try it again and let her hair dry naturally - which she doesn&#x27;t normally do because she has so much hair and its so full, but for the sake of this review she very willingly agreed IF she could have the Dove Pure Care Dry Oil - which was fine with me since it worked so beautifully in her hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She was more than happy to let me know, and she also told me my hair looked a little weighted down and greasy in the front!</li>
            <li>But for me, I have found it takes mere seconds to use the Dove Restorative Treatment to get the look I want and maintain a healthy scalp (which has become more important than ever for me, since my hair is thinning).</li>
            <li>I prefer not to blow dry or use any heat on my hair to keep it healthy.  </li>
            <li>It also says you can apply it to dry hair before shampooing as a more intense moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>At work, people asked me why I was slicking my hair, so I knew I had used to much.  </li>
            <li>Still I would really like a product like this formulated for a man&#x27;s taste.  </li>
            <li>-- you are ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>It is just really</li>
            <li>, I really like this hair oil.</li>
            <li>This alternative from Dove is a real bargain.</li>
            <li>That .38 ounces does seem to be much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I managed to figure out how to use the Dove product, it worked well, and left my hair feeling smooth and silky, and looking shiny.</li>
            <li>I Really have to qualify this two ways . . .</li>
            <li>We both highly recommended!</li>
            <li>My hair is definitely much softer and easier to manage.  </li>
            <li>I found that it soaked in very well and didn&#x27;t grease up my pillow</li>
            <li>When I do that, I really don&#x27;t see any difference.  </li>
            <li>And I suppose this might be the case for many other guys, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Comb back down and smooth hands over top.</li>
            <li>&amp; I both agree Dove Pure Care Dry Oil is a great product for anyone with full thick hair!</li>
            <li>For reference, my hair type is baby fine, wavy, long and is prone to breakage.</li>
            <li>So maybe that&#x27;s why there&#x27;s a near magical power and potency to this oil made from such ancient, near mythical source!  </li>
            <li>We both highly recommended!&gt;She &amp; I both agree Dove Pure Care Dry Oil is a great product for anyone with full thick hair!</li>
            <li>long hair, use primarily on ends .</li>
            <li>The big down side of this oil is that the majority of it is mineral oil, which really cannot be absorbed into the hair, and just sits on top of it.</li>
            <li>types of products thanthis one -- they dispense less, but more evenly.</li>
            <li>My hair has less static and is shinier and healthier looking than when I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>For hair on older women?  </li>
            <li>If I follow the directions carefully and only apply from mid-length to end, the dry oil works great.  </li>
            <li>My only problem so far with Dove Restorative Treatment with Anatolian Pomegranate Seed Oil is that I don&#x27;t completely have the hang of how many pumps of it I require on my (short) hair to get it shiny and sleek without too much greasiness.&lt;br</li>
            <li>oil itself is also very &amp;#34;oily,&amp;#34; and I&#x27;ve tried other products like this that simply worked much better and felt lighter.</li>
            <li>Although this product didn&#x27;t work for me because my hair is VERY thin and baby fine, it worked AMAZINGLY well for our daughter - who has long, thick, and very healthy</li>
            <li>if you have dry to normal hair, this Dove Dry Oil is fantastic, but if you have an oily scalp be very careful how you apply the oil and make sure you keep it away from your scalp area.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not nearly as easy to comb through hair lightly or evenly this way, and can be a real pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am not sure how they were able to accomplish this, but it is not oily at all after a llittle bit.</li>
            <li>I love the scent and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down -- important since I have thick hair.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, after I&#x27;ve dried and styled my hair, I can&#x27;t smell it anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the smell</li>
            <li>It is not limp or oily and in fact still has body and movement.  </li>
            <li>The combination of my natural oil and the oil from the treatment makes it look like I haven’t washed my hair in days.  </li>
            <li>, it makes my hair soft, silky and leaves it smelling heavenly.</li>
            <li>This treatment just makes it silky and soft.  </li>
            <li>int he after picture, soft curls/</li>
            <li>The first time I tried this Dove product, because it states it is a dry oil, I massaged it in from the roots of my hair to the ends.</li>
            <li>When I used the Dove product again (and I used once more after this with the same results), I only massaged the oil in from mid-section of my hair down.</li>
            <li>While this product does a fine job of not leaving my hair greasy feeling or smelly, I&#x27;m just not sure it&#x27;s working as advertised.</li>
            <li>I have combination hair: it is very oily at the scalp but dry and brittle near the ends.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much, so I expect it to be a long time before I replace it.</li>
            <li>It is stick straight, but also gets frizzy when dry.  </li>
            <li>I was not familiar with the product category and wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but subsequently learned that my wife uses a comparable but more expensive hair oil called Affinage Kitoko.  </li>
            <li>It reminds me of baby powder mixed with old lady perfume.</li>
            <li>I even used a larger quantify the second time thinking that I perhaps didn&#x27;t use enough the first time, but I basically had the same results.  </li>
            <li>Like most silicone containing hair treatments, this makes my hair slightly greasy looking no matter how little I use.  </li>
            <li>I use this for my long hair and live it</li>
            <li>The bottle is quite large and will last a long, long time.</li>
            <li>My wife has a full head of thick blond hair</li>
            <li>She prefers Affinage Kitoko to this hair oil although we think the Dove product is a reasonable alternative for people looking for something less</li>
            <li>I have thick, long wavy hair that gets frizzy easily and appears dry at times at the ends.</li>

            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is more wavy but also frizzes, and I was blown away when I applied this to her bed-head hair.  </li>
            <li> so I was pleased to see an oil.</li>
            <li> dry.&lt;br /&gt;However, I might even recommend this great new Dove treatment to people with frizzy hair!  </li>
            <li> I do not normally go out on a limb like that, but this softness and great absorption power really makes your hair feel really wonderfully</li>
            <li> is that Anatolian pomegranates have a legend of being grown from the original seeds taken aboard Noah&#x27;s Ark that landed in nearby mountains of Ararat (part of the Anatolian Plateau!).  </li>
            <li> There is some coconut oil, which can be absorbed by the hair, and is the fifth ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most enjoyable thing about this product is its smell.</li>
            <li> The oil soothes my scalp and helps make it easy to style my hair, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use a moroccan oil knock off which did a decent job, but not as good  as Dove.  </li>
            <li> I love Dove products and generally have good luck with them.</li>
            <li> I like thinking about this exceptionally fine oil</li>
            <li> The smell alone would be a huge selling point, but this product delivers on every level.</li>
            <li> And, for me, price is a huge issue.</li>
            <li> My hair is silkier, shinier, healthier, and smells unbelievably fantastic.</li>
            <li> It does smell fantastic and make my hair shine.  </li>
            <li> I never thought I could find a product I would prefer to my beloved Bed Head Ego Boost, but this has completely won my heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First of all I have to say that I have been a huge fan of the Dove soaps for many years and when this product came out, I was looking forward to using it.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients got me excited.</li>
            <li> Both times I didn&#x27;t notice a significant difference in quality or texture.</li>
            <li> I do like a lot of the Dove product line, so I was excited to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This works great for my hair if I don&#x27;t blow dry it</li>
            <li> But as with many, it just wasn&#x27;t thought out very far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Her hair is so gorgeous, but it definitely had a luster and shine to it that hadn&#x27;t had before!</li>
            <li> I think if you have really damaged hair you may see better results.  </li>
            <li> truly \\&quot;dry\\&quot; oil should be much lighter, and even better if it comes in a spray bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The result is nice soft manageable hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad product, just not for me or my hair.</li>
            <li> (I love going barefoot) and was surprised at how smooth and youthful it made my skin</li>
            <li> I smooth some in after a shower and it holds and restores luster just as well as the higher priced ones I have also used.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh you hair down and gives it a great shine and feel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found the Dove Restorative Treatment with Anatolian Pomegranate Seed Oil to be exactly what I needed!  </li>
            <li> oil itself is supposed to be a light, dry oil with a nice scent,</li>
            <li> This is a nice compliment when I need a little more</li>
            <li> /&gt;This isn&#x27;t my favorite hair oil (that honor goes to the Macadamia brand), but it is very affordable--after using it each day for a month, I still have more than 3/4 of the bottle left.</li>
            <li> Once my hair dries, it feels soft, silky and has a healthy shine.  </li>
            <li> With the rise in popularity of Moroccan Argan oil and the like, Dove has entered the market with an effective, lower-priced alternative that performs very similarly.  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;d laugh and say, I can&#x27;t help it it smells</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend my absolute favorite Kerastase Elixir Ultime.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just cut right to the chase on this one.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think 3-4 pumps is the right amount</li>
            <li> , it comes in an easy to dispense bottle which is a nice size and a little will go along way.</li>
            <li> anyone interested in trying hair oils, at this price point, its worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For highlighted or bleached hair</li>
            <li> highly recommend this very useful product to everyone.</li>
            <li> My hair tends to go from healthy to dry quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time I tried it, I put about 6 drops into my hands, rubbed them together, and then worked the oil into my hair.  </li>
            <li> the plus side, you get a lot for the money, but I personally think you&#x27;ll get more out of the &amp;#34;oil mist&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it claims.</li>
            <li> The results were much better, and about equal to what I was getting from Suave.</li>
            <li> I guess it depends on exactly how you use this oil to determine if its for you or not.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She washed her hair and put the product in the first time as she was drying it with the blow dryer.</li>
            <li> asked her to try it again and let her hair dry naturally - which she doesn&#x27;t normally do because she has so much hair and its so full, but for the sake of this review she very willingly agreed IF she could have the Dove Pure Care Dry Oil - which was fine with me since it worked so beautifully in her hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She was more than happy to let me know, and she also told me my hair looked a little weighted down and greasy in the front!</li>
            <li> But for me, I have found it takes mere seconds to use the Dove Restorative Treatment to get the look I want and maintain a healthy scalp (which has become more important than ever for me, since my hair is thinning).</li>
            <li> I prefer not to blow dry or use any heat on my hair to keep it healthy.  </li>
            <li> It also says you can apply it to dry hair before shampooing as a more intense moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> At work, people asked me why I was slicking my hair, so I knew I had used to much.  </li>
            <li> Still I would really like a product like this formulated for a man&#x27;s taste.  </li>
            <li> -- you are ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> It is just really</li>
            <li> , I really like this hair oil.</li>
            <li> This alternative from Dove is a real bargain.</li>
            <li> That .38 ounces does seem to be much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I managed to figure out how to use the Dove product, it worked well, and left my hair feeling smooth and silky, and looking shiny.</li>
            <li> I Really have to qualify this two ways . . .</li>
            <li> We both highly recommended!</li>
            <li> My hair is definitely much softer and easier to manage.  </li>
            <li> I found that it soaked in very well and didn&#x27;t grease up my pillow</li>
            <li> When I do that, I really don&#x27;t see any difference.  </li>
            <li> And I suppose this might be the case for many other guys, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Comb back down and smooth hands over top.</li>
            <li> &amp; I both agree Dove Pure Care Dry Oil is a great product for anyone with full thick hair!</li>
            <li> For reference, my hair type is baby fine, wavy, long and is prone to breakage.</li>
            <li> So maybe that&#x27;s why there&#x27;s a near magical power and potency to this oil made from such ancient, near mythical source!  </li>
            <li> We both highly recommended!&gt;She &amp; I both agree Dove Pure Care Dry Oil is a great product for anyone with full thick hair!</li>
            <li> long hair, use primarily on ends .</li>
            <li> The big down side of this oil is that the majority of it is mineral oil, which really cannot be absorbed into the hair, and just sits on top of it.</li>
            <li> types of products thanthis one -- they dispense less, but more evenly.</li>
            <li> My hair has less static and is shinier and healthier looking than when I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> For hair on older women?  </li>
            <li> If I follow the directions carefully and only apply from mid-length to end, the dry oil works great.  </li>
            <li> My only problem so far with Dove Restorative Treatment with Anatolian Pomegranate Seed Oil is that I don&#x27;t completely have the hang of how many pumps of it I require on my (short) hair to get it shiny and sleek without too much greasiness.&lt;br</li>
            <li> oil itself is also very &amp;#34;oily,&amp;#34; and I&#x27;ve tried other products like this that simply worked much better and felt lighter.</li>
            <li> Although this product didn&#x27;t work for me because my hair is VERY thin and baby fine, it worked AMAZINGLY well for our daughter - who has long, thick, and very healthy</li>
            <li> if you have dry to normal hair, this Dove Dry Oil is fantastic, but if you have an oily scalp be very careful how you apply the oil and make sure you keep it away from your scalp area.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not nearly as easy to comb through hair lightly or evenly this way, and can be a real pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am not sure how they were able to accomplish this, but it is not oily at all after a llittle bit.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down -- important since I have thick hair.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, after I&#x27;ve dried and styled my hair, I can&#x27;t smell it anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the smell</li>
            <li> It is not limp or oily and in fact still has body and movement.  </li>
            <li> The combination of my natural oil and the oil from the treatment makes it look like I haven’t washed my hair in days.  </li>
            <li> , it makes my hair soft, silky and leaves it smelling heavenly.</li>
            <li> This treatment just makes it silky and soft.  </li>
            <li> int he after picture, soft curls/</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this Dove product, because it states it is a dry oil, I massaged it in from the roots of my hair to the ends.</li>
            <li> When I used the Dove product again (and I used once more after this with the same results), I only massaged the oil in from mid-section of my hair down.</li>
            <li> While this product does a fine job of not leaving my hair greasy feeling or smelly, I&#x27;m just not sure it&#x27;s working as advertised.</li>
            <li> I have combination hair: it is very oily at the scalp but dry and brittle near the ends.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much, so I expect it to be a long time before I replace it.</li>
            <li> It is stick straight, but also gets frizzy when dry.  </li>
            <li> I was not familiar with the product category and wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but subsequently learned that my wife uses a comparable but more expensive hair oil called Affinage Kitoko.  </li>
            <li> It reminds me of baby powder mixed with old lady perfume.</li>
            <li> I even used a larger quantify the second time thinking that I perhaps didn&#x27;t use enough the first time, but I basically had the same results.  </li>
            <li> Like most silicone containing hair treatments, this makes my hair slightly greasy looking no matter how little I use.  </li>
            <li> I use this for my long hair and live it</li>
            <li> The bottle is quite large and will last a long, long time.</li>
            <li> My wife has a full head of thick blond hair</li>
            <li> She prefers Affinage Kitoko to this hair oil although we think the Dove product is a reasonable alternative for people looking for something less</li>
            <li> I have thick, long wavy hair that gets frizzy easily and appears dry at times at the ends.</li>
            <li> Apparently it&#x27;s for dry, brittle hair</li>
            <li> I use about 12 pumps on my long, coarse hair after it has been towel-dried and still damp.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very heavy and very greasy.</li>
            <li> BUT I have to be very careful not to get the dry oil anywhere near my scalp.  </li>
            <li> I allowed my hair to air dry and then used a flat iron.</li>
            <li> as long as she let me know what she thought of it - since I&#x27;d be reviewing it.</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t pleasing, the oil is too heavy, and the choice of a pump dispenser instead of a light mist makes it very hard to use the way it&#x27;s promoted for use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As one who has a lot of thick hair, I regularly use a similar product before drying my hair and I have tried several different ones that on the market and have been satisifed with them.</li>
            <li> My hair reaches down to my shoulders and is rather thick, but I didn&#x27;t use very much of the product.</li>
            <li> think Dove has a winner here for dry haired people!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> something you can use to strengthen and nourish dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I just adore this dry oil treatment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on damp hair, leaving it to air dry and blow drying it.</li>
            <li> But then, the Suave product does not claim to be a dry oil.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After she washed her hair and let it dry, she pumped some of the oil into her hands and rubbed them together.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it to be anywhere the feel of a dry oil.</li>
            <li> Afterwards I allow my hair to air dry.  </li>
            <li> This is a dry oil</li>
            <li> I would not put on to wear in the day as a dry oil.</li>
            <li> A dry oil for me should be wearable during the day this product is not.</li>
            <li> And the bottle is fairly big and not a comfortable &amp;#34;hand fit.&amp;#34; Suave is a slightly smaller size, made of plastic, and fits the hand well.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for use before blow drying (at least for my hair type) as it leaves fine hair a bit heavy and limp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit confused by what exactly it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> But where it literally shines is on one&#x27;s hair -- especially if it&#x27;s dry and flat looking.</li>
            <li> I have to be careful not to transfer the oil from the tips of hair to the scalp via the comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> think you have to be careful about the amount you use though.</li>
            <li> I know my hair feels stronger and less dry after using this for a month.</li>
            <li> For the price, volume, and effect, this product beats all the other oils I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the difference is between this and the macadamia oil version (other than the oil itself).  </li>
            <li> She thought so too but said it was unlikely she&#x27;d do it very often because of the time involved, but she loves the product and wanted to keep it!  </li>
            <li> Any other type of hair might get severely weighed down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> you have hard to manage, frizzy, thick or very course hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to be a dry oil, which means it should not be heavy and greasy .</li>
            <li> Only complaint was that the dispenser got a bit cracked in shipment and thus didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of different oils on my hair from cheap to expensive Moroccan oils and this compares favorably to the expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I have found that I have to avoid the bang area, though, as it looks oily and weighed down if I get any of the oil on</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and leaves no trace of oil in my hair.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend it--if you can get past the smell!</li>
            <li> I use 5-6 pumps and run it through my damp hair, then dry as usual.  </li>
            <li> I never use oils on my hair when it is dry, the result is usually greasy</li>
            <li> I saw what the other reviews said about it being heavy.  </li>
            <li> and, I have used it now for a few weeks</li>
            <li> After showering, I put a few drops on my palms and rub the oil into my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, course, shoulder length hair that is hard to manage, especially in the humid summer months</li>
            <li> But the oil dispenser is a gloppy pump-style dispense, and the oil is very heavy, so what you end up with on each dose is a palmful of heavy, gloppy oil.</li>
            <li> Rub small amount in hands and then massage through length if hair.</li>
            <li> beards, rub small amount in hands  </li>
            <li> Since then I have used usually just two drops, sometimes 3, and I do like the effect -</li>
            <li> - it reminds me of an elderly lady&#x27;s perfume, but it is not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> I use six pumps on damp hair and then style as usual.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not particularly sure about this one.</li>
            <li> The intended use is to apply a small amount to damp hair to moisturize/condition it.  </li>
            <li> The problem is it&#x27;s VERY thick, heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li> My hair is rather thick and absorbs the oil well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too thick and greasy.  </li>
            <li> When I did that, it was very hard to wash out</li>
            <li> fancy glass bottle is not impressive.</li>
            <li> Sorry, One star for this one .</li>
            <li> But the fragrances make me ill!</li>
            <li> However, I was somewhat disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> I hate the scent of this oil.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a terrible product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great for mens beards as well! I use this for my long hair and live it but my husband uses it for his beard  and now many of his friends do as well because his nerad looks so good.&lt;br /&gt;For long hair, use primarily on ends . Rub small amount in hands and then massage through length if hair. Lightweight, doesn&#x27;t make hair oily.&lt;br /&gt;For beards, rub small amount in hands  and then up from underneath thru beards. Comb back down and smooth hands over top. Helps control and give a healthy look.</li>
            <li> This is an oil that you spread sparingly into your hair after showering and before combing or brushing.  I was not familiar with the product category and wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but subsequently learned that my wife uses a comparable but more expensive hair oil called Affinage Kitoko.  She prefers Affinage Kitoko to this hair oil although we think the Dove product is a reasonable alternative for people looking for something less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tried it, I put about 6 drops into my hands, rubbed them together, and then worked the oil into my hair.  At work, people asked me why I was slicking my hair, so I knew I had used to much.  Since then I have used usually just two drops, sometimes 3, and I do like the effect - it&#x27;s particularly nice in the winter as a countermeasure to static.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not like the smell - it reminds me of an elderly lady&#x27;s perfume, but it is not overwhelming.  Still I would really like a product like this formulated for a man&#x27;s taste.  Perhaps coconut or something like English Leather.</li>
            <li> I really LOVE this product. My only problem so far with Dove Restorative Treatment with Anatolian Pomegranate Seed Oil is that I don&#x27;t completely have the hang of how many pumps of it I require on my (short) hair to get it shiny and sleek without too much greasiness.&lt;br /&gt;It is incredibly effective. You use it on your damp hair after you have shampooed... and wham bam bop !!!-- you are ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;Note: My hair is not frizzy. It is just really dry.&lt;br /&gt;However, I might even recommend this great new Dove treatment to people with frizzy hair!  I do not normally go out on a limb like that, but this softness and great absorption power really makes your hair feel really wonderfully silky.&lt;br /&gt;I think Dove has a winner here for dry haired people!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;jean</li>
            <li> The ingredients got me excited. These are great oils for the hair. But the fragrances make me ill! Ugh!&lt;br /&gt;If you love musky smells, you will love this. It works great. I just can&#x27;t stand the smell. Make it unscented for me, ok?</li>
            <li> I hate the scent of this oil. Loathe it. It reminds me of baby powder mixed with old lady perfume. Fortunately, after I&#x27;ve dried and styled my hair, I can&#x27;t smell it anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the smell, I really like this hair oil. I use six pumps on damp hair and then style as usual. I know my hair feels stronger and less dry after using this for a month. I have found that I have to avoid the bang area, though, as it looks oily and weighed down if I get any of the oil on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t my favorite hair oil (that honor goes to the Macadamia brand), but it is very affordable--after using it each day for a month, I still have more than 3/4 of the bottle left. It also does a good job. I definitely recommend it--if you can get past the smell!</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a terrible product. But as with many, it just wasn&#x27;t thought out very far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil itself is supposed to be a light, dry oil with a nice scent, something you can use to strengthen and nourish dry hair.  But the oil dispenser is a gloppy pump-style dispense, and the oil is very heavy, so what you end up with on each dose is a palmful of heavy, gloppy oil. It&#x27;s not nearly as easy to comb through hair lightly or evenly this way, and can be a real pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil itself is also very &amp;#34;oily,&amp;#34; and I&#x27;ve tried other products like this that simply worked much better and felt lighter. The scent isn&#x27;t pleasing, the oil is too heavy, and the choice of a pump dispenser instead of a light mist makes it very hard to use the way it&#x27;s promoted for use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, you get a lot for the money, but I personally think you&#x27;ll get more out of the &amp;#34;oil mist&amp;#34; types of products thanthis one -- they dispense less, but more evenly.</li>
            <li> I just adore this dry oil treatment. I have been using it every day since I got it and it is perfect for my needs. I prefer not to blow dry or use any heat on my hair to keep it healthy.  So I have been trying different hair oils.  For the price, volume, and effect, this product beats all the other oils I&#x27;ve been using. I use about 12 pumps on my long, coarse hair after it has been towel-dried and still damp. I only use the oil from midlengthe to the ends.  Then I run a comb through it a couple more times while it&#x27;s drying. The oil itself feels light and smells wonderful - like baby oil.  Once my hair dries, it feels soft, silky and has a healthy shine.  It is not limp or oily and in fact still has body and movement.  No residue whatsoever.  Also I find that the fragrance fades by the end of the day. I don&#x27;t know what the difference is between this and the macadamia oil version (other than the oil itself).  Also it is touted as for \\&quot;age-depleted\\&quot; hair.  I don&#x27;t know what that means. For hair on older women?  Women over 40?  Elderly women?</li>
            <li> I love this hair oil. I use it every day after my shower. It does exactly what it claims. My hair is silkier, shinier, healthier, and smells unbelievably fantastic. I never thought I could find a product I would prefer to my beloved Bed Head Ego Boost, but this has completely won my heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works in well, doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and leaves no trace of oil in my hair. The smell alone would be a huge selling point, but this product delivers on every level.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using coconut oil as my shampoo. I put it on in the evening and wash it out next morning. This is a nice compliment when I need a little more body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure how they were able to accomplish this, but it is not oily at all after a llittle bit. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Like most silicone containing hair treatments, this makes my hair slightly greasy looking no matter how little I use.  It does smell fantastic and make my hair shine.  The bottle is quite large and will last a long, long time.</li>
            <li> Moroccan Hair Oil can be pricey. This alternative from Dove is a real bargain. Doesn&#x27;t weigh you hair down and gives it a great shine and feel. Does not flake at all either. And smells great! Only complaint was that the dispenser got a bit cracked in shipment and thus didn&#x27;t work. But the oil inside worked great!</li>
            <li> I have combination hair: it is very oily at the scalp but dry and brittle near the ends.  If I follow the directions carefully and only apply from mid-length to end, the dry oil works great.  It tames my frizzy and flyaway hair and gives it a nice healthy shine.  The oil also smells really, really good.  BUT I have to be very careful not to get the dry oil anywhere near my scalp.  The combination of my natural oil and the oil from the treatment makes it look like I haven’t washed my hair in days.  Combing my hair after applying the oil is also risky.  I have to be careful not to transfer the oil from the tips of hair to the scalp via the comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you have dry to normal hair, this Dove Dry Oil is fantastic, but if you have an oily scalp be very careful how you apply the oil and make sure you keep it away from your scalp area.</li>
            <li> My hair tends to go from healthy to dry quickly. I&#x27;ve used this product several times when it seems like my hair needs a boost. I love the scent and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down -- important since I have thick hair. I have not used it on successive days, but I like what it&#x27;s done the times I have used it. It doesn&#x27;t take much, so I expect it to be a long time before I replace it.</li>
            <li> I have 4a type hair. The Dove Restorative Treatment with Anatolian Pomegranate Seed Oil was more of a &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; for my hair (meaning to seal moisture in my hair, that I&#x27;ve already added). The big down side of this oil is that the majority of it is mineral oil, which really cannot be absorbed into the hair, and just sits on top of it. There is some coconut oil, which can be absorbed by the hair, and is the fifth ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most enjoyable thing about this product is its smell. Although I will continue to use this product until it&#x27;s gone, I probably won&#x27;t purchase it in the future.</li>
            <li> With the rise in popularity of Moroccan Argan oil and the like, Dove has entered the market with an effective, lower-priced alternative that performs very similarly.  I smooth some in after a shower and it holds and restores luster just as well as the higher priced ones I have also used.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I love Dove products and generally have good luck with them. I&#x27;m just not particularly sure about this one. I&#x27;m a bit confused by what exactly it&#x27;s supposed to do. Apparently it&#x27;s for dry, brittle hair and it&#x27;s supposed to leave it silky and shiny. I&#x27;ve used it on damp hair, leaving it to air dry and blow drying it. Both times I didn&#x27;t notice a significant difference in quality or texture. I have thick, long wavy hair that gets frizzy easily and appears dry at times at the ends. Nothing has worked. While this product does a fine job of not leaving my hair greasy feeling or smelly, I&#x27;m just not sure it&#x27;s working as advertised.</li>
            <li> I have been using Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Moroccan Argan Styling Oil for some time now, and decided to give this product a try. I do like a lot of the Dove product line, so I was excited to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed by the size of the bottle. Suave&#x27;s product comes in a bottle that is 3 ounces, and this bottle is 3.38 ounces. That .38 ounces does seem to be much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know with the Suave product, the instructions state not to put the product at the roots of the hair, but to place it at about mid-section of the hair. But then, the Suave product does not claim to be a dry oil. The first time I tried this Dove product, because it states it is a dry oil, I massaged it in from the roots of my hair to the ends. My hair reaches down to my shoulders and is rather thick, but I didn&#x27;t use very much of the product. I allowed my hair to air dry and then used a flat iron. When I finished, my hair looked oily and greasy! ICK! I was horrified! My hair looked as though I hadn&#x27;t washed it, and it had just been washed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Suave product, I never had that problem. When I used the Dove product again (and I used once more after this with the same results), I only massaged the oil in from mid-section of my hair down. The results were much better, and about equal to what I was getting from Suave. However, there are some things will keep me using the Suave product. Dove comes in a glass bottle - does any manufacturer make glass containers for bathrooms anymore? Especially when using a product that is oil? And the bottle is fairly big and not a comfortable &amp;#34;hand fit.&amp;#34; Suave is a slightly smaller size, made of plastic, and fits the hand well. This Dove product does have a spray nozzle, but no cap for it. Suave also has a spray nozzle, but it does have a cap, which makes it much more convenient to place it in a drawer or tuck it into a container under the sink. And, for me, price is a huge issue. Suave costs between $6.00 - $7.00, and the product does last a while. The Dove product, while having an additional .38 ounces, costs $11.00 - $12.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I managed to figure out how to use the Dove product, it worked well, and left my hair feeling smooth and silky, and looking shiny. However, I think for the best bang for my buck, Suave is the better product for me.</li>
            <li> ok, but it was too oily for me. I wouldn&#x27;t use it again but I would recommend it to a friend&lt;br /&gt;with drier hair. It&#x27;s not a bad product, just not for me or my hair. Smells ok.</li>
            <li> For reference, my hair type is baby fine, wavy, long and is prone to breakage. This works great for my hair if I don&#x27;t blow dry it, it makes my hair soft, silky and leaves it smelling heavenly. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for use before blow drying (at least for my hair type) as it leaves fine hair a bit heavy and limp.</li>
            <li> I love this sample of Dove Restorative Treatment with Anatolian Pomegranate Seed Oil.  My wife has a full head of thick blond hair and she applied it in the sunlight and when she shook her hair it was like a cascade of shimmering crystals.  I told here that and she laughed.  But when I gave her a mirror, she was amazed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rub it into my elbows and gnarly feet (I love going barefoot) and was surprised at how smooth and youthful it made my skin appear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil is extracted from Anatolian pomegranate seeds.  I like thinking about this exceptionally fine oil is that Anatolian pomegranates have a legend of being grown from the original seeds taken aboard Noah&#x27;s Ark that landed in nearby mountains of Ararat (part of the Anatolian Plateau!).  So maybe that&#x27;s why there&#x27;s a near magical power and potency to this oil made from such ancient, near mythical source!  Wouldn&#x27;t that be something?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this great product for restoring a more youthful look to aging and damaged skin.  But where it literally shines is on one&#x27;s hair -- especially if it&#x27;s dry and flat looking.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice oil although its not as light as I thought it was going to be, So Instead I use this as a pre-poo before shampooing and it works a lot better for me that way and my hair does not feel weighed down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is nice and I don&#x27;t find it overpowering at all, it comes in an easy to dispense bottle which is a nice size and a little will go along way. I guess it depends on exactly how you use this oil to determine if its for you or not. In my opinion its best to use this as a pre-poo or hot oil treatment.</li>
            <li> First of all I have to say that I have been a huge fan of the Dove soaps for many years and when this product came out, I was looking forward to using it.  As one who has a lot of thick hair, I regularly use a similar product before drying my hair and I have tried several different ones that on the market and have been satisifed with them. However, I was somewhat disappointed with this product.  I have tried it twice, and both times it did not leave my hair feeling silky. I even used a larger quantify the second time thinking that I perhaps didn&#x27;t use enough the first time, but I basically had the same results.  So, in all honesty, I can&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I Really have to qualify this two ways . . . Although this product didn&#x27;t work for me because my hair is VERY thin and baby fine, it worked AMAZINGLY well for our daughter - who has long, thick, and very healthy hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When our daughter came home she smelled the Dove Restorative Treatment in my hair, and asked if she could try it. I said, &amp;#34;Sure&amp;#34; as long as she let me know what she thought of it - since I&#x27;d be reviewing it. She was more than happy to let me know, and she also told me my hair looked a little weighted down and greasy in the front! LOL I already knew - my hair was just too fine for this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She washed her hair and put the product in the first time as she was drying it with the blow dryer. Her hair is so gorgeous, but it definitely had a luster and shine to it that hadn&#x27;t had before! I had to laugh because I kept catching her reaching around and pulling her hair around to smell! She&#x27;d laugh and say, I can&#x27;t help it it smells SO good!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked her to try it again and let her hair dry naturally - which she doesn&#x27;t normally do because she has so much hair and its so full, but for the sake of this review she very willingly agreed IF she could have the Dove Pure Care Dry Oil - which was fine with me since it worked so beautifully in her hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After she washed her hair and let it dry, she pumped some of the oil into her hands and rubbed them together. Then she started at the ends of her hair and worked her way up. She uses these kinds of things in her hair so she knows what she&#x27;s doing - she doesn&#x27;t overdo it or leave any part undone.  She flipped her head over to get every strand. When she was finished her hair looked even better than it did when she used the blow dryer! She thought so too but said it was unlikely she&#x27;d do it very often because of the time involved, but she loves the product and wanted to keep it!  I told her for all the work she had put in for me, she deserved to keep it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She &amp; I both agree Dove Pure Care Dry Oil is a great product for anyone with full thick hair! It gives you a beautiful lustrous shine and wonderful smell that&#x27;s not overwhelming. We both highly recommended!&gt;She &amp; I both agree Dove Pure Care Dry Oil is a great product for anyone with full thick hair! It gives you a beautiful lustrous shine and wonderful smell that&#x27;s not overwhelming. We both highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is a great hair treatment that works two ways, before you shampoo (the night before) or on damp hair after shampooing.  I have very thick, course, shoulder length hair that is hard to manage, especially in the humid summer months and, I have used it now for a few weeks and I just love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use a moroccan oil knock off which did a decent job, but not as good  as Dove.  I use 5-6 pumps and run it through my damp hair, then dry as usual.  My hair is definitely much softer and easier to manage.  I have also used the product at night and let it sit overnight and then washed it out in the morning for a double treatment.  I found that it soaked in very well and didn&#x27;t grease up my pillow but the result was the same by just putting it on my hair after shampooing.  I think if you have really damaged hair you may see better results.  The only drawback I could see with this product is that it comes in a glass container.  The container looks nice on your sink, but I would be worried to travel with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have hard to manage, frizzy, thick or very course hair this product would be great for you.  I plan on making it a permanent part of my beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t see any results from this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just cut right to the chase on this one. I do not like it. It&#x27;s supposed to be a dry oil, which means it should not be heavy and greasy . The problem is it&#x27;s VERY thick, heavy and greasy. I don&#x27;t find it to be anywhere the feel of a dry oil. It left my hair feeling oily and looking like I had not washed it in days. I couldn&#x27;t even get it off my hands without washing with Dawn dishwashing liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A truly \\&quot;dry\\&quot; oil should be much lighter, and even better if it comes in a spray bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fancy glass bottle is not impressive. I would prefer a better product in a plastic bottle. Sorry, One star for this one .</li>
            <li> I like this restorative oil. I use 3-4 pumps on my damp (post washing) mid-back length highlighted blonde hair.  My hair is rather thick and absorbs the oil well.  Afterwards I allow my hair to air dry.  The result is nice soft manageable hair.  I never use oils on my hair when it is dry, the result is usually greasy looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think you have to be careful about the amount you use though. Its very easy to wind up with an oily looking head. I would only recommend this to people with thicker hair.  Any other type of hair might get severely weighed down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone interested in trying hair oils, at this price point, its worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For highlighted or bleached hair I highly recommend my absolute favorite Kerastase Elixir Ultime.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found the Dove Restorative Treatment with Anatolian Pomegranate Seed Oil to be exactly what I needed!  After showering, I put a few drops on my palms and rub the oil into my hair and scalp. The oil soothes my scalp and helps make it easy to style my hair, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand that people who have a bit more hair on the top of their heads than I might have more to do.  But for me, I have found it takes mere seconds to use the Dove Restorative Treatment to get the look I want and maintain a healthy scalp (which has become more important than ever for me, since my hair is thinning). And I suppose this might be the case for many other guys, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this very useful product to everyone.</li>
            <li> I saw what the other reviews said about it being heavy.  It&#x27;s just not for me or my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine hair.  It is stick straight, but also gets frizzy when dry.  This treatment just makes it silky and soft.  My daughter&#x27;s hair is more wavy but also frizzes, and I was blown away when I applied this to her bed-head hair.  I wish I could upload a picture of my daughter&#x27;s hair before &amp; after.  It&#x27;s incredible, but I can&#x27;t seem to upload it here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you would see in the before picture is a frizzball puff ...and int he after picture, soft curls/waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think 3-4 pumps is the right amount (although that&#x27;s per the directions).  Start with 1-2.</li>
            <li> This is a dry oil but it&#x27;s very heavy and very greasy. I would put this on at night and wear a stocking cap to bed. I would not put on to wear in the day as a dry oil. It&#x27;s too thick and greasy.  A dry oil for me should be wearable during the day this product is not. It is good however if you use at night and then wash out in the morning.</li>
            <li> I had just recently purchased the Dove shampoo and conditioner that goes with this line so I was pleased to see an oil. I have used a lot of different oils on my hair from cheap to expensive Moroccan oils and this compares favorably to the expensive brands. My hair has less static and is shinier and healthier looking than when I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t quite see the value in this product.  The intended use is to apply a small amount to damp hair to moisturize/condition it.  When I do that, I really don&#x27;t see any difference.  It does smell good, but that&#x27;s about it.  It also says you can apply it to dry hair before shampooing as a more intense moisturizer.  When I did that, it was very hard to wash out and my hair looked oily afterward.  I will continue to use it on damp hair until the bottle runs out, but I won&#x27;t be buying it in the future.</li>
