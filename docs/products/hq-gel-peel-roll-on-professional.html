    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I am very happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>So if you are going to buy this, I suggest you buy a VERY good moisturizer because you will need it.</li>
            <li>Good luck!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using retin-A for a year or so with great results.  </li>
            <li>This peel is great.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;peel\\&quot; which I&#x27;m happy about,</li>
            <li>Great for deeper scars and discolorations.  </li>
            <li>Despite all that, I was happy with the fact that it eliminated my acne blemishes.  </li>
            <li>I use it about once a month to help keep my skin looking bright and clear.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a good product but didn&#x27;t seem to be quite what I needed.  </li>
            <li>For some, I am sure this product works great.</li>
            <li>this product works but it sure hurts!</li>
            <li>Most of the product had leaked out during shipping, as others have mentioned in their reviews (Amazon handled the return with NO problems - even paid for the return shipping!).</li>
            <li>and i love this product!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m hoping these 2 products will work nicely together.</li>
            <li>I ordered more because it&#x27;s good to have around.</li>
            <li>This product is very strong.  </li>
            <li>I love this peel better than the rest!</li>
            <li>I love this peel better than the rest!</li>
            <li>It did sting way more than the glycolic acid, but it wasn&#x27;t unbearable.</li>
            <li>Adding weekly applications of this product has improved my skin texture and evened out my skin pigmentation even more.</li>
            <li>:)    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to order it in the bottle instead of the roll-on because the reviews suggest that it&#x27;ll work better.</li>
            <li>and it feels like you better listen and rinse soon</li>
            <li>I love the HQ Gel Peel.</li>
            <li>i love love love the HQ peel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite satisfied with the results I&#x27;ve gotten.</li>
            <li>The product is good for a first time user.  </li>
            <li>The roll on applicator made it very easy to firstly apply the peel to the darkest portions.</li>
            <li>But overall, I am happy with this product and plan to continue using it.</li>
            <li>not such a great idea.</li>
            <li>but i know since it&#x27;s a light peel</li>
            <li>stuff has been so fantastic.</li>
            <li>It sounds like it works better for acne and may be worth the cost for that.</li>
            <li>Works great on scars and hyperpigmentation on the body, including back and chest (for those who have had acne on these areas).  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t roll on &#x27;smoothly&#x27;.</li>
            <li>The roller made this peel easy to apply quickly.  </li>
            <li>What I like most is that it is easy to apply on the spots that need to be treated, and within a day, new breakouts are almost gone.  </li>
            <li>it arrived so quickly, i was really excited.</li>
            <li>Make sure you don&#x27;t have any special events you have to attend, as a matter of fact, avoid going out, because people will be staring at your face because it will peel so much, i meant it was like my skin was coming off.</li>
            <li>Despite the suggestion to start w/a minute I twitched, fidgeted, gritted my teeth, and danced around for a full 2 mins.</li>
            <li>My skin loves peels &amp; I could always leave the peel on for the full amount of time.  </li>
            <li>I leave it on for the full time of 4 minutes</li>
            <li>Also, it does sting, but not bad at all--comparable to alcohol, or concentrated salycilic acid.  </li>
            <li>I have mild acne and a lot of scars from the acne.  </li>
            <li>I would chance a guess that between first application, and the second one where I doubled up on the product to cover my whole face over twice, I&#x27;ve used about 2/10ths of the product, so this is great bang for your bucks.</li>

            <li>the amazing effects aren&#x27;t very lasting though I do still think it was worth it &amp; has helped over all.idering doing a skin peel, maybe think about what you&#x27;re eating during the healing process.</li>
            <li>So the amazing effects aren&#x27;t very lasting though I do still think it was worth it &amp; has helped over all.</li>
            <li>but it was WORTH IT.</li>
            <li>That kind of reward is heartfelt.</li>
            <li>That kind of reward is heartfelt.</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth, has a more even tone, and my pores are smaller</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been eating lots of avacados, walnuts, salmon, tomato sauce, green &amp; white teas w/honey, sweet potatoes/yams, &amp; pomagrantes since they all have excellent skin benefits.</li>

            <li>no gain right?</li>
            <li>My skin tightened up right away</li>
            <li>The 5th time I used the peel, the next day I saw that my acne scars were much less visible(which made me very happy).</li>
            <li>I mean, if you&#x27;re going to go as far as a skin peel (even a gentle one) why not go all the way &amp; ensure your new skin is the best it can be? :)</li>
            <li>so I have hope for better results after a few more treatments.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I healed completely and my skin in that area is now very smooth and clear.  </li>
            <li>The peeling is very gentle and I am able to wear makeup the next day.</li>
            <li>hyperpigmentation(which was why I bought the glycolic acid in the first place).</li>
            <li>and I have not recieved a refund from the first packaging mishap.  </li>
            <li>The first time because my sitch is grave, and truth be told, my sitch is also impatience.</li>
            <li>on, I have the first ever chance of appearing as a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; beauty w/3 lbs.</li>
            <li>on, I have the first ever chance of appearing as a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; beauty w/3 lbs.</li>
            <li>My skin is incredibly soft &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>The product seems to be working with no ill side effects.  </li>
            <li>today, i have my first HQ peeling.</li>
            <li>but this is my first home peel.</li>
            <li>can already tell that the size of my pores appears smaller and that my skin tone is more even.</li>
            <li>i tested it on my wrist first, then did my whole face.</li>
            <li>I mean, if you&#x27;re going to go as far as a skin peel (even a gentle one) why not go all the way &amp; ensure your new skin is the best it can be?</li>
            <li>My situation, fair skin bi racial w/very dark scarring tendencies, sensitive skin, and PCOS razor bump scars under chin.</li>
            <li>large pores.</li>
            <li>I just received my order of Elicina snail cream which promises to treat acne scars, fine lines &amp; wrinkles &amp; the overall texture of the skin</li>
            <li>and i could really see a huge difference in the appearance of my red marks.</li>
            <li>, they worked very well with acne and oily skin.</li>
            <li>It wiped off gently w/</li>
            <li>It wiped off gently w/</li>
            <li>I read a review that said that the user didn&#x27;t see real results until the 5th week</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really make my skin visibly</li>
            <li>I have used twice now - it is a gentle peel -  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t really burn my skin, which rly surprise me.</li>
            <li>I get an occasional light peel from a Spa</li>
            <li>As of 3 months later, the results are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It was kind of embarrassing to walk around with this huge stain on my face, however, by day 3, my skin started to peel and by the next morning, all of that dead skin peeled off to reveal newer, fresher skin underneath without any scarring or discoloration.  </li>
            <li>a real person with acne scars</li>
            <li>It is plainly well designed to do no harm, and that will help greatly with my ability to use this product in the future, because i trust there pledge to care for my skin as much as i do.</li>

            <li>Unlike the TCI peels, and other far harsher products, i got simply amazing results</li>
            <li>Unlike the TCI peels, and other far harsher products, i got simply amazing results</li>
            <li>If you use this product, just be sure to rinse your nostril area very carefully and use LOTS of water.</li>
            <li>I also apply Aveeno Positively Radiant moisturizer sp15 (my regular daily moisturizer) afterward which seems to have gone over well with my skin :)</li>
            <li>Immediately, I&#x27;m bracing for the pain, but much like losing a chemical peel cherry, it only really hurt like hell the very first time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does not hurt very much, just a warmth which is easily tamed with some cool water.&lt;br /&gt;There is barely downtime as well if you do not leave it on longer than a few minutes.</li>
            <li>As with any non-surgical skin procedure, it takes time and regular use to see the full benefits.  </li>
            <li>Per directions, I simply rinsed w/copious amounts of cool tap water.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using other exfoliating products like Olay&#x27;s Definity line (recently started it), Obagi&#x27;s Vitamin C line (great for reducing dark spots and evening skin tone), Dior (love it!), and other products.     </li>
            <li>I did have to leave it on for the maximum time (or more) in order to have slight peeling within about 48 hours.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve just been particularly cautious with the sun while I&#x27;m using this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would and have highly recommended this product.</li>
            <li>so far no negative skin reactions, which is positive.</li>
            <li>I have decided not to purchase this product anymore (despite its effectiveness) due to this fact and will look for products containing more natural ingredients, like arbutin-a and kojic acid.</li>
            <li>I like the little rollerball on the top of the bottle to use on just the spots.....</li>
            <li>and it really helped clear my acne.</li>
            <li>This peel does take more than a few applications for it to work.</li>
            <li>I wasnt sure dead skin gone at all.  </li>
            <li>I used retinol (heavily) next day and then saw shiny fresh skin.</li>
            <li>The stinging and redness largely went away immediately, and what didn&#x27;t, appeared normal after the combination of my usual moisturizer and maybe ten minutes of resting w/a cool, strong drink in hand.</li>
            <li>My skin is very prone to scarring, so once I get a big blemish, it stays with me for a long time, which is why I am so glad that this not only shrinks, but stops new blemishes.</li>
            <li>so I worked very fast to do it, and then my entire face and neck.</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle on the first bottle i was using it about three times a week.</li>
            <li>, so i tested it out for the first time last night...</li>
            <li>, i got fantastic results without the extreme side effects!</li>
            <li>, i got fantastic results without the extreme side effects!</li>
            <li>but I think that&#x27;s probably partly because I use the Aveeno Face Pads to wash my face (only the soft side &amp; very gently)</li>
            <li>Clearly when it comes to healing and results, patience is a chemical peels</li>
            <li>Clearly when it comes to healing and results, patience is a chemical peels</li>
            <li>Later, I noticed a huge red patch on my left cheek which looked like &amp; hurt like a sunburn.</li>
            <li>and it will burn a lot because of the frequent usage.</li>
            <li>I have only had it for three weeks, and am really uncertain how it will work for my existing hyperpigmentation and scars, but it seems to be doing it&#x27;s job.  </li>
            <li>B002GJPI0U HQ+ Gel Peel, Roll-on (Professional)]]    </li>
            <li>ive tried almost all of the peels on here and none have made me frost like this.my whole face turned white and did the whole process the next day.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s worth noting that I&#x27;ve had to be extremely careful about sunlight.</li>
            <li>like I could leave the house without makeup on with confidence for the first time in a very, very long time.</li>
            <li>Typically with strong chemical peels, my skin would become very dry and peel in the affected area, but I saw mark lighten significantly and almost disappear by a month of use (every other day to 3xs a week).</li>
            <li>The first time I had no problems but the 2nd and 3rd time I received my package</li>
            <li>I did not rinse well enough the first time I used the peel and was really red.</li>
            <li>My skin peels for about 2 days after using the peel,then it stops peeling and goes back to normal.</li>
            <li>It does not really burn, in my opinion, and works gently and quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also!</li>
            <li>I also ordered the Salicylic Acid 2-% gel peel and tried it a couple of days after the HQ+ Gel Peel and got the results I expected, even after the first application.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product with another peel and was a little leary of the application method, however this product was better than I expected.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve barely had one break out even during my cycle!</li>
            <li>No other issues</li>
            <li>I rinsed and in addition to less pain, there was less redness, but a bit more of the foamy look that says it penetrated well.</li>
            <li>I can barely noticed the scars fading away.</li>
            <li>I have used the peel a total of 5 times so far.</li>
            <li>The first two times I put it on for less than 10 minutes, my face didn&#x27;t peel at all.  </li>
            <li>Well, within a couple of days, no real peeling, but I could see a slight difference in the scar and a fresh garden patch of acnevthat had been threatening to sprout on my left cheek was completely heeled.</li>
            <li>I left it on for 5 minutes and probably should have gone longer, but I was a little nervous as this was my first time using a home peel product.     </li>
            <li>I used the little that was left - enough to lightly cover my face and chest area - and after reading other reviews I was prepared to wash it off within a minute or two.</li>
            <li>Terribly so much time to wait in order that emptiness comes, there are many complaints and claims from which always the flask comes badly sealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I mean, if you&#x27;re going to go as far as a skin peel (even a gentle one) why not go all the way &amp; ensure your new skin is the best it can be? :)</li>
            <li> so I have hope for better results after a few more treatments.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I healed completely and my skin in that area is now very smooth and clear.  </li>
            <li> The peeling is very gentle and I am able to wear makeup the next day.</li>
            <li> hyperpigmentation(which was why I bought the glycolic acid in the first place).</li>
            <li> and I have not recieved a refund from the first packaging mishap.  </li>
            <li> The first time because my sitch is grave, and truth be told, my sitch is also impatience.</li>
            <li> on, I have the first ever chance of appearing as a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; beauty w/3 lbs.</li>

            <li> today, i have my first HQ peeling.</li>
            <li> but this is my first home peel.</li>
            <li> can already tell that the size of my pores appears smaller and that my skin tone is more even.</li>
            <li> i tested it on my wrist first, then did my whole face.</li>

            <li> My situation, fair skin bi racial w/very dark scarring tendencies, sensitive skin, and PCOS razor bump scars under chin.</li>
            <li> large pores.</li>
            <li> I just received my order of Elicina snail cream which promises to treat acne scars, fine lines &amp; wrinkles &amp; the overall texture of the skin</li>
            <li> and i could really see a huge difference in the appearance of my red marks.</li>
            <li> , they worked very well with acne and oily skin.</li>
            <li> It wiped off gently w/</li>
            <li> It wiped off gently w/</li>
            <li> I read a review that said that the user didn&#x27;t see real results until the 5th week</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really make my skin visibly</li>
            <li> I have used twice now - it is a gentle peel -  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t really burn my skin, which rly surprise me.</li>
            <li> I get an occasional light peel from a Spa</li>
            <li> As of 3 months later, the results are fantastic.  </li>
            <li> It was kind of embarrassing to walk around with this huge stain on my face, however, by day 3, my skin started to peel and by the next morning, all of that dead skin peeled off to reveal newer, fresher skin underneath without any scarring or discoloration.  </li>
            <li> a real person with acne scars</li>
            <li> It is plainly well designed to do no harm, and that will help greatly with my ability to use this product in the future, because i trust there pledge to care for my skin as much as i do.</li>

            <li> Unlike the TCI peels, and other far harsher products, i got simply amazing results</li>
            <li> Unlike the TCI peels, and other far harsher products, i got simply amazing results</li>
            <li> If you use this product, just be sure to rinse your nostril area very carefully and use LOTS of water.</li>
            <li> I also apply Aveeno Positively Radiant moisturizer sp15 (my regular daily moisturizer) afterward which seems to have gone over well with my skin :)</li>
            <li> Immediately, I&#x27;m bracing for the pain, but much like losing a chemical peel cherry, it only really hurt like hell the very first time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not hurt very much, just a warmth which is easily tamed with some cool water.&lt;br /&gt;There is barely downtime as well if you do not leave it on longer than a few minutes.</li>
            <li> As with any non-surgical skin procedure, it takes time and regular use to see the full benefits.  </li>
            <li> Per directions, I simply rinsed w/copious amounts of cool tap water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using other exfoliating products like Olay&#x27;s Definity line (recently started it), Obagi&#x27;s Vitamin C line (great for reducing dark spots and evening skin tone), Dior (love it!), and other products.     </li>
            <li> I did have to leave it on for the maximum time (or more) in order to have slight peeling within about 48 hours.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve just been particularly cautious with the sun while I&#x27;m using this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would and have highly recommended this product.</li>
            <li> so far no negative skin reactions, which is positive.</li>
            <li> I have decided not to purchase this product anymore (despite its effectiveness) due to this fact and will look for products containing more natural ingredients, like arbutin-a and kojic acid.</li>
            <li> I like the little rollerball on the top of the bottle to use on just the spots.....</li>
            <li> and it really helped clear my acne.</li>
            <li> This peel does take more than a few applications for it to work.</li>
            <li> I wasnt sure dead skin gone at all.  </li>
            <li> I used retinol (heavily) next day and then saw shiny fresh skin.</li>
            <li> The stinging and redness largely went away immediately, and what didn&#x27;t, appeared normal after the combination of my usual moisturizer and maybe ten minutes of resting w/a cool, strong drink in hand.</li>
            <li> My skin is very prone to scarring, so once I get a big blemish, it stays with me for a long time, which is why I am so glad that this not only shrinks, but stops new blemishes.</li>
            <li> so I worked very fast to do it, and then my entire face and neck.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle on the first bottle i was using it about three times a week.</li>
            <li> , so i tested it out for the first time last night...</li>
            <li> , i got fantastic results without the extreme side effects!</li>
            <li> , i got fantastic results without the extreme side effects!</li>
            <li> but I think that&#x27;s probably partly because I use the Aveeno Face Pads to wash my face (only the soft side &amp; very gently)</li>
            <li> Clearly when it comes to healing and results, patience is a chemical peels</li>
            <li> Clearly when it comes to healing and results, patience is a chemical peels</li>
            <li> Later, I noticed a huge red patch on my left cheek which looked like &amp; hurt like a sunburn.</li>
            <li> and it will burn a lot because of the frequent usage.</li>
            <li> I have only had it for three weeks, and am really uncertain how it will work for my existing hyperpigmentation and scars, but it seems to be doing it&#x27;s job.  </li>
            <li> B002GJPI0U HQ+ Gel Peel, Roll-on (Professional)]]    </li>
            <li> ive tried almost all of the peels on here and none have made me frost like this.my whole face turned white and did the whole process the next day.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s worth noting that I&#x27;ve had to be extremely careful about sunlight.</li>
            <li> like I could leave the house without makeup on with confidence for the first time in a very, very long time.</li>
            <li> Typically with strong chemical peels, my skin would become very dry and peel in the affected area, but I saw mark lighten significantly and almost disappear by a month of use (every other day to 3xs a week).</li>
            <li> The first time I had no problems but the 2nd and 3rd time I received my package</li>
            <li> I did not rinse well enough the first time I used the peel and was really red.</li>
            <li> My skin peels for about 2 days after using the peel,then it stops peeling and goes back to normal.</li>
            <li> It does not really burn, in my opinion, and works gently and quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also!</li>
            <li> I also ordered the Salicylic Acid 2-% gel peel and tried it a couple of days after the HQ+ Gel Peel and got the results I expected, even after the first application.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product with another peel and was a little leary of the application method, however this product was better than I expected.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve barely had one break out even during my cycle!</li>
            <li> No other issues</li>
            <li> I rinsed and in addition to less pain, there was less redness, but a bit more of the foamy look that says it penetrated well.</li>
            <li> I can barely noticed the scars fading away.</li>
            <li> I have used the peel a total of 5 times so far.</li>
            <li> The first two times I put it on for less than 10 minutes, my face didn&#x27;t peel at all.  </li>
            <li> Well, within a couple of days, no real peeling, but I could see a slight difference in the scar and a fresh garden patch of acnevthat had been threatening to sprout on my left cheek was completely heeled.</li>
            <li> I left it on for 5 minutes and probably should have gone longer, but I was a little nervous as this was my first time using a home peel product.     </li>
            <li> I used the little that was left - enough to lightly cover my face and chest area - and after reading other reviews I was prepared to wash it off within a minute or two.</li>
            <li> Terribly so much time to wait in order that emptiness comes, there are many complaints and claims from which always the flask comes badly sealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When my skin healed, the large pores were much smaller, old scars were softer and discoloration was greatly decreased.</li>
            <li> I could only tell if I missed any areas by waiting for it to dry to a chalky white, which was a couple of minutes into it.</li>
            <li> It faded by at least 75% after the first application.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product a few times and there were two occasions when the product was a little too strong and caused my skin to turn red for a few days as a result of the irritation.  </li>
            <li> Everything appeared the same otherwise, until 2 days later when I began to peel a little, but it wasn&#x27;t major, so I was still on the fence about effectiveness.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m hoping they will be completely gone within the next few applications.  </li>
            <li> So i decided to use it more often and this is where i went crazy</li>
            <li> It may have had minor effects on the bumpiness but for the cost I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.  </li>
            <li> Still a ways to go though trying to tame my adult acne skin and overactive oil/sebum production.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using GM Collin ceramides to ease the dry skin/peeling.</li>
            <li> There were obvious patches of what could only be termed as dead skin whiteness like you might slough off your feet after a soak, but around my nose &amp; chin.</li>

            <li> i ended up putting copious amounts of Vaseline on my face and ice on and off but after 3 more days it stopped hurting and the dry, peeling skin wasn&#x27;t so bad</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is my second bottle on the first bottle i was using it about three times a week. I can barely noticed the scars fading away. So i decided to use it more often and this is where i went crazy but it was WORTH IT. i used the product twice a day and I did that for about three weeks and it will burn a lot because of the frequent usage. Make sure you don&#x27;t have any special events you have to attend, as a matter of fact, avoid going out, because people will be staring at your face because it will peel so much, i meant it was like my skin was coming off. But after that i stop using the product and it took about 6-8 days for all the dead skin on my face to come off.&lt;br /&gt;It totally pays off i did that.&lt;br /&gt;When i have days off again, i&#x27;ll do it again and this time my skin will be scares free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. During that time ran about 10-15 miles a week, and drank about a gallon of water a day.</li>
            <li> Ok..so I bought this product because I was wanting it to help with-hyperpigmentation/acne scars(red dots &amp;&amp; little indents)/acne/oily skin/large pores. Before I had bought this product, I was a user of the glycolic acid peel 35% and 50%, they worked very well with acne and oily skin. But it didn&#x27;t work well at fading hyperpigmentation(which was why I bought the glycolic acid in the first place). So, I try the HQ+ peel on a small spot of a breakout. It did sting way more than the glycolic acid, but it wasn&#x27;t unbearable. The next day I notice my skin start to peel and the acne in that spot had shrunk in size. I now tried the product on other spots, like my forehead and chin. The pores on my forehead were so much smaller after rinsing off the peel. I will continue to use this product once a week and every week, and after a few weeks I will comment my further results!(:  -*-*-*-*-*-*-*  *UPDATE:  I have used the peel a total of 5 times so far. I will say that I didn&#x27;t see any difference at all in my acne scars, UNTIL the 5th time. The 5th time I used the peel, the next day I saw that my acne scars were much less visible(which made me very happy). I&#x27;m hoping they will be completely gone within the next few applications.  Note: This peel made my skin peel like crazy, even though I used lots of moisturizer. So if you are going to buy this, I suggest you buy a VERY good moisturizer because you will need it. My skin peels for about 2 days after using the peel,then it stops peeling and goes back to normal. This peel does take more than a few applications for it to work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using retin-A for a year or so with great results.  Adding weekly applications of this product has improved my skin texture and evened out my skin pigmentation even more. As with any non-surgical skin procedure, it takes time and regular use to see the full benefits.  There will be some stinging -- after all, these are acids! But overall, I am happy with this product and plan to continue using it.</li>
            <li> The product seems to work in lightening dark spots, but I am having a difficult time receiving the product due to inappropriate packaging.  The first time I had no problems but the 2nd and 3rd time I received my package all of the liquid has leaked out leaving me with no product to use and I have not recieved a refund from the first packaging mishap.  I am very disappointed since I think the product was starting to work, but I don&#x27;t think I will be ordering it again from this seller.</li>
            <li> i bought this product to fade acne scars. i tested it on my wrist first, then did my whole face. not such a great idea. this stuff burns and 1-2 days later is extremely painful. i ended up putting copious amounts of Vaseline on my face and ice on and off but after 3 more days it stopped hurting and the dry, peeling skin wasn&#x27;t so bad and i could really see a huge difference in the appearance of my red marks. this product works but it sure hurts! no pain no gain right?</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product.  I have mild acne and a lot of scars from the acne.  What I like most is that it is easy to apply on the spots that need to be treated, and within a day, new breakouts are almost gone.  My skin is very prone to scarring, so once I get a big blemish, it stays with me for a long time, which is why I am so glad that this not only shrinks, but stops new blemishes. I have had about 10 pimples begin to show since I&#x27;ve had this product and all of them have shrunk and then disappeard within two days--without leaving scars!     I have only had it for three weeks, and am really uncertain how it will work for my existing hyperpigmentation and scars, but it seems to be doing it&#x27;s job.  I did have to leave it on for the maximum time (or more) in order to have slight peeling within about 48 hours.  The first two times I put it on for less than 10 minutes, my face didn&#x27;t peel at all.  I&#x27;m not really sure that your face does have to peel to get the same results, but it seems to me that it would be necessary.      Also, it does sting, but not bad at all--comparable to alcohol, or concentrated salycilic acid.  It only stings while you have it on and for a couple minutes after you rinse it off.      I would and have highly recommended this product.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B002GJPI0U HQ+ Gel Peel, Roll-on (Professional)]]    This peel is great. I had immediate results. My skin tightened up right away and it really helped clear my acne. Three days after application, I began to peel. I had some redness, but not severe. When my skin healed, the large pores were much smaller, old scars were softer and discoloration was greatly decreased. I had a huge, ugly age spot that is now almost gone. It faded by at least 75% after the first application.  If you use this product, just be sure to rinse your nostril area very carefully and use LOTS of water. I did not rinse well enough the first time I used the peel and was really red. Luckily, I healed completely and my skin in that area is now very smooth and clear.  The roller made this peel easy to apply quickly.  My order arrived in about eight days and the roll-on bottle and product was intact.</li>
            <li> This product did not give me the results I was hoping for. Only a very slight peel with no improvement for melasma.</li>
            <li> My situation, fair skin bi racial w/very dark scarring tendencies, sensitive skin, and PCOS razor bump scars under chin. In other words, I&#x27;ve been using a lot of expensive makeup for years to cover my situation. So here&#x27;s what happened... The roll on applicator made it very easy to firstly apply the peel to the darkest portions. It stung like a bee sting so I worked very fast to do it, and then my entire face and neck. Easy-peezy! Despite the suggestion to start w/a minute I twitched, fidgeted, gritted my teeth, and danced around for a full 2 mins. The first time because my sitch is grave, and truth be told, my sitch is also impatience. In the mirror I looked a bit red, especially around the more delicate areas like the cheeks and my neck looked raw &amp; angry. Per directions, I simply rinsed w/copious amounts of cool tap water. The stinging and redness largely went away immediately, and what didn&#x27;t, appeared normal after the combination of my usual moisturizer and maybe ten minutes of resting w/a cool, strong drink in hand. After rinsing, there was absolutely no pain! Well, within a couple of days, no real peeling, but I could see a slight difference in the scar and a fresh garden patch of acnevthat had been threatening to sprout on my left cheek was completely heeled. But, I knew my intolerance to pain had not given me the results I deserved, so the 3rd day (yeah, I think I said I was impatient, and I was close to half way through my vacation days... HomeSpa treat!) I did it another peel. Immediately, I&#x27;m bracing for the pain, but much like losing a chemical peel cherry, it only really hurt like hell the very first time. This second time it just felt mildly annoying like a sibling poking you repeatedly on a long road trip, so  I went the full 4mins. &amp; could have gone further, but the directions expressly forbid it, so I grudgingly complied. I rinsed and in addition to less pain, there was less redness, but a bit more of the foamy look that says it penetrated well. There were obvious patches of what could only be termed as dead skin whiteness like you might slough off your feet after a soak, but around my nose &amp; chin. It wiped off gently w/the wet towel and I was careful because there is a risk of tearing the skin when it&#x27;s in such a delicate state. Everything appeared the same otherwise, until 2 days later when I began to peel a little, but it wasn&#x27;t major, so I was still on the fence about effectiveness. There goes my impatience talking again! However, four days post peel, the dark brownish red plethora of razor bumps/acne scars were easily half as dark. Clearly when it comes to healing and results, patience is a chemical peels bestie! The combination of acids in the HQ peel, plus the extra ingredient of hydroquinone (spelling?) to fade scars penetrated deep enough to perform the sort of miracle I&#x27;ve been waiting for for years. This summer, w/ [[ASIN:B003I89H5U Neutrogena Age Shield Face Sunblock SPF 90 - 3.0 oz.]] on, I have the first ever chance of appearing as a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; beauty w/3 lbs. Less makeup to cover the scars. That kind of reward is heartfelt. I would chance a guess that between first application, and the second one where I doubled up on the product to cover my whole face over twice, I&#x27;ve used about 2/10ths of the product, so this is great bang for your bucks. Unlike the TCI peels, and other far harsher products, i got simply amazing results w/out huge dark patches of dead skin and days of red gooey rawness (youtube vids will both caution you and scare you silly, but offer valuable info as well), i got fantastic results without the extreme side effects! It is plainly well designed to do no harm, and that will help greatly with my ability to use this product in the future, because i trust there pledge to care for my skin as much as i do. I love this peel better than the rest!

            <li> I used to get chemical peels at a salon/day spa. My skin loves peels &amp; I could always leave the peel on for the full amount of time.  I decided to try the HQ roll on peel because I have acne scars &amp; uneven skin tone. I&#x27;ve been using this peel once a week for 3 weeks &amp; it makes my skin peel for a couple of days afterwards. I&#x27;ve been using GM Collin ceramides to ease the dry skin/peeling. I read a review that said that the user didn&#x27;t see real results until the 5th week so I have hope for better results after a few more treatments. It definitely stings when I put it on but it isn&#x27;t intolerable. I leave it on for the full time of 4 minutes but I would recommend that you work your way up to that starting at 1-2 minutes especially if you are a virgin to peels. I just received my order of Elicina snail cream which promises to treat acne scars, fine lines &amp; wrinkles &amp; the overall texture of the skin so I&#x27;m hoping these 2 products will work nicely together. I&#x27;ll try to update this review soon. Good luck!</li>
            <li> it arrived so quickly, i was really excited. the only thing that annoyed me was it had leaked a bit by the time it arrived, but nothing major.&lt;br /&gt;okay, so i tested it out for the first time last night... the stinging did not bother me at all, it merely felt similar to rubbing alcohol. so far no negative skin reactions, which is positive. the roll on makes for a simple application which i like though i have no idea how that compares to the other version. i have not really noticed any changes so far but i know since it&#x27;s a light peel it&#x27;ll take a few applications. i&#x27;ll update further after some time has passed!&lt;br /&gt;++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;br /&gt;(LATER)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so it&#x27;s been about 3 weeks &amp; I&#x27;ve just done my 3rd application. I think this product is terrific! My skin is incredibly soft &amp; smooth. I&#x27;ve definitely notice it has cleaned out my pores, made my skin tighter but still \\&quot;plush\\&quot;, I&#x27;ve barely had one break out even during my cycle! Oh &amp; my skin tone is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t really make my skin visibly \\&quot;peel\\&quot; which I&#x27;m happy about, but I think that&#x27;s probably partly because I use the Aveeno Face Pads to wash my face (only the soft side &amp; very gently) so it probably clears away any lurking dead skin cells on the surface. I also apply Aveeno Positively Radiant moisturizer sp15 (my regular daily moisturizer) afterward which seems to have gone over well with my skin :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, it&#x27;s worth noting that I&#x27;ve had to be extremely careful about sunlight. The first time I applied it to my entire face (instead of a small part as a test) I got a lot of sun on the left side of my face from my sunny window. Later, I noticed a huge red patch on my left cheek which looked like &amp; hurt like a sunburn. I put lots of the moisturizer on it &amp; it faded in about a day or two. No other issues but I&#x27;ve just been particularly cautious with the sun while I&#x27;m using this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff has been so fantastic. It does not really burn, in my opinion, and works gently and quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also! If you&#x27;re considering doing a skin peel, maybe think about what you&#x27;re eating during the healing process. I&#x27;ve been eating lots of avacados, walnuts, salmon, tomato sauce, green &amp; white teas w/honey, sweet potatoes/yams, &amp; pomagrantes since they all have excellent skin benefits. I mean, if you&#x27;re going to go as far as a skin peel (even a gentle one) why not go all the way &amp; ensure your new skin is the best it can be? :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helped anyone who was curious!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;++++++++&lt;br /&gt;MONTH LATER&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the amazing effects aren&#x27;t very lasting though I do still think it was worth it &amp; has helped over all.idering doing a skin peel, maybe think about what you&#x27;re eating during the healing process.

            <li> The product seems to be working with no ill side effects.  The only complaint is the roller ball sticks.</li>
            <li> I have used twice now - it is a gentle peel -  have not seen yet an improvement yet in wrinkles and age spots - but product is as described.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in an attempt to treat a condition I have called keratosis pilaris, which is bumps and redness on the back of the arms.  I thought I would give it a shot as nothing else has worked.  It may have had minor effects on the bumpiness but for the cost I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.  I applied the product and felt no pain whatsoever on the back of my arms, I washed it off after 5 minutes as instructed and moisturized after that.  It sounds like it works better for acne and may be worth the cost for that.</li>
            <li> I like the little rollerball on the top of the bottle to use on just the spots.....I ordered more because it&#x27;s good to have around.</li>
            <li> The product is good for a first time user.  I should have got one stronger and will order it soon.</li>
            <li> today, i have my first HQ peeling. Although, i had other peeling before, but i still apply it very carefully. i put it on my face and let it stay for around 2 mins. it doesn&#x27;t really burn my skin, which rly surprise me. but the design of the roll is suck, it dose rly work; i will juz use my brush next time!</li>
            <li> Most of the product had leaked out during shipping, as others have mentioned in their reviews (Amazon handled the return with NO problems - even paid for the return shipping!). I used the little that was left - enough to lightly cover my face and chest area - and after reading other reviews I was prepared to wash it off within a minute or two. However, I didn&#x27;t have a reaction to it at all - no stinging, no burning, no redness. It did have a smell, but not overwhelming or bothersome. I left it on for 5 minutes and probably should have gone longer, but I was a little nervous as this was my first time using a home peel product.     I&#x27;m going to order it in the bottle instead of the roll-on because the reviews suggest that it&#x27;ll work better. Also, I didn&#x27;t feel that I was getting even and all-over coverage using the roll-on. I could only tell if I missed any areas by waiting for it to dry to a chalky white, which was a couple of minutes into it. By then if I did miss a spot then that spot wouldn&#x27;t have the same treatment as the surrounding skin.     I get an occasional light peel from a Spa but this is my first home peel. I think that my skin may he built up a tolerance which is why I didn&#x27;t get the stinging, burning, redness or sloughing that others got.  I&#x27;ve been using other exfoliating products like Olay&#x27;s Definity line (recently started it), Obagi&#x27;s Vitamin C line (great for reducing dark spots and evening skin tone), Dior (love it!), and other products.     SIDE NOTE: I also ordered the Salicylic Acid 2-% gel peel and tried it a couple of days after the HQ+ Gel Peel and got the results I expected, even after the first application. My skin is smooth, has a more even tone, and my pores are smaller (yeah!). It didn&#x27;t do anything for my acne scars (yet), but I have only used the Salicylic once. I suggest buying this as well. They&#x27;re only $18.95 each when you buy both together. And, salicylic acid is \\&quot;self neutralizing\\&quot; which means it stops working after 8 to 10 minutes and you can use it 3-4 times a week, per the instructions.</li>
            <li> I have melasma &amp; after 10 uses, I am seeing some results!  Melasma is slowly fading &amp; breaking up into freckle sized bits.  Acne scars lightened dramatically.  I promised to update if I saw an improvement &amp; I did.  Be patient &amp; you will see some change.  **UPDATE**  As of 3 months later, the results are fantastic.  Melasma is dramatically improved.  Stick with it ladies, you will get results!</li>
            <li> Terribly so much time to wait in order that emptiness comes, there are many complaints and claims from which always the flask comes badly sealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I could not realize the test of if it works, SKIN LABORATORY does not seal the packings. NOT RECOMMENDED&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Espa&amp;ntilde;ol&lt;br /&gt;Pesimo, SKIN LABORATORIO no envia sellado el envase por lo que facilmente se derrama el producto, esperar tanto tiempo para nada, ha llegado vacio el envase y una frustacion de dinero perdido.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pesimo pesimo y pesimo</li>
            <li> It is a good product but didn&#x27;t seem to be quite what I needed.  For some, I am sure this product works great.</li>
            <li> Said to leave on just 2 minutes max and it feels like you better listen and rinse soon but after redness fades I wasnt sure dead skin gone at all.  I used retinol (heavily) next day and then saw shiny fresh skin. Cant say what worked.</li>
            <li> This product is very strong.  Great for deeper scars and discolorations.  I&#x27;ve used this product a few times and there were two occasions when the product was a little too strong and caused my skin to turn red for a few days as a result of the irritation.  It was kind of embarrassing to walk around with this huge stain on my face, however, by day 3, my skin started to peel and by the next morning, all of that dead skin peeled off to reveal newer, fresher skin underneath without any scarring or discoloration.  Works great on scars and hyperpigmentation on the body, including back and chest (for those who have had acne on these areas).  Despite all that, I was happy with the fact that it eliminated my acne blemishes.  I give it 4 stars, however, because this product contains hydroquinone which has been linked to various side effects.  Some studies have shown that this chemical can cause the growth of cancer cells.  I have decided not to purchase this product anymore (despite its effectiveness) due to this fact and will look for products containing more natural ingredients, like arbutin-a and kojic acid.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product with another peel and was a little leary of the application method, however this product was better than I expected. My 1st application cleared a lot of acne spots. I am looking forward to the results after my 3rd application. I will continue my review in a month....</li>
            <li> I love the HQ Gel Peel. I use it about once a month to help keep my skin looking bright and clear.&lt;br /&gt;It does not hurt very much, just a warmth which is easily tamed with some cool water.&lt;br /&gt;There is barely downtime as well if you do not leave it on longer than a few minutes. The peeling is very gentle and I am able to wear makeup the next day. It just looks a little flakey.&lt;br /&gt;I can already tell that the size of my pores appears smaller and that my skin tone is more even.</li>
            <li> i love love love the HQ peel. ive tried almost all of the peels on here and none have made me frost like this.my whole face turned white and did the whole process the next day. im 100% a real person with acne scars and i love this product!</li>
            <li> The product works. I&#x27;ve used it 6 times now. I&#x27;m quite satisfied with the results I&#x27;ve gotten. Still a ways to go though trying to tame my adult acne skin and overactive oil/sebum production. One tip, buy this in the regular bottle - http://www.amazon.com/HQ-Gel-Peel-30ml-Professional/dp/B002GJND8O . The roller bottle is a pain in the hinee. It doesn&#x27;t roll on &#x27;smoothly&#x27;. So skip the roller and go for a brush, cotton pad or non-latex sponge pad instead.</li>
            <li> I am African American and I have hyperpigmentation. After reading the reviews, I decided to purchase this roll on version of the HQ Gell Peel.  I don&#x27;t have acne, but when I do get a pimple or two they always leave a dark mark no matter what I do. After I cleanse my face, I would apply the roll on to the affected area. While I expirienced some discomfort, it was in no way as severe as some of the other reviews say. As long as you are applying the medication to a healed scar/mark you shouldn&#x27;t feel an extreme burning sensation. Typically with strong chemical peels, my skin would become very dry and peel in the affected area, but I saw mark lighten significantly and almost disappear by a month of use (every other day to 3xs a week). This product does work and delivers results.  I have lived with hyperpigmentation my entire life and with this product I felt like I could leave the house without makeup on with confidence for the first time in a very, very long time.</li>
