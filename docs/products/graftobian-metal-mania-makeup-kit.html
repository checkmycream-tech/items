            <li>Great look if you want to be golder than gold.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how great it looked.</li>
            <li>I would NEVER use this on a child after my reaction, but it worked great for me.</li>
            <li>This was great.</li>
            <li>Great coverage.</li>
            <li>The paint was great-</li>
            <li>This body (paint) powder is amazing!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>The effects of this make up are amazing</li>
            <li>I wore it for 4 hours and felt throbbing headache and irritation, otherwise I looked golden (which was great)..</li>
            <li>This makeup goes on easily and stays on!</li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly and opaque.</li>
            <li>This was a fantastic product!  </li>
            <li>I wish it came with more sealer however</li>
            <li>Overall it was excellent make up though!</li>
            <li>The paint didn&#x27;t crack after many hours.</li>
            <li>I wish they gave you more binder, but that is easily found.</li>
            <li>After, it came off easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li>It was also ridiculously easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It also comes of easily with soap and water.  </li>
            <li>It also come off easily in the shower.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to mix with the fixate.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, stayed on well and removed quickly.</li>
            <li>After purchasing thee \\&quot;gold\\&quot; makeup for Halloween, this was my final pick and by far the best.</li>
            <li>The makeup goes on and drys quickly.</li>
            <li>It can work well as a super metallic shadow/powder as well as with the mixing liquid..</li>
            <li>There could have been a greater amount of adhering solution, there was definitley more powder left over if you use the mixing ratio on the box.</li>
            <li>I also would purchase a larger bottle of the Magic Mixing liquid if you&#x27;re painting more than a face or truck.</li>
            <li>It was a greener than i would have liked but gold enough for the night.</li>
            <li>also put some on some shoes to make them gold and it washed right off.</li>
            <li>Be sure to mix it correctly and use less liquid, it comes out thicker and gives you a better gold look.  </li>
            <li>there was more than enough to cover those parts.</li>
            <li>First time using this stuff.</li>
            <li>No ill affects</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely getting more.  </li>
            <li>They give you so much!</li>
            <li>Lots of positive comments.</li>
            <li>Be careful if you get headaches easy as this stuff can do that to you!</li>
            <li>it went on easily but only came off with soap and water.</li>
            <li>Do NOT use to much on your body, it is toxic and I felt woozy for a couple of days after using.</li>
            <li>I went the whole night without losing it.</li>
            <li>I did notice it started turning a slightly greenish tint after a while particularly when I was warm</li>
            <li>It came off fine in the shower (a bit of scrubbing required for the face) and the little amount that transferred onto my dress came off fine in a regular wash.</li>
            <li>makes a huge mess to apply though.</li>
            <li>However, if you are painting a lot or a large part of your body (I painted a man to look like an Oscar, so an entire body)</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t get much of the liquid mixer to do an entire body but the truth is you can mix it with water and it works the same.  </li>
            <li>We still have about half of a container of powder after painting a whole body!</li>
            <li>A lovely dramatic gold.</li>
            <li>I only used a small portion of the powder and was able to cover half of his body in gold.</li>
            <li>The gold looked very realistic and didn&#x27;t rub off all over everything after it dried.  </li>

            <li> The gold looked very realistic and didn&#x27;t rub off all over everything after it dried.  </li>
            <li> I covered my hair and face and it wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable and washed off easy.</li>
            <li> It came off reasonably well in water, although some areas (the nooks and crannies of my face) were harder to clean and the copper oxidized, making me look green and ill the day after use, but it eventually came off.  </li>
            <li> and it goes on opaque and lasts on the skin for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest that during application to dab it on your skin with the sponge instead of making long strokes, because there were cuts along my leg afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I mixed it with a little bit of water since the package doesn&#x27;t come with enough liquid to mix it together.  </li>
            <li> It gave a very dramatic look and easy to wash off.  </li>
            <li> have a ton left over since i only needed it in a few areas on my skin.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a really long way.</li>
            <li> So a little amount goes a LONG WAY!</li>
            <li> It stayed on all night, and as other reviews said, a little went a long way!  </li>
            <li> Was not worth the risk of our health.</li>
            <li> However, if you would rub up on something dark, you could see the gold paint.</li>
            <li> I have a half sleeve and it covered all of my tattoos in one coat.</li>
            <li> And don&#x27;t let that little jar fool you.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I have to say is that you need at least two jars of the setting liquid for one jar of the powder.</li>
            <li> It started to get a green tint after about 5 hours though.</li>
            <li> I used to make my arm look metal for a convention and after it dried it didn&#x27;t rub off.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what effect this make up</li>
            <li> Seriously mix just a tinyyyy bit at a time.  </li>
            <li> made my friend and I VERY SICK for two days after we used it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> DO NOT BUY!&lt;br /&gt;This made my friend and I VERY SICK for two days after we used it. It clogged our pores and gave us chemical pneumonia. Was not worth the risk of our health.</li>
            <li> This was a fantastic product!  Be sure to mix it correctly and use less liquid, it comes out thicker and gives you a better gold look.  I mixed it with a little bit of water since the package doesn&#x27;t come with enough liquid to mix it together.  Do NOT use to much on your body, it is toxic and I felt woozy for a couple of days after using.</li>
            <li> After purchasing thee \\&quot;gold\\&quot; makeup for Halloween, this was my final pick and by far the best. I went as a human trophy covering my head, arms, hands, etc. there was more than enough to cover those parts. The makeup goes on and drys quickly. I went the whole night without losing it. Aaaaa++++++</li>
            <li> This makeup goes on easily and stays on! Great look if you want to be golder than gold. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get enough of this! Love it! It can work well as a super metallic shadow/powder as well as with the mixing liquid.. it lasts a while on my models!</li>
            <li> First time using this stuff. I couldn&#x27;t believe how great it looked. Wore it to a rave. I was worried that it would melt off from sweat, but it held up like a champ. After, it came off easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li> I used this for a c3po costume. I have a half sleeve and it covered all of my tattoos in one coat. Lasted all night. It started to get a green tint after about 5 hours though. And my skin started prickling all over about then too, so I washed it off. I would NEVER use this on a child after my reaction, but it worked great for me. It was also ridiculously easy to apply. Took a bit of scrubbing to get it off. I washed myself twice and it was gone.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with application and results!  Easy to apply, stayed on well and removed quickly.</li>
            <li> So a little amount goes a LONG WAY! I put this on my face, necks, legs, arms and feet (everywhere not covered by a dress) for a James Bond themed party. I did notice it started turning a slightly greenish tint after a while particularly when I was warm but it worked perfectly. I had it on for about 6 hours. I don&#x27;t recommend covering the palm of your hand because if you hold drinks or need to wash your hands it will start to come off! It came off fine in the shower (a bit of scrubbing required for the face) and the little amount that transferred onto my dress came off fine in a regular wash. And I won the costume party!</li>
            <li> This was used for my child&#x27;s dance recital.  It gave a very dramatic look and easy to wash off.  No ill affects</li>
            <li> This was great. I used to make my arm look metal for a convention and after it dried it didn&#x27;t rub off. It also comes of easily with soap and water.  I&#x27;m definitely getting more.  I wish it came with more sealer however but plenty of gold powder left.</li>
            <li> The gold doesnt stick to skin</li>
            <li> Worked perfect for my sons Halloween Costume... We used it on his face, hair and hands.  The gold looked very realistic and didn&#x27;t rub off all over everything after it dried.  It also come off easily in the shower.</li>
            <li> I wore it for 4 hours and felt throbbing headache and irritation, otherwise I looked golden (which was great).. It&#x27;ll definitely stain your clothes and after one thorough wash, I still shine with a tinge of yellow according to my friends</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, a little goes a long way! Seriously mix just a tinyyyy bit at a time.  I use it to paint designs on my body and face for raves and festivals. Be careful if you get headaches easy as this stuff can do that to you!</li>
            <li> The effects of this make up are amazing and it goes on opaque and lasts on the skin for a long time.  I did notice after I washed the make up off my legs that my skin stung and there were micro-abrasions where the metal had cut through my skin.  I would suggest that during application to dab it on your skin with the sponge instead of making long strokes, because there were cuts along my leg afterwards.  I am not sure what effect this make up would have if applied to open wounds.</li>
            <li> This was perfect for the Egyptian goddess look I was trying to achieve. A lovely dramatic gold. Great coverage. Stayed on all night. Lots of positive comments.</li>
            <li> I wore this gold body paint to a NYE rave and i was expecting it to come off as soon as someone would rub against me but that wasn&#x27;t the case!  It even stayed on through all of my dancing and sweating.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to mix with the fixate. It goes on very smoothly and opaque. AND it stays on your face until you wash it off with soap and water, even if you wear it as a lipstick. And don&#x27;t let that little jar fool you. A little goes a really long way. You could cover your body with what&#x27;s in that jar.</li>
            <li> The paint was great- it went on easily but only came off with soap and water. The only negative thing I have to say is that you need at least two jars of the setting liquid for one jar of the powder.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t get much of the liquid mixer to do an entire body but the truth is you can mix it with water and it works the same.  The outcome was great!</li>
            <li> I go to a masquerade every year and wanted some gold skin. It was a greener than i would have liked but gold enough for the night. makes a huge mess to apply though. and to remove. have a ton left over since i only needed it in a few areas on my skin. also put some on some shoes to make them gold and it washed right off.</li>
            <li> I was definitely a stand out at the party I attended in this makeup!  It stayed on all night, and as other reviews said, a little went a long way!  There could have been a greater amount of adhering solution, there was definitley more powder left over if you use the mixing ratio on the box. It came off reasonably well in water, although some areas (the nooks and crannies of my face) were harder to clean and the copper oxidized, making me look green and ill the day after use, but it eventually came off.  Overall it was excellent make up though!</li>
            <li> This body (paint) powder is amazing! However, if you are painting a lot or a large part of your body (I painted a man to look like an Oscar, so an entire body) I would suggest a larger sponge! I also would purchase a larger bottle of the Magic Mixing liquid if you&#x27;re painting more than a face or truck. The paint didn&#x27;t crack after many hours. However, if you would rub up on something dark, you could see the gold paint. We still have about half of a container of powder after painting a whole body!</li>
            <li> I used this for a fashion show on one of my models. It is a great product! They give you so much! I only used a small portion of the powder and was able to cover half of his body in gold. I wish they gave you more binder, but that is easily found. For the price I paid, I am beyond impressed.</li>
            <li> This stuff works awesome! I covered my hair and face and it wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable and washed off easy.</li>
