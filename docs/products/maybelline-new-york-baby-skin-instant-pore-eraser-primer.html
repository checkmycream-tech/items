            <li>I was encouraged that this product was wonderful and like magic.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this product - it works awesome for me!</li>
            <li>Love this product it makes your skin look flawless !</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good primer, it doesn&#x27;t cancel pores out though.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feels good to touch, and no rash nor irritation from it.</li>
            <li>I had heard good things about how well this product works.</li>
            <li>None of these things seem to work well for my skin - this is not as good as the Porefessional by Benefit, though.</li>
            <li>A good choice for budget-conscious buyers.</li>
            <li>she loved this stuff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so good with makeup.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>and of really good quality</li>
            <li>#34;It&#x27;s your pores, do you use a filler?&amp;#34; So I told her I was using baby skin, and she didn&#x27;t have much good to say about it either.</li>
            <li>Not as good as Clinique&#x27;s Pore eraser, but a good runner up.</li>
            <li>It also works great on its own.</li>
            <li>A good primer and pore reducer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good pore minimizer that will work well under my make up</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also good for hiding flaky acne skin: rub some on the flakes, dab some concealer on with a brush, put your foundation on then blend it all together with a brush.</li>
            <li>it feels so good in the skin</li>
            <li>If I forget to put it on my foundation doesn&#x27;t look nearly as good.</li>
            <li>Do recommend and the also received very quickly as well!!</li>
            <li>Very good for the price, amazing, face feels velvety smooth, and works just as good as porefessional from sephora which is 31.00</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I thought well sure it makes your skin look great, and</li>
            <li>love it great product</li>
            <li>Feels great and blurs perfectly, I love it</li>
            <li>This is a great product if you like going without foundation:)</li>
            <li>this was 4$ a steal, I better order more!!</li>
            <li>Love wearing this even when I don&#x27;t wear foundation over it (which is 99.9% of the time) - it makes my skin feel silky smooth and flawless.</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>One of my favorite make up products I own!</li>
            <li>Lovely you!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>Try mixing it with a bit of foundation and watch the magic begin!</li>
            <li>I have been telling everyone I know about this product - go Maybelline, another cosmetic favorite!</li>
            <li>I love baby skin!</li>
            <li>I really love this!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>In my opinion works better than benefits porefessional !</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay but not for me!</li>
            <li>I love this product and will be using it for life!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>I want more now!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Love the baby skin pore eraser!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>The texture is really great and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Over all, very light and effective product for a good price</li>
            <li>Amazing products.</li>
            <li>Works great for a cheap price.</li>
            <li>Works great and leaves skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>Its great for light makeup looks.</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is surprisingly effective.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t suppose to make pores disappear, but it does do a nice job covering them.</li>
            <li>It kind of blurs</li>
            <li>Nice price for the amount given.</li>
            <li>Get a good primer, it&#x27;ll do you better.</li>
            <li>and it just feels nice on the skin.</li>
            <li>I really liked how it feels on my skin</li>
            <li>I like the way the primer feels, but honestly my foundation (I use BB cream)</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t notice a difference.</li>
            <li>But it does a nice finish in coverage</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I love this product and I&#x27;m so happy that I can find a good, cheap pore eraser</li>
            <li>This products honestly does not work.</li>
            <li>I liked this product</li>
            <li>Really liked it.</li>
            <li>It covers my pores in a nice way</li>
            <li>After applying, I had to squint at my own reflection to convince myself that I still HAD pores.</li>
            <li>As good as a sephora kind from sephora but its more concentrated.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to clean off too!!</li>
            <li>This stuff feels GREAT on my face and absorbs quickly making my skin feel like &amp;#34;Baby Skin&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I have very fair, oily skin with some large pores on and around the nose.  </li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t see the complete difference if you don&#x27;t aply with something else, I used the bb cream from Maybelline, my skin is flawless now!</li>
            <li>This is a great primer when you work with it the right way.</li>
            <li>Love love LOVE!</li>
            <li>Love love love this!</li>
            <li>Love the consistency of this product its very light weight and makes skin feel very smooth and does minimize most of my pores!</li>
            <li>However the price is great and it&#x27;s a good day to day primer type cover for those going for natural looks.</li>
            <li>Fantastic results, really smooths the skin and under makeup makes for an almost flawless look.</li>
            <li>I use it kind of like a moisturizer, and have also tried it under makeup, which is nice, and helps it look nicer for longer, but also come off more easily at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin very smooth in seconds.</li>
            <li>Would&#x27;ve been great if it&#x27;d worked as the price point is much better than the higher end stuff.</li>
            <li>When I use it with my full makeup it leaves my skin with a flawless finish, where as before you could really see my pores.</li>
            <li>Nice feel on, pretty good to lessen pores</li>
            <li>* Seller shipped super fast and product is delightful!</li>
            <li>My pores are huge and this stuff literally erases them!</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as amazing as people would hype it out to be, but it gets the job done (my huge pores are made to look semi-normal).</li>
            <li>but it sure does a hell of a job for the price</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>THIS IS MAGIC.</li>
            <li>Probably my favorite primer - even better than my smash box one.</li>
            <li>I do not have oily skin, if anything I run into more issues with dryness.</li>
            <li>It might even make them more visible.</li>
            <li>Amazing, this product goes on smooth on my face and it covers up any noticeable pores on my face.</li>
            <li>If you are looking to apply heavier creams or layering anything on for a more made up look, go for something else.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>just I love it-</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>Its ok.</li>
            <li>love this.</li>
            <li>This stuff is magical.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It would be better were it tinted.  </li>
            <li>Time to get some more.</li>
            <li>I love this primer</li>
            <li>so I really love something so affordable to use.</li>
            <li>love love love this stuff</li>
            <li>I love this primer.</li>
            <li>I love how this does what it says it will.</li>
            <li>I do want to add one more note</li>
            <li>Product was ok but made my face even oilier than what it is.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS...</li>
            <li>Not my favorite purchase.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this and use it as a primer over my others.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so smooth and shrinks my pores!</li>
            <li>I love this product--</li>
            <li>use it in addition to another green-based primer (because of my rosacea) to get the most out of it, as well as my foundation.</li>
            <li>The product feels like it just sits on top of your skin</li>
            <li>It made my skin feel like a baby for sure; it didnt, however keep my makeup from getting into my pours.i</li>
            <li>While it did seem to hide pores, my skin reacted to it by producing more oil.</li>
            <li>i LOVE this</li>
            <li>I love the way this makes my skin look and feel.</li>
            <li>I find it works better with some makeups than others.....</li>
            <li>I would not recommend it, but if you have small-looking pores then maybe you&#x27;ll have better luck than I did.</li>
            <li>I mostly don&#x27;t ware makeup, but I like to put put this primer on my face alone</li>
            <li>Nice light weight primer.</li>
            <li>and it had more pore-erasing power.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin look really smooth!</li>
            <li>but it seems to be out of stock most of the time.</li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>it feels like i&#x27;m just putting more oily stuff on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>She recommended NYX Pore Filler which I have since been using, and THAT is magical.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>This is an OKAY product.</li>
            <li>Wanted to love this.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t relate to the reviewers who said this made their face more oily.</li>
            <li>I love it, so</li>
            <li>I seriously am in love with this product.</li>
            <li>It holds onto foundation better than my skin alone.</li>
            <li>work?&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product with and without applying something on top.</li>
            <li>but mostly I don&#x27;t even use it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it, its not going to shrink your pores, that&#x27;s not what its made for.</li>
            <li>Love the texture of the primer it feels like silk</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this primer is okay.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT, YOUR SKIN WILL BE LIKE A BABY,</li>
            <li>HEHE I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my skin feel smooth as a baby&#x27;s backside!  </li>
            <li>I know you would love it too.</li>
            <li>If you have reasonable expectations, I think you will be happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>more so &amp;#34;blurs&amp;#34; your skin&#x27;s imperfections into a more visually appealing palette.</li>
            <li>Okay, I watched alot of youtube regarding this product.</li>
            <li>so when I run out I will buy more :)</li>
            <li>I love putting this on my face.</li>
            <li>But i still love it</li>
            <li>Love this as a primer for applying makeup.</li>
            <li>but it feels nice and smooth on the skin.</li>
            <li>I wish I could like it more.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this product</li>
            <li>but I love Baby Lips</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>All in all, my skin looks so much better with this on under my foundation.</li>
            <li>- I think I like it - gives the skin a nice smooth feel</li>
            <li>My skin felt smoother and I am sure that if I wore makeup it would look better with this.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>but it sure makes them not so visible.</li>
            <li>These seems more like a primer than just a pore eraser.  </li>
            <li>It makes your skin look nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
            <li>Its ok.</li>
            <li>I used it when I had pictures taken so that I could get a more polished look with my makeup</li>
            <li>I even stopped using my eyeshadow primer, because this does the trick even better.</li>
            <li>This stuff is just OK.  </li>
            <li>Ok maybe for some people it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just in love with this stuff 😊😊😊</li>
            <li>I love it bottom</li>
            <li>Better price than most.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>--I have this on auto, that&#x27;s how much I love this item</li>
            <li>still dont know if is making anything in my skin because i need to used more.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smooth and literally makes my pores disappear!</li>
            <li>It does not take much product for coverage and it feels very nice on the skin.  </li>
            <li>and I will be investing a lot of money in this tiny tube of Magic!!!</li>
            <li>It was a pretty good product i have oily skin</li>
            <li>Pretty good at minimizing pores, but I can still see them, they are not erased.  </li>
            <li>it truely smooths out your face, sets it nice  to add foundation.</li>
            <li>Pretty good primer...</li>
            <li>worth every penny!!</li>
            <li>so it glides on more easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It totally minimizes the appearance of the pores on my nose, so that when I apply my mineral make up, I have a smooth, flawless finish.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned with large pores so it might work for somebody else.</li>
            <li>good alternative to some of the more high end face primers</li>
            <li>But the reason I love it and can&#x27;t go without it is because it makes my makeup glide on so smooth and wear so well.</li>
            <li>You still have to put some foundation on it to have the more smooth look!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I could NOT believe the silky smooth consistency of this outstanding product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definately not as good as Porefessional (the much pricier product that it&#x27;s trying to emulate) but it does make a difference in pore visibility.</li>
            <li>I heard a lot of thing about this product, I&#x27;ve never used anything similar, but I decided to try it, and I loved it!</li>
            <li>I have easy to maintain skin,</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t noticed it clogging up pores, and washes off easily.</li>
            <li>, I was a make-up artist for many years, still am on special occasions, and one of my biggest request is the reduction of pores.</li>
            <li>Very smooth, a lol goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Basically this helps your base go on great and does a nice job of spackling those pores so your makeup looks more flawless.</li>
            <li>Feels slightly oily when you put it on but works great!</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a product to erase the look of pores and fine lines</li>
            <li>It is lightweight and smooth, easy to put make up over.</li>
            <li>Made my skin feel super smooth!</li>
            <li>Pretty good primer, just make sure that you don&#x27;t use too much or your foundation will start to separate.</li>
            <li>Glides on easily and perfect base to help any foundation glide on perfectly.</li>
            <li>I have huge pores</li>
            <li>I use it as a primer for my foundation, and there is a HUGE difference in how noticeable my pores are.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have huge pores and it still didn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li>My brother even tried it on his face, and he was amazed at what a huge difference it</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of how it felt a couple of hours after applying....</li>
            <li>This product goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>I put it on every morning and my face feels smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>Neither my primer nor my foundation lay smoothly over this product when applied.  </li>
            <li>It makes my face feel so smooth.</li>
            <li>I liked this product over my loreal studio primer, which is much thicker/heavier  </li>
            <li>Makeup goes on really smoothly afterwards too.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin sooooo smooth .</li>
            <li>but it is great for getting my make up to last all day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as smooth as Porefessional but for 1/5th of the price I&#x27;ll use it on my non-important days.</li>
            <li>I purchased it with the intention to use it as a primer, and it really is great if you are looking for a primer that will make your make up last all day.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really fill in the pores, kind of just smoothed out skin.</li>
            <li>I used Maybelline Dream Fresh BB cream over the top of this.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic and its price</li>
            <li>It has a smooth silky texture.  </li>
            <li>Works great, especially in combination with a foundation.</li>
            <li>I have to wait 5-10 minutes from applying the primer to applying my foundation if I want my foundation to go on smooth.</li>
            <li>Feels so smooth like you have nothing on at all.</li>
            <li>But it does smooth out my skin for makeup.</li>
            <li>Its so smooth and covers all my pores.</li>
            <li>Such s great product.</li>
            <li>It helps smooth out my pores and helps my foundation go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how people say it makes your skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li>Great experience, definitely will repurchase.</li>
            <li>It feel nice and make my skin soft and more even.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know how this will hold up in the summer, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>I have used many prestige brand pore &#x27;erasers&#x27;, and I have to say this is right up there with all of them.  </li>
            <li>I honestly really like it!!!</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite product!</li>
            <li>It does however leave my skin super soft feeling and it makes a good primer for makeup.</li>
            <li>Will always use this , very pleased and surprised ..</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I saw an advertisement for this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Love it, it does exactly what it says its supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>Face feels super smooth and easier to apply foundation.  </li>
            <li>me, while I would wear this on its own, it looked much better under my sheer BB cream.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use traditional liquid foundation, so on top of the pore eraser I put on a layer of BB cream (the Korean kind, not the American/tinted moisturizer type if that makes a difference).</li>
            <li>I love this product so much it makes my skin so smooth</li>
            <li>It almost feels lightly (super light) waxy.</li>
            <li>Not as good as smashbox, doesn&#x27;t really have much of an effect.</li>
            <li>: First, I put on moisturizer (Clinique Gel), then I apply a layer of normal primer all over (BareMinerals original), then I apply this on my problem spots, then I use a tinted moisturizer (BareMinerals Complexion Rescue) and top it off with a very, very light dusting of mineral powder (BareMinerals original).</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and very cheap.</li>
            <li>Honestly it&#x27;s best used to cover up any dry or uneven skin, and can work fairly well as an eyeshadow primer.</li>
            <li>I have used it by itself too, it gives your skin a matte finish, if you have oily skin like me, it really helps absorb the oil, I have a huge decrease in shiny face!</li>
            <li>It gave my old face a beautiful finish that looked totally natural.</li>
            <li>Your skin feel so soft and amazing with this primer.  </li>
            <li>Love this because it really does blur blemishes and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>After trying both, I think that this comes very close to Benefits the Porefessional at a much better price</li>
            <li>Overall, a good product.</li>
            <li>This product is good, but not the best.&lt;br /&gt;I find that it definitely fills in my pores.</li>
            <li>it makes your face soft, it&#x27;s kind of like rubbing Paul Mitchell serum on your face.</li>
            <li>while back I purchased this primer after running out of the one I had ; the price was much more reasonable then the one I was paying from Benefit, and I had heard it was one of the really good one&#x27;s out there.</li>
            <li>Not bad</li>
            <li>Not a bad primer though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not bad...</li>
            <li>Not bad at all.</li>
            <li>The delayed eraser magic was just a pleasant surprise because I didn&#x27;t expect any changes a few hours</li>
            <li>yeah it is easy to use but there is far more to it than meets the eye.</li>
            <li>I wasnt sure at first about this product, it felt nice but wasnt instant results like posted on the packaging.</li>
            <li>Alone my pores were still present, but &amp;#34;blurred.&amp;#34; The pore eraser allowed my BB cream to sit nicely on top of my skin and not sink into my pores and make them more noticeable.</li>
            <li>I will be searching for a quick fox for a pore eraser.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just not 5 star worthy in my opinion</li>
            <li>Most of my make up is high end</li>
            <li>By mid-day my face was a lot more oily than normal.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s very hot and before using this my face would look like a grease pile by the end of the night.</li>
            <li>The cost is very reasonable!</li>
            <li>This stuff is very much reminds me of Smashbox without the price tag-Love it!</li>
            <li>if you have dry skin this would probably be good.</li>
            <li>if you have dry skin this is a good one</li>
            <li>It really works!!</li>
            <li>Ok... It is cheap, but it never dry ...</li>
            <li>It looked fine for about an hour and then got really oily.</li>
            <li>, the pores look significantly smaller.&lt;br /&gt;Since this is a makeup primer, it also helps to make my foundation look better than it does on just my bare skin alone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This cost a little more than I would have liked to pay....</li>
            <li>Did some research, consistently this got high reviews and this was a top pick on &amp;</li>
            <li>Makes your face smooth and ready for makeup.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel amazing enough to make it worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth, and I don&#x27;t really see it make a difference on my make up.</li>
            <li>Really does make your face feel baby smooth.</li>
            <li>This makes my face feel so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>Worth the buy 100%</li>
            <li>For the price it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more clear and silky like Revlon&#x27;s primer</li>
            <li>hide/fill pore in any way..not worth.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen much change in my pore size, but it&#x27;s good for just a regular primer.</li>
            <li>Nice texture, clear, but didn&#x27;t really do the job for me.</li>
            <li>I have a golden tan complexion so defintilty not for me.</li>
            <li>Honestly, though, I don&#x27;t see myself buying this product again just because I don&#x27;t think it makes that big of a difference.</li>
            <li>Not as good as expected</li>
            <li>Brand new, in the packaging, exactly what is said is what I got :)</li>
            <li>&amp; it makes my face SUPER soft, but could easily be scraped off with my finger nail.</li>
            <li>This is great for the raised red and dark areas on the face, it helps foundation and powder smooth over them!</li>
            <li>It went on feeling greasy right away and did not seem to cover my pores at all.</li>
            <li>Right Before My Eyes...Loved it and Will order Again</li>
            <li>This product does not allow my foundation and or powder to stick, it just wipes right off.</li>
            <li>And the price was right.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t wear under my make up: it slid right off.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think someone with good skin- not oily or dry- whose pores aren&#x27;t large to begin with- might see some effect,  but if that was the case, you wouldn&#x27;t need to buy a pore erasing product, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>A great way to layer, use this first, then a light layer of illuminating BB cream with sunscreen, then your concealer, then your favorite base makeup, then highlighter, then a light dusting of setting powder, then a light misting of finishing spray.</li>
            <li>(but works well for very large pores).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>he has very large pores on his nose-</li>
            <li>he has very large pores on his nose-</li>
            <li>Maybe I just have very large pores.</li>
            <li>even though the primer I use is barely tinted, it functions as a skin tone evener on top of priming my skin for foundation.  </li>
            <li>even though the primer I use is barely tinted, it functions as a skin tone evener on top of priming my skin for foundation.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure if it realy helps with the pores but it works great alone after my face lotion it helps with the T zone.</li>
            <li>If you need to get rid of those unsightly large pores on your nose or anywhere else on your face, get a tube of this!  </li>
            <li>I have several pores that were made larger by the problem and this product helps minimize the appearance greatly.</li>
            <li>I love it because it really makes my skin look and feel soft .&lt;br</li>
            <li>i love it, it makes my skin feel soft, but my pores do not look very &amp;#34;blurred.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Beautiful silky feeling , just a slight bit greasy, but that goes away when  you apply make-up !!!</li>
            <li>but you don&#x27;t need very much anyway.</li>
            <li>It also feels really good on my skin and is very easy to apply... a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I am not positive whether this is going to cause any clogging, it is a unique texture, so I am pre-empting that with making sure I do my cucumber peels often.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I was amazed...</li>
            <li>The first day I wore it, my makeup was just sliding off my face with the slightest touch.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently started looking more closely at my cosmetics and checking the ingredients before using.</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve used a product like this</li>
            <li>i will order more in the future</li>
            <li>Works really well!  </li>
            <li>This is the first I&#x27;ve ever gotten</li>
            <li>Everyone (even me at first) assumes you just rub it all over your face, but that is not the case.  </li>
            <li>It does feel greasy at first</li>
            <li>however i would pay extra for better quality.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s soft and silky smooth.</li>
            <li>It work rather well, if feeling a bit greasy at first.  </li>
            <li>and it works almost the same! :)</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and my pore are filled in and if I do ware makeup it stays on longer than it would without the baby skin.</li>
            <li>Really does make pores disappear!</li>
            <li>only just ok..</li>
            <li>absolutely work, it did what it promisesd!</li>
            <li>If I find that, for some reason, the humidity outside is causing my pores to show through all of that, then I can use a bit of this ON TOP of everything</li>
            <li>Okay so instant baby skin?</li>
            <li>It is very oily and does not cover any pores!</li>
            <li>It does not do exactly as the product describes</li>
            <li>I love this as a primer under my regular makeup.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time trying out primers.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive and really smoothens my face!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no color to this product, my face was incredibly soft after using this my foundation just glided on so smoothly.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Totally patchy makeup free after using this product!</li>
            <li>Once I use this up I most likely won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li>With this product, I was able to wear it along with my regular routine products.</li>
            <li>When I first tried it out, I noticed how soft/smooth it felt on my face.</li>
            <li>Works very well!  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li>I was amazed when I first used this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as spectacular as I&#x27;ve heard and it seems to melt off in the southern heat where I live.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin so soft and makes my skin look much more clear, and obviously makes my make up look better too.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, Maybelline discontinued one of their best products (Pure H20 Foundation), which was aces as a foundation with a matte finish.  </li>
            <li>, this product is just like any other kind of makeup...</li>
            <li>This felt super greasy to me - -  more so than other dimethicone type primers.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product it is my everyday item to use and is part of my regime, it makes my pores look invisible and skin so smooth.</li>
            <li>Very soft.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been able to find it at any local stores.</li>
            <li>I have pretty large, visible pores on my cheeks and nose, so I didn&#x27;t expect a drastic improvement.</li>
            <li>I read comments of people saying it was more for dry skin and not oily, but in my case i have pretty oily skin, and i didn&#x27;t see an increase.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and thought this would help but no way, this is pretty greasy.</li>
            <li>Good if you have small pores (which don&#x27;t really really need this to begin with lol) and not good for large pores.  </li>
            <li>Overall though, it leaves my skin softer and it allows foundation to easily slide over.</li>
            <li>however I started using a BiPap machine to sleep with at night and the warm moist air caused the black heads on my nose and my pores to become inflamed and infected.</li>
            <li>When I use this under makeup, it makes the dry, flaky patches on my skin more noticeable.</li>
            <li>I was hoping it would be more of a dry feeling.</li>
            <li>Loved the long lasting wear it gives.</li>
            <li>I spread it over the areas of my face where my pores are particularly large, as well as under my eyes, before applying makeup.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this product for oily skin or large pores.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to refine the look of my large pores on my cheek area, it did not do anything to either blur or mask those.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend for large pores.</li>
            <li>I believe that it does somewhat help the large pore situation.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m olive toned and have large pores on my T-zone.</li>
            <li>My pores still looked large, and I still needed a lot of powder to make it all matte.  </li>
            <li>My pores still looked large, and I still needed a lot of powder to make it all matte.  </li>
            <li>I have found that it does not erase my pores, especially my large ones, but it will blur the smaller ones.</li>
            <li>I have used products 5 times more expensive and from my typing :) to your ears, do not hesitate!</li>
            <li>The only plus is that it feels fine on my skin and didn&#x27;t cause any breakouts.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin with large pores.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have large pores, so I haven&#x27;t seen a difference really.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin with large pores.</li>
            <li>Really diminishes the appearance of large pores and wrinkles on my nose and under my eyes</li>
            <li>My skin is very dry most of the time</li>
            <li>Honestly, it just blurs a little bit.</li>
            <li>This product is clear and has a soft and smooth consistency.</li>
            <li>Baby Skin is a nice alternative for those of us that cannot afford the more expensive department store products.  </li>
            <li>I have huge pores everywhere and this product makes your face kinda blurry looking on naked skin</li>
            <li>Overall, blends really well with makeup and helps to smooth it out.</li>
            <li>My face gets really oily</li>
            <li>Even the smallest amount seems to be too much for me.</li>
            <li>If you use too much, your face is bound is feel greasy.</li>
            <li>and they have to be applied in a &amp;#34;patting motion&amp;#34; gently into your skin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really erase your pores..</li>
            <li>but this helps to calm the oil, it hasn&#x27;t made me break out and it makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>so i was really worried</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really notice a difference</li>
            <li>but didnt really help cover noticeable imperfectons like I had hoped for</li>
            <li>It may work for others whose pores don&#x27;t need quite as much &amp;#34;erasing.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>it really really works</li>
            <li>but I really notice them disappear once I&#x27;ve put my foundation on.</li>
            <li>This did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li>Way better than I expected.</li>
            <li>You skin will be close up ready and photo</li>
            <li>but it has way too much slip.</li>
            <li>It works really well under make up</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really do much for my pores.</li>
            <li>I let my friend use it with much lighter skin and it worked.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say if you have a really even skin tone and are just looking at this product to correct pores it could almost be used without foundation.</li>
            <li>It does not make pores smaller, but it does make a smooth surface for makeup to glide on.</li>
            <li>and it has a very slippery feeling.</li>
            <li>This does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m very picky and a perfectionist)</li>
            <li>You really should buy this</li>
            <li>I really want to like it</li>
            <li>I suggest trying a test area before you really need to use it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really blur pores</li>
            <li>I call this my REAL LIFE PHOTOSHOP.</li>
            <li>The price is very comparable as well.</li>
            <li>a light foundation with a powder is enough to even my skin out.  </li>
            <li>I did not see much pore erasing/minimizing...</li>
            <li>Did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really notice a difference..</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s really</li>
            <li>if you put foundation over it(which is the whole point)</li>
            <li>This product is very versatile.</li>
            <li>This stuff helped so much.</li>
            <li>The texture doesn&#x27;t really go away, it&#x27;s as if the gel just sits on your face without soaking in.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really does minimize pores and makes your skin look smoother.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s too greasy, Didn&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li>and this doesn&#x27;t help too much.</li>
            <li>Luv this product it really works.</li>
            <li>It works very well!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this product I found it at Walmart after I found it on here</li>
            <li>Really like this primer.</li>
            <li>i really like it</li>
            <li>I really like the way it makes my face feel after using it.  </li>
            <li>It has a silicone feeling and it really does fill in your pores.</li>
            <li>my face became VERY oily - even with my powder on</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>This product is very oily and does not set foundation very well at all.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery gets the job done</li>
            <li>but I have semi-oily skin, and I kind of felt oilier after a few hours of having this on.  </li>
            <li>But that does not mean it would not work for others!</li>
            <li>I was using the M.A.C. primer, but this is just as good, if not better, at a fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li>The next day, I steamed my face first to open up my pores, then applied the product, hoping it was absorb better.  </li>
            <li>This is SUCH an amazing product, especially considering the super low cost.  </li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t use too much - as always with makeup - less is more,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very new product, so I thought it was just all hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a clear, gel-like composition, which slides over the skin and feels like silk at first.  </li>
            <li>When I first tried this product, I was hesitant looking at the results because my pores were clearly visible.</li>
            <li>Now, even before I tried the stuff, I was kind of skeptical about clear gel with magic \\&quot;skin blurring properties\\&quot;-</li>
            <li>Loveee this stuff, I couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>It does have an odd smell to it as soon as you get it out of the tube, but once applied you cannot smell it any more</li>
            <li>I like this product, super soft &amp; smooth on my skin, &amp; does seem to slightly blur my pores..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to apply, takes 2 sec</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more in the future..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a clear, smooth gel that makes your skin feel hydrated and silky while minimizing imperfections, reducing the appearance of pores, and just overall making skin look healthier.</li>
            <li>then I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t waste too much money,</li>
            <li>It is a decent primer for the price of it and being from the drugstore.</li>
            <li>but it is decent in a pinch and decent for the price.</li>
            <li>It does temporarily give your face a &amp;#34;blurred&amp;#34; look, but it quickly just turns greasy which makes pores look larger.</li>
            <li>I got some at a local store and tried it - even right after applying it, letting it dry, and covering with powder, you could still easily see my pores.</li>
            <li>By the end of the day my makeup was a blotchy mess and most of had melted off.</li>
            <li>My pores vanished--or at least they were blurred out a lot more!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Upshot: I would only recommend this product to those lucky people who can apply pure Vaseline or baby oil directly to their faces without consequence.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT...</li>
            <li>In my experience, high end or drug store, products either work for you or they don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have high expectations but thought I&#x27;d give it at try.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend</li>
            <li>It is thick but smooths out easily for a light soft coverage.</li>
            <li>Is good is just a weird product, is super soft in my skin.</li>
            <li>I have relatively clear skin, but unfortunately large pores.</li>
            <li>Chalking it up to a new product, I blotted quickly and left anyway.</li>
            <li>Get a good primer, it&#x27;ll do you better.ke baby powder on the skin: slightly moisturized, softer, but also dry.</li>
            <li>and personally I have some pretty large pores</li>
            <li>This really hides your pores and makes your skin so soft.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin soft, but doesn&#x27;t really hide any pores or wrinkles.</li>
            <li>This does make my skin really soft but it doesn&#x27;t really help with the pores.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t require much because it spreads really far.</li>
            <li>Maybelline&#x27;s target price is usually mid-shelf: better than the bottom shelf liquor (Wet and Wild), but not quite on par with the top shelf stuff (L&#x27;oreal, Physician&#x27;s Formula)- which may be why I&#x27;m put off by that price tag.  </li>
            <li>I have combination to oily skin, with relatively normal skin during the winter months.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t need to use powder on my face, as I normally would after applying foundation.</li>
            <li>right at my local Target!</li>
            <li>I have pores around my nose and some on my forehead right above the nose, so thats basically where I apply the product.</li>
            <li>Only reason I give this 2 stars is because it might be better on someone with very dry skin.</li>
            <li>I live in south Florida</li>
            <li>Decent product, but it really doesn&#x27;t work as well as most primers as far as smoothing down the facial surface.</li>
            <li>Creates a perfect base and feels really silky, not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>I use to really like this product, but the second time I really didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>So far after a few days I am really pleased.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and am always cautious about trying new products.  </li>
            <li>Makes skin very soft.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Thus far, it hasn&#x27;t caused irritation or zits, thankfully!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft!</li>
            <li>but I guess it would do the exact same thing as what I do!</li>
            <li>I was nervous the first time i used this because once applying you are left with the impression that this is greasy</li>
            <li>However, after applying the rest of my makeup, I could visibly see a different in my pores- positively.</li>
            <li>It did reduce pore visibility slightly, and my makeup looked smooth and natural.</li>
            <li>I have super oily skin and a moisturizer in my t-zone can sometimes cause too much oil in a few hours</li>
            <li>Once the primer is dry, it makes my face feel extra soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I would only recommend this product for someone with large pores, otherwise you don&#x27;t need it.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of discoloration in my face (red, lots of freckles, large pores), and it helps tone all these things</li>
            <li>After using this for about a month or so my face has started getting these large red almost welt-like patches where I applied Baby Skin.  </li>
            <li>It will not cover large deep pores or blackheads.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After lightly moisturizing, I squeezed a little bit onto my fingertips (no word on the label whether lotion hampers the product&#x27;s results).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clear primer, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t hide the large pores on my nose.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear whitish gel with some texture.</li>
            <li>Even if this had worked, it&#x27;s clear-</li>
            <li>Even if this had worked, it&#x27;s clear-</li>
            <li>The product is clear, with the consistency of Vaseline.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had issues with my skin and finding products to make it look clear.</li>
            <li>This product is clear so doesn&#x27;t affect any foundation color you may put over it.</li>
            <li>Goes on like a gel (clear gel), and erase the pores.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like ythat ir make your skin feel soft, however if you get it on your eyebrows, it leaves chunks of it on them.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face soft.</li>
            <li>It also made my skin so soft</li>
            <li>just realized at this very moment, that I don&#x27;t know the proper spelling for pours/poors in this context.  </li>
            <li>Made my skin very greasy and I don&#x27;t think my pores are any smaller.</li>
            <li>You only need a pea size amount to cover your whole face.</li>
            <li>it is silky soft it does soften the skin.</li>
            <li>It really helps makeup last longer!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really make my pores look any smaller</li>
            <li>I have seriously sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s transparent oily gel, it feels soft on the skin</li>
            <li>This leaves my skin soft which makes it easier to apply the rest of my makeup.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely unsatisfied.</li>
            <li>It does what it promised!&lt;br /&gt;So soft , look at the difference!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it can only do so much.</li>
            <li>My 12 yr old daughter swiped it from me though.....</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t used it enough to really determine if I like it...</li>
            <li>One application and my skin was so soft.</li>
            <li>And my skin was so soft still in the morning.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>To be fair though, you don&#x27;t need a lot, so the tube should last at least a week or two for someone who uses it once or twice daily .  </li>
            <li>Perfect as a primer or base for powder foundation.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Maybelline New York Baby Skin Instant Pore Eraser Primer.</li>
            <li>also want to say that I have oily skin that seems to break out at the drop of a hat, but if you use just the right amount of this pore eraser, you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem with breakouts or your makeup slipping and sliding.</li>
            <li>Sure, this stuff is pretty cheap but in this case you really do get what you pay for, this did absolutely nothing for me and it feels greasy and nasty.</li>
            <li>It does make your pores smaller and makes you use less makeup since it helps spread it easily.</li>
            <li>It did make my forehead area where there are very small pores more refined.  </li>
            <li>To the people saying this is greasy, TRY using small amounts ONLY in the places your pores are biggest and need to be most primed.</li>
            <li>especially the older we get.</li>
            <li>I used this product for the first time last night; I attended a wedding and didn&#x27;t want my makeup to sink into the larger pores I have around my nose and between my brows.</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes.</li>
            <li>I had high expectations, but this product is a basic primer.</li>
            <li>It feels fine on, but it DOES NOT make pores look smaller, not even a little bit.</li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my skin feel, but it&#x27;s not good if you want to wear foundation over it.</li>
            <li>my face felt like matte paper then my skin peeled off within 3 days and was back to normal.</li>
            <li>First impressions: The gel&#x27;s texture was not something I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>My only wish is that it had SPF in it like the Avon version I normally buy.</li>
            <li>It feels a little greasy at first but after putting foundation over it, it just feels like normal.</li>
            <li>and I could see a difference one side looked dull and kinda fuzzy but felt so soft and smooth</li>
            <li>this not only makes my makeup last all day, but it really does &amp;#34;blur&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It really was just a waste of money, very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>I slowly added more to the desired areas of my face, rubbing it in tiny circles, until I achieved the desired effect.</li>
            <li>Spreads easily too so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I have big pores in some parts of my face ( around my cheeks near my nose) and it didn&#x27;t do anything!</li>
            <li>One more plus, a little tiny bit goes a very long way!</li>
            <li>Even after washing it off my whole face became very dry and scaly...</li>
            <li>A little goes a long ways and it glides smoothly onto your skin.</li>
            <li>It tends to make my makeup look splotchy or uneven/bad in general.</li>
            <li>when after I ordered this product, I walked into the Dollar General and saw it hanging on their rack.</li>
            <li>It works very well on small pores, and really does make them appear to vanish.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it for two days so far</li>
            <li>2 weeks later, they&#x27;ve almost completely gone away.</li>
            <li>some better, some worse.  </li>
            <li>Its nice don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li>(I was a little surprised by that because several of the previous reviewers said they were able to use it without applying foundation over it.</li>
            <li>The only thing is it&#x27;s not exactly &amp;#34;instant&amp;#34; and it seems oily at first.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smoothly and a teeny little bit goes a LONG way because I&#x27;m only applying it to problem enlarged pore areas!</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t see any other use for this.</li>
            <li>but my nose on the other hand not so much.</li>
            <li>This stuff doesn&#x27;t exactly work miracles on my pores but it does fill them in a little so that my skin looks smoother and</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice a huge difference other than my face feeling a little softer.</li>
            <li>I tried it on my skin alone with nothing mixed into it and it barely made a difference.</li>
            <li>This gets two stars for the price, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s even worth that.</li>
            <li>It really makes my pores less visible... and it smoothens my skin too.</li>
            <li>I had washed my face with my usual routine before going to bed - I have never broken out like that before, and my skin was nearly clear until the day after I used the primer, so I&#x27;m assuming it was that.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However,it is not necessarily long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;Meaning that my makeup doesn&#x27;t last a lot longer with this</li>
            <li>His looked exactly the same, and when he touched his face a few minutes later he said it felt like he&#x27;d smeared baby oil gel on</li>
            <li>His looked exactly the same, and when he touched his face a few minutes later he said it felt like he&#x27;d smeared baby oil gel on</li>
            <li>While I normally have a brief waiting period, my other primers only require 1-2 minutes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m generally hard to impress as far as skin products go, but this absolutely blew me away.</li>

            <li> Love it!!</li>
            <li> This is amazing!</li>
            <li> I was encouraged that this product was wonderful and like magic.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product - it works awesome for me!</li>
            <li> Love this product it makes your skin look flawless !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good primer, it doesn&#x27;t cancel pores out though.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feels good to touch, and no rash nor irritation from it.</li>
            <li> I had heard good things about how well this product works.</li>
            <li> None of these things seem to work well for my skin - this is not as good as the Porefessional by Benefit, though.</li>
            <li> A good choice for budget-conscious buyers.</li>
            <li> she loved this stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so good with makeup.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> and of really good quality</li>
            <li> #34;It&#x27;s your pores, do you use a filler?&amp;#34; So I told her I was using baby skin, and she didn&#x27;t have much good to say about it either.</li>
            <li> Not as good as Clinique&#x27;s Pore eraser, but a good runner up.</li>
            <li> It also works great on its own.</li>
            <li> A good primer and pore reducer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good pore minimizer that will work well under my make up</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also good for hiding flaky acne skin: rub some on the flakes, dab some concealer on with a brush, put your foundation on then blend it all together with a brush.</li>
            <li> it feels so good in the skin</li>
            <li> If I forget to put it on my foundation doesn&#x27;t look nearly as good.</li>
            <li> Do recommend and the also received very quickly as well!!</li>
            <li> Very good for the price, amazing, face feels velvety smooth, and works just as good as porefessional from sephora which is 31.00</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I thought well sure it makes your skin look great, and</li>
            <li> love it great product</li>
            <li> Feels great and blurs perfectly, I love it</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you like going without foundation:)</li>
            <li> this was 4$ a steal, I better order more!!</li>
            <li> Love wearing this even when I don&#x27;t wear foundation over it (which is 99.9% of the time) - it makes my skin feel silky smooth and flawless.</li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite make up products I own!</li>
            <li> Lovely you!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> Try mixing it with a bit of foundation and watch the magic begin!</li>
            <li> I have been telling everyone I know about this product - go Maybelline, another cosmetic favorite!</li>
            <li> I love baby skin!</li>
            <li> I really love this!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> In my opinion works better than benefits porefessional !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay but not for me!</li>
            <li> I love this product and will be using it for life!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> I want more now!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> Love the baby skin pore eraser!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> The texture is really great and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Over all, very light and effective product for a good price</li>
            <li> Amazing products.</li>
            <li> Works great for a cheap price.</li>
            <li> Works great and leaves skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> Its great for light makeup looks.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is surprisingly effective.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t suppose to make pores disappear, but it does do a nice job covering them.</li>
            <li> It kind of blurs</li>
            <li> Nice price for the amount given.</li>
            <li> Get a good primer, it&#x27;ll do you better.</li>
            <li> and it just feels nice on the skin.</li>
            <li> I really liked how it feels on my skin</li>
            <li> I like the way the primer feels, but honestly my foundation (I use BB cream)</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t notice a difference.</li>
            <li> But it does a nice finish in coverage</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I love this product and I&#x27;m so happy that I can find a good, cheap pore eraser</li>
            <li> This products honestly does not work.</li>
            <li> I liked this product</li>
            <li> Really liked it.</li>
            <li> It covers my pores in a nice way</li>
            <li> After applying, I had to squint at my own reflection to convince myself that I still HAD pores.</li>
            <li> As good as a sephora kind from sephora but its more concentrated.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to clean off too!!</li>
            <li> This stuff feels GREAT on my face and absorbs quickly making my skin feel like &amp;#34;Baby Skin&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I have very fair, oily skin with some large pores on and around the nose.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t see the complete difference if you don&#x27;t aply with something else, I used the bb cream from Maybelline, my skin is flawless now!</li>
            <li> This is a great primer when you work with it the right way.</li>
            <li> Love love LOVE!</li>
            <li> Love love love this!</li>
            <li> Love the consistency of this product its very light weight and makes skin feel very smooth and does minimize most of my pores!</li>
            <li> However the price is great and it&#x27;s a good day to day primer type cover for those going for natural looks.</li>
            <li> Fantastic results, really smooths the skin and under makeup makes for an almost flawless look.</li>
            <li> I use it kind of like a moisturizer, and have also tried it under makeup, which is nice, and helps it look nicer for longer, but also come off more easily at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin very smooth in seconds.</li>
            <li> Would&#x27;ve been great if it&#x27;d worked as the price point is much better than the higher end stuff.</li>
            <li> When I use it with my full makeup it leaves my skin with a flawless finish, where as before you could really see my pores.</li>
            <li> Nice feel on, pretty good to lessen pores</li>
            <li> * Seller shipped super fast and product is delightful!</li>
            <li> My pores are huge and this stuff literally erases them!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as amazing as people would hype it out to be, but it gets the job done (my huge pores are made to look semi-normal).</li>
            <li> but it sure does a hell of a job for the price</li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> THIS IS MAGIC.</li>
            <li> Probably my favorite primer - even better than my smash box one.</li>
            <li> I do not have oily skin, if anything I run into more issues with dryness.</li>
            <li> It might even make them more visible.</li>
            <li> Amazing, this product goes on smooth on my face and it covers up any noticeable pores on my face.</li>
            <li> If you are looking to apply heavier creams or layering anything on for a more made up look, go for something else.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> just I love it-</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> Its ok.</li>
            <li> love this.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magical.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It would be better were it tinted.  </li>
            <li> Time to get some more.</li>
            <li> I love this primer</li>
            <li> so I really love something so affordable to use.</li>
            <li> love love love this stuff</li>
            <li> I love this primer.</li>
            <li> I love how this does what it says it will.</li>
            <li> I do want to add one more note</li>
            <li> Product was ok but made my face even oilier than what it is.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS...</li>
            <li> Not my favorite purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this and use it as a primer over my others.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so smooth and shrinks my pores!</li>
            <li> I love this product--</li>
            <li> use it in addition to another green-based primer (because of my rosacea) to get the most out of it, as well as my foundation.</li>
            <li> The product feels like it just sits on top of your skin</li>
            <li> It made my skin feel like a baby for sure; it didnt, however keep my makeup from getting into my pours.i</li>
            <li> While it did seem to hide pores, my skin reacted to it by producing more oil.</li>
            <li> i LOVE this</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my skin look and feel.</li>
            <li> I find it works better with some makeups than others.....</li>
            <li> I would not recommend it, but if you have small-looking pores then maybe you&#x27;ll have better luck than I did.</li>
            <li> I mostly don&#x27;t ware makeup, but I like to put put this primer on my face alone</li>
            <li> Nice light weight primer.</li>
            <li> and it had more pore-erasing power.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin look really smooth!</li>
            <li> but it seems to be out of stock most of the time.</li>
            <li> I really love it.</li>
            <li> it feels like i&#x27;m just putting more oily stuff on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She recommended NYX Pore Filler which I have since been using, and THAT is magical.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> This is an OKAY product.</li>
            <li> Wanted to love this.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t relate to the reviewers who said this made their face more oily.</li>
            <li> I love it, so</li>
            <li> I seriously am in love with this product.</li>
            <li> It holds onto foundation better than my skin alone.</li>
            <li> work?&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product with and without applying something on top.</li>
            <li> but mostly I don&#x27;t even use it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it, its not going to shrink your pores, that&#x27;s not what its made for.</li>
            <li> Love the texture of the primer it feels like silk</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this primer is okay.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT, YOUR SKIN WILL BE LIKE A BABY,</li>
            <li> HEHE I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel smooth as a baby&#x27;s backside!  </li>
            <li> I know you would love it too.</li>
            <li> If you have reasonable expectations, I think you will be happy with this product.  </li>
            <li> more so &amp;#34;blurs&amp;#34; your skin&#x27;s imperfections into a more visually appealing palette.</li>
            <li> Okay, I watched alot of youtube regarding this product.</li>
            <li> so when I run out I will buy more :)</li>
            <li> I love putting this on my face.</li>
            <li> But i still love it</li>
            <li> Love this as a primer for applying makeup.</li>
            <li> but it feels nice and smooth on the skin.</li>
            <li> I wish I could like it more.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product</li>
            <li> but I love Baby Lips</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> All in all, my skin looks so much better with this on under my foundation.</li>
            <li> - I think I like it - gives the skin a nice smooth feel</li>
            <li> My skin felt smoother and I am sure that if I wore makeup it would look better with this.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> but it sure makes them not so visible.</li>
            <li> These seems more like a primer than just a pore eraser.  </li>
            <li> It makes your skin look nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li> love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
            <li> Its ok.</li>
            <li> I used it when I had pictures taken so that I could get a more polished look with my makeup</li>
            <li> I even stopped using my eyeshadow primer, because this does the trick even better.</li>
            <li> This stuff is just OK.  </li>
            <li> Ok maybe for some people it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just in love with this stuff 😊😊😊</li>
            <li> I love it bottom</li>
            <li> Better price than most.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> --I have this on auto, that&#x27;s how much I love this item</li>
            <li> still dont know if is making anything in my skin because i need to used more.</li>
            <li> It goes on so smooth and literally makes my pores disappear!</li>
            <li> It does not take much product for coverage and it feels very nice on the skin.  </li>
            <li> and I will be investing a lot of money in this tiny tube of Magic!!!</li>
            <li> It was a pretty good product i have oily skin</li>
            <li> Pretty good at minimizing pores, but I can still see them, they are not erased.  </li>
            <li> it truely smooths out your face, sets it nice  to add foundation.</li>
            <li> Pretty good primer...</li>
            <li> worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> so it glides on more easily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It totally minimizes the appearance of the pores on my nose, so that when I apply my mineral make up, I have a smooth, flawless finish.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned with large pores so it might work for somebody else.</li>
            <li> good alternative to some of the more high end face primers</li>
            <li> But the reason I love it and can&#x27;t go without it is because it makes my makeup glide on so smooth and wear so well.</li>
            <li> You still have to put some foundation on it to have the more smooth look!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could NOT believe the silky smooth consistency of this outstanding product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definately not as good as Porefessional (the much pricier product that it&#x27;s trying to emulate) but it does make a difference in pore visibility.</li>
            <li> I heard a lot of thing about this product, I&#x27;ve never used anything similar, but I decided to try it, and I loved it!</li>
            <li> I have easy to maintain skin,</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed it clogging up pores, and washes off easily.</li>
            <li> , I was a make-up artist for many years, still am on special occasions, and one of my biggest request is the reduction of pores.</li>
            <li> Very smooth, a lol goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Basically this helps your base go on great and does a nice job of spackling those pores so your makeup looks more flawless.</li>
            <li> Feels slightly oily when you put it on but works great!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a product to erase the look of pores and fine lines</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and smooth, easy to put make up over.</li>
            <li> Made my skin feel super smooth!</li>
            <li> Pretty good primer, just make sure that you don&#x27;t use too much or your foundation will start to separate.</li>
            <li> Glides on easily and perfect base to help any foundation glide on perfectly.</li>
            <li> I have huge pores</li>
            <li> I use it as a primer for my foundation, and there is a HUGE difference in how noticeable my pores are.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have huge pores and it still didn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li> My brother even tried it on his face, and he was amazed at what a huge difference it</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of how it felt a couple of hours after applying....</li>
            <li> This product goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> I put it on every morning and my face feels smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> Neither my primer nor my foundation lay smoothly over this product when applied.  </li>
            <li> It makes my face feel so smooth.</li>
            <li> I liked this product over my loreal studio primer, which is much thicker/heavier  </li>
            <li> Makeup goes on really smoothly afterwards too.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin sooooo smooth .</li>
            <li> but it is great for getting my make up to last all day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as smooth as Porefessional but for 1/5th of the price I&#x27;ll use it on my non-important days.</li>
            <li> I purchased it with the intention to use it as a primer, and it really is great if you are looking for a primer that will make your make up last all day.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really fill in the pores, kind of just smoothed out skin.</li>
            <li> I used Maybelline Dream Fresh BB cream over the top of this.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic and its price</li>
            <li> It has a smooth silky texture.  </li>
            <li> Works great, especially in combination with a foundation.</li>
            <li> I have to wait 5-10 minutes from applying the primer to applying my foundation if I want my foundation to go on smooth.</li>
            <li> Feels so smooth like you have nothing on at all.</li>
            <li> But it does smooth out my skin for makeup.</li>
            <li> Its so smooth and covers all my pores.</li>
            <li> Such s great product.</li>
            <li> It helps smooth out my pores and helps my foundation go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how people say it makes your skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li> Great experience, definitely will repurchase.</li>
            <li> It feel nice and make my skin soft and more even.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how this will hold up in the summer, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I have used many prestige brand pore &#x27;erasers&#x27;, and I have to say this is right up there with all of them.  </li>
            <li> I honestly really like it!!!</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite product!</li>
            <li> It does however leave my skin super soft feeling and it makes a good primer for makeup.</li>
            <li> Will always use this , very pleased and surprised ..</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I saw an advertisement for this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Love it, it does exactly what it says its supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> Face feels super smooth and easier to apply foundation.  </li>
            <li> me, while I would wear this on its own, it looked much better under my sheer BB cream.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use traditional liquid foundation, so on top of the pore eraser I put on a layer of BB cream (the Korean kind, not the American/tinted moisturizer type if that makes a difference).</li>
            <li> I love this product so much it makes my skin so smooth</li>
            <li> It almost feels lightly (super light) waxy.</li>
            <li> Not as good as smashbox, doesn&#x27;t really have much of an effect.</li>
            <li> : First, I put on moisturizer (Clinique Gel), then I apply a layer of normal primer all over (BareMinerals original), then I apply this on my problem spots, then I use a tinted moisturizer (BareMinerals Complexion Rescue) and top it off with a very, very light dusting of mineral powder (BareMinerals original).</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and very cheap.</li>
            <li> Honestly it&#x27;s best used to cover up any dry or uneven skin, and can work fairly well as an eyeshadow primer.</li>
            <li> I have used it by itself too, it gives your skin a matte finish, if you have oily skin like me, it really helps absorb the oil, I have a huge decrease in shiny face!</li>
            <li> It gave my old face a beautiful finish that looked totally natural.</li>
            <li> Your skin feel so soft and amazing with this primer.  </li>
            <li> Love this because it really does blur blemishes and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> After trying both, I think that this comes very close to Benefits the Porefessional at a much better price</li>
            <li> Overall, a good product.</li>
            <li> This product is good, but not the best.&lt;br /&gt;I find that it definitely fills in my pores.</li>
            <li> it makes your face soft, it&#x27;s kind of like rubbing Paul Mitchell serum on your face.</li>
            <li> while back I purchased this primer after running out of the one I had ; the price was much more reasonable then the one I was paying from Benefit, and I had heard it was one of the really good one&#x27;s out there.</li>
            <li> Not bad</li>
            <li> Not a bad primer though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not bad...</li>
            <li> Not bad at all.</li>
            <li> The delayed eraser magic was just a pleasant surprise because I didn&#x27;t expect any changes a few hours</li>
            <li> yeah it is easy to use but there is far more to it than meets the eye.</li>
            <li> I wasnt sure at first about this product, it felt nice but wasnt instant results like posted on the packaging.</li>
            <li> Alone my pores were still present, but &amp;#34;blurred.&amp;#34; The pore eraser allowed my BB cream to sit nicely on top of my skin and not sink into my pores and make them more noticeable.</li>
            <li> I will be searching for a quick fox for a pore eraser.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just not 5 star worthy in my opinion</li>
            <li> Most of my make up is high end</li>
            <li> By mid-day my face was a lot more oily than normal.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s very hot and before using this my face would look like a grease pile by the end of the night.</li>
            <li> The cost is very reasonable!</li>
            <li> This stuff is very much reminds me of Smashbox without the price tag-Love it!</li>
            <li> if you have dry skin this would probably be good.</li>
            <li> if you have dry skin this is a good one</li>
            <li> It really works!!</li>
            <li> Ok... It is cheap, but it never dry ...</li>
            <li> It looked fine for about an hour and then got really oily.</li>
            <li> , the pores look significantly smaller.&lt;br /&gt;Since this is a makeup primer, it also helps to make my foundation look better than it does on just my bare skin alone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This cost a little more than I would have liked to pay....</li>
            <li> Did some research, consistently this got high reviews and this was a top pick on &amp;</li>
            <li> Makes your face smooth and ready for makeup.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel amazing enough to make it worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth, and I don&#x27;t really see it make a difference on my make up.</li>
            <li> Really does make your face feel baby smooth.</li>
            <li> This makes my face feel so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> Worth the buy 100%</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more clear and silky like Revlon&#x27;s primer</li>
            <li> hide/fill pore in any way..not worth.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much change in my pore size, but it&#x27;s good for just a regular primer.</li>
            <li> Nice texture, clear, but didn&#x27;t really do the job for me.</li>
            <li> I have a golden tan complexion so defintilty not for me.</li>
            <li> Honestly, though, I don&#x27;t see myself buying this product again just because I don&#x27;t think it makes that big of a difference.</li>
            <li> Not as good as expected</li>
            <li> Brand new, in the packaging, exactly what is said is what I got :)</li>
            <li> &amp; it makes my face SUPER soft, but could easily be scraped off with my finger nail.</li>
            <li> This is great for the raised red and dark areas on the face, it helps foundation and powder smooth over them!</li>
            <li> It went on feeling greasy right away and did not seem to cover my pores at all.</li>
            <li> Right Before My Eyes...Loved it and Will order Again</li>
            <li> This product does not allow my foundation and or powder to stick, it just wipes right off.</li>
            <li> And the price was right.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t wear under my make up: it slid right off.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think someone with good skin- not oily or dry- whose pores aren&#x27;t large to begin with- might see some effect,  but if that was the case, you wouldn&#x27;t need to buy a pore erasing product, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> A great way to layer, use this first, then a light layer of illuminating BB cream with sunscreen, then your concealer, then your favorite base makeup, then highlighter, then a light dusting of setting powder, then a light misting of finishing spray.</li>
            <li> (but works well for very large pores).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> he has very large pores on his nose-</li>
            <li> he has very large pores on his nose-</li>
            <li> Maybe I just have very large pores.</li>
            <li> even though the primer I use is barely tinted, it functions as a skin tone evener on top of priming my skin for foundation.  </li>
            <li> even though the primer I use is barely tinted, it functions as a skin tone evener on top of priming my skin for foundation.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if it realy helps with the pores but it works great alone after my face lotion it helps with the T zone.</li>
            <li> If you need to get rid of those unsightly large pores on your nose or anywhere else on your face, get a tube of this!  </li>
            <li> I have several pores that were made larger by the problem and this product helps minimize the appearance greatly.</li>
            <li> I love it because it really makes my skin look and feel soft .&lt;br</li>
            <li> i love it, it makes my skin feel soft, but my pores do not look very &amp;#34;blurred.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Beautiful silky feeling , just a slight bit greasy, but that goes away when  you apply make-up !!!</li>
            <li> but you don&#x27;t need very much anyway.</li>
            <li> It also feels really good on my skin and is very easy to apply... a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I am not positive whether this is going to cause any clogging, it is a unique texture, so I am pre-empting that with making sure I do my cucumber peels often.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I was amazed...</li>
            <li> The first day I wore it, my makeup was just sliding off my face with the slightest touch.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently started looking more closely at my cosmetics and checking the ingredients before using.</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve used a product like this</li>
            <li> i will order more in the future</li>
            <li> Works really well!  </li>
            <li> This is the first I&#x27;ve ever gotten</li>
            <li> Everyone (even me at first) assumes you just rub it all over your face, but that is not the case.  </li>
            <li> It does feel greasy at first</li>
            <li> however i would pay extra for better quality.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s soft and silky smooth.</li>
            <li> It work rather well, if feeling a bit greasy at first.  </li>
            <li> and it works almost the same! :)</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and my pore are filled in and if I do ware makeup it stays on longer than it would without the baby skin.</li>
            <li> Really does make pores disappear!</li>
            <li> only just ok..</li>
            <li> absolutely work, it did what it promisesd!</li>
            <li> If I find that, for some reason, the humidity outside is causing my pores to show through all of that, then I can use a bit of this ON TOP of everything</li>
            <li> Okay so instant baby skin?</li>
            <li> It is very oily and does not cover any pores!</li>
            <li> It does not do exactly as the product describes</li>
            <li> I love this as a primer under my regular makeup.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time trying out primers.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and really smoothens my face!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no color to this product, my face was incredibly soft after using this my foundation just glided on so smoothly.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Totally patchy makeup free after using this product!</li>
            <li> Once I use this up I most likely won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> With this product, I was able to wear it along with my regular routine products.</li>
            <li> When I first tried it out, I noticed how soft/smooth it felt on my face.</li>
            <li> Works very well!  </li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li> I was amazed when I first used this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as spectacular as I&#x27;ve heard and it seems to melt off in the southern heat where I live.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft and makes my skin look much more clear, and obviously makes my make up look better too.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, Maybelline discontinued one of their best products (Pure H20 Foundation), which was aces as a foundation with a matte finish.  </li>
            <li> , this product is just like any other kind of makeup...</li>
            <li> This felt super greasy to me - -  more so than other dimethicone type primers.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product it is my everyday item to use and is part of my regime, it makes my pores look invisible and skin so smooth.</li>
            <li> Very soft.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been able to find it at any local stores.</li>
            <li> I have pretty large, visible pores on my cheeks and nose, so I didn&#x27;t expect a drastic improvement.</li>
            <li> I read comments of people saying it was more for dry skin and not oily, but in my case i have pretty oily skin, and i didn&#x27;t see an increase.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and thought this would help but no way, this is pretty greasy.</li>
            <li> Good if you have small pores (which don&#x27;t really really need this to begin with lol) and not good for large pores.  </li>
            <li> Overall though, it leaves my skin softer and it allows foundation to easily slide over.</li>
            <li> however I started using a BiPap machine to sleep with at night and the warm moist air caused the black heads on my nose and my pores to become inflamed and infected.</li>
            <li> When I use this under makeup, it makes the dry, flaky patches on my skin more noticeable.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would be more of a dry feeling.</li>
            <li> Loved the long lasting wear it gives.</li>
            <li> I spread it over the areas of my face where my pores are particularly large, as well as under my eyes, before applying makeup.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product for oily skin or large pores.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to refine the look of my large pores on my cheek area, it did not do anything to either blur or mask those.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend for large pores.</li>
            <li> I believe that it does somewhat help the large pore situation.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m olive toned and have large pores on my T-zone.</li>
            <li> My pores still looked large, and I still needed a lot of powder to make it all matte.  </li>
            <li> My pores still looked large, and I still needed a lot of powder to make it all matte.  </li>
            <li> I have found that it does not erase my pores, especially my large ones, but it will blur the smaller ones.</li>
            <li> I have used products 5 times more expensive and from my typing :) to your ears, do not hesitate!</li>
            <li> The only plus is that it feels fine on my skin and didn&#x27;t cause any breakouts.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin with large pores.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have large pores, so I haven&#x27;t seen a difference really.  </li>
            <li> I have very oily skin with large pores.</li>
            <li> Really diminishes the appearance of large pores and wrinkles on my nose and under my eyes</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry most of the time</li>
            <li> Honestly, it just blurs a little bit.</li>
            <li> This product is clear and has a soft and smooth consistency.</li>
            <li> Baby Skin is a nice alternative for those of us that cannot afford the more expensive department store products.  </li>
            <li> I have huge pores everywhere and this product makes your face kinda blurry looking on naked skin</li>
            <li> Overall, blends really well with makeup and helps to smooth it out.</li>
            <li> My face gets really oily</li>
            <li> Even the smallest amount seems to be too much for me.</li>
            <li> If you use too much, your face is bound is feel greasy.</li>
            <li> and they have to be applied in a &amp;#34;patting motion&amp;#34; gently into your skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really erase your pores..</li>
            <li> but this helps to calm the oil, it hasn&#x27;t made me break out and it makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> so i was really worried</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice a difference</li>
            <li> but didnt really help cover noticeable imperfectons like I had hoped for</li>
            <li> It may work for others whose pores don&#x27;t need quite as much &amp;#34;erasing.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> it really really works</li>
            <li> but I really notice them disappear once I&#x27;ve put my foundation on.</li>
            <li> This did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li> Way better than I expected.</li>
            <li> You skin will be close up ready and photo</li>
            <li> but it has way too much slip.</li>
            <li> It works really well under make up</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do much for my pores.</li>
            <li> I let my friend use it with much lighter skin and it worked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say if you have a really even skin tone and are just looking at this product to correct pores it could almost be used without foundation.</li>
            <li> It does not make pores smaller, but it does make a smooth surface for makeup to glide on.</li>
            <li> and it has a very slippery feeling.</li>
            <li> This does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m very picky and a perfectionist)</li>
            <li> You really should buy this</li>
            <li> I really want to like it</li>
            <li> I suggest trying a test area before you really need to use it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really blur pores</li>
            <li> I call this my REAL LIFE PHOTOSHOP.</li>
            <li> The price is very comparable as well.</li>
            <li> a light foundation with a powder is enough to even my skin out.  </li>
            <li> I did not see much pore erasing/minimizing...</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really notice a difference..</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s really</li>
            <li> if you put foundation over it(which is the whole point)</li>
            <li> This product is very versatile.</li>
            <li> This stuff helped so much.</li>
            <li> The texture doesn&#x27;t really go away, it&#x27;s as if the gel just sits on your face without soaking in.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really does minimize pores and makes your skin look smoother.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s too greasy, Didn&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li> and this doesn&#x27;t help too much.</li>
            <li> Luv this product it really works.</li>
            <li> It works very well!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this product I found it at Walmart after I found it on here</li>
            <li> Really like this primer.</li>
            <li> i really like it</li>
            <li> I really like the way it makes my face feel after using it.  </li>
            <li> It has a silicone feeling and it really does fill in your pores.</li>
            <li> my face became VERY oily - even with my powder on</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> This product is very oily and does not set foundation very well at all.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery gets the job done</li>
            <li> but I have semi-oily skin, and I kind of felt oilier after a few hours of having this on.  </li>
            <li> But that does not mean it would not work for others!</li>
            <li> I was using the M.A.C. primer, but this is just as good, if not better, at a fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li> The next day, I steamed my face first to open up my pores, then applied the product, hoping it was absorb better.  </li>
            <li> This is SUCH an amazing product, especially considering the super low cost.  </li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t use too much - as always with makeup - less is more,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very new product, so I thought it was just all hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a clear, gel-like composition, which slides over the skin and feels like silk at first.  </li>
            <li> When I first tried this product, I was hesitant looking at the results because my pores were clearly visible.</li>
            <li> Now, even before I tried the stuff, I was kind of skeptical about clear gel with magic \\&quot;skin blurring properties\\&quot;-</li>
            <li> Loveee this stuff, I couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> It does have an odd smell to it as soon as you get it out of the tube, but once applied you cannot smell it any more</li>
            <li> I like this product, super soft &amp; smooth on my skin, &amp; does seem to slightly blur my pores..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to apply, takes 2 sec</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more in the future..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a clear, smooth gel that makes your skin feel hydrated and silky while minimizing imperfections, reducing the appearance of pores, and just overall making skin look healthier.</li>
            <li> then I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t waste too much money,</li>
            <li> It is a decent primer for the price of it and being from the drugstore.</li>
            <li> but it is decent in a pinch and decent for the price.</li>
            <li> It does temporarily give your face a &amp;#34;blurred&amp;#34; look, but it quickly just turns greasy which makes pores look larger.</li>
            <li> I got some at a local store and tried it - even right after applying it, letting it dry, and covering with powder, you could still easily see my pores.</li>
            <li> By the end of the day my makeup was a blotchy mess and most of had melted off.</li>
            <li> My pores vanished--or at least they were blurred out a lot more!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Upshot: I would only recommend this product to those lucky people who can apply pure Vaseline or baby oil directly to their faces without consequence.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT...</li>
            <li> In my experience, high end or drug store, products either work for you or they don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high expectations but thought I&#x27;d give it at try.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend</li>
            <li> It is thick but smooths out easily for a light soft coverage.</li>
            <li> Is good is just a weird product, is super soft in my skin.</li>
            <li> I have relatively clear skin, but unfortunately large pores.</li>
            <li> Chalking it up to a new product, I blotted quickly and left anyway.</li>
            <li> Get a good primer, it&#x27;ll do you better.ke baby powder on the skin: slightly moisturized, softer, but also dry.</li>
            <li> and personally I have some pretty large pores</li>
            <li> This really hides your pores and makes your skin so soft.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin soft, but doesn&#x27;t really hide any pores or wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This does make my skin really soft but it doesn&#x27;t really help with the pores.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t require much because it spreads really far.</li>
            <li> Maybelline&#x27;s target price is usually mid-shelf: better than the bottom shelf liquor (Wet and Wild), but not quite on par with the top shelf stuff (L&#x27;oreal, Physician&#x27;s Formula)- which may be why I&#x27;m put off by that price tag.  </li>
            <li> I have combination to oily skin, with relatively normal skin during the winter months.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t need to use powder on my face, as I normally would after applying foundation.</li>
            <li> right at my local Target!</li>
            <li> I have pores around my nose and some on my forehead right above the nose, so thats basically where I apply the product.</li>
            <li> Only reason I give this 2 stars is because it might be better on someone with very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I live in south Florida</li>
            <li> Decent product, but it really doesn&#x27;t work as well as most primers as far as smoothing down the facial surface.</li>
            <li> Creates a perfect base and feels really silky, not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I use to really like this product, but the second time I really didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> So far after a few days I am really pleased.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and am always cautious about trying new products.  </li>
            <li> Makes skin very soft.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> Thus far, it hasn&#x27;t caused irritation or zits, thankfully!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft!</li>
            <li> but I guess it would do the exact same thing as what I do!</li>
            <li> I was nervous the first time i used this because once applying you are left with the impression that this is greasy</li>
            <li> However, after applying the rest of my makeup, I could visibly see a different in my pores- positively.</li>
            <li> It did reduce pore visibility slightly, and my makeup looked smooth and natural.</li>
            <li> I have super oily skin and a moisturizer in my t-zone can sometimes cause too much oil in a few hours</li>
            <li> Once the primer is dry, it makes my face feel extra soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I would only recommend this product for someone with large pores, otherwise you don&#x27;t need it.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of discoloration in my face (red, lots of freckles, large pores), and it helps tone all these things</li>
            <li> After using this for about a month or so my face has started getting these large red almost welt-like patches where I applied Baby Skin.  </li>
            <li> It will not cover large deep pores or blackheads.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After lightly moisturizing, I squeezed a little bit onto my fingertips (no word on the label whether lotion hampers the product&#x27;s results).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clear primer, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t hide the large pores on my nose.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear whitish gel with some texture.</li>
            <li> Even if this had worked, it&#x27;s clear-</li>
            <li> Even if this had worked, it&#x27;s clear-</li>
            <li> The product is clear, with the consistency of Vaseline.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had issues with my skin and finding products to make it look clear.</li>
            <li> This product is clear so doesn&#x27;t affect any foundation color you may put over it.</li>
            <li> Goes on like a gel (clear gel), and erase the pores.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like ythat ir make your skin feel soft, however if you get it on your eyebrows, it leaves chunks of it on them.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face soft.</li>
            <li> It also made my skin so soft</li>
            <li> just realized at this very moment, that I don&#x27;t know the proper spelling for pours/poors in this context.  </li>
            <li> Made my skin very greasy and I don&#x27;t think my pores are any smaller.</li>
            <li> You only need a pea size amount to cover your whole face.</li>
            <li> it is silky soft it does soften the skin.</li>
            <li> It really helps makeup last longer!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really make my pores look any smaller</li>
            <li> I have seriously sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s transparent oily gel, it feels soft on the skin</li>
            <li> This leaves my skin soft which makes it easier to apply the rest of my makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely unsatisfied.</li>
            <li> It does what it promised!&lt;br /&gt;So soft , look at the difference!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it can only do so much.</li>
            <li> My 12 yr old daughter swiped it from me though.....</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used it enough to really determine if I like it...</li>
            <li> One application and my skin was so soft.</li>
            <li> And my skin was so soft still in the morning.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> To be fair though, you don&#x27;t need a lot, so the tube should last at least a week or two for someone who uses it once or twice daily .  </li>
            <li> Perfect as a primer or base for powder foundation.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Maybelline New York Baby Skin Instant Pore Eraser Primer.</li>
            <li> also want to say that I have oily skin that seems to break out at the drop of a hat, but if you use just the right amount of this pore eraser, you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem with breakouts or your makeup slipping and sliding.</li>
            <li> Sure, this stuff is pretty cheap but in this case you really do get what you pay for, this did absolutely nothing for me and it feels greasy and nasty.</li>
            <li> It does make your pores smaller and makes you use less makeup since it helps spread it easily.</li>
            <li> It did make my forehead area where there are very small pores more refined.  </li>
            <li> To the people saying this is greasy, TRY using small amounts ONLY in the places your pores are biggest and need to be most primed.</li>
            <li> especially the older we get.</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time last night; I attended a wedding and didn&#x27;t want my makeup to sink into the larger pores I have around my nose and between my brows.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations, but this product is a basic primer.</li>
            <li> It feels fine on, but it DOES NOT make pores look smaller, not even a little bit.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel, but it&#x27;s not good if you want to wear foundation over it.</li>
            <li> my face felt like matte paper then my skin peeled off within 3 days and was back to normal.</li>
            <li> First impressions: The gel&#x27;s texture was not something I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> My only wish is that it had SPF in it like the Avon version I normally buy.</li>
            <li> It feels a little greasy at first but after putting foundation over it, it just feels like normal.</li>
            <li> and I could see a difference one side looked dull and kinda fuzzy but felt so soft and smooth</li>
            <li> this not only makes my makeup last all day, but it really does &amp;#34;blur&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It really was just a waste of money, very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I slowly added more to the desired areas of my face, rubbing it in tiny circles, until I achieved the desired effect.</li>
            <li> Spreads easily too so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have big pores in some parts of my face ( around my cheeks near my nose) and it didn&#x27;t do anything!</li>
            <li> One more plus, a little tiny bit goes a very long way!</li>
            <li> Even after washing it off my whole face became very dry and scaly...</li>
            <li> A little goes a long ways and it glides smoothly onto your skin.</li>
            <li> It tends to make my makeup look splotchy or uneven/bad in general.</li>
            <li> when after I ordered this product, I walked into the Dollar General and saw it hanging on their rack.</li>
            <li> It works very well on small pores, and really does make them appear to vanish.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for two days so far</li>
            <li> 2 weeks later, they&#x27;ve almost completely gone away.</li>
            <li> some better, some worse.  </li>
            <li> Its nice don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> (I was a little surprised by that because several of the previous reviewers said they were able to use it without applying foundation over it.</li>
            <li> The only thing is it&#x27;s not exactly &amp;#34;instant&amp;#34; and it seems oily at first.</li>
            <li> It goes on so smoothly and a teeny little bit goes a LONG way because I&#x27;m only applying it to problem enlarged pore areas!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see any other use for this.</li>
            <li> but my nose on the other hand not so much.</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t exactly work miracles on my pores but it does fill them in a little so that my skin looks smoother and</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice a huge difference other than my face feeling a little softer.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my skin alone with nothing mixed into it and it barely made a difference.</li>
            <li> This gets two stars for the price, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s even worth that.</li>
            <li> It really makes my pores less visible... and it smoothens my skin too.</li>
            <li> I had washed my face with my usual routine before going to bed - I have never broken out like that before, and my skin was nearly clear until the day after I used the primer, so I&#x27;m assuming it was that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However,it is not necessarily long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;Meaning that my makeup doesn&#x27;t last a lot longer with this</li>
            <li> His looked exactly the same, and when he touched his face a few minutes later he said it felt like he&#x27;d smeared baby oil gel on</li>
            <li> His looked exactly the same, and when he touched his face a few minutes later he said it felt like he&#x27;d smeared baby oil gel on</li>
            <li> While I normally have a brief waiting period, my other primers only require 1-2 minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m generally hard to impress as far as skin products go, but this absolutely blew me away.</li>
            <li> This primer only lasts for a few hours before the oil starts coming through and in some cases the oil in the product comes through right away if I do not let it dry long enough before applying my foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pores on my chin and around my nose have been huge lately for some reason and other primers just aren&#x27;t covering them up properly.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed with Baby Skin, especially after I heard such good things.</li>
            <li> Also, be careful not to use too much, as a layer about as thick as I would normally apply foundation feels slippery, almost oily.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and used a tiny amount--roughly the size of a drop that would balance on the tip of a Q-tip--a little really did go a very long way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is kind of a silly plus-side, but it also helps me remove the mistake mascara that hits my upper eye lid, because there is something about the gel that helps remove the black makeup before it</li>
            <li> Not many products can do much about that, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and if you spray a makeup setting spray on your skin before application, this primer will make your makeup last twice as long.</li>
            <li> Thereafter I apply my foundation with a flat kabuki and my concealer, highlighter, blush, etc.</li>
            <li> If I ever run out of my regular primer or even if I&#x27;m only going to be gone for a few hours I tend to reach for this primer because of how soft it makes your skin.</li>
            <li> It minimized the look of my pores, but I could see where someone with really large, deep pores might have a hard time using this stuff.</li>
            <li> Bunch of tiny little dots along bridge of my nose and completely covered in bumps between my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> This does not have very long lasting stay.</li>
            <li> completely pore less.</li>
            <li> I tried it on other areas of my face where my pores are barely visible to see any difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it three different times, by itself, with pressed and loose powder, and with foundation.</li>
            <li> (My skin is very, very pale, and “normal” – so my review is for similar skin types.)</li>
            <li> Big pores or not there are other primers that actually do something!</li>
            <li> There was nothing different about this product from the other basic primers I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping for a less expensive alternative to fix my oily skin problem, but When it comes to primers, I think the department store brands are worth the splurge after all.</li>
            <li> I apply it only in my nose area, which is very dry.</li>
            <li> A little background I am in my early 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li> This product goes on soft as silk and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> So - I&#x27;d skip this and spend a little more next time, not impressed with it.</li>
            <li> The texture and visibility is just a minor issue.</li>
            <li> This product was much bigger than expected and met my expectations for the price.</li>
            <li> Much smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> I would only use this again for a night function or a function that would only last a few hours.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t any oily or wet feel to it initially-</li>
            <li> I loved it as a make-up base.</li>
            <li> This leaves your pores looking small/flawless and gives a good base for your foundation too.  </li>
            <li> My lines and pores didn&#x27;t disappear entirely but they definitely appeared blurred and were much less visible than before.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will admit, initially, I thought it made a tiny, slight difference- but after using it a couple times, I realized</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will admit, initially, I thought it made a tiny, slight difference- but after using it a couple times, I realized</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it one star is became I could use this for clients that have  extreme dryness as a moisturizer</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it makes my skin feel extremely oily .</li>
            <li> A little extra attention to your face reveals that you look the same.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry.</li>
            <li> Let it set in on your face for a while to let it dry some before adding foundation.</li>
            <li> but I was noticing that my Bare Minerals powder was caking within a few hours of applying.</li>
            <li> It blurs pores slightly, but not enough to make me want to continue using.</li>
            <li> And even though the container looks small, you seriously only need a tiny amount every day.</li>
            <li> It actually blurs them making them less noticeable.</li>
            <li> While it does make my pores appear less noticeable to the naked eye, I wouldn&#x27;t rely on it to drastically change the look of your skin.</li>
            <li> It definitely did blur my pores, and made the crease on my forehead less noticeable...</li>
            <li> Does not live up to product description!</li>
            <li> arrived on time but it tends to be a bit oily so you only need a little, however it works well</li>
            <li> I mixed a little bit of foundation/coverup into it (in the palm of my hand) before applying it</li>
            <li> It does make it a little slippery, so a powder is definitely necessary.  </li>
            <li> I followed the instructions properly and found no significant difference in my pore size after using it.</li>
            <li> It makes a little difference in my pores, but they obviously don&#x27;t disappear (I&#x27;m 45, pores are here to stay.)</li>
            <li> Use it everyday, lasts forever cause you only need a little tiny bit!</li>
            <li> I just personally am not a fan of how heavy it makes my face feel</li>
            <li> Minus a star for the smell.</li>
            <li> This was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> It just stays wet??  </li>
            <li> This closed up my pores after continued use.</li>
            <li> just make my face oily &amp; wet looking</li>
            <li> Was as expected for the price.</li>
            <li> So I decided to test it out and see if it was worth the raves it had been getting - sadly, it was not.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For what it cost, it is as expected but nothing like the others I have tried from department store brands.</li>
            <li> I am a dark black skin female and it did not do anything for me.</li>
            <li> My pores essentially disappear, I only need a very small amount every day, no scent/irritation.</li>
            <li> slightly moisturized, softer, but also dry.</li>
            <li> next morning, I woke up to a dotting of little pimples all around my nose!</li>
            <li> Just remember a little goes a long way with primers</li>
            <li> Just a little tab goes a long way 😍</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a LONG way with this product.</li>
            <li> I do not agree with what some of the other reviewers are saying.</li>
            <li> This tube while it may appear to be a small amount will last me months.</li>
            <li> I take a small amount on each ring finger, dab it into the areas a number of times where I have larger pores, and then I massage the remainder into my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have used other pore-refining products,</li>
            <li> On the other hand, the name suits it well.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to other people.</li>
            <li> This small tube will last a while.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I wear this alone, sometimes under other makeup.</li>
            <li> so instead, i put this primer on my t-zone and moisturizer on the other parts of my face.</li>
            <li> product I purchased in the last few months!</li>
            <li> The effects of this product are very minimal.</li>
            <li> Part of me wants to remove a star from the disappointment BUT on the other hand, FOR ME, this is a basic product.  </li>
            <li> It felt very strange and heavy.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to friends who don&#x27;t want to buy expensive primer&#x27;s and all you really need is a pea size.</li>
            <li> My work shifts are usually 8-10 hours long</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t suggest it for dark or ethnic skin.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately,  after about 5 minutes, it felt very greasy.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately,  after about 5 minutes, it felt very greasy.  </li>
            <li> not worth the money for me</li>
            <li> like this for everyday, when I put minimal makeup on.</li>
            <li> I am not willing to give up what this product does!</li>
            <li> Plus, a little bit goes a long way; I needed to apply very little to get results.</li>
            <li> I put this on half of my face and then had my family see if they could tell which side it was on.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s less than half the price it is on here.</li>
            <li> but if had made my pores even slightly less noticeable, or mattified my skin even a bit, I would have been all about it.  </li>
            <li> Also, there&#x27;s an odd odor to it, I smell it when I apply it on my face but don&#x27;t notice it afterwards.</li>
            <li> I put some on half of my face</li>
            <li> I put this on half of my face and asked my husband to see if he could tell a difference</li>
            <li> Since then, I&#x27;ve been on a quest to find the right combination of products to give me the same results, but after switching to another liquid foundation by Maybelline, I had to start using a primer, which I hate, b/c</li>
            <li> While my foundation application went a bit smoother than usual, when I checked the mirror on my way out the door, my face was starting to oil up pretty badly.</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s why i&#x27;m having such a hard time dealing with this slick sorta oily feel ( its not oily...</li>
            <li> I as a little hesitant to use it because I have oily skin</li>
            <li> Helps keep makup on a little longer</li>
            <li> It is a little greasy though.</li>
            <li> it feels a little like baby powder on the skin:</li>
            <li> A little oiler than i like, but still works well</li>
            <li> it didnt do anything for my skin besides make it softer and a little greasy..</li>
            <li> It does cover a little of my pores not all.</li>
            <li> A little greasier than I hope for out of a product like this</li>
            <li> This product does not work even a little bit though.</li>
            <li> Add a little makeup and they are no longer noticeable.</li>
            <li> it may be making my make up cake a little?</li>
            <li> I decided it was one of those products where you needed to get fully made up to notice any difference, and went on to finish my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a little over an hour</li>
            <li> If you like smashbox primer you will be shocked at how much this looks and feels just like it at a fraction of the price!!</li>
            <li> It does diminish your pores, but I thought it felt a little heavy on your skin</li>
            <li> Extremely  greasy!!</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff at my local bss on a whim, hoping it would help my poor strawberry nose look a little smoother.</li>
            <li> Studio Mineral Infused Face Primer in tone adjusting green</li>
            <li> tried it a few times and noticed even though it felt greasy</li>
            <li> I use this primer everyday with or without make up.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday</li>
            <li> and I have not had trouble with acne for year</li>
            <li> found waiting a few minutes and using some powder to set</li>
            <li> I use it everyday under my makeup</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money for this product.</li>
            <li> I tried using it with no moisturizer, and it still went greasy after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried using it with no moisturizer, and it still went greasy after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i tried it few times and the pores are still visible</li>
            <li> It does have an oily/slick texture, but I have oily skin and don&#x27;t have trouble with it.</li>
            <li> After a few hours when I checked the mirror again, my pores were *</li>
            <li> I have a few problems with this product.</li>
            <li> My makeup was still on at the end of the day, so I didn&#x27;t experience any problems with slippage or needing to reapply, however, at the end of day #2, I removed my makeup only to discover that I&#x27;d broken out--badly</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it every day because it feels heavy, but again those days I am in meeting after meeting, it is a must.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> and they stay hidden ALL DAY!</li>
            <li> But I went out on a limb and bought this, and it&#x27;s pretty bad.</li>
            <li> a lifesaver in a little tube!</li>
            <li> I like this little thing!</li>
            <li> Without this as my primer, my foundation is hard to blend onto my skin and is a little splotchy.</li>
            <li> It helps with pores but is a little thick and greasy.</li>
            <li> I use very little because it can cause makeup to slide off.lol.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d forgotten how badly a face covered in acne can really</li>
            <li> obviously doesn&#x27;t come close to those expensive primers</li>
            <li> it actually really dried out my skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about this item.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a small burning sensation upon application as well.</li>
            <li> product is slick, but stays where you put it if you don&#x27;t overdo it.</li>
            <li> As I said I have used products that cost 5 times what this cost and if I had this product I would have saved myself hundreds of dollars in wasted money!</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> The tube is small.</li>
            <li> I usually purchase it at Walmart</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s affordable and comparable to my usual $20 primer.</li>
            <li> not sure I&#x27;d buy it again..</li>
            <li> unfortunately this worked differently,</li>
            <li> Had to switch back to my expensive smash box.</li>
            <li> I usually have to buy products for my face with no fragrance, dyes, etc.  </li>
            <li> (My teen daughters informed me that I looked like a sad, spotted 7th grader who hasn&#x27;t yet discovered face wash.)</li>
            <li> I use a bead about the size of a small grain of rice each time.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable..</li>
            <li> not sure yet.</li>
            <li> , it was like an oil slick on my t-zone and around my nose.</li>
            <li> and it helps make the rest of my makeup look less like makeup!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help me much :(</li>
            <li> I can hardly see my pores through my make up</li>
            <li> For me, it was hard to apply the correct amount because a lot would come out of the tube.</li>
            <li> I can see where some reviewers had a hard time laying powder over it (because it&#x27;s silicone</li>
            <li> Well, at least until I started dancing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m cutting back on my expenses to pay for my graduate student loans and my wedding.</li>
            <li> Well, DUH....</li>
            <li> So in my opinion it sucks.</li>
            <li> Also make cakes when this is applied at least to my skin.</li>
            <li> sucks.</li>
            <li> I used some blotting papers, but within another hour it was oily and icky once again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as thick as Miracle Blur</li>
            <li> I find it a tad to thick to be a primer.</li>
            <li> and it does require a learning curve for figuring out how to apply it so that it doesn&#x27;t work, but isn&#x27;t too thick.</li>
            <li> Actually didn&#x27;t work that bad.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t so much make me break out, but irritate my skin very badly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to see when applying and almost immediately disappears once applied to your face.</li>
            <li> so very oily disgusting</li>
            <li> Worse than with no primer at all.</li>
            <li> which is irritating cause</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t make it worse.</li>
            <li> No 7 Beautifully Matte as my moisturizer/ primer combination.</li>
            <li> For my skin, this is the worst primer I&#x27;ve tried so far.  </li>
            <li> became obsessed w/ this stuff.</li>
            <li> This product was oily and useless.</li>
            <li> just weird ).</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this purchase and neither is my face!</li>
            <li> This product has a weird consistency (kinda greasy), and it doesn&#x27;t seem to &amp;#34;erase&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Weird greasy feeling</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this</li>
            <li> I was sadly disappointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And sadly, my foundation gravitated into my pores even faster than it did with just the primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> And sadly, my foundation gravitated into my pores even faster than it did with just the primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> Not impressed,  too greasy for me</li>
            <li> i bought expensive ones that i dont use because i prefer to use baby skin</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Baby Skin&amp;#34; is right--if they&#x27;re referring to the unfortunate infants born with baby acne.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this</li>
            <li> so it can stick in weird ways), but I blended with my stick foundation and didn&#x27;t have a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Clogs your pores and makes skin feel weird.</li>
            <li> your skeptical just try it and see if it works for you.</li>
            <li> I added a very thin layer to the rest of my face to get a uniform look, but I don&#x27;t think this was necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A very thin layer is perfecto.</li>
            <li> I thing the people that say it clogged their pores and mad them oily are probably putting it on like cake frosting.</li>
            <li> But it is not THAT bad.</li>
            <li> ; my pores, though, admittedly, I have bad skin.  </li>
            <li> it smells bad</li>
            <li> BAD PLAN.</li>
            <li> This product clogged my pores really badly.  </li>
            <li> Now, my skin has always been oily, but never that bad.</li>
            <li> But with the experience I had, it was too bothersome blotting my face every hour and then waking up with a painful breakout.</li>
            <li> Totally disappointed</li>
            <li> I had hoped this would help but it didnt :(</li>
            <li> I was disappointed</li>
            <li> ..I hate giving this onky 3 stars, but it did not work as it claims.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it</li>
            <li> I was shocked!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have awful oily formula like some base products</li>
            <li> breaks me out very bad</li>
            <li> Awful!</li>
            <li> This primer has some ingredients that can be terrible for acne prone skin!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I wear this under my makeup and when I applied my makeup on it gave me a flawless look i&#x27;d never had before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I became obsessed w/ this stuff. I recommend it to friends who don&#x27;t want to buy expensive primer&#x27;s and all you really need is a pea size. My face gets really oily but I have never had to even retouch up w/ this on. My work shifts are usually 8-10 hours long and I never once have to retouch up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It obviously doesn&#x27;t come close to those expensive primers but it sure does a hell of a job for the price its at. Can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> love it! makes my skin look and feel smoother. i wear this underneath my foundation and it makes my skin look flawless.</li>
            <li> I put it on once in the morning.  Face feels super smooth and easier to apply foundation.  Highly recommend.  Great price.</li>
            <li> This makes my face feel so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> Love this.  Works like a dream.</li>
            <li> Worth the buy 100% and it&#x27;s cheaper here than in stores!</li>
            <li> THIS IS MAGIC. Works as described. Allow it to set up for a minute or two before putting on your foundation and WOW! It truly transforms the presentation of your skin. I am not positive whether this is going to cause any clogging, it is a unique texture, so I am pre-empting that with making sure I do my cucumber peels often. I am not willing to give up what this product does!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I was amazed... Primed my face for foundation beautifully! However it made my face break-out! When the bumps go away I will try it alone or with a different foundation. For the price it&#x27;s worth a try. I loved it as a make-up base. I&#x27;m hoping it will work with my lighter-weight foundation.</li>
            <li> This stuff feels like it just sits on my face and forms sort of a glazed layer.  The first day I wore it, my makeup was just sliding off my face with the slightest touch.  The next day, I steamed my face first to open up my pores, then applied the product, hoping it was absorb better.  No such luck.  Even the smallest amount seems to be too much for me.</li>
            <li> so very oily disgusting</li>
            <li> This is definitely  not for people  with oily skin after about 2 hours wearing  this product it looks like I rubbed  vegetable oil all over my face.</li>
            <li> I like ythat ir make your skin feel soft, however if you get it on your eyebrows, it leaves chunks of it on them.</li>
            <li> Did not see a difference whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Probably my favorite primer - even better than my smash box one. To the people saying this is greasy, TRY using small amounts ONLY in the places your pores are biggest and need to be most primed. If you use too much, your face is bound is feel greasy. This is a great primer when you work with it the right way.</li>
            <li> Awful! This product was oily and useless. Totally disappointed</li>
            <li> Where is the pore erasing qualities to this? I have big pores in some parts of my face ( around my cheeks near my nose) and it didn&#x27;t do anything! I tried it on other areas of my face where my pores are barely visible to see any difference. None! I have never used a primer with silicone so i&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s why i&#x27;m having such a hard time dealing with this slick sorta oily feel ( its not oily...just weird ). I have used the e.l.f. Studio Mineral Infused Face Primer in tone adjusting green and since i ran out i wanted to another drug store primer. I read comments of people saying it was more for dry skin and not oily, but in my case i have pretty oily skin, and i didn&#x27;t see an increase. Just remember a little goes a long way with primers and they have to be applied in a &amp;#34;patting motion&amp;#34; gently into your skin. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this primer for anyone. Its just a slather or silicone on your face. Big pores or not there are other primers that actually do something!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently started looking more closely at my cosmetics and checking the ingredients before using. This primer has some ingredients that can be terrible for acne prone skin! Even before realizing what was in this primer, I found that it didn&#x27;t work well at all. It looked fine for about an hour and then got really oily. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for anyone with oily skin.</li>
            <li> This gets two stars for the price, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s even worth that. This was the worst primer I&#x27;ve ever used! It felt so greasy and looked it. I do not have oily skin, if anything I run into more issues with dryness. Even using the smallest amount my fave felt awful and greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it a few times and noticed even though it felt greasy it actually really dried out my skin! I was not happy with this purchase and neither is my face!</li>
            <li> This stuff is surprisingly effective. I spread it over the areas of my face where my pores are particularly large, as well as under my eyes, before applying makeup. My lines and pores didn&#x27;t disappear entirely but they definitely appeared blurred and were much less visible than before. Plus, a little bit goes a long way; I needed to apply very little to get results.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really erase your pores.. It might even make them more visible.</li>
            <li> Amazing, this product goes on smooth on my face and it covers up any noticeable pores on my face. Great buy I will definitely, purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I use this primer everyday with or without make up. It leaves my face soft.</li>
            <li> Buy this. You will thank yourself later.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t minimize pores guys.  It&#x27;s a lie</li>
            <li> Love this because it really does blur blemishes and you can&#x27;t beat the price. I as a little hesitant to use it because I have oily skin but this helps to calm the oil, it hasn&#x27;t made me break out and it makes my skin feel so soft. I use it under the maybeline bb cream and it works great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good primer, it doesn&#x27;t cancel pores out though.</li>
            <li> It feel nice and make my skin soft and more even.</li>
            <li> It was a pretty good product i have oily skin so i was really worried bt i reall like it. It also made my skin so soft</li>
            <li> Made my skin feel greasy and didn&#x27;t shrink my pores at all. The only difference I noticed was that my skin felt gross. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite make up products I own! Makes my skin so soft and makes my skin look much more clear, and obviously makes my make up look better too.</li>
            <li> I Absolutely Hate The Consistency Of This Product! Feels So Freaking Greasy!</li>
            <li> I did not purchase this for Amazon, but I wanted to review this product. I have very oily skin with large pores. This product goes on smoothly. But, it left my skin greasy &amp; it did not decrease or blur my pores. I would not recommend this product for oily skin or large pores. I like Benefit&#x27;s  Porefessional.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice a difference</li>
            <li> reduces the appearance of pores</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feels good to touch, and no rash nor irritation from it. Would totally buy it again.</li>
            <li> Cancelled subscribe and save. I have easy to maintain skin, this cause mine to breakout because of clogged pores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as spectacular as I&#x27;ve heard and it seems to melt off in the southern heat where I live. However the price is great and it&#x27;s a good day to day primer type cover for those going for natural looks. If you are looking to apply heavier creams or layering anything on for a more made up look, go for something else.</li>
            <li> Feels slightly oily when you put it on but works great! First time I&#x27;ve used a product like this and I&#x27;m very happy with the results</li>
            <li> I really love this product. It feels oily on my fingers after I put it on my face.Overall though, it leaves my skin softer and it allows foundation to easily slide over. It isn&#x27;t suppose to make pores disappear, but it does do a nice job covering them. Will definitely buy more in the future..</li>
            <li> Works great. It&#x27;s like a cross between Revlon&#x27;s face primer and Loreal&#x27;s Miracle Blur. It&#x27;s not as thick as Miracle Blur but you get the same effect, just without the waxiness. It&#x27;s more clear and silky like Revlon&#x27;s primer so it glides on more easily. It&#x27;s a bit moister/wetter than Miracle Blur. Basically this helps your base go on great and does a nice job of spackling those pores so your makeup looks more flawless. Just don&#x27;t use too much - as always with makeup - less is more, especially the older we get. A great way to layer, use this first, then a light layer of illuminating BB cream with sunscreen, then your concealer, then your favorite base makeup, then highlighter, then a light dusting of setting powder, then a light misting of finishing spray. Lovely you!</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling so flawless</li>
            <li> Pretty good primer, just make sure that you don&#x27;t use too much or your foundation will start to separate. This works well for oily skin and if you spray a makeup setting spray on your skin before application, this primer will make your makeup last twice as long.</li>
            <li> Magnificent, I really liked this product. Leaves my skin very smooth in seconds. just I love it-</li>
            <li> On time.Product was undamaged. LOVE</li>
            <li> Its ok. It kind of blurs but didnt really help cover noticeable imperfectons like I had hoped for</li>
            <li> Great primer!  I use this everyday and I believe it helps my skin.  The texture is really great and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Too greasy feeling but I got it at a great price so I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> love this. i will order more in the future</li>
            <li> Amazing products. ....delivered on time</li>
            <li> a lifesaver in a little tube!</li>
            <li> I had heard good things about how well this product works. It&#x27;s a very new product, so I thought it was just all hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nope. This stuff is magical. I have relatively clear skin, but unfortunately large pores. After using just a dab of this  my face looked photoshopped. I will be recommending it to everyone I know!</li>
            <li> Product is lightweight and not oily.  I don&#x27;t have large pores, so I haven&#x27;t seen a difference really.  It tends to make my foundation go on smoother though.</li>
            <li> Works really well!  I have used many prestige brand pore &#x27;erasers&#x27;, and I have to say this is right up there with all of them.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> None of these things seem to work well for my skin - this is not as good as the Porefessional by Benefit, though. I got some at a local store and tried it - even right after applying it, letting it dry, and covering with powder, you could still easily see my pores. So - I&#x27;d skip this and spend a little more next time, not impressed with it. Would&#x27;ve been great if it&#x27;d worked as the price point is much better than the higher end stuff. This is basically like the powder chafing relief gel that lots of people use as an alternative.</li>
            <li> Does not live up to product description!</li>
            <li> It does however leave my skin super soft feeling and it makes a good primer for makeup. My pores though look the same with and without. I&#x27;m fair skinned with large pores so it might work for somebody else.</li>
            <li> Decent product, but it really doesn&#x27;t work as well as most primers as far as smoothing down the facial surface. Nice price for the amount given. A good choice for budget-conscious buyers.</li>
            <li> Helps keep makup on a little longer</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I put it on every morning and my face feels smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work perfectly with oily T-zones. But it is not THAT bad.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Perfect as a primer or base for powder foundation.</li>
            <li> This product has a weird consistency (kinda greasy), and it doesn&#x27;t seem to &amp;#34;erase&amp;#34; my pores, though, admittedly, I have bad skin.  It would be better were it tinted.  Neither my primer nor my foundation lay smoothly over this product when applied.  It may work for others whose pores don&#x27;t need quite as much &amp;#34;erasing.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I do not agree with what some of the other reviewers are saying. If you like smashbox primer you will be shocked at how much this looks and feels just like it at a fraction of the price!! Love it!!! I have never bothered to review anything else from amazon but i was so impressed with this product i just had to...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about this item.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter she loved this stuff. Time to get some more.</li>
            <li> I love this primer it makes my makeup stay but the only thing i dont like is the smell of it.</li>
            <li> good alternative to some of the more high end face primers</li>
            <li> Good if you have small pores (which don&#x27;t really really need this to begin with lol) and not good for large pores.  I purchased this to refine the look of my large pores on my cheek area, it did not do anything to either blur or mask those.  It did make my forehead area where there are very small pores more refined.  I don&#x27;t recommend for large pores.</li>
            <li> Amazing!! This product goes on soft as silk and a little goes a long way. This tube while it may appear to be a small amount will last me months. It is thick but smooths out easily for a light soft coverage. I am 35 and I have not had trouble with acne for year and I had no pock marks from acne however I started using a BiPap machine to sleep with at night and the warm moist air caused the black heads on my nose and my pores to become inflamed and infected. I have several pores that were made larger by the problem and this product helps minimize the appearance greatly. I did not believe that it was possible, but it is. Definitely boosts my self esteem.</li>
            <li> Will always use this , very pleased and surprised .. it really really works</li>
            <li> arrived on time but it tends to be a bit oily so you only need a little, however it works well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for two days so far but it has been working well. It&#x27;s clear whitish gel with some texture. It&#x27;s very hard to see when applying and almost immediately disappears once applied to your face. I can hardly see my pores through my make up so it does its job. The texture and visibility is just a minor issue.</li>
            <li> Makes skin silky feeling but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> Comparable to Smashbox primer. Works great for a cheap price.</li>
            <li> broke my T-zone area out horribly. Bunch of tiny little dots along bridge of my nose and completely covered in bumps between my eyebrows. Then below the actual eyebrow, bumps had me looking permanently disgruntled. 2 weeks later, they&#x27;ve almost completely gone away.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!!!! My pores are huge and this stuff literally erases them!</li>
            <li> Its makes my skin overly oily.</li>
            <li> I love this! It blurs my pores but I really notice them disappear once I&#x27;ve put my foundation on. I have huge pores so I really love something so affordable to use. Recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love this! It makes my face feel so smooth.</li>
            <li> The effects of this product are very minimal. It blurs pores slightly, but not enough to make me want to continue using. It has a texture very similar to that of vaseline. It doesn&#x27;t blend well when applied under makeup and looks a bit streaky (I apply my foundation with my fingers, if you use brushes that may help). Also, I have dry/sensitive skin on my cheeks. When I use this under makeup, it makes the dry, flaky patches on my skin more noticeable. There&#x27;s a small burning sensation upon application as well.</li>
            <li> love love love this stuff</li>
            <li> Doesnt minimise/hide/fill pore in any way..not worth.(</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time last night; I attended a wedding and didn&#x27;t want my makeup to sink into the larger pores I have around my nose and between my brows. I thought it was great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is slick, but stays where you put it if you don&#x27;t overdo it. I slowly added more to the desired areas of my face, rubbing it in tiny circles, until I achieved the desired effect. I added a very thin layer to the rest of my face to get a uniform look, but I don&#x27;t think this was necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, while I would wear this on its own, it looked much better under my sheer BB cream. Alone my pores were still present, but &amp;#34;blurred.&amp;#34; The pore eraser allowed my BB cream to sit nicely on top of my skin and not sink into my pores and make them more noticeable. In fact, my pores basically disappeared when I finished my look. I liked this product over my loreal studio primer, which is much thicker/heavier  (but works well for very large pores).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found waiting a few minutes and using some powder to set it kept my face looking matte all night... Well, at least until I started dancing. My makeup did  not melt off, but I glistened a bit!</li>
            <li> The product is great and all but you can get it cheaper at Walmart. I got mine for about $6.</li>
            <li> I love this primer. This is the first I&#x27;ve ever gotten and I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday under my makeup</li>
            <li> Not as good as smashbox, doesn&#x27;t really have much of an effect.</li>
            <li> Happy with everything</li>
            <li> I have combination skin with an oily t-zone. I use Olay Total Effects CC cream (medium-to-dark) mixed with Boots No 7 Beautifully Matte as my moisturizer/ primer combination. I wait a bit then put the Baby Skin on my t-zone. Thereafter I apply my foundation with a flat kabuki and my concealer, highlighter, blush, etc. I legitimately look like I have baby&#x27;s skin. I live in south Florida so I don&#x27;t know how this will hold up in the summer, but so far so good. I&#x27;m cutting back on my expenses to pay for my graduate student loans and my wedding. This is a great alternative to Benefits Porefessional.</li>
            <li> Nothing goof for baby skin look like .</li>
            <li> I love how this does what it says it will. I wear it alone and it makes my face look completely pore less. It&#x27;s not a big tube but you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of product.</li>
            <li> Really great product!  Will definitely get again!</li>
            <li> This did absolutely nothing for me. I&#x27;ve noticed no difference in the appearance of my skin or the finish of make up applied over it. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite product! It&#x27;s like a clear, smooth gel that makes your skin feel hydrated and silky while minimizing imperfections, reducing the appearance of pores, and just overall making skin look healthier.</li>
            <li> Good as a primer hides all your pores!</li>
            <li> Way better than I expected. I adore this product. I thought well sure it makes your skin look great, and yeah it is easy to use but there is far more to it than meets the eye. Try mixing it with a bit of foundation and watch the magic begin! Talk about skin perfection! I have used products 5 times more expensive and from my typing :) to your ears, do not hesitate! Put this in your cart and buy it. I do want to add one more note, I was a make-up artist for many years, still am on special occasions, and one of my biggest request is the reduction of pores. As I said I have used products that cost 5 times what this cost and if I had this product I would have saved myself hundreds of dollars in wasted money! You skin will be close up ready and photo ready.&lt;br /&gt;* Seller shipped super fast and product is delightful!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and am always cautious about trying new products.  This stuff feels GREAT on my face and absorbs quickly making my skin feel like &amp;#34;Baby Skin&amp;#34;.  Makeup goes on really smoothly afterwards too.</li>
            <li> Product was ok but made my face even oilier than what it is. I will be searching for a quick fox for a pore eraser.</li>
            <li> Love love LOVE! This product is GREAT on my skin. My pores essentially disappear, I only need a very small amount every day, no scent/irritation. This is a great product for those on a budget. And even though the container looks small, you seriously only need a tiny amount every day. One container lasts me about a month.</li>
            <li> Seems to work rather well</li>
            <li> breaks me out very bad</li>
            <li> Very good for the price, amazing, face feels velvety smooth, and works just as good as porefessional from sephora which is 31.00 this was 4$ a steal, I better order more!! Lol</li>
            <li> This is SUCH an amazing product, especially considering the super low cost.  It does have an odd smell to it as soon as you get it out of the tube, but once applied you cannot smell it any more and it hasn&#x27;t irritated any part of my face or skin.  This leaves your pores looking small/flawless and gives a good base for your foundation too.  I have been telling everyone I know about this product - go Maybelline, another cosmetic favorite!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS...THIS IS MY MOISTURIZER MY PORE ERASER &amp; PRIMER ALL IN 1...AFTER APPLYING MY YOUTHFUL BRILLIANCE EYE SERUM THIS IS THE NEXT THING THAT GOES ON BEFORE APPLYING MY FOUNDATION...I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT...I CONTINUE TO USE IT &amp; WILL BUY AGAIN!!!</li>
            <li> Weird greasy feeling I didn&#x27;t like it. :/</li>
            <li> This cost a little more than I would have liked to pay....but it does make my face appear younger..it closes pores.. or Maes them disappear. It&#x27;s so good with makeup. It doesn&#x27;t have awful oily formula like some base products</li>
            <li> Not my favorite purchase. Similar to elf primer but it has way too much slip.</li>
            <li> I would only recommend this product for someone with large pores, otherwise you don&#x27;t need it.</li>
            <li> People putting this on and complaining that you can&#x27;t see a difference in your pore size.... Well, DUH.... You have to PRIME your face with this.. It fills in the pores on your face... THEN apply concealer and foundation or bb cream... THAT is when your pores disappear. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with this product. It works as advertised. The tube is small. I expect to be replacing it every couple weeks... Just in case anyone else has this on subscription.</li>
            <li> Great great !!!! I use it in clients and myself</li>
            <li> Bought this to eliminate that midday shine. Works great and leaves skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this product. A little goes a long ways and it glides smoothly onto your skin. It works really well under make up and it makes it last hours longer than without it. After I apply my moisturizer, I wait til my face dries, then I apply this and do my eyes while it dries and then apply my concealer/foundation. It does smell like plastic/silicon for a second when applying but it disappears after 10 seconds. I love this and use it as a primer over my others.</li>
            <li> I love it and I think that this is definitely under rated because it&#x27;s not being applied correctly.  Everyone (even me at first) assumes you just rub it all over your face, but that is not the case.  Because it is a pore eraser, it needs to be patted or dabbed into your pores.  I take a small amount on each ring finger, dab it into the areas a number of times where I have larger pores, and then I massage the remainder into my skin.  It does feel greasy at first but if you continue to massage it into your skin, that goes away.  this not only makes my makeup last all day, but it really does &amp;#34;blur&amp;#34; my pores...especially on my nose.  This is a staple in my makeup routine!!</li>
            <li> Loveee this stuff, I couldn&#x27;t live without it! It makes my skin feel so smooth and shrinks my pores! Plus it looks great under my foundation, I don&#x27;t find it greasy at all... Just a little tab goes a long way 😍</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this but it turned out to actually work. I have really big pores around my nose and on my chin. It makes me skin look flawless and it lasts almost up to 12 hours. It feels a little greasy at first but after putting foundation over it, it just feels like normal.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do much for my pores. I let my friend use it with much lighter skin and it worked. Wouldn&#x27;t suggest it for dark or ethnic skin.</li>
            <li> Love the consistency of this product its very light weight and makes skin feel very smooth and does minimize most of my pores! Love love love this!</li>
            <li> This product was much bigger than expected and met my expectations for the price. It shipped in record time, no mishaps. The only thing is it&#x27;s not exactly &amp;#34;instant&amp;#34; and it seems oily at first.</li>
            <li> I do like it and is afforxable however i would pay extra for better quality. Not bad but thetes bettsr out tjere</li>
            <li> I love this product-- it&#x27;s soft and silky smooth. It does great things to help erase visible pores. I have a lot of discoloration in my face (red, lots of freckles, large pores), and it helps tone all these things down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it in addition to another green-based primer (because of my rosacea) to get the most out of it, as well as my foundation. I&#x27;d say if you have a really even skin tone and are just looking at this product to correct pores it could almost be used without foundation. A really great product for the price!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a pore filler but it does blur out pores. It came in great timing 😘😘😘😘</li>
            <li> I use it daily and I love it!!</li>
            <li> After trying both, I think that this comes very close to Benefits the Porefessional at a much better price</li>
            <li> It does not make pores smaller, but it does make a smooth surface for makeup to glide on. I really don&#x27;t see any other use for this.</li>
            <li> Much smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money for this product.</li>
            <li> You can instantly see a difference in the size of your pours. I reccomend before foundation or powder.</li>
            <li> It work rather well, if feeling a bit greasy at first.  This goes away as your rub in the product.  I have used other pore-refining products, some better, some worse.  Overall, a good product.</li>
            <li> The product feels like it just sits on top of your skin and it has a very slippery feeling. It didn&#x27;t help conceal or reduce the size of my pores either. So in my opinion it sucks.</li>
            <li> This does absolutely nothing. It did not make my skin look any different and didn&#x27;t work as a primer. The only plus is that it feels fine on my skin and didn&#x27;t cause any breakouts.</li>
            <li> Excellent primer for any foundation</li>
            <li> I love baby skin! I use it as just a primer and it helps make the rest of my makeup look less like makeup!! Love it!!</li>
            <li> Great for the price!!! I will deffently buy this again!!!</li>
            <li> I found it to be too greasy.</li>
            <li> Loved the long lasting wear it gives.</li>
            <li> ..I hate giving this onky 3 stars, but it did not work as it claims. On the other hand, the name suits it well. It made my skin feel like a baby for sure; it didnt, however keep my makeup from getting into my pours.i just realized at this very moment, that I don&#x27;t know the proper spelling for pours/poors in this context.  Huh!</li>
            <li> Brand new, in the packaging, exactly what is said is what I got :)</li>
            <li> I put this on half of my face and then had my family see if they could tell which side it was on.  They couldn&#x27;t.  It feels fine on, but it DOES NOT make pores look smaller, not even a little bit.</li>
            <li> Chepear than Benefit and it works almost the same! :)</li>
            <li> Did not like it and it broke out my face. I am a dark black skin female and it did not do anything for me. But that does not mean it would not work for others!</li>
            <li> I purchased this in-store. I do not like the consistency. For me, it was hard to apply the correct amount because a lot would come out of the tube. While it did seem to hide pores, my skin reacted to it by producing more oil. By mid-day my face was a lot more oily than normal. I would only use this again for a night function or a function that would only last a few hours. This is not an all day product for me.</li>
            <li> i LOVE this it works wonders for my skin</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my skin look and feel. It&#x27;s almost silky. It&#x27;s a pretty small tune but you don&#x27;t need very much anyway. I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make me break out so that&#x27;s good. It does make your pores smaller and makes you use less makeup since it helps spread it easily. &amp; it makes my face SUPER soft, but could easily be scraped off with my finger nail. I probably won&#x27;t buy again, I don&#x27;t like how it makes my face feel somewhat cakey and gooey. I do suggest to anyone who&#x27;s contemplating on buying it to buy it though &amp; try it out because it does do its job. I just personally am not a fan of how heavy it makes my face feel (I&#x27;m very picky and a perfectionist)</li>
            <li> Nice feel on, pretty good to lessen pores</li>
            <li> I really love this! It really works!! I&#x27;m gonna have to get me another one!! You really should buy this</li>
            <li> Made my skin very greasy and I don&#x27;t think my pores are any smaller. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to other people.</li>
            <li> I have dry/combination skin and this stuff is terrible.  I can only imagine if you had oily skin what a nightmare this product would be.  My makeup slipped all over my face all day and my pores were still just as noticeable as when I have nothing on my skin.  If you are looking for a product to erase the look of pores and fine lines then I would recommend L&#x27;Oreal Paris RevitaLift Miracle Blur Cream.</li>
            <li> I really want to like it I do but it didn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped. Its nice don&#x27;t get me wrong and it sort of worked on my cheeks but my nose on the other hand not so much. I have the worst time trying to put foundation on my nose. It gets in my pores and looks speckely and horrible. I had hoped this would help but it didnt :( im going to try the benifit one next wish me luck. I hope it works for you guys.</li>
            <li> Love this! It works great and is a great brand!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way. You only need a pea size amount to cover your whole face. I haven&#x27;t seen much change in my pore size, but it&#x27;s good for just a regular primer. It is a little greasy though.</li>
            <li> I suggest trying a test area before you really need to use it. Even after washing it off my whole face became very dry and scaly...my face felt like matte paper then my skin peeled off within 3 days and was back to normal.</li>
            <li> I believe that it does somewhat help the large pore situation.  I find it works better with some makeups than others.....</li>
            <li> It makes your skin sooooo smooth . I love it because it really makes my skin look and feel soft .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ps. I got mine from Kmart waayyyy cheaper</li>
            <li> I gave this product a try for about a week and I had no visible change in pore appearance whatsoever. I have pretty large, visible pores on my cheeks and nose, so I didn&#x27;t expect a drastic improvement. However, I couldn&#x27;t even tell that I had ever applied it to my face. I would not recommend it, but if you have small-looking pores then maybe you&#x27;ll have better luck than I did.</li>
            <li> I mostly don&#x27;t ware makeup, but I like to put put this primer on my face alone and  it works WONDERS! My skin is soft and my pore are filled in and if I do ware makeup it stays on longer than it would without the baby skin. I would suggest getting this at a local drug store ware it&#x27;s less than half the price it is on here.</li>
            <li> Nice light weight primer. It doesn&#x27;t really blur pores but it is great for getting my make up to last all day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definately not as good as Porefessional (the much pricier product that it&#x27;s trying to emulate) but it does make a difference in pore visibility. I tried it on my skin alone with nothing mixed into it and it barely made a difference. The next time I wore it I mixed a little bit of foundation/coverup into it (in the palm of my hand) before applying it and it had more pore-erasing power. It&#x27;s not as smooth as Porefessional but for 1/5th of the price I&#x27;ll use it on my non-important days.</li>
            <li> This product is clear and has a soft and smooth consistency. A small amount goes a long way. I purchased it with the intention to use it as a primer, and it really is great if you are looking for a primer that will make your make up last all day. It did reduce pore visibility slightly, and my makeup looked smooth and natural. Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really fill in the pores, kind of just smoothed out skin. Nice texture, clear, but didn&#x27;t really do the job for me.</li>
            <li> Loved it and would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> I call this my REAL LIFE PHOTOSHOP. It makes my skin look really smooth!</li>
            <li> Love this product! I usually purchase it at Walmart but it seems to be out of stock most of the time. So happy to find it here! Makes your face smooth and ready for makeup. The price is very comparable as well.</li>
            <li> I would say that this is very similar to using Monistat Soothing Care Chafing Relief Powder Gel on your face. It&#x27;s too thin and really doesn&#x27;t have much &amp;#34;staying&amp;#34; power. I&#x27;m olive toned and have large pores on my T-zone. I&#x27;ve been using a pore refiner from Kohl&#x27;s but thought I&#x27;d give this a try. I&#x27;m going to have to pass and return this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a drastic difference when using this product, but there is a difference and my pores do appear somewhat smaller. It also feels really good on my skin and is very easy to apply... a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Fantastic results, really smooths the skin and under makeup makes for an almost flawless look. I highly recommend the Maybelline New York Baby Skin Instant Pore Eraser Primer. I really love it. Will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> In my opinion works better than benefits porefessional ! Def will be purchasing again 💖</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I saw an advertisement for this stuff.  I have very fair, oily skin with some large pores on and around the nose.  I don&#x27;t like wearing a ton of makeup- a light foundation with a powder is enough to even my skin out.  Unfortunately, Maybelline discontinued one of their best products (Pure H20 Foundation), which was aces as a foundation with a matte finish.  Even with matte finish foundations, I need a finishing powder, but that stuff was the closest I came to not needing some.  Since then, I&#x27;ve been on a quest to find the right combination of products to give me the same results, but after switching to another liquid foundation by Maybelline, I had to start using a primer, which I hate, b/c it feels like i&#x27;m just putting more oily stuff on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought this stuff was my salvation, and would eliminate the need for the primer and maybe even lessen the need for powder.  I was sadly disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;R&lt;br /&gt;At eight buck a pop, they&#x27;re selling you a pretty small tube- Maybelline&#x27;s target price is usually mid-shelf: better than the bottom shelf liquor (Wet and Wild), but not quite on par with the top shelf stuff (L&#x27;oreal, Physician&#x27;s Formula)- which may be why I&#x27;m put off by that price tag.  To be fair though, you don&#x27;t need a lot, so the tube should last at least a week or two for someone who uses it once or twice daily .  It&#x27;s gimmick is what&#x27;s called \\&quot;blur technology\\&quot;.  Now, even before I tried the stuff, I was kind of skeptical about clear gel with magic \\&quot;skin blurring properties\\&quot;- but if had made my pores even slightly less noticeable, or mattified my skin even a bit, I would have been all about it.  But it didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After lightly moisturizing, I squeezed a little bit onto my fingertips (no word on the label whether lotion hampers the product&#x27;s results). It has a clear, gel-like composition, which slides over the skin and feels like silk at first.  There isn&#x27;t any oily or wet feel to it initially- it feels a little like baby powder on the skin: slightly moisturized, softer, but also dry. Unfortunately,  after about 5 minutes, it felt very greasy.  I tried using it with no moisturizer, and it still went greasy after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will admit, initially, I thought it made a tiny, slight difference- but after using it a couple times, I realized that was just psychosomatic/wishful thinking.  I didn&#x27;t see any change.  My pores still looked large, and I still needed a lot of powder to make it all matte.  And sadly, my foundation gravitated into my pores even faster than it did with just the primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just for the heck of it, I made my husband try some, to see it from another vantage point- he has very large pores on his nose- but there wasn&#x27;t an iota of minimizing, or blurring.  His looked exactly the same, and when he touched his face a few minutes later he said it felt like he&#x27;d smeared baby oil gel on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has no tint to it- this was another bummer, b/c even though the primer I use is barely tinted, it functions as a skin tone evener on top of priming my skin for foundation.  Even if this had worked, it&#x27;s clear- so you&#x27;d still need to use a tinted primer over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think someone with good skin- not oily or dry- whose pores aren&#x27;t large to begin with- might see some effect,  but if that was the case, you wouldn&#x27;t need to buy a pore erasing product, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip it.  Get a good primer, it&#x27;ll do you better.ke baby powder on the skin: slightly moisturized, softer, but also dry. Unfortunately,  after about 5 minutes, it felt very greasy.

            <li> AWESOME!!! Really does make pores disappear!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay but not for me!</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel amazing enough to make it worth it.</li>
            <li> Personally, I wasn&#x27;t a fan. I have very oily skin with large pores. My pores didn&#x27;t look smaller, and my makeup didn&#x27;t last any longer or look any smoother. I was really hoping for a less expensive alternative to fix my oily skin problem, but When it comes to primers, I think the department store brands are worth the splurge after all.</li>
            <li> It caused my foundation to look oily..I did not see much pore erasing/minimizing...it is silky soft it does soften the skin.</li>
            <li> A little oiler than i like, but still works well</li>
            <li> Really diminishes the appearance of large pores and wrinkles on my nose and under my eyes</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing for me. Definitely didn&#x27;t erase or even diminish the look of my pores.</li>
            <li> Pores still visable after onoy an hour. I have a golden tan complexion so defintilty not for me.</li>
            <li> As I searched reviews for this on Amazon I was encouraged that this product was wonderful and like magic. Most of my make up is high end and of really good quality and I NEVER use a drugstore primer. But I went out on a limb and bought this, and it&#x27;s pretty bad. It made my skin look flakey after I had put on my foundation, and it made my foundation look like I had on ten thousand layers. I went to Ulta and showed them and she immediately said &amp;#34;It&#x27;s your pores, do you use a filler?&amp;#34; So I told her I was using baby skin, and she didn&#x27;t have much good to say about it either. She recommended NYX Pore Filler which I have since been using, and THAT is magical. It&#x27;s affordable and comparable to my usual $20 primer. I am so disappointed with Baby Skin, especially after I heard such good things. In my experience, high end or drug store, products either work for you or they don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Love wearing this even when I don&#x27;t wear foundation over it (which is 99.9% of the time) - it makes my skin feel silky smooth and flawless. Great price too.  I was using the M.A.C. primer, but this is just as good, if not better, at a fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high expectations but thought I&#x27;d give it at try.  I held a mirror as I applied this and I could see the results immediately as I applied it.  Love it.  I used Maybelline Dream Fresh BB cream over the top of this.  It gave my old face a beautiful finish that looked totally natural.</li>
            <li> I like this product, super soft &amp; smooth on my skin, &amp; does seem to slightly blur my pores..but I don&#x27;t really notice a difference..so it&#x27;s really only just ok.. not sure I&#x27;d buy it again..</li>
            <li> This is an OKAY product. Honestly, it just blurs a little bit. It feels like vaseline.</li>
            <li> Wanted to love this. I have very oily skin and thought this would help but no way, this is pretty greasy. I used to use one from Mary Kay that actually didn&#x27;t make skin greasy unfortunately this worked differently, if you have dry skin this would probably be good. Also make cakes when this is applied at least to my skin.</li>
            <li> Fantastic and its price</li>
            <li> Makes skin very soft.</li>
            <li> EDIT: After using this for about a month or so my face has started getting these large red almost welt-like patches where I applied Baby Skin.  It didn&#x27;t so much make me break out, but irritate my skin very badly.  I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> Pretty good at minimizing pores, but I can still see them, they are not erased.  Maybe I just have very large pores.</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry most of the time so I can&#x27;t relate to the reviewers who said this made their face more oily. I love it, so if you have dry skin this is a good one and it just feels nice on the skin.</li>
            <li> absolutely work, it did what it promisesd! I apply it only in my nose area, which is very dry. It cover the pore and prevent my makeup flaky as well!!! Hope australia will have this product soon, otherwise I have to buy it from US amazon.</li>
            <li> Works well, but clogs pores.</li>
            <li> Everyone said its like the porefessional but they lied! I tried this stuff and you have to dab it into your skin, if you swipe the slightest bit then it comes off, so if you put foundation over it(which is the whole point) the stuff comes off. I have yet to try the porefessional, but if it&#x27;s anything like this (which I hope not seeing as how the porefessional is $30) then I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t waste too much money,</li>
            <li> I have used smashbox primer for a while but, way more expensive than this.. I really liked how it feels on my skin I am not sure if it realy helps with the pores but it works great alone after my face lotion it helps with the T zone.</li>
            <li> Not as good as Clinique&#x27;s Pore eraser, but a good runner up.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.  It has a smooth silky texture.  Lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Very good for the price</li>
            <li> Makes your face greasy and does nothing to your pores.  I don&#x27;t know why ppl are raving about it. The only reason I gave it one star is became I could use this for clients that have  extreme dryness as a moisturizer but that&#x27;s about it</li>
            <li> Ok... It is cheap, but it never dry ... And pores continue visibly</li>
            <li> La-la-LOVE this product!!!!!! The pores on my chin and around my nose have been huge lately for some reason and other primers just aren&#x27;t covering them up properly. This product just makes them go away and they stay hidden ALL DAY! So, here&#x27;s what I do with this product: First, I put on moisturizer (Clinique Gel), then I apply a layer of normal primer all over (BareMinerals original), then I apply this on my problem spots, then I use a tinted moisturizer (BareMinerals Complexion Rescue) and top it off with a very, very light dusting of mineral powder (BareMinerals original). This works perfectly for me. If I find that, for some reason, the humidity outside is causing my pores to show through all of that, then I can use a bit of this ON TOP of everything and it hides the pores immediately. This product is very versatile. Thus far, it hasn&#x27;t caused irritation or zits, thankfully! It goes on so smoothly and a teeny little bit goes a LONG way because I&#x27;m only applying it to problem enlarged pore areas! This small tube will last a while. It feels like there&#x27;s nothing on my skin and it never gets shiny where I apply it. I seriously am in love with this product. It&#x27;s a holy grail product for me!!! I will continue to buy this until they discontinue it!</li>
            <li> I wasnt sure at first about this product, it felt nice but wasnt instant results like posted on the packaging. However, after applying the rest of my makeup, I could visibly see a different in my pores- positively.</li>
            <li> it smells bad i tried it few times and the pores are still visible</li>
            <li> I work in a pizza place so it&#x27;s very hot and before using this my face would look like a grease pile by the end of the night. This stuff helped so much. Great product.</li>
            <li> Works like Smashbox&#x27;s Photo Finish primer. Honestly it&#x27;s best used to cover up any dry or uneven skin, and can work fairly well as an eyeshadow primer. It does have an oily/slick texture, but I have oily skin and don&#x27;t have trouble with it. It holds onto foundation better than my skin alone. I use this over moisturizer before concealer and foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Monistat&#x27;s anti-chafing gel is the same, essentially, and cheaper, but I prefer having this in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff at my local bss on a whim, hoping it would help my poor strawberry nose look a little smoother. While my foundation application went a bit smoother than usual, when I checked the mirror on my way out the door, my face was starting to oil up pretty badly. Chalking it up to a new product, I blotted quickly and left anyway. BAD PLAN. I got to work and looked like I had participated in one of those baby oil wrestling matches.</li>
            <li> First impressions: The gel&#x27;s texture was not something I expected it to be. It&#x27;s not like lotion, or face creams, or serums. It comes out as a glob and not a runny liquid, but when you smear it, it feels both velvety and slippery at the same time. The texture doesn&#x27;t really go away, it&#x27;s as if the gel just sits on your face without soaking in. Also, there&#x27;s an odd odor to it, I smell it when I apply it on my face but don&#x27;t notice it afterwards. Minus a star for the smell. I really don&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it work?&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product with and without applying something on top. With just the pore eraser, I don&#x27;t see a difference in the size of my pores. I don&#x27;t use traditional liquid foundation, so on top of the pore eraser I put on a layer of BB cream (the Korean kind, not the American/tinted moisturizer type if that makes a difference). After the BB cream, my pores do look smaller, but then again it wold look smaller without the use of the pore eraser.&lt;br /&gt;BUT. After a few hours when I checked the mirror again, my pores were *gasp* erased! The delayed minimization of my pores definitely has not happened before with just my BB cream, so I gotta give the credit to the pore eraser. Honestly, though, I don&#x27;t see myself buying this product again just because I don&#x27;t think it makes that big of a difference. The delayed eraser magic was just a pleasant surprise because I didn&#x27;t expect any changes a few hours later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I personally wouldn&#x27;t use it as a primer even though people say it can be used as one. I find it a tad to thick to be a primer.</li>
            <li> It really helps makeup last longer!</li>
            <li> Works great, especially in combination with a foundation. Works awesome on its own, too, though. It really does minimize pores and makes your skin look smoother. Lasts all day too.</li>
            <li> Not impressed,  too greasy for me</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really make my pores look any smaller and it&#x27;s too greasy, Didn&#x27;t really like it. Sometimes I do wear underneath my primer but mostly I don&#x27;t even use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clear primer, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t hide the large pores on my nose. Not a bad primer though. Not as moisturizing as I like.</li>
            <li> Okay so instant baby skin? No, but this is an awesome product!! I absolutely love it, its not going to shrink your pores, that&#x27;s not what its made for. It actually blurs them making them less noticeable. I use it as a primer for my foundation, and there is a HUGE difference in how noticeable my pores are. A little background I am in my early 30&#x27;s and personally I have some pretty large pores, I would say that this product makes my pores appear 75% smaller. When I use it with my full makeup it leaves my skin with a flawless finish, where as before you could really see my pores. I have used it by itself too, it gives your skin a matte finish, if you have oily skin like me, it really helps absorb the oil, I have a huge decrease in shiny face! I love this product and will be using it for life!</li>
            <li> This product is good, but not the best.&lt;br /&gt;I find that it definitely fills in my pores. However,it is not necessarily long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;Meaning that my makeup doesn&#x27;t last a lot longer with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this for everyday, when I put minimal makeup on. Its great for light makeup looks.</li>
            <li> This was not what I expected. It is very oily and does not cover any pores! Had to switch back to my expensive smash box. I will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li> No surprises as I have used before.</li>
            <li> Love the texture of the primer it feels like silk i bought expensive ones that i dont use because i prefer to use baby skin</li>
            <li> Very smooth, a lol goes a long way. I like to use this under a tinted moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I like the way the primer feels, but honestly my foundation (I use BB cream) looks the same with it or without it. I have big pores around my nose and this doesn&#x27;t help too much.</li>
            <li> Beautiful silky feeling , just a slight bit greasy, but that goes away when  you apply make-up !!!</li>
            <li> I have had and used this product for several months now. It is a decent primer for the price of it and being from the drugstore. I have found that it does not erase my pores, especially my large ones, but it will blur the smaller ones. I have a few problems with this product. 1. I have to wait 5-10 minutes from applying the primer to applying my foundation if I want my foundation to go on smooth. Otherwise the primer is still to wet/sticky for my makeup to go on. While I normally have a brief waiting period, my other primers only require 1-2 minutes. Once the primer is dry, it makes my face feel extra soft and smooth. 2. This does not have very long lasting stay. I have combination to oily skin, with relatively normal skin during the winter months. This primer only lasts for a few hours before the oil starts coming through and in some cases the oil in the product comes through right away if I do not let it dry long enough before applying my foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this primer is okay. It does not do exactly as the product describes but it is decent in a pinch and decent for the price. If I ever run out of my regular primer or even if I&#x27;m only going to be gone for a few hours I tend to reach for this primer because of how soft it makes your skin.</li>
            <li> Luv this product it really works.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so oily in just a couple of hours and im not so oily to begin with!!!</li>
            <li> I have seriously sensitive skin.  As a matter of fact, my family jokingly calls me &amp;#34;Bubble Girl&amp;#34;.  I usually have to buy products for my face with no fragrance, dyes, etc.  I also have a strawberry nose.  What prompted me to buy this product was simply the name - &amp;#34;Baby Skin&amp;#34;.  It works very well!&lt;br /&gt;It totally minimizes the appearance of the pores on my nose, so that when I apply my mineral make up, I have a smooth, flawless finish.  If you need to get rid of those unsightly large pores on your nose or anywhere else on your face, get a tube of this!  It&#x27;s good stuff!</li>
            <li> I dont like this product at all. !! It doesn&#x27;t dry. It just stays wet??  I would like to return this product and get something that works !!.  It also doesn&#x27;t cover my pores at all.</li>
            <li> Creates a perfect base and feels really silky, not greasy at all. I have tried &amp;#34;Age Defy&amp;#34; pore eraser base and it was so greasy. The &amp;#34;Baby Skin&amp;#34; pore eraser is perfect for my skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it I just don&#x27;t get what difference this product makes. It&#x27;s transparent oily gel, it feels soft on the skin and it&#x27;s not shiny at all, but it doesn&#x27;t cover imperfections I honestly can&#x27;t notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT, YOUR SKIN WILL BE LIKE A BABY, HEHE I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Closest product to Smashbox primer for a fraction of the cost. Love it!</li>
            <li> it didnt do anything for my skin besides make it softer and a little greasy.. anything i put it on with cakes up as well.. not worth the money for me</li>
            <li> I love this as a primer under my regular makeup.  It does make it a little slippery, so a powder is definitely necessary.  I love the way it makes my skin feel smooth as a baby&#x27;s backside!  Haven&#x27;t noticed it clogging up pores, and washes off easily.</li>
            <li> This felt super greasy to me - -  more so than other dimethicone type primers. I don&#x27;t have oily skin either.  Didn&#x27;t like it,  should have returned it.</li>
            <li> The product is clear, with the consistency of Vaseline. (I was a little surprised by that because several of the previous reviewers said they were able to use it without applying foundation over it. I&#x27;m jealous.) I followed the directions and used a tiny amount--roughly the size of a drop that would balance on the tip of a Q-tip--a little really did go a very long way. Applied my loose-powder foundation, and went on my way. My makeup was still on at the end of the day, so I didn&#x27;t experience any problems with slippage or needing to reapply, however, at the end of day #2, I removed my makeup only to discover that I&#x27;d broken out--badly--everywhere I&#x27;d applied it. (My teen daughters informed me that I looked like a sad, spotted 7th grader who hasn&#x27;t yet discovered face wash.) &amp;#34;Baby Skin&amp;#34; is right--if they&#x27;re referring to the unfortunate infants born with baby acne. I&#x27;d forgotten how badly a face covered in acne can really feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upshot: I would only recommend this product to those lucky people who can apply pure Vaseline or baby oil directly to their faces without consequence. I&#x27;m not one of those people. (If it helps, I&#x27;m a 30-mumble-year-old mom with combination skin.)</li>
            <li> This is amazing! It really makes my pores less visible... and it smoothens my skin too. I would rather buy this than a high-end primer which works just the same.</li>
            <li> It works ... Not as good as expected but it does ... The only thing is that it makes my skin feel extremely oily .</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying out primers. This leaves my skin soft which makes it easier to apply the rest of my makeup.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product it is my everyday item to use and is part of my regime, it makes my pores look invisible and skin so smooth. I know you would love it too.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and really smoothens my face! I love this!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as amazing as people would hype it out to be, but it gets the job done (my huge pores are made to look semi-normal).</li>
            <li> I dont have big pores but it works</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any difference</li>
            <li> I heard a lot of thing about this product, I&#x27;ve never used anything similar, but I decided to try it, and I loved it! You won&#x27;t see the complete difference if you don&#x27;t aply with something else, I used the bb cream from Maybelline, my skin is flawless now!</li>
            <li> It feels magnificent on my skin, like a protecting layer. I use it kind of like a moisturizer, and have also tried it under makeup, which is nice, and helps it look nicer for longer, but also come off more easily at the end of the day. It also works great on its own. While it does make my pores appear less noticeable to the naked eye, I wouldn&#x27;t rely on it to drastically change the look of your skin. A little extra attention to your face reveals that you look the same. Also, be careful not to use too much, as a layer about as thick as I would normally apply foundation feels slippery, almost oily. A very thin layer is perfecto. I use a bead about the size of a small grain of rice each time.</li>
            <li> When applying this pore eraser you could definitely tell that it was working once applied. It has a Matte look which worked great on my oily skin. Have been using this product for over a three weeks and it has not caused me to breakout.&lt;br /&gt;I use this product without any foundation or powder and it last all day.</li>
            <li> This feels great on my skin. I&#x27;ve never used a primer before but I was noticing that my Bare Minerals powder was caking within a few hours of applying. This stuff doesn&#x27;t exactly work miracles on my pores but it does fill them in a little so that my skin looks smoother and my makeup stays put.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no color to this product, my face was incredibly soft after using this my foundation just glided on so smoothly.</li>
            <li> For my skin, this is the worst primer I&#x27;ve tried so far.  It went on feeling greasy right away and did not seem to cover my pores at all. By the end of the day my makeup was a blotchy mess and most of had melted off. Worse than with no primer at all. Only reason I give this 2 stars is because it might be better on someone with very dry skin. Mine is combination oily.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes. It does temporarily give your face a &amp;#34;blurred&amp;#34; look, but it quickly just turns greasy which makes pores look larger. I&#x27;m completely unsatisfied.</li>
            <li> it makes your face soft, it&#x27;s kind of like rubbing Paul Mitchell serum on your face. It feels silky but that&#x27;s it. I have larger pores and didn&#x27;t help. It also smells like petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li> does nothing for my pores, doesnt create an even canvas. sucks.</li>
            <li> Great base for makeup.</li>
            <li> If you have reasonable expectations, I think you will be happy with this product.  It works very well on small pores, and really does make them appear to vanish.  It does not take much product for coverage and it feels very nice on the skin.  It will not cover large deep pores or blackheads.  Baby Skin is a nice alternative for those of us that cannot afford the more expensive department store products.  (My skin is very, very pale, and “normal” – so my review is for similar skin types.)</li>
            <li> This is good stuff! It won&#x27;t cover larger or brighter blemishes like zits, but more so &amp;#34;blurs&amp;#34; your skin&#x27;s imperfections into a more visually appealing palette. It&#x27;s lightweight and feels like nothing on your skin. It&#x27;s clear too. Sometimes I wear this alone, sometimes under other makeup. My only wish is that it had SPF in it like the Avon version I normally buy.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help me much :(</li>
            <li> Okay, I watched alot of youtube regarding this product. I had high expectations, but this product is a basic primer. There was nothing different about this product from the other basic primers I&#x27;ve used before. Part of me wants to remove a star from the disappointment BUT on the other hand, FOR ME, this is a basic product.  If your experience is different, then, you antty up the stars! ;)</li>
            <li> I honestly really like it!!! I have huge pores everywhere and this product makes your face kinda blurry looking on naked skin I put some on half of my face and I could see a difference one side looked dull and kinda fuzzy but felt so soft and smooth I can&#x27;t wait to put it under my make up I really like this product I found it at Walmart after I found it on here so when I run out I will buy more :)</li>
            <li> love it great product</li>
            <li> If there was an option for zero stars, I&#x27;d give it that. Sure, this stuff is pretty cheap but in this case you really do get what you pay for, this did absolutely nothing for me and it feels greasy and nasty. It really was just a waste of money, very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I love putting this on my face. It feels awesome. It does cover a little of my pores not all. But i still love it</li>
            <li> Great primer for those days things MUST stay in place and you won&#x27;t have time to touch up. I don&#x27;t use it every day because it feels heavy, but again those days I am in meeting after meeting, it is a must.</li>
            <li> Love this as a primer for applying makeup. It acts as a barrier between the makeup and my skin which is just awesome. Spreads easily too so a little goes a long way. Definitely a staple product of mine nw. Was also worried that this would break me out but it hasn&#x27;t!! Don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase.</li>
            <li> it truely smooths out your face, sets it nice  to add foundation.</li>
            <li> Really like this primer. Did some research, consistently this got high reviews and this was a top pick on &amp;#34;total beauty&#x27;s&amp;#34; website. Good price! Feels so smooth like you have nothing on at all. I have to double check when I&#x27;m smoothing it over my face, cause I can&#x27;t even tell. Let it set in on your face for a while to let it dry some before adding foundation. Overall, blends really well with makeup and helps to smooth it out. Totally patchy makeup free after using this product!</li>
            <li> Its  Greasy even if you let it rest for 10 mins on your face before you apply rest of your make up.But it does a nice finish in coverage</li>
            <li> A good primer and pore reducer.  It is lightweight and smooth, easy to put make up over.</li>
            <li> A little goes a LONG way with this product. A little greasier than I hope for out of a product like this but it feels nice and smooth on the skin.</li>
            <li> Your skin feel so soft and amazing with this primer.  You will not want to put foundation on over it!</li>
            <li> i really like it , it works perfect on me ,make my skin look amazing. I  recommend it to everyone</li>
            <li> I really like the way it makes my face feel after using it.  Very soft.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been able to find it at any local stores.</li>
            <li> So greasy feeling! But it does smooth out my skin for makeup. But then when I use a brush for powder it builds up on the brush and with a sponge, it cakes up on my face. I wish I could like it more.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday, lasts forever cause you only need a little tiny bit! Its so smooth and covers all my pores. Fast shipping and very cheap. worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> I had no problems with shipping or the quality of the package, I just found that the product doesn&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s advertised to. I followed the instructions properly and found no significant difference in my pore size after using it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magical!!!! A couple seconds after putting it on I saw a difference!!! I am in love with this product</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this but I love Baby Lips so I thought I would try. This really hides your pores and makes your skin so soft. Great purchase!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve been looking for a good pore minimizer that will work well under my make up and this is it. The cost is very reasonable! One more plus, a little tiny bit goes a very long way!</li>
            <li> Unbelievable..Best Ever. I literally watched my Pores Vanish Right Before My Eyes...Loved it and Will order Again</li>
            <li> I use to really like this product, but the second time I really didn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s smooth, and I don&#x27;t really see it make a difference on my make up. Once I use this up I most likely won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> I thought it would blur out my pores but it didn&#x27;t at all!  I don&#x27;t have huge pores and it still didn&#x27;t do the job. Waste of money. You guys can use it as a primer.</li>
            <li> It does what it promised!&lt;br /&gt;So soft , look at the difference!&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend!</li>
            <li> When I first tried this product, I was hesitant looking at the results because my pores were clearly visible. But, when I put my foundation over it...ta da! My pores vanished--or at least they were blurred out a lot more! I can see where some reviewers had a hard time laying powder over it (because it&#x27;s silicone so it can stick in weird ways), but I blended with my stick foundation and didn&#x27;t have a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to say that I have oily skin that seems to break out at the drop of a hat, but if you use just the right amount of this pore eraser, you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem with breakouts or your makeup slipping and sliding. It&#x27;s also good for hiding flaky acne skin: rub some on the flakes, dab some concealer on with a brush, put your foundation on then blend it all together with a brush. Voil&amp;agrave;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this product is just like any other kind of makeup...it can only do so much. It minimized the look of my pores, but I could see where someone with really large, deep pores might have a hard time using this stuff. Not many products can do much about that, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love this product and I&#x27;m so happy that I can find a good, cheap pore eraser right at my local Target!</li>
            <li> It does diminish your pores, but I thought it felt a little heavy on your skin and it does require a learning curve for figuring out how to apply it so that it doesn&#x27;t work, but isn&#x27;t too thick.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing. Love this product.</li>
            <li> Love it, it does exactly what it says its supposed to do.  My 12 yr old daughter swiped it from me though..... which is irritating cause at 12 she don&#x27;t even have open pores yet!!!  She STILL has &amp;#34;baby skin!&amp;#34; lol</li>
            <li> It feels like Vaseline in a tube. Extremely  greasy!!</li>
            <li> All the hype and I still see shine</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing. I am on my second tube. When I put this on my face, I almost do not even need foundation anymore. It works THAT well. My brother even tried it on his face, and he was amazed at what a huge difference it made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a beauty mirror that magnifies everything, and even up close and personal, the pores look significantly smaller.&lt;br /&gt;Since this is a makeup primer, it also helps to make my foundation look better than it does on just my bare skin alone.&lt;br /&gt;This is kind of a silly plus-side, but it also helps me remove the mistake mascara that hits my upper eye lid, because there is something about the gel that helps remove the black makeup before it dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy this for years to come. Holy Grail beauty product.</li>
            <li> This is no miracle youth serum. It makes a little difference in my pores, but they obviously don&#x27;t disappear (I&#x27;m 45, pores are here to stay.) But the reason I love it and can&#x27;t go without it is because it makes my makeup glide on so smooth and wear so well. Without this as my primer, my foundation is hard to blend onto my skin and is a little splotchy. Using this Baby Skin as my primer, my makeup goes on like a dream. Not only that, but there&#x27;s no shine on my face afterwards so I don&#x27;t need to use powder on my face, as I normally would after applying foundation. All in all, my skin looks so much better with this on under my foundation.</li>
            <li> Just used it once - I think I like it - gives the skin a nice smooth feel</li>
            <li> This products honestly does not work. I&#x27;ve tried it three different times, by itself, with pressed and loose powder, and with foundation. Its so slippery! This product does not allow my foundation and or powder to stick, it just wipes right off. It doesn&#x27;t even &amp;#34;blur&amp;#34; my pores. I was intrigued to by this because of the cutesy packaging but if you&#x27;re like me, on a budget and have visible pores, try the NYX Pore Filler. It actually works.</li>
            <li> I totally recommend this one when it comes to minimizing pores. This closed up my pores after continued use. Very happy!</li>
            <li> This made no difference for me, my skin looked the same after applying my makeup as if I had not put this on at all. No wonder it is priced so low, I guess I got what I paid for. This product does not work even a little bit though.</li>
            <li> this just made my face greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Feels great and blurs perfectly, I love it</li>
            <li> i love it, it makes my skin feel soft, but my pores do not look very &amp;#34;blurred.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I put this on half of my face and asked my husband to see if he could tell a difference but he couldn&#x27;t. My skin felt smoother and I am sure that if I wore makeup it would look better with this. I don&#x27;t wear cover up.</li>
            <li> This product clogged my pores really badly.  I had to quit using it.</li>
            <li> I liked this product but I have semi-oily skin, and I kind of felt oilier after a few hours of having this on.  It definitely did blur my pores, and made the crease on my forehead less noticeable...for that I would say YAY....but I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of how it felt a couple of hours after applying....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not bad...it&#x27;s just not 5 star worthy in my opinion</li>
            <li> I love this product so much it makes my skin so smooth I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t hear about this earlier</li>
            <li> Such s great product. I&#x27;ve always had issues with my skin and finding products to make it look clear. With this product, I was able to wear it along with my regular routine products. My skin looks flawless with it and I love it. It works great under my makeup. It is very easy to clean off too!!</li>
            <li> It has a silicone feeling and it really does fill in your pores. I have super oily skin and a moisturizer in my t-zone can sometimes cause too much oil in a few hours so instead, i put this primer on my t-zone and moisturizer on the other parts of my face. I&#x27;ve noticed that my face isnt as oily as it used to be in 3-5 hours which is a plus.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my skin feel like a baby. Just like it says. I want more now! It&#x27;s so soft!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it erases my pores but it sure makes them not so visible. Add a little makeup and they are no longer noticeable.</li>
            <li> Clogs your pores and makes skin feel weird.</li>
            <li> Really liked it. Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is great for the raised red and dark areas on the face, it helps foundation and powder smooth over them!</li>
            <li> It covers my pores in a nice way</li>
            <li> Made my skin feel super smooth!</li>
            <li> These seems more like a primer than just a pore eraser.  Either way, I like it.  It works for me.  You can use it with or without makeup.  It makes your skin look nice and smooth.  And the price was right.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work pores are still big just make my face oily &amp; wet looking</li>
            <li> this compares to my 45$+ arbone primer. feels the same looks the same. it may be making my make up cake a little? not sure yet.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product - it works awesome for me! Would definitely recommend trying it out.</li>
            <li> love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
            <li> Makes your skin soft, but doesn&#x27;t really hide any pores or wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This does make my skin really soft but it doesn&#x27;t really help with the pores. I only use BB creams and I can see my pores through this thing. It might work with foundation though. I&#x27;m not too fond of this stuff.</li>
            <li> Pretty good primer...</li>
            <li> Was as expected for the price. Actually didn&#x27;t work that bad. I apply it before seven am and reapply around two pm. Not bad at all.</li>
            <li> This stuff is very much reminds me of Smashbox without the price tag-Love it!</li>
            <li> Really does make your face feel baby smooth.</li>
            <li> Its ok. I don&#x27;t notice a huge difference other than my face feeling a little softer.</li>
            <li> It helps with pores but is a little thick and greasy.</li>
            <li> It gave my skin an great texture.  I use it alone and with powder foundation.</li>
            <li> it feels so good in the skin</li>
            <li> Love this product it makes your skin look flawless !</li>
            <li> This serum is great! When I first tried it out, I noticed how soft/smooth it felt on my face. Then I saw my pores disappear! Great stuff 😎</li>
            <li> I like this little thing! It&#x27;s really easy to apply, takes 2 sec so if you&#x27;re in a hurry in the morning like I am and still want to have a nice looking put together makeup for work or school, its a really great product to have! I have pores around my nose and some on my forehead right above the nose, so thats basically where I apply the product. I heard a lot of people saying they apply this all over their face. I haven&#x27;t tried it yet but I guess it would do the exact same thing as what I do! Over all, very light and effective product for a good price, don&#x27;t expect a miracle, it won&#x27;t make disappear your pores entirely! You still have to put some foundation on it to have the more smooth look!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best product I purchased in the last few months!</li>
            <li> Works very well!  I used it when I had pictures taken so that I could get a more polished look with my makeup and it did the trick!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this product! If I forget to put it on my foundation doesn&#x27;t look nearly as good. It helps smooth out my pores and helps my foundation go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this stuff 10 stars! It&#x27;s wonderful! I use it on my entire face because it helps makeup go on--and stay on!--so well. I even stopped using my eyeshadow primer, because this does the trick even better. I cannot recommend this enough.</li>
            <li> Great price. Excellent product. I was nervous the first time i used this because once applying you are left with the impression that this is greasy but i assure you it is not. I highly recommend</li>
            <li> (Please understand before reading I purchased from Target, not Amazon)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A while back I purchased this primer after running out of the one I had ; the price was much more reasonable then the one I was paying from Benefit, and I had heard it was one of the really good one&#x27;s out there. So I decided to test it out and see if it was worth the raves it had been getting - sadly, it was not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is very similar to Vaseline, but yet has a powdery feel in my opinion. It felt very strange and heavy. Upon application, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference, except heaviness on my face. I decided it was one of those products where you needed to get fully made up to notice any difference, and went on to finish my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a little over an hour my face became VERY oily - even with my powder on, it was like an oil slick on my t-zone and around my nose. Now, my skin has always been oily, but never that bad. I used some blotting papers, but within another hour it was oily and icky once again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning, I woke up to a dotting of little pimples all around my nose! I had washed my face with my usual routine before going to bed - I have never broken out like that before, and my skin was nearly clear until the day after I used the primer, so I&#x27;m assuming it was that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I don&#x27;t recommend this product. It may just be not for oily skin, or maybe I&#x27;m the only one who had a problem like this. But with the experience I had, it was too bothersome blotting my face every hour and then waking up with a painful breakout.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would be more of a dry feeling. It almost feels lightly (super light) waxy. I was going for a matte finish/feel.</li>
            <li> Love the baby skin pore eraser!</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel, but it&#x27;s not good if you want to wear foundation over it. It tends to make my makeup look splotchy or uneven/bad in general. This is a great product if you like going without foundation:)</li>
            <li> This stuff is just OK.  I was disappointed when after I ordered this product, I walked into the Dollar General and saw it hanging on their rack.</li>
            <li> This did nothing for me. It didn&#x27;t work as a primer but further added shine during the day. Definitely not for a matte finish.</li>
            <li> I could NOT believe the silky smooth consistency of this outstanding product. After applying, I had to squint at my own reflection to convince myself that I still HAD pores. I&#x27;m generally hard to impress as far as skin products go, but this absolutely blew me away. Will be stockpiling this treasure for years to come.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my pores and is really no different than using the Monistat Chafing Gel as a primer.</li>
            <li> For what it cost, it is as expected but nothing like the others I have tried from department store brands.</li>
            <li> I got this primer because of a review on YouTube. A girl was comparing several primers and this was one of them. This product is clear so doesn&#x27;t affect any foundation color you may put over it. It goes on smoothly and leaves skin soft. Noticeably reduces size of pores as well.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used it enough to really determine if I like it...but it does reduce pore appearance.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t require much because it spreads really far. But I do not notice a difference in my pore size. I have been using it just to keep my skin hydrated when I&#x27;m not wearing makeup.</li>
            <li> Got it yesterday. And it doesn&#x27;t make your pores disappear. IT FEELS SO OILY AND NASTY! I don&#x27;t know how people say it makes your skin feel smooth. It doesn&#x27;t at all.</li>
            <li> Ok maybe for some people it doesn&#x27;t work. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for me I love this stuff!!!! One application and my skin was so soft. I would still see poors but they were much smaller than they ever have been. I left it on over night to see if it would break me out (I already had two pimples forming) it didn&#x27;t break me out and it took the 2 away that had started!!!! I was shocked! And my skin was so soft still in the morning. I&#x27;m just in love with this stuff 😊😊😊&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your skeptical just try it and see if it works for you. I have oily skin and it didn&#x27;t make it worse. I thing the people that say it clogged their pores and mad them oily are probably putting it on like cake frosting. I put a dime size drop rubbed my fingertips together and applied it like a lotion. I love it bottom like and I will be investing a lot of money in this tiny tube of Magic!!!</li>
            <li> Great primer.  Glides on easily and perfect base to help any foundation glide on perfectly. Better price than most.</li>
            <li> As good as a sephora kind from sephora but its more concentrated.I have dryish skin but if I had oily skin.no way.I use very little because it can cause makeup to slide off.lol.I do like it....</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Goes on like a gel (clear gel), and erase the pores.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE--I have this on auto, that&#x27;s how much I love this item</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me. I do not have oily skin, this product made it greasy. Couldn&#x27;t wear under my make up: it slid right off.</li>
            <li> Is good is just a weird product, is super soft in my skin. I really like it&lt;br /&gt;I still dont know if is making anything in my skin because i need to used more.</li>
            <li> I was thinking I could use this as a primer as well as a pore reducer but that is not the case. This product is very oily and does not set foundation very well at all. I seen no change in my pores and my face stayed oily all day.</li>
            <li> So far after a few days I am really pleased.  Do recommend and the also received very quickly as well!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It goes on so smooth and literally makes my pores disappear! Haven&#x27;t used anything like it but will definitely use it as a staple in my daily makeup application.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery gets the job done</li>
            <li> Wow. I was amazed when I first used this product. It glided onto my skin beautifully. Great experience, definitely will repurchase.</li>
