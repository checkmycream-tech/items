    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li>Great product, purchased for my husband and he loves them.  </li>
            <li>&amp; they&#x27;ve done me good.</li>
            <li>so if you are not in a hurry, this is a good buy.</li>
            <li>Great product for such a great price.</li>
            <li>Very cheap, blades do not touch evenly.</li>
            <li>I use them for my eyebrows, they work ok</li>
            <li>this is a good quality scissor and is useful for some tasks that need precision.</li>
            <li>OK for the price</li>
            <li>but it feels cheaply made and didn&#x27;t cut too well.</li>
            <li>cheap and do what they should</li>
            <li>i got one to help clean my roomba.</li>
            <li>Used them right away and they worked perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>Maybe my Asian nose hairs are too wiry, but the scissors often get a good grip on them</li>
            <li>Good product but shipping took way too long</li>
            <li>On a more positive note, delivery was lightning fast.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping too.</li>
            <li>and I am almost positive I will cut myself.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad for general trimming.</li>
            <li>i bought this 2 times, the first time it came pretty quickly like in a week, the other took a month or so to arrive.</li>
            <li>but they are top of the line and soooooo sharp!</li>
            <li>Hard to use for nose hairs, but works okay.</li>
            <li>Came earlier than estimated, is of adequate quality, is not small but a manageable size and the one I received is sharp.</li>
            <li>It only costs a few dollars and includes free shipping (at the time of this review).</li>
            <li>These were unknowingly shipped directly from China, with all packaging in Chinese and the quality of the scissors is indicative of a product from China.</li>
            <li>This means my moustache endeavors to cover any and all bare skin above my upper lip at a Wolverine-like pace.  </li>

            <li> This means my moustache endeavors to cover any and all bare skin above my upper lip at a Wolverine-like pace.  </li>
            <li> I feel like they probably won&#x27;t last long, so far I&#x27;ve had them a few weeks</li>
            <li> Of there was a minus star, I&#x27;d rate it that.</li>
            <li> I expected these to be flimsy because of how inexpensive they were</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t trust myself to use it because it&#x27;s too sharp</li>
            <li> Average product.</li>
            <li> These blades are very short and don&#x27;t have much of a curve on them, and are very difficult to use as the hinge pin is very tight.  </li>
            <li> The small curved edge allows me to shape my moustache with precision.  </li>
            <li> I should of just went to the beauty salon and buy some there.. :/</li>
            <li> I would return them but for the money I&#x27;m too lazy.</li>
            <li> Thin and sharp.</li>
            <li> These scissors are beyond DULL.</li>
            <li> Bought this for trimming nose hair but not as thin at the tip as they appear in photos.  </li>
            <li> Ugh what a disappointment and waste of my time and money.</li>
            <li> So bad and ship so slow</li>
            <li> They are so dull!!!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> These scissors are beyond DULL. they won&#x27;t cut anything!</li>
            <li> Great product for such a great price. Does what it needs to do!</li>
            <li> Used them right away and they worked perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> I have what geneticists call the &amp;#34;Burt Reynolds gene.&amp;#34;  This means my moustache endeavors to cover any and all bare skin above my upper lip at a Wolverine-like pace.  I needed something compact and durable to handle this hirsute problem.  Enter these scissors.  The small curved edge allows me to shape my moustache with precision.  It only costs a few dollars and includes free shipping (at the time of this review).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with it. i got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> Came earlier than estimated, is of adequate quality, is not small but a manageable size and the one I received is sharp. It comes from &amp;#34;Pingfu Town Longgang District Shenzhen&amp;#34; China.</li>
            <li> Bought this for trimming nose hair but not as thin at the tip as they appear in photos.  Average product.</li>
            <li> Of there was a minus star, I&#x27;d rate it that. Scissors came with open package, when I wanted to use them today, they didn&#x27;t cut my eyebrows. They are so dull!!! Ugh what a disappointment and waste of my time and money. I should of just went to the beauty salon and buy some there.. :/</li>
            <li> Thin and sharp. Just what i need them to be.</li>
            <li> These were unknowingly shipped directly from China, with all packaging in Chinese and the quality of the scissors is indicative of a product from China.</li>
            <li> I bought it, It looks like quality but I don&#x27;t trust myself to use it because it&#x27;s too sharp and I am almost positive I will cut myself.</li>
            <li> I use this to trim nose hairs and eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Junk. Don&#x27;t waster your mone . Got what I paid for I guess. Tried to give no stars but it wouldn&#x27;t let me.</li>
            <li> Maybe my Asian nose hairs are too wiry, but the scissors often get a good grip on them and I end up using them to tweez my nose hairs out.  Not what I was wanting to use them for.</li>
            <li> I use them for my eyebrows, they work ok but there&#x27;s some resistance when you try to cut with them. I feel like they probably won&#x27;t last long, so far I&#x27;ve had them a few weeks &amp; they&#x27;ve done me good. You get what you pay for though.</li>
            <li> Great product, purchased for my husband and he loves them.  Very fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> Quality So bad and ship so slow</li>
            <li> I expected these to be flimsy because of how inexpensive they were but they are top of the line and soooooo sharp!</li>
            <li> The cut could be sharper. Hard to use for nose hairs, but works okay. It&#x27;s not bad for general trimming.</li>
            <li> Cannot cut anything with them. All they did was pull hair. Tried several times to trim my moustache with them-then into the garbage they went</li>
            <li> this is a good quality scissor and is useful for some tasks that need precision. i got one to help clean my roomba. i have to say that the price point cannot be matched as i saw the same scissor in duane reade with double/triple price. i bought this 2 times, the first time it came pretty quickly like in a week, the other took a month or so to arrive. so if you are not in a hurry, this is a good buy.</li>
            <li> OK for the price but it feels cheaply made and didn&#x27;t cut too well. On a more positive note, delivery was lightning fast.</li>
            <li> cheap and do what they should</li>
            <li> Good product but shipping took way too long</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Very cheap, blades do not touch evenly.</li>
            <li> These blades are very short and don&#x27;t have much of a curve on them, and are very difficult to use as the hinge pin is very tight.  An application of 3in1 oil did nothing to help this.  I would return them but for the money I&#x27;m too lazy.</li>
