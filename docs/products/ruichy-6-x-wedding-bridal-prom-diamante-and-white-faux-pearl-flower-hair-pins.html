            <li> Very pretty, but did not hold my very thick hair well.  </li>
            <li> Very pretty and stays well in my thin hair.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and needed something</li>
            <li> I bring back all my hair and this barrette holds it firmly in place in the back.</li>
            <li> delivery was on time,  actual item was a little bigger than expected.  </li>
            <li> Size is little big for me.</li>
            <li> Came sooner then expected.</li>
            <li> this hair clip is broken when I received ( straight in to the garbage can ).</li>
            <li> It looks well made, heavy, not fragile, so I am not concerned with it breaking when using it.</li>
            <li> I should have ordered a pair of red and another pair of green clips.</li>
            <li> Was what I expected.</li>
            <li> Delivery from China takes a little long</li>
            <li> Came from China so not worth returning.</li>
            <li> The rhinestones are set tightly in the barrette and none have fallen out.</li>
            <li> It just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> bought 4 of these all together (got the green too)</li>
            <li> Poor quality NOT highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This hair clip is small.</li>
            <li> It is too small for my pony tail because I have tick hair.</li>
            <li> Hairclip very small, cannot do a ponytail.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> but once they arrive you will not be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Looks a bit cheesy!!!</li>

            <li> This barrette is pretty, light-weight and holds my hair well.  The rhinestones are set tightly in the barrette and none have fallen out.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.  Came quickly and in perfect condition. The service was great. I would recommend it to anyone and is perfect for those special occassions when you need a little bling.</li>
            <li> I have to be honest, the barrete is prettier than it&#x27;s picture and I purchased this to add as a decoration to a gown.  I have gotten several compliments.  They all think the gown came with the accent.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely accessory to add to my hair pieces. I don&#x27;t wear many things and am very pleased with this barrette. It has great sparkle, not cheap looking, and I specifically ordered it because it is a barrette and not a hair clip. I wanted it for Christmas and it made it. The item ships directly from China so it does take a while. The color is a deep red more than a maroon or Burgundy color. It looks well made, heavy, not fragile, so I am not concerned with it breaking when using it. It&#x27;s a nice size but may be too large for children. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> bought 4 of these all together (got the green too) they work well with fine hair.  helps keep my hair which is thick and fine out of things easy to use as well</li>
            <li> One thing you should know about this barrette: you can&#x27;t wear it on the top of your head or on the sides. There is a sizable gap between the decorative part of the barrette and the clip. When you wear it on the top of your head (like I do with barrettes when I pull my long bangs back), it looks goofy. There&#x27;s a gap big enough you can put your finger through it. Likewise, it&#x27;s too big of a barrette to wear on the side. I use it as a pony tail holder. I bring back all my hair and this barrette holds it firmly in place in the back.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for putting up the front of my hair, and the sparkles are always a plus for me</li>
            <li> Looks a bit cheesy!!! Not something I will recommend to others unless maybe for kids.</li>
            <li> I like this medium size prettu hair clip. It looks bright red than a&lt;br /&gt;Picture. But way prettier. I like it especially for hoilidays it looks really good</li>
            <li> These barrettes are so beautiful! So many compliments! It feels comfortable too. I bought 4 different color&#x27;s They hold up well.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> delivery was on time,  actual item was a little bigger than expected.  It is a very nice hair clip and my niece loves it. I have ordered several and each time I am very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> Beautiful pin.  Rhinestones were nice and clear; not cloudy. It was purchased as part of a gift and my friend loved it!</li>
            <li> Very beautiful barrette, bright colors and will look good on any color hair.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas present and my daughter loves it.  It came quickly and exactly as ordered, I would order again.</li>
            <li> I should have ordered a pair of red and another pair of green clips. It just looks AND works perfect.</li>
            <li> Hairclip very small, cannot do a ponytail.</li>
            <li> Beautiful hair Barrette bought for getting my hair done for a wedding. Elegant, brautiful, and great price. Looks awesome in my hair.</li>
            <li> I got my barrette today. The red color is a lot brighter than the picture. It is too small for my pony tail because I have tick hair. It would be more suitable for a kid, or you can use it for lifting up some hair on the side. It is pretty and a good price</li>
            <li> Very cute. Was what I expected. Took awhile to get here though.</li>
            <li> This is such a beauty, very well made, looks great with ever thing, wearing this clip you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Very pretty and stays well in my thin hair.</li>
            <li> In addition to how pretty and feminine this is, the quality in this barrette is amazing.  Very well made and securely holds my hair. I get compliments every time I wear it.  Love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very beautiful and versatile piece of jewelry that can be used for everyday wear as well as for the situations requiring a bit more of dress-up.  It perfectly holds a moderately sized ponytail and is bright and sparkly without gaudiness.</li>
