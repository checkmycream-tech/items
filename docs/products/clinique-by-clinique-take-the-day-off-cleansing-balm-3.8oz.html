            <li>One of the BEST makeup remover &amp; cleanser.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for taking off makeup, including eye makeup, but it just wasn&#x27;t the perfect consistency for me</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>This is a great cleansing balm.  </li>

            <li>The product is amazing.</li>
            <li>good stuff, helps my skin out, takes off any eye makeup easily</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
            <li>I love the convenience of this balm.</li>
            <li>It does okay to take the makeup off, but in order to get it all the way off your skin you have to use washcloth and water.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I really love this.</li>
            <li>It is rated as a top cleanser, and cost $28, plus there was some promotion</li>
            <li>I insisted at top volume, thrusting the cleanser at her.</li>
            <li>It surprisingly was very easy and not as solid as it looked.  </li>
            <li>I used this cleaner day and night for a couple of days and it quickly became one of my favorite products to use.  </li>
            <li>Very gently removes eye makeup and rinses off very easily.</li>
            <li>It seemed to be fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>So I used it to clean my mascara and eye-shadow.</li>
            <li>Rinses clean</li>
            <li>I love it and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I rubbed in the balm making sure to get everything really well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle on my skin and it makes my skin feel smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li>That way you kind double cleanse.</li>
            <li>I am glad to have discovered this balm for sensitive and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>which is great for the day but tough to clean- this stuff works!</li>
            <li>I bounced onto the porch when the delivery man arrived with my freshly purchased Clinique \\&quot;Take the Day Off\\&quot; Cleansing Balm, giddily anticipating my first day off since the fire.    </li>
            <li>And I rinsed well holding my face directly under the spout making sure to really rub and rinse thoroughly both eyes.</li>
            <li>Lately, my skin has felt so soft because of using this as well as [[ASIN:B00DTTYF6E Best Face and Eye Moisturizer 100%</li>
            <li>I first apply on dry skin, thoroughly massaging in circular motions, and than start to add warm water.</li>
            <li>really is The One you have to gave!</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling so smooth and soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>First let me say that I did not buy through Amazon, I had a gift card to Nordstrom and thats where I bought it from.</li>
            <li>I have fair, dry, sensitive skin and found this product when I was trying to find an alternative to the Eve Lom cleaning balm.  </li>
            <li>and I love that it does not leave behind any kind of residue.</li>
            <li>It gets all my make up off and leaves my skin super soft.</li>
            <li>This is far far better for my sensitive skin (I have rosacea and eczema - woohoo!)</li>
            <li>I do look like a crazy panda/ raccoon when I use it, but everything washes off nicely and my skin feel amazing after.</li>
            <li>It cleaned my skin very well but did not strip it.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really made a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I first was introduced to this I was hesitant to use it since I have acne prone skin, but I was really surprised by how well it removed my make-</li>
            <li>i highly reccomend this</li>
            <li>Totally cleans off all make up and leaves my skin so soft and clean.</li>
            <li>I did not mind that, but I love the smell of Eve Lom and somehow was missing that.  </li>
            <li>It goes from a shortening texture to fluid the moment it touches your face &amp; it really just melts your makeup off!</li>
            <li>Not heavy or greasy.......takes off even eyeliner and mascara</li>
            <li>The combination has made my skin so soft and moisturized in the morning.</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive skin around my eyes</li>
            <li>my how much make-up was left on my skin!</li>
            <li>Works fantastic and has removed even the most difficult make up!</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and it works to take off even the most stubborn eye makeup.  </li>
            <li>Got in the shower to rinse off completely while I showered then scrubbed with my regular soap and still-- raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li>All Natural &amp; 85% Organic Face &amp; Eye Cream By BeeFriendly, Deep Moisturizing All In One Face, Eye, Neck and Decollete Anti Aging Cream Reduces Wrinkles &amp; Lines]] together.</li>
            <li>first tested it by removing my make-up with my &amp;#34;old brand&amp;#34; of make-up remover, then applied this balm and used a wet, white cloth to remove the balm.</li>
            <li>Mentally drained, I asked the cleanser if instead of cooking it would simply draw me a hot bath before leaving.</li>
            <li>Effective but sort of difficult to use.</li>

            <li> Having had enough of this farce of a conversation, my happy anticipation of a day off ruined, I angrily power-walked the cleanser to the bus stop and left it there without a goodbye or a tip.    </li>
            <li> There is plenty in the jar and will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I braked hard and burst from the car, shrieking in horror as I ran toward the little shelter full of unsuspecting commuters.</li>

            <li> so no need to use other products.</li>

            <li> After waiting through several awkward moments for an answer, I asked the cleanser loudly, \\&quot;Do</li>
            <li> It looked solid and I was worried that it might be difficult to work with.  </li>
            <li> As I have dry skin, I would still use a moisturizer afterward, but my skin didn&#x27;t feel taught or uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> I find it too oily and really hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> It does take the makeup off well, but then it itself is hard to remove.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not thrilled with this stuff.</li>
            <li> and always cover the redness with make up that is non irritating but stubborn</li>
            <li> This stuff even removes my eye makeup without leaving that faint residue of a &amp;#34;black halo&amp;#34; around my eyes</li>
            <li> I was shocked</li>
            <li> Clearly distraught by my gruesome discovery, the crowd scattered as I cradled the cleanser, weeping and apologizing.    </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Best make up remover ever!!  Iʻve been using this for years and one of these will last a while.</li>
            <li> Great product. Willdefinately purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is a great cleansing balm.  It is moisturizing and takes your make up off very well without having to scrub hard to remove it.  I love it and highly recommend it! There is plenty in the jar and will last a long time.  I will always use it from now on!</li>
            <li> Just got it today because I read reviews of how great it was. Works like my cheapo cleaners. I rubbed in the balm making sure to get everything really well. Got in the shower to rinse off completely while I showered then scrubbed with my regular soap and still-- raccoon eyes. And I rinsed well holding my face directly under the spout making sure to really rub and rinse thoroughly both eyes. neither my mascara nor my eyeliner are waterproof. Guess I have to keep looking.</li>
            <li> I love the convenience of this balm. You just apply to dry face and rinse. It gets all my make up off and leaves my skin super soft. As little of this balm it takes,this bottle will last a long time..  i highly reccomend this</li>
            <li> Effective but sort of difficult to use. I feel like I have to use another face wash to get rid of this product.</li>
            <li> This is a solid cream that melts into an oil as you rub it on your face. It&#x27;s great for taking off makeup, including eye makeup, but it just wasn&#x27;t the perfect consistency for me - I prefer thicker cleansing creams.</li>
            <li> I have fair, dry, sensitive skin and found this product when I was trying to find an alternative to the Eve Lom cleaning balm.  I ordered my product from Nordstrom.  It was $28.50.  This has a very different texture than Eve Lom.  It looked solid and I was worried that it might be difficult to work with.  It surprisingly was very easy and not as solid as it looked.  It melted onto my skin.  It seemed to be fragrance free.  I did not mind that, but I love the smell of Eve Lom and somehow was missing that.  It cleaned my skin very well but did not strip it.  As I have dry skin, I would still use a moisturizer afterward, but my skin didn&#x27;t feel taught or uncomfortable.  I used this cleaner day and night for a couple of days and it quickly became one of my favorite products to use.  I will definitely buy this product again and again.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try this product initially but it&#x27;s really made a difference in my skin. I shied away from Clinique in the years past my teens and early twenties but this product is a perfect example of why I should maybe take another look. I use this as intended, to remove makeup, and then cleanse a second time. It truly takes everything off and I love that it does not leave behind any kind of residue. I&#x27;m just bummed they don&#x27;t make it in a travel size.</li>
            <li> The BEST makeup remover &amp; cleanser EVER!! I&#x27;ve tried everything &amp; this cleansing balm really is The One you have to gave! It goes from a shortening texture to fluid the moment it touches your face &amp; it really just melts your makeup off! My face has never been this clean or felt this good! I don&#x27;t use a separate cleanser after either. Just a small bit of balm (a little goes a Long waon dry skin,  rub gently, wipe off with warm wash rag &amp; then apply dramatically different loition. Boils!</li>
            <li> good stuff, helps my skin out, takes off any eye makeup easily</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not thrilled with this stuff. It does okay to take the makeup off, but in order to get it all the way off your skin you have to use washcloth and water. You might as well just wash your face with a cleanser if you&#x27;re going to do that.</li>
            <li> Seriously I can&#x27;t rave about this cleansing balm enough.  A little goes a long way and it works to take off even the most stubborn eye makeup.  LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! Totally cleans off all make up and leaves my skin so soft and clean. I&#x27;ve never used a cream based cleanser before - always had foaming etc. I&#x27;ll never go back. This is far far better for my sensitive skin (I have rosacea and eczema - woohoo!) and always cover the redness with make up that is non irritating but stubborn which is great for the day but tough to clean- this stuff works!</li>
            <li> Best makeup remover EVER!  Not heavy or greasy.......takes off even eyeliner and mascara so no need to use other products. This is the only one you&#x27;ll ever need.</li>
            <li> Love the product! I have oily skin in the T zone and its the only thing that throughly removes my make-up without drying out my skin. It leaves my skin feeling so smooth and soft and hydrated. This stuff even removes my eye makeup without leaving that faint residue of a &amp;#34;black halo&amp;#34; around my eyes and I wear waterproof products because of my oily skin type.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. I got it on a friend&#x27;s recommendation. I feel like it has changed my face and my life. My skin isn&#x27;t as dry at night because of whatever is in this. I don&#x27;t need to use a lot to get off my waterproof eye makeup (except some mascaras). I do look like a crazy panda/ raccoon when I use it, but everything washes off nicely and my skin feel amazing after. Lately, my skin has felt so soft because of using this as well as [[ASIN:B00DTTYF6E Best Face and Eye Moisturizer 100% All Natural &amp; 85% Organic Face &amp; Eye Cream By BeeFriendly, Deep Moisturizing All In One Face, Eye, Neck and Decollete Anti Aging Cream Reduces Wrinkles &amp; Lines]] together. The combination has made my skin so soft and moisturized in the morning. I love it.</li>
            <li> I find it too oily and really hard to wash off. It does take the makeup off well, but then it itself is hard to remove. I probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I really love this. It did a good job cleaning all of my make up. I have a sensitive skin around my eyes but It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. So I used it to clean my mascara and eye-shadow.</li>
            <li> First let me say that I did not buy through Amazon, I had a gift card to Nordstrom and thats where I bought it from. It is rated as a top cleanser, and cost $28, plus there was some promotion so I did not pay for shipping. The product is amazing. I have some acne. which has disappeared in 3-4 uses of this stuff. I first apply on dry skin, thoroughly massaging in circular motions, and than start to add warm water. That way you kind double cleanse. I would recommend it to anyone who wears makeup!!!</li>
            <li> Great product!  Works like a charm!  Rinses clean</li>
            <li> One of the BEST makeup remover &amp; cleanser. It&#x27;s very gentle on my skin and it makes my skin feel smooth afterwards. I am glad to have discovered this balm for sensitive and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Works fantastic and has removed even the most difficult make up! Despite being a balm once you apply it, rinse and then wash your face (it&#x27;s not a cleanser, just a make-up remover) your skin isn&#x27;t left greasy or oily.&lt;br /&gt;When I first was introduced to this I was hesitant to use it since I have acne prone skin, but I was really surprised by how well it removed my make-up.&lt;br /&gt;I first tested it by removing my make-up with my &amp;#34;old brand&amp;#34; of make-up remover, then applied this balm and used a wet, white cloth to remove the balm. I was shocked my how much make-up was left on my skin! When I used this balm twice in a row the 2nd use had no foundation residue on the cloth.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need to use a cloth to remove this product either (although you can) you can simply rinse it off and it dissolves the product on your face.&lt;br /&gt;No acne, no clogged pores and you really only need a tiny bit to cover your entire face.</li>
            <li> I bounced onto the porch when the delivery man arrived with my freshly purchased Clinique \\&quot;Take the Day Off\\&quot; Cleansing Balm, giddily anticipating my first day off since the fire.    Thanking him profusely before shutting the door, I unboxed the cleanser, placed it carefully in the kitchen and asked it to make tacos for my family and several young guests. It just sat there, silent, staring. After waiting through several awkward moments for an answer, I asked the cleanser loudly, \\&quot;Do you speak English?\\&quot; Still no response.    My daughter speaks some Spanish. Flustered from my recent exchange, I snatched the cleanser up and stormed into the living room, interrupting her study group. \\&quot;Tell it to cook tacos!\\&quot; I insisted at top volume, thrusting the cleanser at her. \\&quot;I&#x27;m taking the day off!\\&quot;    My daughter can be so uptight. After she and her study group hurried out the door, there was no more need to cook, which was great because I really hate tacos.    Mentally drained, I asked the cleanser if instead of cooking it would simply draw me a hot bath before leaving. And once again my question was met with silence. Having had enough of this farce of a conversation, my happy anticipation of a day off ruined, I angrily power-walked the cleanser to the bus stop and left it there without a goodbye or a tip.    The next morning I decided to buy a bird and some matches. As I drove past the bus stop, I noticed the cleanser was still there, only now it was on its side with no cap and liquid spilled all around. I braked hard and burst from the car, shrieking in horror as I ran toward the little shelter full of unsuspecting commuters. Clearly distraught by my gruesome discovery, the crowd scattered as I cradled the cleanser, weeping and apologizing.    Six weeks have passed since that dark day and I still haven&#x27;t spoken a word from the shock and guilt. Tonight my daughter asked if I would make tacos. I just sat there, silent, staring.    5 stars.</li>
            <li> Very gently removes eye makeup and rinses off very easily. I still cleanse my face with something for acne, but this gets the makeup removal job done well.</li>
