            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell, reminds me of Christmas for some reason.  </li>
            <li>While the smell is pleasant, it can get overpowering after while</li>

            <li>I am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>It has a great smell, softens my hair and makes it more manageable.</li>
            <li>Very pleased to have oredered this product.</li>
            <li>I have to make sure we order another one before we run out of the one that we do have!</li>
            <li>The smell is exotic and my girlfriend loves it!</li>
            <li>I will suggest to many of my bearded friends!</li>
            <li>Just the right consistency and a very pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>This product does what its name implies; it makes the beard shine...and it gives it a nice smell of pine and spice...or as my roommate calls it potpourri</li>
            <li>Smells nice and is not too glossy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This isn&#x27;t quite it, but it is nice.  </li>
            <li>It also gives a nice shine and conditioning to my beard without caking.  </li>
            <li>get it warm, and then rub it through your beard.  </li>
            <li>It holds my mustache and goatee nicely and is not greasy.  </li>
            <li>Not greasy at all and smells kind of piney.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do anything for hold but it does add a nice, conditioned gloss and helps control the man beard.</li>
            <li>It adds a nice shine without being oily.</li>
            <li>I have a full beard and mustache, and this product has been great for both</li>
            <li>It makes his beard so soft and it smells great!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The gloss makes my beard look healthy, and tamed, but still nice and bushy.</li>
            <li>Not a greasy looking shine, but a nice healthy glow.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have anything to compare this to since it&#x27;s the first beard product I&#x27;ve used, but the scent is great and it gives my beard a nice shine and makes it softer.  </li>
            <li>It smells great, makes his beard feel great, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Not knowing what would work best for me -- and with few/no options at the local drugstore -- I found this product on Amazon.com and some very good reviews for it, so I decided to give it a try (given the modest price).  </li>
            <li>I wear a circle beard and wanted something to help obtain a more groomed appearance.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s noticeably softer and more relaxed.</li>
            <li>I was hoping it would have more hold than it does, but then again I didn&#x27;t buy Mustache gloss for the hold.</li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t have the grip or &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; of some of the waxier alternatives, but it has become my favorite by far.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It worked OK for doing this</li>
            <li>I put a dime sized dab on my palm and rubbed it until the consistency was more liquid and applied that to my beard.  </li>
            <li>once it&#x27;s all combed and in place, I try to avoid touching my chin if I can, because the residue gets on my fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The wiry, unruly gray hair looks better than it did, still bushy but under control.  </li>
            <li>It has a light nice smell.  </li>
            <li>Many of the others I have tried are way too scented with herbs and whatnot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using this.  </li>
            <li>My beard is more manageable this way.  </li>
            <li>I use it most days now and didn&#x27;t know I needed this.  </li>
            <li>I love the clove-ish aroma.</li>
            <li>I have a full goatee and am very pleased with the Stingray Bay beard and mustache gloss.  </li>
            <li>Reminiscent of a candle scent (I think bayberry?), it is just wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Probably would not order more when he runs out, because it is not a staple in his routine.</li>
            <li>I had no idea I would have to love it and feed it and stroke it</li>
            <li>This particular gloss is a great product.</li>
            <li>Very pleasant aroma for the essential oils and NZ honey!</li>
            <li>Smells pretty good too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t have to look too far to find a great product.</li>
            <li>My friend really likes it though, says it works great and his beard looks fantastic.</li>
            <li>Ordered this because of the great reviews, and wow, it doesn&#x27;t disappoint!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light wax, mostly conditioning.</li>
            <li>This stuff is good but its very waxy and makes my beard feel sticky.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasant, light herbal scent, very neutral taste</li>
            <li>Easy to apply</li>
            <li>It even has more color -- which I didn&#x27;t expect, but it&#x27;s a great bonus given that overall</li>
            <li>The screw-top metal container is easy to pack and store.  </li>
            <li>scent that was clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li>it has a nice clove smell to it and makes his beard nice and soft and shiney.</li>
            <li>Not as strong of hold as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s is a very pleasant, masculine scent that compliments my cologne very well.</li>
            <li>He still thinks its a fine product, but not a must have.  </li>
            <li>Not only is the smell amazing but his mustache looks so healthy!</li>
            <li>stuff makes a HUGE difference on my beard.</li>
            <li>if you are looking for a light wax that wont leave your beard and skin feeling sticky</li>
            <li>Overall great product.</li>
            <li>As a mustache wax though, it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>Some people have reported break-outs after use, but I have experienced the opposite</li>
            <li>This is a great gloss and conditioner for facial hair.  </li>
            <li>For what it is, it is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Nice old school scent, easy application with comb, and</li>
            <li>The package came fast and right when I opened it I was able to smell a very light clove(ish)</li>
            <li>It has a nice waxy, paste consistency while many such products are greasy.  </li>
            <li>Stingray Bay, which I bought on Amazon last month, was voted the best in terms of smell and keeping the beard soft without being greasy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does wash out easily and I am not unhappy with my purchase and would consider this product again.</li>
            <li>I ordered the stingray bay gloss because it was one of the only products available on prime, and had good reviews.</li>
            <li>The canister is cool, the aroma is super light and pleasing.</li>
            <li>Great scent and not really greasy</li>
            <li>Girl last night was going nuts about how good I smelled.</li>
            <li>It has a nice natural smell, not girly though.</li>
            <li>Works very well, wish it were a bit more aromatic..</li>
            <li>Then I found this product and loved it for not only the price but for the quality.</li>
            <li>I got a nice face shag going, but work in a professional environment.</li>
            <li>This product did make his mustache have a more glossier appearance, but didn&#x27;t do too much in the way of softening the mustache.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, after placing my order, I was astonished how quickly it was delivered.</li>
            <li>(that Christmasy smelling stuff).&lt;br /&gt;However, I thought that when I bought this I would be able to use it daily to soften my beard and make it more manageable.</li>
            <li>hold is decent, but the purpose of this is for more of a gloss to the hair than hold.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to rub it nice and long in between your hands to get it hot before taming your beast.</li>
            <li>This has a nice mild, spicy aroma, while many products are either bland or overpowering.  </li>
            <li>importantly though, it makes my beard very presentable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>far, I am quite pleased.  </li>
            <li>I have had reactions to skin products before, however I am confident the natural makeup of this product is the reason I have not had any skin issues after application.  </li>
            <li>Decent hold, really easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Anything left on my fingers goes on the front of my hair and my eyebrows, giving them a nice shine.  </li>
            <li>It gives your beard just the right amount of hold and volume.  </li>
            <li>He uses it first to get a nice conditioned gloss and then waxes the tips of his moustache with a different product.  </li>
            <li>I would not recommend it for moustaches unless you use VERY little, but for beards it is great.  </li>
            <li>I used to use a clear gel that I loved, because it combed through the hair nicely when wet and held strong and didn&#x27;t budge when dry.  </li>
            <li>It smells great when you first apply it, however after about a half hour, the smell really got to me.</li>
            <li>Leaves facial hair soft and in place with a light, pleasant and masculine scent.  </li>
            <li>Great to use as a beard balm, but doesn&#x27;t really offer any firm hold.  </li>
            <li>and I still have about 2 more weeks worth left.  </li>
            <li>He does appreciate that it is all natural and does not have a strong scent.  </li>
            <li>It is not a strong holding wax, but does provide the gloss and pleasant smell as stated.  </li>
            <li>This product&#x27;s aroma is a clean, fresh, natural one.</li>
            <li>And although I am not a fan of having scented products directly under my nostrils, Stingray is pleasant and milder than the other moustache waxes &amp; oils I&#x27;ve encountered (several of which have very strong scents which I came to regret having applied).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a little greasy but does the job and has a pretty good scent.  </li>
            <li>I read the reviews on Stingray Bay and it seemed pretty legit, so I have been using it for about a month now.  </li>
            <li>I like the smell first off...</li>
            <li>It soon became apparent that I needed some kind of product to help control the natural curliness of the longer hairs.  </li>
            <li>I think when I run out of this I will buy something that is more like a daily leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li>Also stoked to support this family business and LOVE the Koru graphic and symbolism.</li>
            <li>This is my first beard.  </li>
            <li>This wax works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Makes your beard shiny, fluffy and smells good.</li>
            <li>The spicy scent is pleasing to the nose and since it&#x27;s right in my beard, it&#x27;s easy to get a whiff of several times throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent is quite nice, saving this from getting one star, however it hasn&#x27;t met my expectations on any other category.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Stingray my moustache feels soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Great piney scented gloss that provides control and a subtle shine to the beard.  </li>
            <li>It is great for controlling stray rogue hairs and provide a subtle shine.</li>
            <li>Over the years, I&#x27;ve never fussed with my beard--except for washing it in the shower, giving it a good brushing daily, and trimming it (but only when it really needs it).  </li>
            <li>It comes in an easy to open tin.  </li>
            <li>Application is simple, I scrape up a small amount with the top of my nail, warm it between two fingers on both hands and then apply.  </li>
            <li>Greasy, doesn&#x27;t hold the shape you&#x27;re trying for very well.</li>
            <li>It is also is very greasy and gets all over everything if you have a longer beard.</li>
            <li>It does not take much...</li>
            <li>I will have to buy him another one very soon.</li>
            <li>I have very course hair</li>
            <li>I have an unruly beard, no matter how much I conditioned it</li>
            <li>It was just too much.</li>
            <li>It does everything it is designed to do (its gloss, NOT shaping wax), and it is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Beard is much softer and feels a lot nicer.</li>
            <li>It smells good and helps control wild hairs with little effort!</li>
            <li>--I have not had any break-outs while using this, which is infinitely better than other products I have tried.</li>
            <li>After years of wearing a short full beard and mustache, I decided to shave the beard and let the mustache grow out.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely be ordering more when I finally run out!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m always looking for a decent replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mild and a scent to which I look forward daily.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This stuff is high quality and holds well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Your beard will have a little sheen, looks healthy.  </li>
            <li>and it normally feels like a Brillo pad</li>
            <li>As someone from Filipino descent, my beard has never been quite full, long, or thick.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>(though I also use it in conjunction with a wax on the mustache, as it is super long and needs a wax).</li>
            <li>The smell is great and persists subtly for several hours, and the product, which is firm at room temperature, is easy to use after rubbing between my fingers, and then into my beard.</li>
            <li>Being new to the experience of letting my moustache grow out, I ordered an assortment of moustache wax and wax-like products</li>
            <li>We are talking a very strong odor that is hard to get rid of even after trying to shampoo this stuff out of my beard.</li>
            <li>My jacket suddenly had a scorpion stitched on the back and my driving skills became so advanced</li>
            <li>They included  nice thank you note, thanking me for the business and supporting small business!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not super cheap</li>
            <li>The scent is manly, but takes a few hours the first time to get used to (being right under your nose).  </li>
            <li>This does give some control and guidance, but makes the hair soft, not stiff.  </li>
            <li>If you heat it, It soaks in well and leaves you with a natural looking mustache.</li>
            <li>If your beard is soft and doesn&#x27;t have those radical whiskers then this is for you.</li>
            <li>Completely natural.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really need this stuff, but I&#x27;ll definitely use it as a cologne alternative.</li>
            <li>As far as holding power it is lacking but take into consideration that this is a gloss.</li>
            <li>and it makes my beard soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>With the help of Stingray Bay:  soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>, it is all natural product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a plus that it is made from all natural ingredients -- no parabens and no petroleum.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my moustache shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>My moustache and beard are on the way to being epic, but are a bit wild.  </li>
            <li>it stays soft and aromatic all day.</li>
            <li>Gave this to my son in law who is an all natural guy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells masculine but not overpowering</li>
            <li>But my beard, which is thick, is much more under control with wax in it.  </li>
            <li>It does not give a firm hold by any means (unlike the spiking glue I like to use in my hair), but it does offer just enough of a hold to keep things from becoming unruly and to style the mustache just a bit.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t make my whiskers any shinier, despite the &amp;#34;gloss&amp;#34; name, nor did it do anything to tame the stray hairs without significant amounts, like I dipped my goatee in candle wax.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product but next time ill find the Wild Man.</li>
            <li>but if all you need is something to calm down your beard you wont regret this purchase.</li>
            <li>IT is a little lighter than needed to shape a handle bar, but the feel and scent are worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This will probably last a long time, because you don&#x27;t have to use too much.  </li>
            <li>This product has a nice smell and will hold some lame whiskers.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s hard to avoid getting it on your lips if you have a long &#x27;stache), and offers good control without being stiff.  </li>
            <li>Using it feels luxurious and the hair responds by going where I want it to go -- and mostly staying in place (except for trying to get handlebar behavior at the far edges which apparently requires stiffer wax, which I don&#x27;t want uncomfortably spread across the rest of my moustache).  </li>
            <li>Smells a lot like cloves but has a mild dry down scent, not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I have tried several different kinds of beard products,  but this one is a clear standout.</li>
            <li>I ended up using a little more than the suggested amount of a small dab between your fingers.  </li>
            <li>Then when I combed it out at the end of the day, the hair didn&#x27;t feel overly dry or flaky, it just felt soft.  </li>
            <li>Helps tame the beast and smells absolutely divine!</li>
            <li>It gives the beard a little volume, but doesn&#x27;t do as much to control the curl and frizz as I would like.  </li>
            <li>You really do have to use a little that is warmed up between rubbing hands and apply all over your beard.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get past the strong black licorice smell and it overpowers any cologne.</li>
            <li>Adds a little weight to the beard hair to help it hang down instead of stick straight out, I would recommend this to men with shorter styled beards, it probably wouldn&#x27;t hold up to a serious ZZ top.</li>

            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell, reminds me of Christmas for some reason.  </li>
            <li> While the smell is pleasant, it can get overpowering after while</li>

            <li> I am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> It has a great smell, softens my hair and makes it more manageable.</li>
            <li> Very pleased to have oredered this product.</li>
            <li> I have to make sure we order another one before we run out of the one that we do have!</li>
            <li> The smell is exotic and my girlfriend loves it!</li>
            <li> I will suggest to many of my bearded friends!</li>
            <li> Just the right consistency and a very pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> This product does what its name implies; it makes the beard shine...and it gives it a nice smell of pine and spice...or as my roommate calls it potpourri</li>
            <li> Smells nice and is not too glossy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This isn&#x27;t quite it, but it is nice.  </li>
            <li> It also gives a nice shine and conditioning to my beard without caking.  </li>
            <li> get it warm, and then rub it through your beard.  </li>
            <li> It holds my mustache and goatee nicely and is not greasy.  </li>
            <li> Not greasy at all and smells kind of piney.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything for hold but it does add a nice, conditioned gloss and helps control the man beard.</li>
            <li> It adds a nice shine without being oily.</li>
            <li> I have a full beard and mustache, and this product has been great for both</li>
            <li> It makes his beard so soft and it smells great!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The gloss makes my beard look healthy, and tamed, but still nice and bushy.</li>
            <li> Not a greasy looking shine, but a nice healthy glow.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything to compare this to since it&#x27;s the first beard product I&#x27;ve used, but the scent is great and it gives my beard a nice shine and makes it softer.  </li>
            <li> It smells great, makes his beard feel great, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Not knowing what would work best for me -- and with few/no options at the local drugstore -- I found this product on Amazon.com and some very good reviews for it, so I decided to give it a try (given the modest price).  </li>
            <li> I wear a circle beard and wanted something to help obtain a more groomed appearance.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s noticeably softer and more relaxed.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would have more hold than it does, but then again I didn&#x27;t buy Mustache gloss for the hold.</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t have the grip or &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; of some of the waxier alternatives, but it has become my favorite by far.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It worked OK for doing this</li>
            <li> I put a dime sized dab on my palm and rubbed it until the consistency was more liquid and applied that to my beard.  </li>
            <li> once it&#x27;s all combed and in place, I try to avoid touching my chin if I can, because the residue gets on my fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The wiry, unruly gray hair looks better than it did, still bushy but under control.  </li>
            <li> It has a light nice smell.  </li>
            <li> Many of the others I have tried are way too scented with herbs and whatnot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using this.  </li>
            <li> My beard is more manageable this way.  </li>
            <li> I use it most days now and didn&#x27;t know I needed this.  </li>
            <li> I love the clove-ish aroma.</li>
            <li> I have a full goatee and am very pleased with the Stingray Bay beard and mustache gloss.  </li>
            <li> Reminiscent of a candle scent (I think bayberry?), it is just wonderful.  </li>
            <li> Probably would not order more when he runs out, because it is not a staple in his routine.</li>
            <li> I had no idea I would have to love it and feed it and stroke it</li>
            <li> This particular gloss is a great product.</li>
            <li> Very pleasant aroma for the essential oils and NZ honey!</li>
            <li> Smells pretty good too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t have to look too far to find a great product.</li>
            <li> My friend really likes it though, says it works great and his beard looks fantastic.</li>
            <li> Ordered this because of the great reviews, and wow, it doesn&#x27;t disappoint!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light wax, mostly conditioning.</li>
            <li> This stuff is good but its very waxy and makes my beard feel sticky.  </li>
            <li> It has a pleasant, light herbal scent, very neutral taste</li>
            <li> Easy to apply</li>
            <li> It even has more color -- which I didn&#x27;t expect, but it&#x27;s a great bonus given that overall</li>
            <li> The screw-top metal container is easy to pack and store.  </li>
            <li> scent that was clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li> it has a nice clove smell to it and makes his beard nice and soft and shiney.</li>
            <li> Not as strong of hold as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s is a very pleasant, masculine scent that compliments my cologne very well.</li>
            <li> He still thinks its a fine product, but not a must have.  </li>
            <li> Not only is the smell amazing but his mustache looks so healthy!</li>
            <li> stuff makes a HUGE difference on my beard.</li>
            <li> if you are looking for a light wax that wont leave your beard and skin feeling sticky</li>
            <li> Overall great product.</li>
            <li> As a mustache wax though, it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> Some people have reported break-outs after use, but I have experienced the opposite</li>
            <li> This is a great gloss and conditioner for facial hair.  </li>
            <li> For what it is, it is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Nice old school scent, easy application with comb, and</li>
            <li> The package came fast and right when I opened it I was able to smell a very light clove(ish)</li>
            <li> It has a nice waxy, paste consistency while many such products are greasy.  </li>
            <li> Stingray Bay, which I bought on Amazon last month, was voted the best in terms of smell and keeping the beard soft without being greasy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does wash out easily and I am not unhappy with my purchase and would consider this product again.</li>
            <li> I ordered the stingray bay gloss because it was one of the only products available on prime, and had good reviews.</li>
            <li> The canister is cool, the aroma is super light and pleasing.</li>
            <li> Great scent and not really greasy</li>
            <li> Girl last night was going nuts about how good I smelled.</li>
            <li> It has a nice natural smell, not girly though.</li>
            <li> Works very well, wish it were a bit more aromatic..</li>
            <li> Then I found this product and loved it for not only the price but for the quality.</li>
            <li> I got a nice face shag going, but work in a professional environment.</li>
            <li> This product did make his mustache have a more glossier appearance, but didn&#x27;t do too much in the way of softening the mustache.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, after placing my order, I was astonished how quickly it was delivered.</li>
            <li> (that Christmasy smelling stuff).&lt;br /&gt;However, I thought that when I bought this I would be able to use it daily to soften my beard and make it more manageable.</li>
            <li> hold is decent, but the purpose of this is for more of a gloss to the hair than hold.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to rub it nice and long in between your hands to get it hot before taming your beast.</li>
            <li> This has a nice mild, spicy aroma, while many products are either bland or overpowering.  </li>
            <li> importantly though, it makes my beard very presentable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> far, I am quite pleased.  </li>
            <li> I have had reactions to skin products before, however I am confident the natural makeup of this product is the reason I have not had any skin issues after application.  </li>
            <li> Decent hold, really easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Anything left on my fingers goes on the front of my hair and my eyebrows, giving them a nice shine.  </li>
            <li> It gives your beard just the right amount of hold and volume.  </li>
            <li> He uses it first to get a nice conditioned gloss and then waxes the tips of his moustache with a different product.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend it for moustaches unless you use VERY little, but for beards it is great.  </li>
            <li> I used to use a clear gel that I loved, because it combed through the hair nicely when wet and held strong and didn&#x27;t budge when dry.  </li>
            <li> It smells great when you first apply it, however after about a half hour, the smell really got to me.</li>
            <li> Leaves facial hair soft and in place with a light, pleasant and masculine scent.  </li>
            <li> Great to use as a beard balm, but doesn&#x27;t really offer any firm hold.  </li>
            <li> and I still have about 2 more weeks worth left.  </li>
            <li> He does appreciate that it is all natural and does not have a strong scent.  </li>
            <li> It is not a strong holding wax, but does provide the gloss and pleasant smell as stated.  </li>
            <li> This product&#x27;s aroma is a clean, fresh, natural one.</li>
            <li> And although I am not a fan of having scented products directly under my nostrils, Stingray is pleasant and milder than the other moustache waxes &amp; oils I&#x27;ve encountered (several of which have very strong scents which I came to regret having applied).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a little greasy but does the job and has a pretty good scent.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews on Stingray Bay and it seemed pretty legit, so I have been using it for about a month now.  </li>
            <li> I like the smell first off...</li>
            <li> It soon became apparent that I needed some kind of product to help control the natural curliness of the longer hairs.  </li>
            <li> I think when I run out of this I will buy something that is more like a daily leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> Also stoked to support this family business and LOVE the Koru graphic and symbolism.</li>
            <li> This is my first beard.  </li>
            <li> This wax works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> Makes your beard shiny, fluffy and smells good.</li>
            <li> The spicy scent is pleasing to the nose and since it&#x27;s right in my beard, it&#x27;s easy to get a whiff of several times throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent is quite nice, saving this from getting one star, however it hasn&#x27;t met my expectations on any other category.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Stingray my moustache feels soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Great piney scented gloss that provides control and a subtle shine to the beard.  </li>
            <li> It is great for controlling stray rogue hairs and provide a subtle shine.</li>
            <li> Over the years, I&#x27;ve never fussed with my beard--except for washing it in the shower, giving it a good brushing daily, and trimming it (but only when it really needs it).  </li>
            <li> It comes in an easy to open tin.  </li>
            <li> Application is simple, I scrape up a small amount with the top of my nail, warm it between two fingers on both hands and then apply.  </li>
            <li> Greasy, doesn&#x27;t hold the shape you&#x27;re trying for very well.</li>
            <li> It is also is very greasy and gets all over everything if you have a longer beard.</li>
            <li> It does not take much...</li>
            <li> I will have to buy him another one very soon.</li>
            <li> I have very course hair</li>
            <li> I have an unruly beard, no matter how much I conditioned it</li>
            <li> It was just too much.</li>
            <li> It does everything it is designed to do (its gloss, NOT shaping wax), and it is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Beard is much softer and feels a lot nicer.</li>
            <li> It smells good and helps control wild hairs with little effort!</li>
            <li> --I have not had any break-outs while using this, which is infinitely better than other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> After years of wearing a short full beard and mustache, I decided to shave the beard and let the mustache grow out.  </li>
            <li> Will definitely be ordering more when I finally run out!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m always looking for a decent replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mild and a scent to which I look forward daily.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This stuff is high quality and holds well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Your beard will have a little sheen, looks healthy.  </li>
            <li> and it normally feels like a Brillo pad</li>
            <li> As someone from Filipino descent, my beard has never been quite full, long, or thick.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> (though I also use it in conjunction with a wax on the mustache, as it is super long and needs a wax).</li>
            <li> The smell is great and persists subtly for several hours, and the product, which is firm at room temperature, is easy to use after rubbing between my fingers, and then into my beard.</li>
            <li> Being new to the experience of letting my moustache grow out, I ordered an assortment of moustache wax and wax-like products</li>
            <li> We are talking a very strong odor that is hard to get rid of even after trying to shampoo this stuff out of my beard.</li>
            <li> My jacket suddenly had a scorpion stitched on the back and my driving skills became so advanced</li>
            <li> They included  nice thank you note, thanking me for the business and supporting small business!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super cheap</li>
            <li> The scent is manly, but takes a few hours the first time to get used to (being right under your nose).  </li>
            <li> This does give some control and guidance, but makes the hair soft, not stiff.  </li>
            <li> If you heat it, It soaks in well and leaves you with a natural looking mustache.</li>
            <li> If your beard is soft and doesn&#x27;t have those radical whiskers then this is for you.</li>
            <li> Completely natural.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t really need this stuff, but I&#x27;ll definitely use it as a cologne alternative.</li>
            <li> As far as holding power it is lacking but take into consideration that this is a gloss.</li>
            <li> and it makes my beard soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> With the help of Stingray Bay:  soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> , it is all natural product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a plus that it is made from all natural ingredients -- no parabens and no petroleum.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my moustache shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> My moustache and beard are on the way to being epic, but are a bit wild.  </li>
            <li> it stays soft and aromatic all day.</li>
            <li> Gave this to my son in law who is an all natural guy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells masculine but not overpowering</li>
            <li> But my beard, which is thick, is much more under control with wax in it.  </li>
            <li> It does not give a firm hold by any means (unlike the spiking glue I like to use in my hair), but it does offer just enough of a hold to keep things from becoming unruly and to style the mustache just a bit.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make my whiskers any shinier, despite the &amp;#34;gloss&amp;#34; name, nor did it do anything to tame the stray hairs without significant amounts, like I dipped my goatee in candle wax.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product but next time ill find the Wild Man.</li>
            <li> but if all you need is something to calm down your beard you wont regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> IT is a little lighter than needed to shape a handle bar, but the feel and scent are worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This will probably last a long time, because you don&#x27;t have to use too much.  </li>
            <li> This product has a nice smell and will hold some lame whiskers.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s hard to avoid getting it on your lips if you have a long &#x27;stache), and offers good control without being stiff.  </li>
            <li> Using it feels luxurious and the hair responds by going where I want it to go -- and mostly staying in place (except for trying to get handlebar behavior at the far edges which apparently requires stiffer wax, which I don&#x27;t want uncomfortably spread across the rest of my moustache).  </li>
            <li> Smells a lot like cloves but has a mild dry down scent, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different kinds of beard products,  but this one is a clear standout.</li>
            <li> I ended up using a little more than the suggested amount of a small dab between your fingers.  </li>
            <li> Then when I combed it out at the end of the day, the hair didn&#x27;t feel overly dry or flaky, it just felt soft.  </li>
            <li> Helps tame the beast and smells absolutely divine!</li>
            <li> It gives the beard a little volume, but doesn&#x27;t do as much to control the curl and frizz as I would like.  </li>
            <li> You really do have to use a little that is warmed up between rubbing hands and apply all over your beard.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get past the strong black licorice smell and it overpowers any cologne.</li>
            <li> Adds a little weight to the beard hair to help it hang down instead of stick straight out, I would recommend this to men with shorter styled beards, it probably wouldn&#x27;t hold up to a serious ZZ top.</li>
            <li> He ran out of his beard shampoo long ago, but this beard wax is a staple in his very simple routine.</li>
            <li> I grew my beard out last year for the first time and I used Wild Man beard oil a little to late in the season</li>
            <li> /&gt;The can holds a generous amount, and should last a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not very much holding power, but just enough for a day off.</li>
            <li> It does leave my beard a little greasy but not too much, just enough to give it a little shine.  </li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t too bad, I kind of like it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a moustache, but my goatee is at about 3 inches long, so</li>
            <li> As long as I have a beard</li>
            <li> I like to put a bit of product in the hair to keep the wild hairs tame.  </li>
            <li> Now that it is totally gray and the hair texture is different from the way it used to be, I figured a little beard dressing was called for.  </li>
            <li> (Use traditional mustache wax, though, if you are looking for a handlebar or other highly-stylized look.)</li>
            <li> Maybe I have a dry beard . . .</li>
            <li> Got this for DH for his manly but dry beard.</li>
            <li> (I have a sensitivity to fragrances) and his beard is shiny and no longer dry.</li>
            <li> The fiancé snuggles right in now, and it has a very subtle scent.</li>
            <li> If you get flakes from dry skin it helps as wel!</li>
            <li> but once you get a little bit on your fingers and rub it between the palms of your hands it melts instantly into a some what liquid form and from there you just rub it into the beard thoroughly.</li>
            <li> An overall waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been partial to men&#x27;s fragrances and don&#x27;t use them.  </li>
            <li> It just has no holding power, and I was only looking for something to hold a few wayward hairs in line with the rest.</li>
            <li> It was getting rough and crunchy feeling and my wife threatened to shave it off in my sleep.</li>
            <li> So I did some research and seen there are few products out there for men to use on their facial hair without spending a fortune.</li>
            <li> I use a few swirl wipes of the finger tips (not enough to get a build up on my fingers) and rub into my mustache and beard.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way too.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually keep my beard very short</li>
            <li> , it itches the other faces it touches.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy him beard grooming stuff because his beard has become &amp;#34;the other woman&amp;#34; in our marriage.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
            <li> Not a good wax, offers very little if looking for any holding power.  </li>
            <li> all beard wax, I think it is somewhat silly when they say a tiny bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Wish it held a little stronger.</li>
            <li> Even with my growth, little of the product is required to do the job.  </li>
            <li> The scent is woodsy and a little like allspice.  </li>
            <li> I might try something that keeps my moustache a little stiffer in the summer though</li>
            <li> This product helps tame my facebeast, and appear less like a misplaced bum in a suit.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect to do any styling with this beyond laying down the stray hairs!</li>
            <li> I like it for everyday application, but not for curling a mustache or beard shaping.  </li>
            <li> I wanted something I could use every day but this made my skin break out after a few days of using it.</li>
            <li> Heavy clove scent.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve been using it everyday for a month</li>
            <li> /&gt;After i used if for a few days I noticed a few things.</li>
            <li> I startled myself a few times.</li>
            <li> It helps to style and has a faint masculine aroma.</li>
            <li> Not too waxy, with a very slight earthy man scent.</li>
            <li> I used a very small amount and it still makes my dark brown beard look way too shiny.</li>
            <li> if your beard is crazy wild this may not work for you.</li>
            <li> I used a small amount.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually rub my fingertips in it then apply it to my beard.  </li>
            <li> Smell is a personal preference, but I think this stuff stinks.  </li>
            <li> smell is that of subtle lime.</li>
            <li> Guys, seriously try this stuff out.</li>
            <li> No more random hair sticking out in all directions.</li>
            <li> (Has a very subtle eucalyptus type scent.)  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it can feel a bit oil while it&#x27;s in, so</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells like a potpourri jar at a crazy cat ladies house.</li>
            <li> ordered the product because I looked like Grizzly Adams on a bad hair</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Just the right consistency and a very pleasant smell. If you heat it, It soaks in well and leaves you with a natural looking mustache.</li>
            <li> This product has a nice smell and will hold some lame whiskers. If your beard is soft and doesn&#x27;t have those radical whiskers then this is for you. Otherwise try a different product. I use this on my beard but use a stronger product for my handlebar.</li>
            <li> Not too waxy, with a very slight earthy man scent. I approve enthusiastically.</li>
            <li> Leaves facial hair soft and in place with a light, pleasant and masculine scent.  Not greasy or sticky.  Completely natural.  A truly excellent product that arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Great product! Smells great and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin. Isn&#x27;t meant for styling and holding but it does give body to your facial hair and keeps it neat. No more random hair sticking out in all directions.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Helps tame the beast and smells absolutely divine! Will definitely be ordering more when I finally run out!</li>
            <li> My beard is at its longest ever, yet I had still never used beard wax.  I read the reviews on Stingray Bay and it seemed pretty legit, so I have been using it for about a month now.  I like the smell first off...and so does my lady.  It gives the beard a little volume, but doesn&#x27;t do as much to control the curl and frizz as I would like.  I use it after washing and drying my beard and mustache.  It is not a strong holding wax, but does provide the gloss and pleasant smell as stated.  I like it for everyday application, but not for curling a mustache or beard shaping.  Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner not holding wax. Makes beards not Brillo pads when kissing my girl. I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Girl last night was going nuts about how good I smelled. So if you like girls raving about your manly scent, get on it. My beard is now really short and I don&#x27;t really need this stuff, but I&#x27;ll definitely use it as a cologne alternative.</li>
            <li> if you are looking for a light wax that wont leave your beard and skin feeling sticky this is it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;arrived on time. packaging and tin were good. smell is that of subtle lime. I like the smell... even if you don&#x27;t it doesn&#x27;t linger long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it softens the beard while helping with rogue hair. if your beard is crazy wild this may not work for you. but if all you need is something to calm down your beard you wont regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff! I have to make sure we order another one before we run out of the one that we do have! It makes his beard so soft and it smells great!</li>
            <li> This particular gloss is a great product. The smell is exotic and my girlfriend loves it! As far as holding power it is lacking but take into consideration that this is a gloss. I will buy this again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Greasy, doesn&#x27;t hold the shape you&#x27;re trying for very well. An overall waste of money. Would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> After years of wearing a short full beard and mustache, I decided to shave the beard and let the mustache grow out.  It soon became apparent that I needed some kind of product to help control the natural curliness of the longer hairs.  Based on recommendations I read here, I decided to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I am quite pleased.  It has a pleasant, light herbal scent, very neutral taste (it&#x27;s hard to avoid getting it on your lips if you have a long &#x27;stache), and offers good control without being stiff.  It also conditions, leaving the hair feeling soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The can holds a generous amount, and should last a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t have to look too far to find a great product.</li>
            <li> Does nothing to condition or control facial hair. If anything it makes it frizz out in all directions. It is also is very greasy and gets all over everything if you have a longer beard. I used a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;It smells like a potpourri jar at a crazy cat ladies house. We are talking a very strong odor that is hard to get rid of even after trying to shampoo this stuff out of my beard. Save your money and your facial hair.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I decided to try this beard gloss.  I wear a circle beard and wanted something to help obtain a more groomed appearance.  I am happy with the outcome I have achieved.  The scent is manly, but takes a few hours the first time to get used to (being right under your nose).  I no longer notice it and my wife LOVES it!!!  It does not take much...</li>
            <li> I wanted something I could use every day but this made my skin break out after a few days of using it.</li>
            <li> This was a great buy!  It has a great smell and is not greasy.  I would recommend this to anyone.  Its a great product from a great country!</li>
            <li> This gloss is great!  Easy to apply and it makes my beard soft and manageable.  I would not recommend it for moustaches unless you use VERY little, but for beards it is great.  It has a great clove smell.</li>
            <li> My husband loves his beard gloss! I will have to buy him another one very soon. The scent is very nice as well.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It has a nice natural smell, not girly though. I have very course hair and it normally feels like a Brillo pad but after using this gloss it&#x27;s noticeably softer and more relaxed. I was hoping it would have more hold than it does, but then again I didn&#x27;t buy Mustache gloss for the hold. A wonderful product that I&#x27;ll be using from now on.</li>
            <li> Being new to the experience of letting my moustache grow out, I ordered an assortment of moustache wax and wax-like products so I could try them for myself.  After experimenting for about two months, I have gradually stopped using all the others and settled on this one.  This one doesn&#x27;t have the grip or &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; of some of the waxier alternatives, but it has become my favorite by far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Au naturel, my &#x27;stache hairs are bristly and wayward.  With the help of Stingray Bay:  soft and manageable.  Using it feels luxurious and the hair responds by going where I want it to go -- and mostly staying in place (except for trying to get handlebar behavior at the far edges which apparently requires stiffer wax, which I don&#x27;t want uncomfortably spread across the rest of my moustache).  Thanks to Stingray my moustache feels soft and smooth.  It even has more color -- which I didn&#x27;t expect, but it&#x27;s a great bonus given that overall my hairs are fading to gray.  And although I am not a fan of having scented products directly under my nostrils, Stingray is pleasant and milder than the other moustache waxes &amp; oils I&#x27;ve encountered (several of which have very strong scents which I came to regret having applied).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, after placing my order, I was astonished how quickly it was delivered.</li>
            <li> This product does what its name implies; it makes the beard shine...and it gives it a nice smell of pine and spice...or as my roommate calls it potpourri (that Christmasy smelling stuff).&lt;br /&gt;However, I thought that when I bought this I would be able to use it daily to soften my beard and make it more manageable. It worked OK for doing this but then I started to break out underneath my beard. Now I only use it once a week and even though I comb and condition it with regular conditioner daily, I would like to use something that would make it soft...not for me, but for my future wife. I think when I run out of this I will buy something that is more like a daily leave-in conditioner. Unless I find a wife before I run out of this product.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it does make the beard shiney, but I can&#x27;t use it as often as I would like because I break out, and it leaves a greasy feel to my beard.</li>
            <li> I have used numerous products in my search for a quality beard care product.  I believe my search is over!  This has a nice mild, spicy aroma, while many products are either bland or overpowering.  It has a nice waxy, paste consistency while many such products are greasy.  It gives your beard just the right amount of hold and volume.  Excellent!</li>
            <li> I have tried several different kinds of beard products,  but this one is a clear standout. Tames my stubborn beard with ease - smells good too! I won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> Great to use as a beard balm, but doesn&#x27;t really offer any firm hold.  Great shine and smell though.</li>
            <li> Great scent. Wish it held a little stronger. I end up using wax and then this. Overall great product. Not too greasy.</li>
            <li> I have an unruly beard, no matter how much I conditioned it I could not get it under control.  After using this product my beard was finally tamed.  I ended up using a little more than the suggested amount of a small dab between your fingers.  I put a dime sized dab on my palm and rubbed it until the consistency was more liquid and applied that to my beard.  I did it twice, once for each side of my face, and it worked great.  Smells pretty good too.</li>
            <li> Great piney scented gloss that provides control and a subtle shine to the beard.  Application is simple, I scrape up a small amount with the top of my nail, warm it between two fingers on both hands and then apply.  I have had reactions to skin products before, however I am confident the natural makeup of this product is the reason I have not had any skin issues after application.  On my second tin, which is all the endorsement needed.</li>
            <li> Works well to manage my beard and mustache. Smells nice and is not too glossy.</li>
            <li> A bunch of guys I work with in Afghanistan all grew beards and eventually we put together several types of beard stuff we had all ordered on Amazon and compared them. Stingray Bay, which I bought on Amazon last month, was voted the best in terms of smell and keeping the beard soft without being greasy. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Works very well, wish it were a bit more aromatic.. it almost smells as if you&#x27;ve coated your face in chap stick</li>
            <li> This stuff is high quality and holds well. I can&#x27;t get past the strong black licorice smell and it overpowers any cologne.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a moustache, but my goatee is at about 3 inches long, so I like to put a bit of product in the hair to keep the wild hairs tame.  I used to use a clear gel that I loved, because it combed through the hair nicely when wet and held strong and didn&#x27;t budge when dry.  Then when I combed it out at the end of the day, the hair didn&#x27;t feel overly dry or flaky, it just felt soft.  They stopped making that, so I&#x27;m always looking for a decent replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t quite it, but it is nice.  The spicy scent is pleasing to the nose and since it&#x27;s right in my beard, it&#x27;s easy to get a whiff of several times throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hold is decent, but the purpose of this is for more of a gloss to the hair than hold.  Unfortunately it can feel a bit oil while it&#x27;s in, so once it&#x27;s all combed and in place, I try to avoid touching my chin if I can, because the residue gets on my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does wash out easily and I am not unhappy with my purchase and would consider this product again.</li>
            <li> Over the years, I&#x27;ve never fussed with my beard--except for washing it in the shower, giving it a good brushing daily, and trimming it (but only when it really needs it).  Now that it is totally gray and the hair texture is different from the way it used to be, I figured a little beard dressing was called for.  This beard and moustache gloss caught my attention.  The product is waxen, so there&#x27;s no chance of spilling.  The screw-top metal container is easy to pack and store.  Even with my growth, little of the product is required to do the job.  The results exceed my expectations:  The wiry, unruly gray hair looks better than it did, still bushy but under control.  Finally, the aroma.  I&#x27;ve never been partial to men&#x27;s fragrances and don&#x27;t use them.  This product&#x27;s aroma is a clean, fresh, natural one. It&#x27;s mild and a scent to which I look forward daily.  Recommended without reservation.</li>
            <li> Smell is a personal preference, but I think this stuff stinks.  It smells great when you first apply it, however after about a half hour, the smell really got to me. It was just too much. As a mustache wax though, it&#x27;s fantastic. Decent hold, really easy to apply. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, you may love the smell, not me though</li>
            <li> It has a light nice smell.  Many of the others I have tried are way too scented with herbs and whatnot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like all beard wax, I think it is somewhat silly when they say a tiny bit goes a long way.  Maybe I have a dry beard . . . but I need to put quite a bit before it starts to make a difference.  I do heat it up before (in fact I do so with a hairdryer).  But my beard, which is thick, is much more under control with wax in it.  I recommend this.</li>
            <li> It was a surprise gift that he had been searching for forever. So glad I found this!! :) The smell isn&#x27;t the best, but it works so great!</li>
            <li> melikey! Nice old school scent, easy application with comb, and the addition of it to my stash&#x27;s routine is definite compliment getter.</li>
            <li> I have a full beard and mustache, and this product has been great for both (though I also use it in conjunction with a wax on the mustache, as it is super long and needs a wax). It does everything it is designed to do (its gloss, NOT shaping wax), and it is reasonably priced. Some people have reported break-outs after use, but I have experienced the opposite--I have not had any break-outs while using this, which is infinitely better than other products I have tried. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend for Father&#x27;s Day, to pamper his beard. He&#x27;s never used beard products before, but he absolutely loved this product. It smells SO GOOD. He uses it on a daily basis. He ran out of his beard shampoo long ago, but this beard wax is a staple in his very simple routine. It smells great, makes his beard feel great, and lasts a long time. Two months later, he&#x27;s still got plenty left in the tin. Great buy. Recommended!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!! Great scent and not really greasy, it is all natural product. They included  nice thank you note, thanking me for the business and supporting small business!!! I will suggest to many of my bearded friends!</li>
            <li> I decided to grow out my beard in Movember, and I needed a product to condition it against low winter humidity here in Minnesota, and also to help keep it under control.  Not knowing what would work best for me -- and with few/no options at the local drugstore -- I found this product on Amazon.com and some very good reviews for it, so I decided to give it a try (given the modest price).  I am very pleased with it.  The smell is great and persists subtly for several hours, and the product, which is firm at room temperature, is easy to use after rubbing between my fingers, and then into my beard. It also gives a nice shine and conditioning to my beard without caking.  It does not give a firm hold by any means (unlike the spiking glue I like to use in my hair), but it does offer just enough of a hold to keep things from becoming unruly and to style the mustache just a bit.  (Use traditional mustache wax, though, if you are looking for a handlebar or other highly-stylized look.) It&#x27;s also a plus that it is made from all natural ingredients -- no parabens and no petroleum.  I will definitely order another tin of this product in a couple months when this one eventually runs out.</li>
            <li> The scent is quite nice, saving this from getting one star, however it hasn&#x27;t met my expectations on any other category. It didn&#x27;t make my whiskers any shinier, despite the &amp;#34;gloss&amp;#34; name, nor did it do anything to tame the stray hairs without significant amounts, like I dipped my goatee in candle wax. It just has no holding power, and I was only looking for something to hold a few wayward hairs in line with the rest.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using this.  My beard is more manageable this way.  I rub it on my palms get it warm, and then rub it through your beard.  It has a pleasant smell, reminds me of Christmas for some reason.  Your beard will have a little sheen, looks healthy.  I use it most days now and didn&#x27;t know I needed this.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I usually keep my beard very short but this year I decided to let it go CRAZY!&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t realize the care a beard need till I started letting it get longer. It was getting rough and crunchy feeling and my wife threatened to shave it off in my sleep. So I did some research and seen there are few products out there for men to use on their facial hair without spending a fortune. Then I found this product and loved it for not only the price but for the quality. It has a great smell, softens my hair and makes it more manageable. A little goes a long way too.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a wax but looks like it in the tin but once you get a little bit on your fingers and rub it between the palms of your hands it melts instantly into a some what liquid form and from there you just rub it into the beard thoroughly. now the wife makes a habit of sneaking in a hug after I put it in just to smell me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now on my second tin and don&#x27;t plan to stop using this product any time soon.</li>
            <li> Ordered this because of the great reviews, and wow, it doesn&#x27;t disappoint!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gloss makes my beard look healthy, and tamed, but still nice and bushy. The smell is the best part. My girlfriend says it &amp;#34;smells like Christmas!&amp;#34;. I love the clove-ish aroma. Definitely going to stick with this brand!</li>
            <li> Stingray Bay All-natural Botanical Beard and Moustache Gloss is a great product, used it as soon as it arrived yesterday! Not very much holding power, but just enough for a day off. Very pleasant aroma for the essential oils and NZ honey!</li>
            <li> Very pleased to have oredered this product. The canister is cool, the aroma is super light and pleasing. The dressing itself is very nice. Not a greasy looking shine, but a nice healthy glow. along with a nice beard brush, this stuff is great. Also stoked to support this family business and LOVE the Koru graphic and symbolism. I wear a koru and didn&#x27;t realize that this was the logo until it came. I&#x27;ll buy this sgain and again.</li>
            <li> I use this after washing my beard with Bluebeards beard wash and I&#x27;ve never had a softer beard.  My girlfriend loves the way this product leaves my beard smelling.  It does leave my beard a little greasy but not too much, just enough to give it a little shine.  The scent is woodsy and a little like allspice.  One can has lasted me about 2.5 months and I still have about 2 more weeks worth left.  As long as I have a beard I&#x27;ll be using this product on it!</li>
            <li> Really great smelling stuff. Heavy clove scent. Leaves my moustache shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> I have a full goatee and am very pleased with the Stingray Bay beard and mustache gloss.  It holds my mustache and goatee nicely and is not greasy.  I will continue to use and include this quality item in my beard care products.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> it reminds me of my dad.  Not exactly what I was looking for!  Ended up gifting this to a friend instead of my boyfriend, so that I wouldn&#x27;t smell my dad every time we kissed.  My friend really likes it though, says it works great and his beard looks fantastic.</li>
            <li> Makes your beard shiny, fluffy and smells good. I have a rather coarse beard, it itches the other faces it touches. Not with this though. Smoooth.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, not greasy with a nice scent, Does its job and does it well.</li>
            <li> Not greasy at all and smells kind of piney. It&#x27;s not super cheap but I&#x27;ve been using it everyday for a month and I&#x27;m not quite even a fourth of the way through the container.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything to compare this to since it&#x27;s the first beard product I&#x27;ve used, but the scent is great and it gives my beard a nice shine and makes it softer.  I usually rub my fingertips in it then apply it to my beard.  Anything left on my fingers goes on the front of my hair and my eyebrows, giving them a nice shine.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband&#x27;s manly facial hair. Smells a lot like cloves but has a mild dry down scent, not overpowering. Doesn&#x27;t do anything for hold but it does add a nice, conditioned gloss and helps control the man beard. Combined with wax for styling works well.</li>
            <li> this is a great product works to condition my beard and mustache.  It also helps to hold my beard in place.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product and it smells delicious - kissably so!  He uses it first to get a nice conditioned gloss and then waxes the tips of his moustache with a different product.  This is the second tin I&#x27;ve bought for him.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to use something like this, but have been impressed with how well it works. You really do have to use a little that is warmed up between rubbing hands and apply all over your beard. It adds a nice shine without being oily. It&#x27;s is a very pleasant, masculine scent that compliments my cologne very well. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My moustache and beard are on the way to being epic, but are a bit wild.  This stuff helps reign it in and guide the stragglers back into the flow.  When I eat, I need to wax the &#x27;stache away from my mouth; that is not what this product is for.  This does give some control and guidance, but makes the hair soft, not stiff.  And, oh, the smell!  Reminiscent of a candle scent (I think bayberry?), it is just wonderful.  I apply it after my morning shower (just massage it in and comb it) and it stays soft and aromatic all day.</li>
            <li> I ordered the stingray bay gloss because it was one of the only products available on prime, and had good reviews. The package came fast and right when I opened it I was able to smell a very light clove(ish) scent that was clean and refreshing. I use a few swirl wipes of the finger tips (not enough to get a build up on my fingers) and rub into my mustache and beard. It is great for controlling stray rogue hairs and provide a subtle shine. IT is a little lighter than needed to shape a handle bar, but the feel and scent are worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After i used if for a few days I noticed a few things. My jacket suddenly had a scorpion stitched on the back and my driving skills became so advanced I startled myself a few times.I must say the effects of the stingray beard gloss are second to none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying this again when my supply runs out</li>
            <li> I grew my beard out last year for the first time and I used Wild Man beard oil a little to late in the season but it was still very good.  This stuff is good but its very waxy and makes my beard feel sticky.  It&#x27;s a good product but next time ill find the Wild Man.</li>
            <li> I got a nice face shag going, but work in a professional environment. This product helps tame my facebeast, and appear less like a misplaced bum in a suit. I use it after showers and will never go back to beard oil. Make sure to rub it nice and long in between your hands to get it hot before taming your beast. You&#x27;re welcome.</li>
            <li> As someone from Filipino descent, my beard has never been quite full, long, or thick.&lt;br /&gt;I have been looking for something to keep it all together since it is quite unruly and doesn&#x27;t like to stay in place.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a number of waxes without luck so I decided to give this gloss a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff makes a HUGE difference on my beard. It keeps it shiny and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly though, it makes my beard very presentable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I do not like about it is the smell. While the smell is pleasant, it can get overpowering after while and at times I just wish would go away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this a week but already noticing a difference! Beard is much softer and feels a lot nicer. The fiancé snuggles right in now, and it has a very subtle scent. It&#x27;s a light wax, mostly conditioning. Don&#x27;t expect to do any styling with this beyond laying down the stray hairs!</li>
            <li> Gave this to my son in law who is an all natural guy.&lt;br /&gt;He wore it as soon as it arrived on his beard and loves it.&lt;br /&gt;He is 27, works and plays in a band, He totally loves this ...it was a hit as a gift to him.</li>
            <li> Spot on with what I was looking. 👌</li>
            <li> Guys, seriously try this stuff out. It smells great and does an excellent job of getting rid of that homeless guy beard look. Adds a little weight to the beard hair to help it hang down instead of stick straight out, I would recommend this to men with shorter styled beards, it probably wouldn&#x27;t hold up to a serious ZZ top.</li>
            <li> Got this for DH for his manly but dry beard. It smells masculine but not overpowering (I have a sensitivity to fragrances) and his beard is shiny and no longer dry.</li>
            <li> bought this for my husband for christmas, hes almost used it up. it has a nice clove smell to it and makes his beard nice and soft and shiney.</li>
            <li> I like this product! It smells good and helps control wild hairs with little effort! Go for it!  If you get flakes from dry skin it helps as wel!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I bought it for my boyfriend for Christmas. Not only is the smell amazing but his mustache looks so healthy!</li>
            <li> This is a great gloss and conditioner for facial hair.  Not a good wax, offers very little if looking for any holding power.  For what it is, it is fantastic.  Great scent, great feel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used four different products for my beard.  This is one of the good products.  It helps to style and has a faint masculine aroma.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t too bad, I kind of like it but my wife does not.  Not as strong of hold as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t what I was expecting.  I used a very small amount and it still makes my dark brown beard look way too shiny.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as part of grooming/shaving kit I put together for my husband for Valentines Day.  It comes in an easy to open tin.  My husband has a simple mustache; no handlebar or anything fancy.  I was looking for something to help soften the pricklies that can irritate when kissing, etc.  This product did make his mustache have a more glossier appearance, but didn&#x27;t do too much in the way of softening the mustache.  He still thinks its a fine product, but not a must have.  He does appreciate that it is all natural and does not have a strong scent.  (Has a very subtle eucalyptus type scent.)  This will probably last a long time, because you don&#x27;t have to use too much.  Probably would not order more when he runs out, because it is not a staple in his routine.</li>
            <li> This is my first beard.  I had no idea I would have to love it and feed it and stroke it and ...........  Well, you get the idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the product because I looked like Grizzly Adams on a bad hair day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple of days use, my beard has started to behave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your help.</li>
            <li> This wax works pretty well.  It is a little greasy but does the job and has a pretty good scent.  I might try something that keeps my moustache a little stiffer in the summer though</li>
            <li> My husband loves this gift.  I decided to buy him beard grooming stuff because his beard has become &amp;#34;the other woman&amp;#34; in our marriage. Used to be the computer. Then it was the iPhone. Now it&#x27;s the beard.  I figured I would embrace it.</li>
            <li> Scent is great, doubles as a hair styling product too!</li>
