            <li>I use this as a cymbal cleaner and it&#x27;s amazing .</li>
            <li>Twinkle is truly an amazing product.</li>
            <li>For our wedding we received a ton of nice copper cookware.</li>
            <li>I bought it to clean the copper parts of my mechanical mods and it works great.</li>

            <li>Great and shipped quickly</li>
            <li>I  have tried many products over the years in an effort to keep our copper nice.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best copper cleaner I have ever used!  </li>
            <li>just some light rubbing, EONS of tarnish came off and my kaleidoscope was as bright and shiny as the day I bought it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>how easy it is to rinse off!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a good product for kitchens and cookware with light tarnish, but for anything more than that</li>
            <li>Bra$$o is fine for cleaning my Navy belt buckle, but that&#x27;s about it!</li>
            <li>Quick delivery and good product.  </li>
            <li>how nice to find a sorta easy to use product to make my brass \\&quot;silverware\\&quot; look shiny and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it works well with any brass, copper or bronze.</li>
            <li>(I love Barkeeper&#x27;s Friend, too, but have to wear gloves to use it.)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try one more time with a dirtier cymbal (2 months?)</li>
            <li>Outstanding product-Thank You</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a brass cleaner that would work as quickly as most silver cleaners.  </li>
            <li>and I once again love my fan!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was expecting a much better result than I received.  </li>
            <li>(That&#x27;s the sort you want to make sure you buy if you have silver-plated objects, for example.)</li>
            <li>Just love this product.</li>
            <li>I thought there had to be something better, and I went on a limb to try this Twinkle stuff.</li>
            <li>So glad to find this product on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This stuff makes it ok to use the pans without spending all my time polishing.  </li>
            <li>I had not used this stuff for many years.</li>
            <li>I love this product and have for years.</li>
            <li>The screen was a gift, and the recipients love it.</li>
            <li>Brasso is a lot more work, but 10 times the shine.</li>
            <li>It turned out ok, but tarnish reappeared in two days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just make sure you have some gloves on.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad that I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting the same wonderful results.</li>
            <li>This is much better than Brasso, etc.</li>
            <li>Yes, Wrights is pretty good, but when it comes to copper this is the one to get.  </li>
            <li>It did an okay job but wasn&#x27;t as easy removing built up</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use on my copper pots and pans and a large brass tray I own.  </li>
            <li>It is FANTASTIC and I HIGHLY recommend it!!!!!</li>
            <li>Super EASY!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>I like this product it is easy to use and served my purpose well.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t what I would term easy</li>
            <li>It cleans brass so fast and easily and has a pleasant clean smell.</li>
            <li>Last year I built a beautiful bird house with a copper roof.  </li>
            <li>The mug looks good as new.</li>
            <li>Love how quickly the tarnish is gone and</li>
            <li>I ever tried required tons of elbow grease and a huge amount of time and effort.  </li>
            <li>Why in the world it is no longer available in the stores is inconceivable to me.  </li>
            <li>There are two kinds of copper/brass polishes: Ones that require an intense amount of rubbing to make them work, and this kind.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>A light rubbing with the applicator was all it took to eliminate 15 years of tarnish.  </li>
            <li>Was reluctant to buy this, but was looking for a brass cleaner to replace the one that I had been using for years - but just learned that it is no longer available.  </li>
            <li>good for old copperware</li>
            <li>not to excited about results.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find it at Amazon - course you can find everything at Amazon -</li>
            <li>It either does not work at all or it destroys the finish on the piece you are trying to clean.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this to clean my cymbals.</li>
            <li>I clean my cymbals monthly, so</li>
            <li>Keeps the pans clean longer than the product we had to use before.</li>
            <li>The day came and I needed it to clean and &#x27;sparkle</li>
            <li>I used it to clean the copper bottom pans that my mother had for years</li>
            <li>It is the best I have ever used and kind of hard to find, so I stocked up!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and makes the copper shine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Twinkle and in ten minutes the entire tea pot was brilliant shiny copper again!  </li>
            <li>It is quick and thorough.  </li>
            <li>This is a SUPER product.</li>
            <li>We even used to clean a fifteen+ year old copper pot rack that now looks good as new.</li>
            <li>If this product was new, it probably would work better.  </li>
            <li>Great product - used to clean old brass door knobs and such.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean up from and the candle holders look like new.  </li>
            <li>new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pieces need to be warmed under hot water before putting product on, which did seem to make them clean faster and easier.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like Twinkle because for some reason , the copper kettle stays bright and shiny longer than when using other brands.</li>
            <li>I have been polishing several pairs of brass candle holders that were very tarnished and this product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Grew up using Twinkle in our household and once married and moved into my own house forgot about it for a long time.</li>
            <li>it works better than any other cleaner available.</li>
            <li>Other&#x27;s take some real elbow grease to get a good result.</li>
            <li>It took a little elbow grease  on one of the pans, but it was shiny and bright when I was finished.  </li>
            <li>Bought to clean copper pots and pans, I really can&#x27;t say much as I didn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>Great product works well, hard to find</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews, but in this case I absolutely had to.  </li>
            <li>I finally decided to embrace the look of tarnished brass convincing myself that it gave the piece character.  </li>
            <li>first tried it on a vintage brass kaleidoscope that was the reason I bought the cleaner.  </li>
            <li>Works like magic, but requires a bit of elbow grease and multiple coats.</li>
            <li>As you start to gently apply the paste, the tarnish comes off almost immediately!</li>
            <li>REALLY, that&#x27;s IT!</li>
            <li>Used this many years ago and then was not able to find it any more and had to use something else.&lt;br /&gt;Glad</li>
            <li>Follow the directions, rinse the piece in hot water, then apply the cleaner with the applicator provided.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job with very little elbow grease!  </li>
            <li>I used this to clean some old copper cooking pots.  </li>
            <li>Using the Twinkle, I cleaned an entire 16\\&quot; cymbal, with 10+ years of tarnish on it (ok, no need to tell me that I should clean them more often!), in LESS THAN 10 MINUTES - BOTH SIDES!!!</li>
            <li>this product is good for small jobs but you must rub for polish.</li>
            <li>It now is polished like new!!</li>
            <li>It definitely gets a patina quickly, but this takes it right off.</li>
            <li>couldn&#x27;t find in stores so thanks Amazon - have used this for at least 50 years and Revereware copper still shines brightly</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how fast the twinkle cut the the tarnish....</li>
            <li>to see if this product has any real effect.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>I recomend this economic Product</li>
            <li>This stuff really works well</li>
            <li>I would but you want me to write too much.</li>
            <li>On word of caution: While it will not hurt your hands, it is very drying.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much elbow work if you add water to your rag or paper towel.</li>
            <li>One item I own has been left with 3 different looking surfaces.  </li>
            <li>I own eight heavy brass bangle bracelets…all made in India.</li>
            <li>I know it sounds too good to be true, but I simply followed the instructions and it worked unbelievably well.</li>
            <li>WoW!!!</li>
            <li>The pad provided is easy to grip and lasts long.</li>
            <li>Works better than any other polish.</li>
            <li>I decided to try one last time to find a polish to clean them, or I would get rid of them.  </li>
            <li>AM really amazed at how well and easily it removes heavy tarnish from brass without very much effort.</li>
            <li>Gives a better polish to brass than any other home product I have ever tried!</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s a picture of the top half of the brass piece which I&#x27;ve finished.</li>
            <li>This works better and requires less polishing.</li>
            <li>Including the delay for the pictures, the whole 14\\&quot; cymbal - BOTH sides - took me less than 15 minutes to completely clean!</li>
            <li>If I want a high polish I then polish it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Leon</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I had a hard time finding it for years, but it seems to have become popular again.  </li>
            <li>I was asked to try my hand at restoring a heavily tarnished 4 1/2 ft high Indian brass piece with many details and cutouts.</li>
            <li>Hot water rinse; then apply the Twinkle paste (sponge applicator is included), then hot water rinse again; then dry off when done.</li>
            <li>They all look new.  </li>
            <li>I live in a salt air environment.</li>
            <li>Tea pot looks new again.</li>
            <li>Used it on some brass jewelry and it also came out looking like new.</li>
            <li>However, the 2 boxes I received were far from new!  </li>
            <li>Used this on a few pieces and am satisfied so far.</li>
            <li>AND...the applicator rinses out completely, in SECONDS!</li>
            <li>AND...the applicator rinses out completely, in SECONDS!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve actually reviewed a product online.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, no heavy offensive odors, just wipe it on, buff it a little with the included sponge and off come years of tarnish.  </li>
            <li>This is the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; Twinkle, although maybe manufactured by a different company, it&#x27;s the same old tried and true product you&#x27;ve known for years.  </li>
            <li>It even removed some of the age old burned on food stains.</li>
            <li>I just wiped in on a old copper tea pot and wiped it off.</li>
            <li>After a couple minutes with this cream, they looked fantastic and they don&#x27;t seem to be tarnishing after a few weeks.</li>
            <li>This is old and has been sitting in a warehouse somewhere</li>
            <li>Just rinse the item with hot water, wipe on the Twinkle paste with the supplied applicator, rinse it off with jot water, dry it</li>
            <li>spent 25+ years in the military and was a huge fan of Bra$$o.</li>
            <li>I tried Brasso and Weiman with little success.</li>
            <li>It literally took only a few mins to clean my antique decor stuff..</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t worry, you didn&#x27;t just destroy $600 worth of pots by putting them in the dishwasher.</li>
            <li>This is one of the few products you&#x27;ll find today that is worth the money and then some.</li>
            <li>The slow kind are good for things that are plated, in that you won&#x27;t eat away 20 microns and find yourself looking at the base metal.</li>
            <li>No pile of black-sooted rags, no black gunk under my fingernails or embedded in my skin for the next three days (if you ever used Bra$$o, you know what I&#x27;m talking about!)</li>
            <li>Then rinse again with the hot water (I just ran from the tap and not hot enough to burn by hand).  </li>
            <li>Twinkle is, indeed, easy to use, requires little  hard rubbing, and makes your whole house glow.</li>
            <li>I was trying to clean up some brass-plated steel corner caps on a late 1800s steamer trunk, this did nothing.</li>
            <li>Wiped dry with an old tee shirt.  </li>
            <li>Wet item, apply cream with the soft sponge in container, rinse off, and dry with soft cloth.</li>
            <li>I have two antique brass candlestick holders, heavily carved, each holding 10 candles, so they are quite large.  </li>

            <li> Quick delivery and good product.  </li>
            <li> how nice to find a sorta easy to use product to make my brass \\&quot;silverware\\&quot; look shiny and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it works well with any brass, copper or bronze.</li>
            <li> (I love Barkeeper&#x27;s Friend, too, but have to wear gloves to use it.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try one more time with a dirtier cymbal (2 months?)</li>
            <li> Outstanding product-Thank You</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a brass cleaner that would work as quickly as most silver cleaners.  </li>
            <li> and I once again love my fan!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was expecting a much better result than I received.  </li>
            <li> (That&#x27;s the sort you want to make sure you buy if you have silver-plated objects, for example.)</li>
            <li> Just love this product.</li>
            <li> I thought there had to be something better, and I went on a limb to try this Twinkle stuff.</li>
            <li> So glad to find this product on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes it ok to use the pans without spending all my time polishing.  </li>
            <li> I had not used this stuff for many years.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have for years.</li>
            <li> The screen was a gift, and the recipients love it.</li>
            <li> Brasso is a lot more work, but 10 times the shine.</li>
            <li> It turned out ok, but tarnish reappeared in two days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just make sure you have some gloves on.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad that I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting the same wonderful results.</li>
            <li> This is much better than Brasso, etc.</li>
            <li> Yes, Wrights is pretty good, but when it comes to copper this is the one to get.  </li>
            <li> It did an okay job but wasn&#x27;t as easy removing built up</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use on my copper pots and pans and a large brass tray I own.  </li>
            <li> It is FANTASTIC and I HIGHLY recommend it!!!!!</li>
            <li> Super EASY!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> I like this product it is easy to use and served my purpose well.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I would term easy</li>
            <li> It cleans brass so fast and easily and has a pleasant clean smell.</li>
            <li> Last year I built a beautiful bird house with a copper roof.  </li>
            <li> The mug looks good as new.</li>
            <li> Love how quickly the tarnish is gone and</li>
            <li> I ever tried required tons of elbow grease and a huge amount of time and effort.  </li>
            <li> Why in the world it is no longer available in the stores is inconceivable to me.  </li>
            <li> There are two kinds of copper/brass polishes: Ones that require an intense amount of rubbing to make them work, and this kind.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> A light rubbing with the applicator was all it took to eliminate 15 years of tarnish.  </li>
            <li> Was reluctant to buy this, but was looking for a brass cleaner to replace the one that I had been using for years - but just learned that it is no longer available.  </li>
            <li> good for old copperware</li>
            <li> not to excited about results.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find it at Amazon - course you can find everything at Amazon -</li>
            <li> It either does not work at all or it destroys the finish on the piece you are trying to clean.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this to clean my cymbals.</li>
            <li> I clean my cymbals monthly, so</li>
            <li> Keeps the pans clean longer than the product we had to use before.</li>
            <li> The day came and I needed it to clean and &#x27;sparkle</li>
            <li> I used it to clean the copper bottom pans that my mother had for years</li>
            <li> It is the best I have ever used and kind of hard to find, so I stocked up!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and makes the copper shine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Twinkle and in ten minutes the entire tea pot was brilliant shiny copper again!  </li>
            <li> It is quick and thorough.  </li>
            <li> This is a SUPER product.</li>
            <li> We even used to clean a fifteen+ year old copper pot rack that now looks good as new.</li>
            <li> If this product was new, it probably would work better.  </li>
            <li> Great product - used to clean old brass door knobs and such.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean up from and the candle holders look like new.  </li>
            <li> new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pieces need to be warmed under hot water before putting product on, which did seem to make them clean faster and easier.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like Twinkle because for some reason , the copper kettle stays bright and shiny longer than when using other brands.</li>
            <li> I have been polishing several pairs of brass candle holders that were very tarnished and this product is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Grew up using Twinkle in our household and once married and moved into my own house forgot about it for a long time.</li>
            <li> it works better than any other cleaner available.</li>
            <li> Other&#x27;s take some real elbow grease to get a good result.</li>
            <li> It took a little elbow grease  on one of the pans, but it was shiny and bright when I was finished.  </li>
            <li> Bought to clean copper pots and pans, I really can&#x27;t say much as I didn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> Great product works well, hard to find</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but in this case I absolutely had to.  </li>
            <li> I finally decided to embrace the look of tarnished brass convincing myself that it gave the piece character.  </li>
            <li> first tried it on a vintage brass kaleidoscope that was the reason I bought the cleaner.  </li>
            <li> Works like magic, but requires a bit of elbow grease and multiple coats.</li>
            <li> As you start to gently apply the paste, the tarnish comes off almost immediately!</li>
            <li> REALLY, that&#x27;s IT!</li>
            <li> Used this many years ago and then was not able to find it any more and had to use something else.&lt;br /&gt;Glad</li>
            <li> Follow the directions, rinse the piece in hot water, then apply the cleaner with the applicator provided.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job with very little elbow grease!  </li>
            <li> I used this to clean some old copper cooking pots.  </li>
            <li> Using the Twinkle, I cleaned an entire 16\\&quot; cymbal, with 10+ years of tarnish on it (ok, no need to tell me that I should clean them more often!), in LESS THAN 10 MINUTES - BOTH SIDES!!!</li>
            <li> this product is good for small jobs but you must rub for polish.</li>
            <li> It now is polished like new!!</li>
            <li> It definitely gets a patina quickly, but this takes it right off.</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t find in stores so thanks Amazon - have used this for at least 50 years and Revereware copper still shines brightly</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how fast the twinkle cut the the tarnish....</li>
            <li> to see if this product has any real effect.</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> I recomend this economic Product</li>
            <li> This stuff really works well</li>
            <li> I would but you want me to write too much.</li>
            <li> On word of caution: While it will not hurt your hands, it is very drying.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take much elbow work if you add water to your rag or paper towel.</li>
            <li> One item I own has been left with 3 different looking surfaces.  </li>
            <li> I own eight heavy brass bangle bracelets…all made in India.</li>
            <li> I know it sounds too good to be true, but I simply followed the instructions and it worked unbelievably well.</li>
            <li> WoW!!!</li>
            <li> The pad provided is easy to grip and lasts long.</li>
            <li> Works better than any other polish.</li>
            <li> I decided to try one last time to find a polish to clean them, or I would get rid of them.  </li>
            <li> AM really amazed at how well and easily it removes heavy tarnish from brass without very much effort.</li>
            <li> Gives a better polish to brass than any other home product I have ever tried!</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a picture of the top half of the brass piece which I&#x27;ve finished.</li>
            <li> This works better and requires less polishing.</li>
            <li> Including the delay for the pictures, the whole 14\\&quot; cymbal - BOTH sides - took me less than 15 minutes to completely clean!</li>
            <li> If I want a high polish I then polish it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Leon</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding it for years, but it seems to have become popular again.  </li>
            <li> I was asked to try my hand at restoring a heavily tarnished 4 1/2 ft high Indian brass piece with many details and cutouts.</li>
            <li> Hot water rinse; then apply the Twinkle paste (sponge applicator is included), then hot water rinse again; then dry off when done.</li>
            <li> They all look new.  </li>
            <li> I live in a salt air environment.</li>
            <li> Tea pot looks new again.</li>
            <li> Used it on some brass jewelry and it also came out looking like new.</li>
            <li> However, the 2 boxes I received were far from new!  </li>
            <li> Used this on a few pieces and am satisfied so far.</li>
            <li> AND...the applicator rinses out completely, in SECONDS!</li>
            <li> AND...the applicator rinses out completely, in SECONDS!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve actually reviewed a product online.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, no heavy offensive odors, just wipe it on, buff it a little with the included sponge and off come years of tarnish.  </li>
            <li> This is the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; Twinkle, although maybe manufactured by a different company, it&#x27;s the same old tried and true product you&#x27;ve known for years.  </li>
            <li> It even removed some of the age old burned on food stains.</li>
            <li> I just wiped in on a old copper tea pot and wiped it off.</li>
            <li> After a couple minutes with this cream, they looked fantastic and they don&#x27;t seem to be tarnishing after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> This is old and has been sitting in a warehouse somewhere</li>
            <li> Just rinse the item with hot water, wipe on the Twinkle paste with the supplied applicator, rinse it off with jot water, dry it</li>
            <li> spent 25+ years in the military and was a huge fan of Bra$$o.</li>
            <li> I tried Brasso and Weiman with little success.</li>
            <li> It literally took only a few mins to clean my antique decor stuff..</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry, you didn&#x27;t just destroy $600 worth of pots by putting them in the dishwasher.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few products you&#x27;ll find today that is worth the money and then some.</li>
            <li> The slow kind are good for things that are plated, in that you won&#x27;t eat away 20 microns and find yourself looking at the base metal.</li>
            <li> No pile of black-sooted rags, no black gunk under my fingernails or embedded in my skin for the next three days (if you ever used Bra$$o, you know what I&#x27;m talking about!)</li>
            <li> Then rinse again with the hot water (I just ran from the tap and not hot enough to burn by hand).  </li>
            <li> Twinkle is, indeed, easy to use, requires little  hard rubbing, and makes your whole house glow.</li>
            <li> I was trying to clean up some brass-plated steel corner caps on a late 1800s steamer trunk, this did nothing.</li>
            <li> Wiped dry with an old tee shirt.  </li>
            <li> Wet item, apply cream with the soft sponge in container, rinse off, and dry with soft cloth.</li>
            <li> I have two antique brass candlestick holders, heavily carved, each holding 10 candles, so they are quite large.  </li>
            <li> … I tried a couple other products on my REALLY old copper pans and it was a lot of work.</li>
            <li> Again, in less than 10 minutes the blades looked brand new</li>
            <li> I have used this polish in the past and it really works well</li>
            <li> The boxes look like they&#x27;ve been on a shelf for a very long time--long enough for the cream to harden.  </li>
            <li> We have a Ship&#x27;s Bell -- regulation -- some 24 some odd years old -- never been cleaned.  </li>
            <li> After putting it outside, the robins decided to use the roof as a perch and spent the summer &amp;#34;doing their business&amp;#34; all over it.  </li>
            <li> Just rinse, wipe on, rinse off and dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the containers offer very little in each tub,  but at least it does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ran out of hot water when left running doing about seven pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No buffing with a dry cloth to remove tarnish required!</li>
            <li> You wet the enclosed sponge, rub cream on brass and wash off, dry and buff and your done.</li>
            <li> But after cleaning just one cymbal with that Bra$$o, it took FOREVER, and I had a MOUND of rags with black brass residue all over, and the black gunk got rubbed into my cymbals (and fingertips!) and took FOREVER to buff out completely.</li>
            <li> I tried it the day it arrived (today) because I was curious...</li>
            <li> I spent an hour using lemon juice, vinegar, and salt just on the lid of my antique copper tea pot.</li>
            <li> I had tried other brands of brass polish before but, never with the results I got with Twinkle.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to get cramps in my hands from using all the other polishes or home</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products for brass and copper.</li>
            <li> If there&#x27;s a really bad tarnish spot, rub it \\&quot;a little\\&quot; for a few more seconds.</li>
            <li> I do not know why this product disappeared from my local supermarket shelves because there is no better product for cleaning copper kitchenware!</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s where I treated half of my copper frying pan.</li>
            <li> I kid you not, in less than 10 minutes with no superhuman effort,</li>
            <li> It is hard to apply on larger surface, the sponge is small and it tears.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; was a hard solid and the sponge was stuck to it hard.  </li>
            <li> The rest are a waste of time.</li>
            <li> Waste of time.</li>
            <li> or Brass sparkles with just a few swipes with the sponge.  </li>
            <li> I tried using Brasso to clean it, but it was worthless.  </li>
            <li> The work is hard and it steaks the surface.</li>
            <li> The arrived hard as a rock.</li>
            <li> Almost all of the black streaks came out, though I can still faintly see the marks the robins made.  </li>
            <li> A ridiculous rule.</li>
            <li> Love the kaleidoscope, hated trying to keep it shiny, but hated the tarnished look.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t find the smell to be overpowering, and what scent there is isn&#x27;t unpleasant.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s VERY expensive, but it does work easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too bad it costs too muvh.</li>
            <li> It just looked like crap.  </li>
            <li> This product is dreadful.  </li>
            <li> The worst product ever!</li>
            <li> Just buy it - you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!</li>

            <li> Nothing better for cleaning copper!!</li>
            <li> I have used Twinkle paste since the Fifties. It is the finest copper and brass polish there is.</li>
            <li> I have been polishing several pairs of brass candle holders that were very tarnished and this product is amazing.  Easy to use and clean up from and the candle holders look like new.  It did a great job.</li>
            <li> I used this to clean some old copper cooking pots.  It worked great.  They all look new.  It even removed some of the age old burned on food stains.</li>
            <li> Awesome sauce for your brassware! Gives a better polish to brass than any other home product I have ever tried!</li>
            <li> It literally took only a few mins to clean my antique decor stuff..</li>
            <li> I accidentally washed a copper mug in the dishwasher.  I thought I was going to have to trash it but this worked wonders. The mug looks good as new.</li>
            <li> I cleaned a brass railing outside our church which hadn&#x27;t been cleaned in over a year.  I was amazed at how fast the twinkle cut the the tarnish....I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  It is FANTASTIC and I HIGHLY recommend it!!!!!</li>
            <li> If this product was new, it probably would work better.  However, the 2 boxes I received were far from new!  The &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; was a hard solid and the sponge was stuck to it hard.  It took a table knife to pry it away from the cleaning agent below.  The boxes look like they&#x27;ve been on a shelf for a very long time--long enough for the cream to harden.  Don&#x27;t judge the product by this review but do judge the seller.</li>
            <li> We have a lot of copper in our home,  domestic and European.  I  have tried many products over the years in an effort to keep our copper nice.  There are no products out there that can compete with Twinkle......  Not even can they come close.  I know ....  I have tried them all.  Why in the world it is no longer available in the stores is inconceivable to me.  Thank goodness for Amazon.  .</li>
            <li> This is by far the best copper cleaner I have ever used!  Love how quickly the tarnish is gone and how easy it is to rinse off!</li>
            <li> This product is dreadful.  It either does not work at all or it destroys the finish on the piece you are trying to clean.  One item I own has been left with 3 different looking surfaces.  Do yourself a favor and pick another product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry, you didn&#x27;t just destroy $600 worth of pots by putting them in the dishwasher. Here&#x27;s where I treated half of my copper frying pan. Bam.</li>
            <li> #1 copper cleaner. I live in a salt air environment. Everything tarnishes. My Publix stopped carrying this and I tried their Brasso and Wright&#x27;s but Never again. Found I could get it here on Amazon and my Revere ware and copper trays are sparkling again.</li>
            <li> After trying to purchase Twinkle from many outlets Amizon fulfilled my need perfectly it works better than any other cleaner available. I hope you continue to stock this product.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and good product.  A++++</li>
            <li> Great product works well, hard to find</li>
            <li> I do not know why this product disappeared from my local supermarket shelves because there is no better product for cleaning copper kitchenware! I looked everywhere for this product!</li>
            <li> My mother used Twinkle in the 50&#x27;s and I have been carrying on the tradition. It&#x27;s easy to use. It does make your copper pans shine. I give the product a 5-star rating!</li>
            <li> I use this as a cymbal cleaner and it&#x27;s amazing . Just rinse, wipe on, rinse off and dry. I&#x27;m sure it works well with any brass, copper or bronze.</li>
            <li> The worst product ever! It is hard to apply on larger surface, the sponge is small and it tears. The work is hard and it steaks the surface. It is like being a slave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and never buy this Twinkle</li>
            <li> My mother and grandmother always used this on their Revere copper bottom pots.  I had a hard time finding it for years, but it seems to have become popular again.  It does a great job with very little elbow grease!  (I love Barkeeper&#x27;s Friend, too, but have to wear gloves to use it.)</li>
            <li> I purchased this to clean my cymbals. I got the same results from grocery store lemons...I clean my cymbals monthly, so I&#x27;ll try one more time with a dirtier cymbal (2 months?) to see if this product has any real effect.</li>
            <li> I have used this polish in the past and it really works well</li>
            <li> I like Twinkle because for some reason , the copper kettle stays bright and shiny longer than when using other brands. I have lots of copper, and my son likes polishing it up. The pad provided is easy to grip and lasts long.</li>
            <li> Excellent polish. Great on cookware, decorative items, and jewelry. I use it all the time and I got a great bargain to boot!</li>
            <li> how nice to find a sorta easy to use product to make my brass \\&quot;silverware\\&quot; look shiny and new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pieces need to be warmed under hot water before putting product on, which did seem to make them clean faster and easier.&lt;br /&gt;my pieces have detail on the handpiece, so took toothbrush to that area to clean.&lt;br /&gt;the containers offer very little in each tub,  but at least it does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ran out of hot water when left running doing about seven pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did 13 pieces of dinner ware, and one brass bowl, and used up about 3/4 of a tub of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thus, it&#x27;s VERY expensive, but it does work easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hopefully the photo will show up, of some cleaned and uncleaned pieces.</li>
            <li> Twinkle is the ONLY cleaner for Brass or Copper. The rest are a waste of time. I have an extensive collection of Brass Oil Lamps and Copper Pans, I should know.  Also, Twinkle cleans Pipe Organ Pipes back to a &amp;#34; like new&amp;#34; condition.</li>
            <li> I just wiped in on a old copper tea pot and wiped it off. Tea pot looks new again. Used it on some brass jewelry and it also came out looking like new.</li>
            <li> I bought it to clean the copper parts of my mechanical mods and it works great.</li>
            <li> Excellent to clean copper</li>
            <li> I like this product it is easy to use and served my purpose well. recommended by amazon on line and I am happy I bought it.</li>
            <li> It is the best I have ever used and kind of hard to find, so I stocked up!!!</li>
            <li> This is the stuff I was looking for.  It used to be in all of the hardware and grocery stores.  It cleans copper instantly.  If I want a high polish I then polish it.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product-Thank You</li>
            <li> Helps me keep ahead of any tarnish on my brass tableware.</li>
            <li> Great product - used to clean old brass door knobs and such. would def. buy again. perfect size for any size cleaning project</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but in this case I absolutely had to.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a brass cleaner that would work as quickly as most silver cleaners.  Something I could just wipe on, work in a bit and then rinse off.  HA...dream on, I thought!  Every brass cleaner I ever tried required tons of elbow grease and a huge amount of time and effort.  I finally decided to embrace the look of tarnished brass convincing myself that it gave the piece character.  Yeah...not so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I saw this on Amazon, read the reviews and figured for the price I&#x27;d give my tarnished brass pieces one last shot at glory.  I tried it the day it arrived (today) because I was curious...although not overly optimistic, but I wanted to see what this stuff could (or couldn&#x27;t) do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first tried it on a vintage brass kaleidoscope that was the reason I bought the cleaner.  Love the kaleidoscope, hated trying to keep it shiny, but hated the tarnished look.  I kid you not, in less than 10 minutes with no superhuman effort, just some light rubbing, EONS of tarnish came off and my kaleidoscope was as bright and shiny as the day I bought it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then tried it on the brass blades of a vintage fan...with that piece I never embraced the &amp;#34;character&amp;#34; tarnished look.  It just looked like crap.  Again, in less than 10 minutes the blades looked brand new and I once again love my fan!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t find the smell to be overpowering, and what scent there is isn&#x27;t unpleasant. I would recommend wearing gloves because the cleaner can be drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final thoughts...buy this stuff...it&#x27;s amazing!  I haven&#x27;t tried it on copper, but I can only assume that it would work just as well as it does on brass.  Wipe, rub, rinse...done!</li>
            <li> I was expecting a much better result than I received.  It wasn&#x27;t what I would term easy and my brass did not shine brightly after vigorously rubbing.</li>
            <li> Great and shipped quickly</li>
            <li> Good product!  Have used it for years and years!</li>
            <li> There are two kinds of copper/brass polishes: Ones that require an intense amount of rubbing to make them work, and this kind. The slow kind are good for things that are plated, in that you won&#x27;t eat away 20 microns and find yourself looking at the base metal. (That&#x27;s the sort you want to make sure you buy if you have silver-plated objects, for example.) If what you have is solid, Twinkle is the answer. It can turn a 20 minute job into a 20 second job.</li>
            <li> Works like magic, but requires a bit of elbow grease and multiple coats. For our wedding we received a ton of nice copper cookware. It definitely gets a patina quickly, but this takes it right off. We even used to clean a fifteen+ year old copper pot rack that now looks good as new. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I own eight heavy brass bangle bracelets…all made in India. I had tried other brands of brass polish before but, never with the results I got with Twinkle. I was amazed and will keep Twinkle on hand from now on. Just love this product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother looking ANY further - THIS is what you were looking to buy!! On the star scale of 1 to 5....this is an EIGHT!! Check out my photos uploaded (cymbals) and see the difference and the in-process changes this product made!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent 25+ years in the military and was a huge fan of Bra$$o. But after cleaning just one cymbal with that Bra$$o, it took FOREVER, and I had a MOUND of rags with black brass residue all over, and the black gunk got rubbed into my cymbals (and fingertips!) and took FOREVER to buff out completely. Yes, the shine was great afterwards, but it took more than TWO HOURS to clean ONE SIDE of a cymbal - Yikes!! I thought there had to be something better, and I went on a limb to try this Twinkle stuff. I&#x27;M SOLD!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never again will I use anything else - especially for a BIG job. Bra$$o is fine for cleaning my Navy belt buckle, but that&#x27;s about it! Using the Twinkle, I cleaned an entire 16\\&quot; cymbal, with 10+ years of tarnish on it (ok, no need to tell me that I should clean them more often!), in LESS THAN 10 MINUTES - BOTH SIDES!!! WoW!!! And the shine was JUST AS GOOD as the Bra$$o! Look at the pix, see for yourself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then cleaned the hi-hat cymbal (and stopped to take pictures along the way, because even I couldn&#x27;t beleive the difference). Including the delay for the pictures, the whole 14\\&quot; cymbal - BOTH sides - took me less than 15 minutes to completely clean! AND...THERE WAS NO \\&quot;MESS\\&quot; afterwards! No pile of black-sooted rags, no black gunk under my fingernails or embedded in my skin for the next three days (if you ever used Bra$$o, you know what I&#x27;m talking about!). Really, it is simple - just follow the diretions. Hot water rinse; then apply the Twinkle paste (sponge applicator is included), then hot water rinse again; then dry off when done. As you start to gently apply the paste, the tarnish comes off almost immediately! If there&#x27;s a really bad tarnish spot, rub it \\&quot;a little\\&quot; for a few more seconds. REALLY, that&#x27;s IT! AND...the applicator rinses out completely, in SECONDS! I can&#x27;t say enough about this product. Just buy it - you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!that&#x27;s IT! AND...the applicator rinses out completely, in SECONDS! I can&#x27;t say enough about this product. Just buy it - you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> So glad to find this product on Amazon. Works so well on my copper bottom pans. Was a staple in our home while growing up</li>
            <li> Works better than any other polish. Too bad it costs too muvh.</li>
            <li> The only copper cleaner I use, if can rinse the item off with water.&lt;br /&gt;CDL</li>
            <li> Perfect very easy cream.  It is no effort to make my copper shine. Thank you. Absolutely WONDERFUL.  Best cleaner I have ever used</li>
            <li> This stuff worked extremley well.  We have a Ship&#x27;s Bell -- regulation -- some 24 some odd years old -- never been cleaned.  It now is polished like new!!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of copper pans.  This stuff makes it ok to use the pans without spending all my time polishing.  It&#x27;s quick and makes the copper shine.</li>
            <li> When my sister&#x27;s husband was stationed in India, my sister Helen asked me to send her several containers of Twinkle-- all the American ladies there used it to polish their brass, and copper.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it ever since that time also and love it!  Twinkle is, indeed, easy to use, requires little  hard rubbing, and makes your whole house glow.</li>
            <li> Used this many years ago and then was not able to find it any more and had to use something else.&lt;br /&gt;Glad Amazon has it. Keeps the pans clean longer than the product we had to use before.</li>
            <li> Received as described. Good Seller.</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t find in stores so thanks Amazon - have used this for at least 50 years and Revereware copper still shines brightly</li>
            <li> We have found that this product is the best for brass and copper and have used it for many years&lt;br /&gt;We highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Leon</li>
            <li> I had not used this stuff for many years. AM really amazed at how well and easily it removes heavy tarnish from brass without very much effort.</li>
            <li> It did nothing. I put it on a pan, rubbed it in, rubbed it off. Nothing changed. Waste of time.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.  Can&#x27;t recommend highly enough.  I have two antique brass candlestick holders, heavily carved, each holding 10 candles, so they are quite large.  I haven&#x27;t polished them for over 15 years, because I gave up after trying Brasso as my last resort.  I decided to try one last time to find a polish to clean them, or I would get rid of them.  Within two minutes of starting with this product, I was stunned.  Follow the directions, rinse the piece in hot water, then apply the cleaner with the applicator provided.  Within a minute the tarnish started to disappear.  A light rubbing with the applicator was all it took to eliminate 15 years of tarnish.  Then rinse again with the hot water (I just ran from the tap and not hot enough to burn by hand).  Wiped dry with an old tee shirt.  This is one of the few products you&#x27;ll find today that is worth the money and then some.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a good product for kitchens and cookware with light tarnish, but for anything more than that it&#x27;s rubbish. I was trying to clean up some brass-plated steel corner caps on a late 1800s steamer trunk, this did nothing.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have for years. It cleans brass so fast and easily and has a pleasant clean smell. No buffing with a dry cloth to remove tarnish required!</li>
            <li> The screen was a gift, and the recipients love it.</li>
            <li> not to excited about results. used for polishing brass bar rail. Brasso is a lot more work, but 10 times the shine.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT--NO PROBLEMS--THANKS</li>
            <li> Grew up using Twinkle in our household and once married and moved into my own house forgot about it for a long time. The day came and I needed it to clean and &#x27;sparkle&#x27; things up around the house as I have alot of copper, and no store carried it anymore.  I was so excited to find it at Amazon - course you can find everything at Amazon - I ordered it and the product was still the best I have ever used.  Thank you Twinkle and thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> Nothing cleans like Twinkle. A brand I have used for years, then could no longer find it on shelves at the store.  I was elated when I found it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Copper or Brass sparkles with just a few swipes with the sponge.  Try it...you will not use anything else.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve actually reviewed a product online. I can&#x27;t believe how good this product works. I spent an hour using lemon juice, vinegar, and salt just on the lid of my antique copper tea pot. I just bought the pot and it has about 100 years of dirt and tarnish on it. It turned out ok, but tarnish reappeared in two days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Twinkle and in ten minutes the entire tea pot was brilliant shiny copper again!  I know it sounds too good to be true, but I simply followed the instructions and it worked unbelievably well. Just rinse the item with hot water, wipe on the Twinkle paste with the supplied applicator, rinse it off with jot water, dry it and that&#x27;s it! I didn&#x27;t have to get cramps in my hands from using all the other polishes or home methods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use Twinkle from now on.</li>
            <li> Best copper polish paste I&#x27;ve used. This one even smells nice! Other&#x27;s take some real elbow grease to get a good result. This one works way faster. Just make sure you have some gloves on. I just use dish washing gloves.</li>
            <li> Always loved/used this product but can&#x27;t find it ANYWHERE locally! It&#x27;s very easy to use on my copper pots and pans and a large brass tray I own.  Wet item, apply cream with the soft sponge in container, rinse off, and dry with soft cloth. It works.  I can&#x27;t believe no one carries it here in town and was delighted when I found it on Amazon/Prime!</li>
            <li> Last year I built a beautiful bird house with a copper roof.  After putting it outside, the robins decided to use the roof as a perch and spent the summer &amp;#34;doing their business&amp;#34; all over it.  I tried using Brasso to clean it, but it was worthless.  After reading the reviews, I bought Twinkle.  Almost all of the black streaks came out, though I can still faintly see the marks the robins made.  Next spring I may install some tiny nails on the roof to encourage the robins to roost elsewhere.</li>
            <li> If you have copper in your home, this is the product to buy.  Yes, Wrights is pretty good, but when it comes to copper this is the one to get.  It is quick and thorough.  You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> Was reluctant to buy this, but was looking for a brass cleaner to replace the one that I had been using for years - but just learned that it is no longer available.  Used this on a few pieces and am satisfied so far.</li>
            <li> I was asked to try my hand at restoring a heavily tarnished 4 1/2 ft high Indian brass piece with many details and cutouts. I tried Brasso and Weiman with little success. After reading the reviews, I decided to give Twinkle a try and I&#x27;m glad that I did. I&#x27;ve used both a scrubber pad and toothbrush and had to apply three treatments where it is pitted. It has taken some elbow work, but the results have been excellent. Here&#x27;s a picture of the top half of the brass piece which I&#x27;ve finished.</li>
            <li> very good and cheap Product for al my copper pot collection ( Mauviel and de Buyer ) I recomend this economic Product</li>
            <li> Did a great job on my copper!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works well… I tried a couple other products on my REALLY old copper pans and it was a lot of work. After a couple minutes with this cream, they looked fantastic and they don&#x27;t seem to be tarnishing after a few weeks. I&#x27;M VERY HAPPY I FOUND THIS STUFF.</li>
            <li> this product is good for small jobs but you must rub for polish.</li>
            <li> Twinkle is truly an amazing product. I used it to clean the copper bottom pans that my mother had for years and I still use.  It took a little elbow grease  on one of the pans, but it was shiny and bright when I was finished.  My mother used Twinkle over 50 years ago. I&#x27;m getting the same wonderful results.</li>
            <li> This is a SUPER product. I use it on brass. Super EASY! You wet the enclosed sponge, rub cream on brass and wash off, dry and buff and your done. This is much better than Brasso, etc. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Bought to clean copper pots and pans, I really can&#x27;t say much as I didn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> This is what we&#x27;ve been looking for. It works great.</li>
            <li> It did an okay job but wasn&#x27;t as easy removing built up tarnish as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> good for old copperware</li>
            <li> Grocery stores no longer stock Twinkle. I&#x27;ve tried other products for brass and copper. This works better and requires less polishing.</li>
            <li> This is the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; Twinkle, although maybe manufactured by a different company, it&#x27;s the same old tried and true product you&#x27;ve known for years.  This stuff works like a charm.  Easy to use, no heavy offensive odors, just wipe it on, buff it a little with the included sponge and off come years of tarnish.  You cannot find it in the stores anymore, but it&#x27;s the best copper and brass cleaners on the market.</li>
            <li> Does the job, and is ci</li>
            <li> I would but you want me to write too much. A ridiculous rule. I won&#x27;t do reviews until you change this.</li>
            <li> This is the best brass cleaner I have ever used.  It does an excellent job even on objects that are highly tarnished.  I have used different types of brass polish over the years, and this is the one I will use from now on.  On word of caution: While it will not hurt your hands, it is very drying.  I would advise using rubber gloves.</li>
            <li> The arrived hard as a rock. Tried heating in microwave which helped somewhat. This is old and has been sitting in a warehouse somewhere would be my guess. Product didn&#x27;t work as well as Weisman&#x27;s either.</li>
            <li> This works great.  Doesn&#x27;t take much elbow work if you add water to your rag or paper towel.</li>
