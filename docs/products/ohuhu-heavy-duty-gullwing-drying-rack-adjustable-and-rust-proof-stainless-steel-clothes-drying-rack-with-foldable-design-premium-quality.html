            <li>Yeah - it is truly amazing.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kind of a pain.</li>

            <li>Nicely built product.  </li>
            <li>I was quite enthusiastic when I bought this product, thinking it would have been nice to have a sturdy, metal clothes rack.</li>

            <li>If you really wanted to get rid of the dryer and you lived alone, this is the perfect drying rack.</li>
            <li>That thing is utilitarian and kind of works.</li>
            <li>That thing is utilitarian and kind of works.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice quality product, but it&#x27;s just way too skinny for my wash loads.</li>
            <li>It looks wonderful!  Very large and strong.</li>
            <li>I live in an Airstream so this is perfect for my lifestyle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>rack folds up into a fairly compact structure for easy storage.</li>
            <li>She is in her 70&#x27;s and said its very easy to manipulate and there was no set up.</li>
            <li>This rack is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>so it won&#x27;t touch the ground if hanged at the highest bars (though it will be nice if it can be adjusted even higher/taller to accommodate most clothes).</li>
            <li>Not bad, but not that good either</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light weight&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plastic connectors are very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>very light weighted.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This drying rack solves so many of our problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>

            <li>lower the top racks a bit).</li>
            <li>Many shirts should hang from hangers without touching the floor.</li>
            <li>I then laid my recently-cleaned makeup brushes on top of the paper towels, perpendicular to the cross-bars on the top rack.</li>
            <li>It is stainless steel and will not rust and has two shoe holders located on the side, a great feature for drying gym shoes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For convenience</li>
            <li>/&gt;Air-drying saves energy and is better for our environment.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care what your EnergyStar rating is; I guarantee that your washer-drier pair is your most inefficient electricity burner in your house.</li>
            <li>It holds more clothes than I thought it would.</li>
            <li>Sure beats the wood shelf that I used for years.</li>
            <li>use you just fold out the arms and legs (for lack of a better term.)  </li>
            <li>of course with the arms up you have to make sure you have both ends balanced so it doesn&#x27;t tip over.  </li>

            <li>I was able to put just about a full laundry load on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This would also be good if you live in a restricted community that doesn&#x27;t allow clotheslines, you could buy one or two and set them out, put away when clothes are dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Acknowledgements to the manufacturer for making the product available for review.</li>
            <li>The metal frame is sturdy but the plastic is insubstantial and cheap.</li>
            <li>The plastic is cheaply made and affixed to the metal frame.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for indoor or outdoor use though I wouldn&#x27;t recommend leaving it outside all the time as you can do with some lines.</li>
            <li>Amazing capacityto take load  and the rack is very  sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Ohuhu heavy duty drying rack is wonderful.</li>
            <li>IT IS FANTASTIC</li>
            <li>I think I am going to really enjoy this thing!&lt;br</li>
            <li>My shirts &amp; towels don&#x27;t fit across the rails.</li>
            <li>This is sturdy and light.  </li>
            <li>It would be much more useful though if it was about 4 inches wider.</li>
            <li>The wife put it to work right away :-).</li>
            <li>Sturdy and reliable, and very economical, as well.  </li>
            <li>the light weight and storage friendly nature of this item also makes it well suited to take on camping trips.  </li>
            <li>Love it, Love it, Love it,  Purchased it to be able to dry sweaters after washing in the machine.</li>
            <li>The rack is very easy to set up and it very sturdy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It would be great if the company came up with a tight stretch mesh screen that could stretch over the wings when opened to be able avoid the bar marks on the sweaters.</li>
            <li>This is easy and fun to use.  </li>
            <li>The rack does not buzz at me for attention, nor does it have a lint filter to clean.</li>
            <li>The Ohuhu® Heavy Duty Gullwing Drying Rack caught my eye right away as it comes in a really awesome compact shape for storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it works well to protect those special pieces of clothing.</li>
            <li>Sturdy, easy to set up, can dry a good sized load.  </li>
            <li>This works  great for a quick dry rack or for hanging out a load of clothes.</li>
            <li>and since it is made of  stainless steel, except for the plastic support and plastic covering pieces means its is strong and will not be easily damaged.&lt;br /&gt;5.Its</li>
            <li>Using a clothing rack to hang the wet laundry on will work great.</li>
            <li>my family has but this rack is very sturdy and has more room than you think.</li>
            <li>Good enough for the price.</li>
            <li>In a good way, the rack looks European.</li>
            <li>Better than hanging a close line between trees for the whole camp grounds to see.</li>
            <li>Folds up quickly and holds a load of towels.</li>
            <li>So it is very easy for one person to move around, car easier than our old garment rack which will be scrapped!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>rack quickly and easily expands out for a large drying area.</li>
            <li>Then lift either wing up to the angle you want, because the center hinge has some friction, the wings stay exactly where you put them (what a great feature compared to those darn wire racks).</li>
            <li>It was compact enough to fit in our camper easily for the trip and when we got out I set it up very quickly.</li>
            <li>It is very sturdy while still setting up and collapsing easily for storage.  </li>
            <li>Even as a child I truly loved when my mother would air dry our clothes and sheets.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly, packaged just right.  </li>
            <li>Also, the bars holding up the side flaps don&#x27;t fit really well either.  </li>
            <li>received this complimentary product for my honest and unbiased review but that in no way swayed the above statements.</li>
            <li>but if you have the space it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>It was shipped sooner than expected and in good conditions.</li>
            <li>Lightweight, but steady and sturdy, easy to store, convenient to use.</li>
            <li>Even without the screen, it&#x27;s a terrific drying rack, a good shake of the sweaters usually takes care of the bar marks, but it would be a good addition.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Right out of the box</li>
            <li>I needed it right away and decided to compromise with some caulk.</li>
            <li>Right now we have it stored in our laundry room</li>
            <li>This solves so many problems with normal straight wire drying racks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been using the shower curtain rod, towel racks, etc., in my second bathroom to hang things to dry, but this wasn&#x27;t an ideal solution.</li>
            <li>It has plenty of room for a full load of washing and folds up to be very compact.  </li>
            <li>The rack is super sturdy with a smart design.</li>
            <li>This has really been a super item in my laundry room.  </li>
            <li>Offers a lot of space to store your clothes for drying, the foldabl design makes convenient storage space and easy to setup whenever required.</li>
            <li>it was clear; this is so easy to use and so sturdy.</li>
            <li>I love this clothes drying rack and have used it to dry swimwear and towels, a full load of clothes, and even to air out my feather bed.  </li>
            <li>There is plenty of room on this rack and it adjusts to so many different positions to accommodate my drying needs.  </li>
            <li>10 days later rust has speckled most of the lower portion.  </li>
            <li>My first thought after taking a look at the Ohuhu drying rack was that I was going to see if it could hold heavier items.  </li>
            <li>in the future Ohuhu can provide products that are more functioning.</li>
            <li>First off</li>
            <li>Exactly what we needed.</li>
            <li>Great for drying your delicate washables.  </li>
            <li>supports the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>The snaps are great for socks, delicate items, etc.</li>
            <li>This rack can be configured in so many ways.&lt;br /&gt;It can&#x27;t be compared to the ones you find at big box stores, this one is in a class all by itself.&lt;br /&gt;Out of the box, just snip the zip ties and unfold in any way you like.</li>
            <li>Air drying clothing is not only better for fabrics themselves but for your utilities as well.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE not having to run my dryer constantly!  </li>
            <li>I used this drying rack for the first time over the weekend.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed</li>
            <li>This is very sturdy and hold a lot of clothes!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good size but not huge and could be tucked into the corner of a room or put on the balcony.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is also great for those that is only hang dry.  </li>
            <li>The Ohuhu Heavy Duty Drying Rack is perfect for  our needs, which is to have a sturdy spot to dry our towels and swimwear after swimming.  </li>
            <li>Right out of the box, it is already ready to use (it&#x27;s pre-assembled, and just need to be unfolded).</li>
            <li>I set the rack up so that the top was basically flat, then covered it with paper towels.</li>
            <li>I bought the original style, not heavy duty as a used item.</li>
            <li>It has it pluses in that it offers a lot of area to hand clothing, but so much of the supports and holders are cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>The best clothes drying I&#x27;ve ever used next to hanging clothes outside to air dry.  </li>
            <li>Good quality, but it is a little more lightweight than I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>Only used it 4 times so far but it works great, assembles easily to different heights /angles for drying dresses out or longer clothes like towels.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much the one I had seen at my friends house in Germany</li>
            <li>Sturdy, light, big enough for many clothes.</li>
            <li>I remember the days of the old wooden racks, hard to set up, wobbly, the smooth stainless steel rods make this ideal for drying sweaters.</li>
            <li>I could easily picture this on a balcony in a European home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>No assembly required and is easy to open and fold away.</li>
            <li>So simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li>No one has room for a rack that large, but folded up it can go into a closet or under a bed.  </li>
            <li>It folds flat for easy storage.</li>
            <li>Very easy to set up and take down.</li>
            <li>The design is very functional.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
            <li>Thanks Ohuhu for sending this sample product.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my mother, she had not stopped talking about how much she likes it.</li>
            <li>Very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this unit is very sturdy and can handle a lot of wieght.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much space.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Very dependable</li>
            <li>and I believe we can really save some money for the gas bill.</li>
            <li>Made of quality materials and very sturdy.</li>
            <li>But she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>are some of the really neat features:&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is all stainless steel, except for the plastic support and plastic covering pieces.  </li>
            <li>clothes rack is very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>and I really needed a drying rack to make it easier.  </li>
            <li>so doesn&#x27;t occupy much of the garden area.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s stainless steel</li>
            <li>After struggling with the cheap wooden drying racks, I found this metal version.  </li>
            <li>Very sturdy.</li>
            <li>I really like the adjustable racks and sturdiness of this drying rack.  </li>
            <li>Ohuhu® Heavy Duty Gullwing Drying Rack is a nice and sturdy drying rack.</li>
            <li>3 more rods have fallen off of the rack and one of the extending arms to lift the top rack has broken.</li>
            <li>but this helps for the smaller items or loads and is much more convenient than heading all the way outside on certain days!</li>
            <li>The size makes it portable, hence easy to fit in your car and carry to different locations which might need you to dry your clothes.</li>
            <li>With a full 12-month warranty and a 30-day money back guarantee you will certainly be satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pantyhose, lingerie, bathing suits, etc., should be able to hang dry with no trouble at all.</li>
            <li>So many of today&#x27;s garments are made with either delicate fabrics or knit, stretchy, material and using a dryer can quickly ruin them.  </li>
            <li>This is very sturdy, the only problem I have with it, is that it isn&#x27;t as wide as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to be more energy friendly, so I searched for one that was light, wouldn&#x27;t rust, and was big enough for a small load of laundry.</li>
            <li>This takes drying racks to a whole new level.</li>
            <li>I had to cram things together to fit them in there, which made it take longer to dry items.</li>
            <li>previous reviews I was expecting something better.</li>
            <li>I saw one at Costco for half the price and better.</li>
            <li>One thing that can be improved are the plastic connectors which can be made more solid (maybe use aluminum instead of plastic) to ensure durability especially when we adjust the angle</li>
            <li>But that means you need a decent drying rack to get the water off your hand-washed clothing.</li>
            <li>however one of the support rods was bent and one of the main rods was dented.</li>
            <li>There are two shoe racks at the bottom of each main leg.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are two shoe racks at the bottom of each main</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sturdy and definitely seems worth the cost</li>
            <li>It even has another high bar to hang clothing.</li>
            <li>High quality and spacious.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Holds a lot of laundry, folds up and down easily and is very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Spend a little more and get something substantial.</li>
            <li>This has been more than convenient and even my difficult husband set in his non-green friendly ways, loves it!  </li>
            <li>It is sort of the modern day version of the old- fashioned clothesline</li>
            <li>I can fit about two loads of laundry on it and of course wet shoes when I need to.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s MUCH better than my old wooden drying rack that would collapse with any weight.</li>
            <li>Poor packaging, good product.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for, the average vertical drying racks wore out quickly and could not support the multitude of jeans</li>
            <li>You can easily make it bigger or smaller depending on your needs.  </li>
            <li>I wish that the rods on the Ohuhu were a tad longer so that I could dry shirts with them at their full width rather than scrunched up.</li>
            <li>it is easy to setup and take down.</li>
            <li>Easy to set up and take down.</li>
            <li>I do still use a clothesline now where I live</li>
            <li>The rack is a little pricey, but after using it, the thing is worth every single penny of that more premium price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The rack is a little pricey, but after using it, the thing is worth every single penny of that more premium price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not just limited to shoes, this rack is great for my hang dry sweaters, and other garments that just can&#x27;t go in the dryer.  </li>
            <li>The whole rack has exactly the right weight - not too heavy and not too light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The whole rack has exactly the right weight - not too heavy and not too light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>thinking about this for a short while, it became clear this rack is useful for a lot of people: college, camping (not rustic camping but drive up campsites), beach house, boat, balcony in the city, backyard, art project drying, laundry room, or the deck.</li>
            <li>If you are Tinkerbelle, or some other fairy or sprite, and you have a collection of fine lace hankies about an inch square, which weigh less than a hummingbird&#x27;s eyelash, and you hand washed those lace hankies, and don&#x27;t want to hang them on little branches in the forest because the hankies will get tree resin on them, then this is a good drying rack for you.  </li>
            <li>The materials help ensure I don&#x27;t have to worry about rust, and it seems very sturdy in general, so I anticipate getting a lot of use out of it.  </li>
            <li>With the wings flat, I was able to put a pair of wet jeans on the end bar</li>
            <li>use it for sweaters only, but there are many options for drying other items including 2 pairs of running shoes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>when assembled it is a full 50&amp;#34; wide and 3 feet tall.  </li>
            <li>So simple and easy to set up, dry overnight, fold up in the morning and slide it neatly into a closet.</li>
            <li>Light weight and can fold down for portability.</li>
            <li>It made them dry faster -- water would get absorbed by the paper towels and evaporate from below (which could not happen if the brushes were laid on a counter) and water would also evaporate from the tops of the brushes.</li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:60163e899cfe17ec8fbfcf578f4d9dee]]Many people are now trying to be eco-friendly and are heading back to several tried and true old-fashioned methods of conserving energy.  </li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:f65a48bca3b591e18c03fa420cdadffd]]I absolutely love this  Ohuhu® Heavy Duty Adjustable Rust-proof Stainless Steel Gullwing Style Clothes Drying Rack will make your laundry chores much easier especially with handwashed items such as dresses , sweaters etc.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Too much heat causes shrinkage and can also fade out the fabric’s colors a lot sooner making your garments looking old when they are actually still fairly new.</li>
            <li>Steer clear of this rack and save your money.  </li>
            <li>At one point we had 6 adult swimsuits, 6 towels (both beach and bath towels), dish towels</li>
            <li>Made of stainless steel and sturdy plastic joints, it will not rust even if you put it in the open.</li>
            <li>What a relief this sturdy drying rack is, rather than my old wobbly one with the rods popping out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The four blue clips on the bottom, I haven&#x27;t really figured out yet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The four blue clips on the bottom, I haven&#x27;t really figured out yet.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough how much I like this rack.</li>
            <li>However, so far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>not heavy duty</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about it is that the rods that hold the clothes are inserted into the frame, which makes it a lot sturdier than other racks where smaller rods are only spot-welded on.  </li>
            <li>This has a pretty flexible design, it&#x27;s easy to set up and take down, and its folded state is small enough to fit in pretty tight spaces.</li>
            <li>I love the versatility of the racks for drying things on hangers or items that must be dried flat.</li>
            <li>The original came with a part missing</li>
            <li>I specifically bought this drying rack because not only was it stainless steel, but it was narrow enough to fit in my tub.  </li>
            <li>We live full time in our 5th wheel toy hauler and I have a small portable washer.</li>
            <li>so I finally got around to purchasing a new drying rack but went to Amazon for a sturdier version.</li>
            <li>The Ohuhu® Heavy Duty Adjustable Rust-proof Stainless Steel Gullwing Style Clothes Drying Rack will make your laundry chores much</li>
            <li>these slots can be used to hang things like socks, bras, and other more delicate items that you don&#x27;t normally put on hangers.  </li>
            <li>However, the metallic material is thin, but the thing that is more of a concern is the plastic that holds these metallic rods is even flimsier (the lower section bars and those that support the top bars are weak links).</li>
            <li>I can dry flat if needed, hang dry, drip dry, and more.  </li>
            <li>Right now it is poolside holding wet towels.&lt;br /&gt;Folds flat for storage.</li>
            <li>The stainless steel design is sturdy and will last you a long time.</li>
            <li>but I will probably move it outside once my patio is complete.  </li>
            <li>There are several different styles available but this drying rack made by Ohuhu that is heavy duty</li>
            <li>Mine did come with one plastic piece broken (the attachment to one of the support arms, where it clips to the cross-bars of the top rack), but I am still able to use it with that piece broken.</li>
            <li>You could even dry a fairly thick sweater without stretching it out by laying it over the top rack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is saving us money on utility bills and is super convenient to use even in a small laundry room.</li>
            <li>Decent dry rack sometime the poles pop out, not the major ones but the smaller ones that need to be moved when folding it up.</li>
            <li>When open it is large - so check measurements carefully if you are worried about space.</li>
            <li>Other than these things, it works really well however</li>
            <li>wife really has found it extremely useful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>To me this is only for indoor air drying (direct sunlight will make the plastic brittle) and need extra care while handling.</li>
            <li>Despite the stainless steel, this product is NOT rust proof, and clearly not meant to dry salt-water-exposed items.  </li>
            <li>The rack was not wide enough</li>
            <li>Setting it up is so easy - spread open the two legs, the center small rack locks in place and keeps this stable on the floor.</li>
            <li>I hang anything on it when I want them dry naturally, clothes or food.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s heavy, but not too heavy that I can&#x27;t easily cart it around, and it has plenty of places to hang towels and swimwear.  </li>
            <li>Folds down for small spaces and is easy to store.</li>
            <li>This is a fairly large stand, and like the title states, heavy duty.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m very grateful to have found something like this to make my camping experience a little bit easier.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are little rubber/plastic gadgets attached to the very ends of the gull wings that you can hang hangers for drying or to hand your clothes as you are tranferring everything to hangers.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a nice quality product, but it&#x27;s just way too skinny for my wash loads.</li>

            <li> This rack is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> so it won&#x27;t touch the ground if hanged at the highest bars (though it will be nice if it can be adjusted even higher/taller to accommodate most clothes).</li>
            <li> Not bad, but not that good either</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light weight&lt;br</li>

            <li> I was able to put just about a full laundry load on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This would also be good if you live in a restricted community that doesn&#x27;t allow clotheslines, you could buy one or two and set them out, put away when clothes are dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is also light weight and easy to set up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, it&#x27;s easy to set up, and it sits politely out of the way on non-laundry days.</li>

            <li> Acknowledgements to the manufacturer for making the product available for review.</li>
            <li> The metal frame is sturdy but the plastic is insubstantial and cheap.</li>
            <li> The plastic is cheaply made and affixed to the metal frame.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for indoor or outdoor use though I wouldn&#x27;t recommend leaving it outside all the time as you can do with some lines.</li>
            <li> Amazing capacityto take load  and the rack is very  sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Ohuhu heavy duty drying rack is wonderful.</li>
            <li> IT IS FANTASTIC</li>
            <li> I think I am going to really enjoy this thing!&lt;br</li>
            <li> My shirts &amp; towels don&#x27;t fit across the rails.</li>
            <li> This is sturdy and light.  </li>
            <li> It would be much more useful though if it was about 4 inches wider.</li>
            <li> The wife put it to work right away :-).</li>
            <li> Sturdy and reliable, and very economical, as well.  </li>
            <li> the light weight and storage friendly nature of this item also makes it well suited to take on camping trips.  </li>
            <li> Love it, Love it, Love it,  Purchased it to be able to dry sweaters after washing in the machine.</li>
            <li> The rack is very easy to set up and it very sturdy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It would be great if the company came up with a tight stretch mesh screen that could stretch over the wings when opened to be able avoid the bar marks on the sweaters.</li>
            <li> This is easy and fun to use.  </li>
            <li> The rack does not buzz at me for attention, nor does it have a lint filter to clean.</li>
            <li> The Ohuhu® Heavy Duty Gullwing Drying Rack caught my eye right away as it comes in a really awesome compact shape for storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it works well to protect those special pieces of clothing.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, easy to set up, can dry a good sized load.  </li>
            <li> This works  great for a quick dry rack or for hanging out a load of clothes.</li>
            <li> and since it is made of  stainless steel, except for the plastic support and plastic covering pieces means its is strong and will not be easily damaged.&lt;br /&gt;5.Its</li>
            <li> Using a clothing rack to hang the wet laundry on will work great.</li>
            <li> my family has but this rack is very sturdy and has more room than you think.</li>
            <li> Good enough for the price.</li>
            <li> In a good way, the rack looks European.</li>
            <li> Better than hanging a close line between trees for the whole camp grounds to see.</li>
            <li> Folds up quickly and holds a load of towels.</li>
            <li> So it is very easy for one person to move around, car easier than our old garment rack which will be scrapped!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> rack quickly and easily expands out for a large drying area.</li>
            <li> Then lift either wing up to the angle you want, because the center hinge has some friction, the wings stay exactly where you put them (what a great feature compared to those darn wire racks).</li>
            <li> It was compact enough to fit in our camper easily for the trip and when we got out I set it up very quickly.</li>
            <li> It is very sturdy while still setting up and collapsing easily for storage.  </li>
            <li> Even as a child I truly loved when my mother would air dry our clothes and sheets.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly, packaged just right.  </li>
            <li> Also, the bars holding up the side flaps don&#x27;t fit really well either.  </li>
            <li> received this complimentary product for my honest and unbiased review but that in no way swayed the above statements.</li>
            <li> but if you have the space it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> It was shipped sooner than expected and in good conditions.</li>
            <li> Lightweight, but steady and sturdy, easy to store, convenient to use.</li>
            <li> Even without the screen, it&#x27;s a terrific drying rack, a good shake of the sweaters usually takes care of the bar marks, but it would be a good addition.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Right out of the box</li>
            <li> I needed it right away and decided to compromise with some caulk.</li>
            <li> Right now we have it stored in our laundry room</li>
            <li> This solves so many problems with normal straight wire drying racks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using the shower curtain rod, towel racks, etc., in my second bathroom to hang things to dry, but this wasn&#x27;t an ideal solution.</li>
            <li> It has plenty of room for a full load of washing and folds up to be very compact.  </li>
            <li> The rack is super sturdy with a smart design.</li>
            <li> This has really been a super item in my laundry room.  </li>
            <li> Offers a lot of space to store your clothes for drying, the foldabl design makes convenient storage space and easy to setup whenever required.</li>
            <li> it was clear; this is so easy to use and so sturdy.</li>
            <li> I love this clothes drying rack and have used it to dry swimwear and towels, a full load of clothes, and even to air out my feather bed.  </li>
            <li> There is plenty of room on this rack and it adjusts to so many different positions to accommodate my drying needs.  </li>
            <li> 10 days later rust has speckled most of the lower portion.  </li>
            <li> My first thought after taking a look at the Ohuhu drying rack was that I was going to see if it could hold heavier items.  </li>
            <li> in the future Ohuhu can provide products that are more functioning.</li>
            <li> First off</li>
            <li> Exactly what we needed.</li>
            <li> Great for drying your delicate washables.  </li>
            <li> supports the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> The snaps are great for socks, delicate items, etc.</li>
            <li> This rack can be configured in so many ways.&lt;br /&gt;It can&#x27;t be compared to the ones you find at big box stores, this one is in a class all by itself.&lt;br /&gt;Out of the box, just snip the zip ties and unfold in any way you like.</li>
            <li> Air drying clothing is not only better for fabrics themselves but for your utilities as well.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE not having to run my dryer constantly!  </li>
            <li> I used this drying rack for the first time over the weekend.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> This is very sturdy and hold a lot of clothes!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good size but not huge and could be tucked into the corner of a room or put on the balcony.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is also great for those that is only hang dry.  </li>
            <li> The Ohuhu Heavy Duty Drying Rack is perfect for  our needs, which is to have a sturdy spot to dry our towels and swimwear after swimming.  </li>
            <li> Right out of the box, it is already ready to use (it&#x27;s pre-assembled, and just need to be unfolded).</li>
            <li> I set the rack up so that the top was basically flat, then covered it with paper towels.</li>
            <li> I bought the original style, not heavy duty as a used item.</li>
            <li> It has it pluses in that it offers a lot of area to hand clothing, but so much of the supports and holders are cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> The best clothes drying I&#x27;ve ever used next to hanging clothes outside to air dry.  </li>
            <li> Good quality, but it is a little more lightweight than I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> Only used it 4 times so far but it works great, assembles easily to different heights /angles for drying dresses out or longer clothes like towels.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much the one I had seen at my friends house in Germany</li>
            <li> Sturdy, light, big enough for many clothes.</li>
            <li> I remember the days of the old wooden racks, hard to set up, wobbly, the smooth stainless steel rods make this ideal for drying sweaters.</li>
            <li> I could easily picture this on a balcony in a European home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> No assembly required and is easy to open and fold away.</li>
            <li> So simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li> No one has room for a rack that large, but folded up it can go into a closet or under a bed.  </li>
            <li> It folds flat for easy storage.</li>
            <li> Very easy to set up and take down.</li>
            <li> The design is very functional.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
            <li> Thanks Ohuhu for sending this sample product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my mother, she had not stopped talking about how much she likes it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this unit is very sturdy and can handle a lot of wieght.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much space.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Very dependable</li>
            <li> and I believe we can really save some money for the gas bill.</li>
            <li> Made of quality materials and very sturdy.</li>
            <li> But she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> are some of the really neat features:&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is all stainless steel, except for the plastic support and plastic covering pieces.  </li>
            <li> clothes rack is very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> and I really needed a drying rack to make it easier.  </li>
            <li> so doesn&#x27;t occupy much of the garden area.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stainless steel</li>
            <li> After struggling with the cheap wooden drying racks, I found this metal version.  </li>
            <li> Very sturdy.</li>
            <li> I really like the adjustable racks and sturdiness of this drying rack.  </li>
            <li> Ohuhu® Heavy Duty Gullwing Drying Rack is a nice and sturdy drying rack.</li>
            <li> 3 more rods have fallen off of the rack and one of the extending arms to lift the top rack has broken.</li>
            <li> but this helps for the smaller items or loads and is much more convenient than heading all the way outside on certain days!</li>
            <li> The size makes it portable, hence easy to fit in your car and carry to different locations which might need you to dry your clothes.</li>
            <li> With a full 12-month warranty and a 30-day money back guarantee you will certainly be satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pantyhose, lingerie, bathing suits, etc., should be able to hang dry with no trouble at all.</li>
            <li> So many of today&#x27;s garments are made with either delicate fabrics or knit, stretchy, material and using a dryer can quickly ruin them.  </li>
            <li> This is very sturdy, the only problem I have with it, is that it isn&#x27;t as wide as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to be more energy friendly, so I searched for one that was light, wouldn&#x27;t rust, and was big enough for a small load of laundry.</li>
            <li> This takes drying racks to a whole new level.</li>
            <li> I had to cram things together to fit them in there, which made it take longer to dry items.</li>
            <li> previous reviews I was expecting something better.</li>
            <li> I saw one at Costco for half the price and better.</li>
            <li> One thing that can be improved are the plastic connectors which can be made more solid (maybe use aluminum instead of plastic) to ensure durability especially when we adjust the angle</li>
            <li> But that means you need a decent drying rack to get the water off your hand-washed clothing.</li>
            <li> however one of the support rods was bent and one of the main rods was dented.</li>
            <li> There are two shoe racks at the bottom of each main leg.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are two shoe racks at the bottom of each main</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sturdy and definitely seems worth the cost</li>
            <li> It even has another high bar to hang clothing.</li>
            <li> High quality and spacious.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Holds a lot of laundry, folds up and down easily and is very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Spend a little more and get something substantial.</li>
            <li> This has been more than convenient and even my difficult husband set in his non-green friendly ways, loves it!  </li>
            <li> It is sort of the modern day version of the old- fashioned clothesline</li>
            <li> I can fit about two loads of laundry on it and of course wet shoes when I need to.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s MUCH better than my old wooden drying rack that would collapse with any weight.</li>
            <li> Poor packaging, good product.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for, the average vertical drying racks wore out quickly and could not support the multitude of jeans</li>
            <li> You can easily make it bigger or smaller depending on your needs.  </li>
            <li> I wish that the rods on the Ohuhu were a tad longer so that I could dry shirts with them at their full width rather than scrunched up.</li>
            <li> it is easy to setup and take down.</li>
            <li> Easy to set up and take down.</li>
            <li> I do still use a clothesline now where I live</li>
            <li> The rack is a little pricey, but after using it, the thing is worth every single penny of that more premium price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The rack is a little pricey, but after using it, the thing is worth every single penny of that more premium price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not just limited to shoes, this rack is great for my hang dry sweaters, and other garments that just can&#x27;t go in the dryer.  </li>
            <li> The whole rack has exactly the right weight - not too heavy and not too light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The whole rack has exactly the right weight - not too heavy and not too light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> thinking about this for a short while, it became clear this rack is useful for a lot of people: college, camping (not rustic camping but drive up campsites), beach house, boat, balcony in the city, backyard, art project drying, laundry room, or the deck.</li>
            <li> If you are Tinkerbelle, or some other fairy or sprite, and you have a collection of fine lace hankies about an inch square, which weigh less than a hummingbird&#x27;s eyelash, and you hand washed those lace hankies, and don&#x27;t want to hang them on little branches in the forest because the hankies will get tree resin on them, then this is a good drying rack for you.  </li>
            <li> The materials help ensure I don&#x27;t have to worry about rust, and it seems very sturdy in general, so I anticipate getting a lot of use out of it.  </li>
            <li> With the wings flat, I was able to put a pair of wet jeans on the end bar</li>
            <li> use it for sweaters only, but there are many options for drying other items including 2 pairs of running shoes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> when assembled it is a full 50&amp;#34; wide and 3 feet tall.  </li>
            <li> So simple and easy to set up, dry overnight, fold up in the morning and slide it neatly into a closet.</li>
            <li> Light weight and can fold down for portability.</li>
            <li> It made them dry faster -- water would get absorbed by the paper towels and evaporate from below (which could not happen if the brushes were laid on a counter) and water would also evaporate from the tops of the brushes.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:60163e899cfe17ec8fbfcf578f4d9dee]]Many people are now trying to be eco-friendly and are heading back to several tried and true old-fashioned methods of conserving energy.  </li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:f65a48bca3b591e18c03fa420cdadffd]]I absolutely love this  Ohuhu® Heavy Duty Adjustable Rust-proof Stainless Steel Gullwing Style Clothes Drying Rack will make your laundry chores much easier especially with handwashed items such as dresses , sweaters etc.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Too much heat causes shrinkage and can also fade out the fabric’s colors a lot sooner making your garments looking old when they are actually still fairly new.</li>
            <li> Steer clear of this rack and save your money.  </li>
            <li> At one point we had 6 adult swimsuits, 6 towels (both beach and bath towels), dish towels</li>
            <li> Made of stainless steel and sturdy plastic joints, it will not rust even if you put it in the open.</li>
            <li> What a relief this sturdy drying rack is, rather than my old wobbly one with the rods popping out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The four blue clips on the bottom, I haven&#x27;t really figured out yet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The four blue clips on the bottom, I haven&#x27;t really figured out yet.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough how much I like this rack.</li>
            <li> However, so far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> not heavy duty</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about it is that the rods that hold the clothes are inserted into the frame, which makes it a lot sturdier than other racks where smaller rods are only spot-welded on.  </li>
            <li> This has a pretty flexible design, it&#x27;s easy to set up and take down, and its folded state is small enough to fit in pretty tight spaces.</li>
            <li> I love the versatility of the racks for drying things on hangers or items that must be dried flat.</li>
            <li> The original came with a part missing</li>
            <li> I specifically bought this drying rack because not only was it stainless steel, but it was narrow enough to fit in my tub.  </li>
            <li> We live full time in our 5th wheel toy hauler and I have a small portable washer.</li>
            <li> so I finally got around to purchasing a new drying rack but went to Amazon for a sturdier version.</li>
            <li> The Ohuhu® Heavy Duty Adjustable Rust-proof Stainless Steel Gullwing Style Clothes Drying Rack will make your laundry chores much</li>
            <li> these slots can be used to hang things like socks, bras, and other more delicate items that you don&#x27;t normally put on hangers.  </li>
            <li> However, the metallic material is thin, but the thing that is more of a concern is the plastic that holds these metallic rods is even flimsier (the lower section bars and those that support the top bars are weak links).</li>
            <li> I can dry flat if needed, hang dry, drip dry, and more.  </li>
            <li> Right now it is poolside holding wet towels.&lt;br /&gt;Folds flat for storage.</li>
            <li> The stainless steel design is sturdy and will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> but I will probably move it outside once my patio is complete.  </li>
            <li> There are several different styles available but this drying rack made by Ohuhu that is heavy duty</li>
            <li> Mine did come with one plastic piece broken (the attachment to one of the support arms, where it clips to the cross-bars of the top rack), but I am still able to use it with that piece broken.</li>
            <li> You could even dry a fairly thick sweater without stretching it out by laying it over the top rack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is saving us money on utility bills and is super convenient to use even in a small laundry room.</li>
            <li> Decent dry rack sometime the poles pop out, not the major ones but the smaller ones that need to be moved when folding it up.</li>
            <li> When open it is large - so check measurements carefully if you are worried about space.</li>
            <li> Other than these things, it works really well however</li>
            <li> wife really has found it extremely useful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> To me this is only for indoor air drying (direct sunlight will make the plastic brittle) and need extra care while handling.</li>
            <li> Despite the stainless steel, this product is NOT rust proof, and clearly not meant to dry salt-water-exposed items.  </li>
            <li> The rack was not wide enough</li>
            <li> Setting it up is so easy - spread open the two legs, the center small rack locks in place and keeps this stable on the floor.</li>
            <li> I hang anything on it when I want them dry naturally, clothes or food.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy, but not too heavy that I can&#x27;t easily cart it around, and it has plenty of places to hang towels and swimwear.  </li>
            <li> Folds down for small spaces and is easy to store.</li>
            <li> This is a fairly large stand, and like the title states, heavy duty.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m very grateful to have found something like this to make my camping experience a little bit easier.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are little rubber/plastic gadgets attached to the very ends of the gull wings that you can hang hangers for drying or to hand your clothes as you are tranferring everything to hangers.  </li>
            <li> Big enough to dry 3 women&#x27;s cashmere sweaters flat; one on each wing and one on the bottom rack.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m done, the unit folds up flat</li>
            <li> Once I was done with it, it folded up flat again.  </li>
            <li> Then today I wanted to put it outside for clothes to dry</li>
            <li> She tried it out as soon as we got it to dry clothes outside.  </li>
            <li> because if I have to dry a runner rug outside</li>
            <li> I use it outside and let the clothes air dry in the sun.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife so she could dry her inner wear, and socks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this rack a few times so far, so I can&#x27;t speak to its longevity.  </li>
            <li> Finally a place to dry sweaters!</li>
            <li> Can use it inside or outside and it has places to dry shoes!</li>
            <li> Release the two blue locking clips, pull up on the wing, the support arm will fall down, push the wings down, now lift up the center rack to release the two sides, and fold the whole thing up.</li>
            <li> Those labels that say machine wash, lay flat to dry-</li>
            <li> It is not high enough to hang a pair of pants from the waistband, but you could dry pants folded over one of the bars.</li>
            <li> It makes the job of drying my delicate items much easier and I&#x27;ve managed to find some unconventional uses for it, as well.</li>
            <li> It makes the job of drying my delicate items much easier and I&#x27;ve managed to find some unconventional uses for it, as well.</li>
            <li> Taking time to protect the things you have purchased saves time and money in the long run.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use a measuring tape to figure out what to expect, but I can say that this rack was larger than I expected.  </li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT&amp;#62; IF ANYTHING IN THE BOX RATTLES&amp;#60; SEND IT BACK BECAUSE WHEN THIS PIECE IS INTACT AND OPENED CAREFULLY</li>
            <li> Clearly not &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34</li>
            <li> When folded, it lies flat for minimal storage</li>
            <li> Of course the rack can be used for several other things, but could it cut the mustard with a pile of laundry?  </li>
            <li> The weight is substantial enough to have one wing out and the other down.&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
            <li> With my tumble dryer, there is no way I could dry them in there, so</li>
            <li> Decades ago there weren&#x27;t dryers and we all hung clothes out to dry.  </li>
            <li> This drying rack does its job and dry my clothes that I don&#x27;t want to put in the dryer.</li>
            <li> I like to hang my work shirts, bras, and pantyhose to dry instead of putting them through the dryer.</li>
            <li> It allows me to hang my towels, socks, etc in the garage to dry.</li>
            <li> And in all of this I hadn&#x27;t even put one sock to dry on it.&lt;br /&gt;Moral</li>
            <li> dry.</li>
            <li> only problem with the smaller ones is that they cannot hold a heavy load.  </li>
            <li> One of the bars was too short and missing blue plastic ring so the bar keeps falling off.</li>
            <li> We had a flimsy drying rack from Target, or somewhere similar, and it broke down over a year ago.</li>
            <li> This one has less space to hang and double the price.</li>
            <li> the this rack is big and allows you to dry a multitude of items,  the rods are not securely fastened to the rack.</li>
            <li> think the added four shoe holders for those wet shoes to help dry quicker!  </li>
            <li> There is a little blue connector/cap that connects the rod to the rack.</li>
            <li> the ends of both sides have a plastic rod on them with numerous little teeth or slots.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little big to use indoors</li>
            <li> If I was unhappy with it&#x27;s condition I was also given a follow-up email offering a free replacement.</li>
            <li> It can be used indoors or outside so during the cold months, we can use it inside our home and then outside when it&#x27;s warmer.  very durable and sturdy regardless of where you choose to use it.  </li>
            <li> So we end up with a lot of wet clothes on our car or our picnic table and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Just be careful on windy days.  </li>
            <li> I washed up a couple of loads of towels and throw rugs, which are not only heavy, but awkward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> doing your laundry carefully sort out items that will not do well in the dryer.</li>
            <li> so it will hold up to heavier wet garments.</li>
            <li> This rack is heavy and might be unwieldy for someone who is physically challenged.</li>
            <li> So, I reassembled it and closed it.</li>
            <li> But as soon as I closed it, another piece came off.</li>
            <li> Closed.</li>
            <li> And I closed it.</li>
            <li> And when I closed it those piece came off the hinges of one side again.</li>
            <li> but they have it about twice as wide.</li>
            <li> but it is not as sturdy as  I expected.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Not qute what I expected, but I&#x27;m getting used to it.  </li>
            <li> I used to hang some of my clothes on the curtain rod, which I hated to do because water would drip on the floor, but with this drying rack I am able to set it up in the bathtub and I can open one side to dry my clothes.  </li>
            <li> I also have a couple of small clothes racks, one metal and one wooden, that I&#x27;ve used from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can lower one or both sides, a storage space in the middle which can be used for small clothes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this product is well designed and extremely helpful</li>
            <li> use this in combination with the Scrubba Wash Bag for small loads, washing machine for bigger ones.</li>
            <li> They have sharp edges that make pulls on your clothes when you take your them off the rack.  </li>
            <li> Even with both sides lowered, you have a small storage space in the middle.  </li>
            <li> My wife also uses it as a collection point for items to be ironed - hanging them on one end and hanging the completed items on the other end.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Folds down to about 3 inches wide for storate.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy duty and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;ll tip over if I hang a heavy towel on one side only.  </li>
            <li> but it is too narrow to dry a bath towel.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> I love how you can adjust the height of the arms for taller items, and a base for stocky things.</li>
            <li> The entire rack will collapse into a very small footprint for storage.  </li>
            <li> I just pulled it up, snapped it into place, and then flipped up a small loose plastic grab and secured that as well.  </li>
            <li> One of the odd things I miss from my childhood is having a closeline in our backyard.  </li>
            <li> Also had some other plastic blue rings already broken after 1 use.  </li>
            <li> These three clips are a series of plastic loops that will hold things tightly.</li>

            <li> If, like me, you&#x27;re trying to reduce your waste and carbon consumption, hand-washing and hang-drying your clothing is the way to start.</li>

            <li> [[VIDEOID:439514ba453a01da5997bff3d8d94485]]Update:&lt;br /&gt;We used this over this weekend while camping and it worked great. It was compact enough to fit in our camper easily for the trip and when we got out I set it up very quickly. Since we were camping with family everyone was using the rack. At one point we had 6 adult swimsuits, 6 towels (both beach and bath towels), dish towels and we even had a sleeping bag on there at one day because my dog decided to pee on it. No issues at all. Can&#x27;t wait to use it again on our next trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is super handy for someone who camps during the summer like me. We stay at a lot of campgrounds that don&#x27;t allow you to hang clothes lines but they have places to swim. So we end up with a lot of wet clothes on our car or our picnic table and it&#x27;s kind of a pain. This drying rack solves so many of our problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It&#x27;s very light weight&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) It&#x27;s compact&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) It can be used at a variety of angles and only 1 side up or both&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Shoe holders. Since we swim in a lot of waterfall areas we use water shoes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) It holds a TON of clothes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) Can hang suits from the hooks on the end and towels on the larger parts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really I could go on and on but I&#x27;m very grateful to have found something like this to make my camping experience a little bit easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this complimentary product for my honest and unbiased review but that in no way swayed the above statements.</li>
            <li> This has really been a super item in my laundry room.  I use it for drying the many items that cannot go in the dryer.  I love the versatility of the racks for drying things on hangers or items that must be dried flat.</li>
            <li> It seems like good quality and it folds up nice. You can fit many things on it. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a great foldable drying rack, the wings can be adjusted to your liking and saves a lot of space in storage. The stainless steel design is sturdy and will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> I like to keep my shoes in good condition and to do that I sometimes run them through the wash.  With my tumble dryer, there is no way I could dry them in there, so it&#x27;s awesome to see the shoe holders on this [[ASIN:B00QG9LOM2 Heavy Duty Adjustable Gullwing Style Clothes Drying Rack by Ohuhu]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not just limited to shoes, this rack is great for my hang dry sweaters, and other garments that just can&#x27;t go in the dryer.  There is plenty of room on this rack and it adjusts to so many different positions to accommodate my drying needs.  I can dry flat if needed, hang dry, drip dry, and more.  When I&#x27;m done, the unit folds up flat so I can put it behind the door or under a bed.  I love the quality of this rack and love it&#x27;s versatile uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Review Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
            <li> The design is very functional. However, the metallic material is thin, but the thing that is more of a concern is the plastic that holds these metallic rods is even flimsier (the lower section bars and those that support the top bars are weak links). To me this is only for indoor air drying (direct sunlight will make the plastic brittle) and need extra care while handling. The good part is that I haven&#x27;t seen any sign of rust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently increased the rating by 1 star because of the great customer service.</li>
            <li> This is easy and fun to use.  Made of stainless steel and sturdy plastic joints, it will not rust even if you put it in the open. It folds and unfolds without effort.  When folded, it lies flat for minimal storage space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife loves it!  It is great for smaller clothing and accessories like undies, socks, scarfs and more.  This is also great for those that is only hang dry.  It even has shoe drying racks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful on windy days.  You may want to tie and anchor it if you put it outside on windy days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: Sample item was provided for this review.</li>
            <li> This works great! Holds a lot of laundry, folds up and down easily and is very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Sturdy but haven&#x27;t used it yet</li>
            <li> Just like I wanted.  Well made.</li>
            <li> We love the ease of use, looks, and practicality of this rack.  However, we bought this rack as a gift for someone to use for her salt-water pool in Florida, and within 3 days of use, rust spots appeared on the bottom of the A frame.  10 days later rust has speckled most of the lower portion.  Despite the stainless steel, this product is NOT rust proof, and clearly not meant to dry salt-water-exposed items.  Perhaps Ohuhu should warn customers of this fact in the product description.</li>
            <li> I love this rack.  It&#x27;s heavy duty and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;ll tip over if I hang a heavy towel on one side only.  I&#x27;ve only used it in one position but I like knowing that I can adjust it if need be.  I plan to use it for beach/pool towels and swimsuits mostly.  It&#x27;s in my sunroom but I will probably move it outside once my patio is complete.  I like the shoe racks also.  I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d need them but my kids put their water shoes on there.</li>
            <li> This is saving us money on utility bills and is super convenient to use even in a small laundry room. Finally a place to dry sweaters!</li>
            <li> This light weight drying rack is sturdy and holds a lot of clothes. Because it&#x27;s aluminum the clothes slide easily on&lt;br /&gt;the racks as opposed to the wooden racks where clothes can get snagged. This is a great product.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:60163e899cfe17ec8fbfcf578f4d9dee]]Many people are now trying to be eco-friendly and are heading back to several tried and true old-fashioned methods of conserving energy.  Decades ago there weren&#x27;t dryers and we all hung clothes out to dry.  I used to use a circular clothesline and now my son is following suit and doing the same thing.  I also have a couple of small clothes racks, one metal and one wooden, that I&#x27;ve used from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem with the smaller ones is that they cannot hold a heavy load.  My first thought after taking a look at the Ohuhu drying rack was that I was going to see if it could hold heavier items.  Of course the rack can be used for several other things, but could it cut the mustard with a pile of laundry?  I washed up a couple of loads of towels and throw rugs, which are not only heavy, but awkward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no directions with the Ohuhu, simply because it&#x27;s an intuitive rack.  I just pulled it up, snapped it into place, and then flipped up a small loose plastic grab and secured that as well.  I started piling those towels and rugs onto the rack, not even thinking about balancing them.  The rack didn&#x27;t tilt nor did it fall over.  I got quite a load of three rugs and several towels loaded onto the rack without problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was rather amazed at the capacity and the sturdiness of the rack.  Once I was done with it, it folded up flat again.  No one has room for a rack that large, but folded up it can go into a closet or under a bed.  There are even room on the rack for a couple of pairs of shoes.  How good can it get?  The design is awesome and it&#x27;s one of the most useful household products I&#x27;ve had it ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> This drying rack is perfect for my needs.  I like in a small house so the space saving aspect of this drying rack is great.  I love the fact that it is lightweight and portable.  I use it both inside and outside.</li>
            <li> Nicely built product.  Would give it 4 stars if product was about 4 inches wider.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, easy to set up, can dry a good sized load.  Doesn&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
            <li> Love the way it looks, and the fact that its so cheap. It is also light weight and easy to set up. The size makes it portable, hence easy to fit in your car and carry to different locations which might need you to dry your clothes. Great product in all!</li>
            <li> Ohuhu® Heavy Duty Gullwing Drying Rack is a nice and sturdy drying rack. Right out of the box, it is already ready to use (it&#x27;s pre-assembled, and just need to be unfolded). This drying rack does its job and dry my clothes that I don&#x27;t want to put in the dryer. You can also use this drying rack to store/hang clothes if you are out of space in your closet. This rack is adjustable so the &amp;#34;wing&amp;#34; side can be made taller to accommodate bigger/longer clothes like work shirts, sports jersey or jeans so it won&#x27;t touch the ground if hanged at the highest bars (though it will be nice if it can be adjusted even higher/taller to accommodate most clothes). One thing that can be improved are the plastic connectors which can be made more solid (maybe use aluminum instead of plastic) to ensure durability especially when we adjust the angle/height of the &amp;#34;wing&amp;#34; often. Thanks Ohuhu for sending this sample product.</li>
            <li> The best clothes drying I&#x27;ve ever used next to hanging clothes outside to air dry.  Folds down for small spaces and is easy to store.</li>
            <li> The Ohuhu Heavy Duty Drying Rack is perfect for  our needs, which is to have a sturdy spot to dry our towels and swimwear after swimming.  This is a fairly large stand, and like the title states, heavy duty.  It&#x27;s not like one of those cheap foldable hanging racks that knock over at the slightest breeze.  This drying rack is quite substantial and is absolutely perfect for our needs.  It&#x27;s heavy, but not too heavy that I can&#x27;t easily cart it around, and it has plenty of places to hang towels and swimwear.  Very happy with this drying rack!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Victoria Franks</li>
            <li> I like to hang my work shirts, bras, and pantyhose to dry instead of putting them through the dryer. I&#x27;d been using the shower curtain rod, towel racks, etc., in my second bathroom to hang things to dry, but this wasn&#x27;t an ideal solution. I had to cram things together to fit them in there, which made it take longer to dry items. So I was happy to try this rack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rack is easy to use and somewhat adjustable (depending on where you snap the support arms, you can raise/lower the top racks a bit). It is not high enough to hang a pair of pants from the waistband, but you could dry pants folded over one of the bars. Many shirts should hang from hangers without touching the floor. Pantyhose, lingerie, bathing suits, etc., should be able to hang dry with no trouble at all. You could even dry a fairly thick sweater without stretching it out by laying it over the top rack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually came up with another use for my rack -- drying makeup brushes. I set the rack up so that the top was basically flat, then covered it with paper towels. I then laid my recently-cleaned makeup brushes on top of the paper towels, perpendicular to the cross-bars on the top rack. It made them dry faster -- water would get absorbed by the paper towels and evaporate from below (which could not happen if the brushes were laid on a counter) and water would also evaporate from the tops of the brushes. This saved me a lot of time and counter space!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rack folds up into a fairly compact structure for easy storage. It&#x27;s reasonably lightweight and fairly sturdy. Mine did come with one plastic piece broken (the attachment to one of the support arms, where it clips to the cross-bars of the top rack), but I am still able to use it with that piece broken. I will probably just tape or glue it back together rather than replacing the rack, since the rack is still functional despite the breakage. I may not hang anything heavy on that side, though, just to be safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely appreciate that this involves no assembly and that you can fold it up. It makes the job of drying my delicate items much easier and I&#x27;ve managed to find some unconventional uses for it, as well. Definitely happy with this. (Please note: this does not come with any instructions.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the manufacturer for evaluation purposes.nitely appreciate that this involves no assembly and that you can fold it up.

            <li> I purchased this for my mother, she had not stopped talking about how much she likes it. She is in her 70&#x27;s and said its very easy to manipulate and there was no set up. We are very pleased with the purchase</li>
            <li> Plastic connectors are very cheaply made. One was already broken out of the box! We are returning for a refund. That should be no problem.</li>
            <li> Too small to hang an average sized shirt or a pair of jeans.</li>
            <li> Worst product ever - Doesnt deserve 1 star but I cant review with selecting at least one star.&lt;br /&gt;While the this rack is big and allows you to dry a multitude of items,  the rods are not securely fastened to the rack. I have had 3 rods fall off. I emailed the Seller a week ago and have yet to hear back from the Seller. There is a little blue connector/cap that connects the rod to the rack. 2 of  them have broken and and rod cant be affixed to the rack without it.  I hope the Seller will read this review and get back to me with some replacement connector pieces. Here is a pic of one of the lose bar with the broken connector piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 08/04/15  I never heard  from the Seller about replacing the rod despite me emailing them several time.&lt;br /&gt;Update 12/15/15  Another connector piece broke and now only one end extends. I now have a lopsided drying rack.&lt;br /&gt;Update 03/16/16  3 more rods have fallen off of the rack and one of the extending arms to lift the top rack has broken. So now the rack is lop sided.</li>
            <li> good product I like it.</li>
            <li> So many of today&#x27;s garments are made with either delicate fabrics or knit, stretchy, material and using a dryer can quickly ruin them.  Too much heat causes shrinkage and can also fade out the fabric’s colors a lot sooner making your garments looking old when they are actually still fairly new. So how you handle your laundry is important. Taking time to protect the things you have purchased saves time and money in the long run. After all who has time or money to just waste away?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When doing your laundry carefully sort out items that will not do well in the dryer. Using a clothing rack to hang the wet laundry on will work great. It is sort of the modern day version of the old- fashioned clothesline but it works well to protect those special pieces of clothing. There are several different styles available but this drying rack made by Ohuhu that is heavy duty so it will hold up to heavier wet garments. It is stainless steel and will not rust and has two shoe holders located on the side, a great feature for drying gym shoes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For convenience it is easy to setup and take down. It folds flat for easy storage. Fully assembled it is a spacious 50”x18” x 35.5” for drying space yet it folds to only 39.4” x 3.9”x20”. The side wings can be adjusted upward allowing for hanging of larger garments on hangers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Air-drying saves energy and is better for our environment. Sounds like a win-win deal all around. With a full 12-month warranty and a 30-day money back guarantee you will certainly be satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:e090eeb25a4c611841adf16ab71700fc]] I don&#x27;t care what your EnergyStar rating is; I guarantee that your washer-drier pair is your most inefficient electricity burner in your house. If, like me, you&#x27;re trying to reduce your waste and carbon consumption, hand-washing and hang-drying your clothing is the way to start. But that means you need a decent drying rack to get the water off your hand-washed clothing. Acknowledgements to the manufacturer for making the product available for review.</li>
            <li> What a relief this sturdy drying rack is, rather than my old wobbly one with the rods popping out. I wish that the rods on the Ohuhu were a tad longer so that I could dry shirts with them at their full width rather than scrunched up. This rack is heavy and might be unwieldy for someone who is physically challenged. I like it. I think it might be too big if I move into a smaller apartment, though.</li>
            <li> Works great! We use it every day. Good quality!</li>
            <li> Does what I wanted it to do. It allows me to hang my towels, socks, etc in the garage to dry. Now I don&#x27;t have to use the dryer as often and this saves money on my electric bill. It holds more clothes than I thought it would.</li>
            <li> Good quality, but it is a little more lightweight than I expected it to be. One good wind and it would tip over.  Also, the bars holding up the side flaps don&#x27;t fit really well either.  Other than these things, it works really well however and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was quite enthusiastic when I bought this product, thinking it would have been nice to have a sturdy, metal clothes rack. Well, as I opened the package yesterday the metal pieces started falling off their plastic hinges. I thought &amp;#34;It&#x27;s probably because it&#x27;s just out of the package&amp;#34;. So, I reassembled it and closed it. But as soon as I closed it, another piece came off. And I put it back on. Closed. Then today I wanted to put it outside for clothes to dry and as I opened it the small pieces from the bottom all came out from the hinges of one side. So, again, I put it back together, trying to balance it. And I closed it. And when I closed it those piece came off the hinges of one side again. And in all of this I hadn&#x27;t even put one sock to dry on it.&lt;br /&gt;Moral: I am not happy and I will send it back. It was pricy and not at all stable.&lt;br /&gt;From previous reviews I was expecting something better. Very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope in the future Ohuhu can provide products that are more functioning.</li>
            <li> Well designed and built.  No complaints. It does the job.</li>
            <li> This rack is very easy to use.  We are using it for our pool.  It is awesome.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, it&#x27;s easy to set up, and it sits politely out of the way on non-laundry days. The serrated plastic things are surprisingly handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t miss the dryer like I thought I would. The rack does not buzz at me for attention, nor does it have a lint filter to clean.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use a measuring tape to figure out what to expect, but I can say that this rack was larger than I expected.  It has plenty of room for a full load of washing and folds up to be very compact.  My favorite thing about it is that the rods that hold the clothes are inserted into the frame, which makes it a lot sturdier than other racks where smaller rods are only spot-welded on.  I would wholeheartedly recommend this rack.  The materials help ensure I don&#x27;t have to worry about rust, and it seems very sturdy in general, so I anticipate getting a lot of use out of it.  I would definitely purchase this one again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting to hear back from Customer Service, but it&#x27;s been 4 days. I purchased this rack because it was called heavy duty but when I removed it from the box one of the essential plastic clips broke. The metal frame is sturdy but the plastic is insubstantial and cheap.</li>
            <li> $40.00 is an excellent value for the rack.  I bought 2, 1 for outside and 1 for my laundry room.  They are good quality, I have used mine every day since I bought them.  Sure beats the wood shelf that I used for years.</li>
            <li> Ok I don&#x27;t think anyone likes doing laundry so anything that can somehow make things a little easier are more than welcome.  This is a very cool clothes drying rack that my wife loves.  She tried it out as soon as we got it to dry clothes outside.  She was using a tall and unwieldy to move garment rack that we keep in the garage.  First off, what makes this rack so great is that it completely folds up.  When folded it is just over three feet tall and a few inches wide meaning it is so thin it can be put behind a door, out of the way.  It weighs just 10 lbs.  So it is very easy for one person to move around, car easier than our old garment rack which will be scrapped!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use you just fold out the arms and legs (for lack of a better term.)  when assembled it is a full 50&amp;#34; wide and 3 feet tall.  Each side has several rungs to which you can hang several hangers of clothes.  the ends of both sides have a plastic rod on them with numerous little teeth or slots.  these slots can be used to hang things like socks, bras, and other more delicate items that you don&#x27;t normally put on hangers.  The bottom legs also feature two pairs of shoe hangers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The arms are adjustable so they can be raised or lowered.  Now matter where you put the arms this unit is very sturdy and can handle a lot of wieght.  of course with the arms up you have to make sure you have both ends balanced so it doesn&#x27;t tip over.  the light weight and storage friendly nature of this item also makes it well suited to take on camping trips.  Great item</li>
            <li> If you are Tinkerbelle, or some other fairy or sprite, and you have a collection of fine lace hankies about an inch square, which weigh less than a hummingbird&#x27;s eyelash, and you hand washed those lace hankies, and don&#x27;t want to hang them on little branches in the forest because the hankies will get tree resin on them, then this is a good drying rack for you.  However, if you are a standard-sized human being, and you wash things like towels and sheets and blue jeans, this is not the drying rack for you.  I was taking it out of the box and the plastic hardware broke, rendering the entire structure useless.  I sent it back. Spend a little more and get something substantial.</li>
            <li> Decent dry rack sometime the poles pop out, not the major ones but the smaller ones that need to be moved when folding it up. Poles pop in just as easily so it is not a huge deal. folds nicely for storage.</li>
            <li> This is a sturdy, dependable and stylish drying rack.  It easy folds up and stashed away out of sight.</li>
            <li> very nice rack and it works great</li>
            <li> Offers a lot of space to store your clothes for drying, the foldabl design makes convenient storage space and easy to setup whenever required.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Exactly what we needed.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I am able to hang ALOT of laundry. It doesn&#x27;t take much space.&lt;br /&gt;The product is constructed robust and all hinges are covered to child proof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again from this merchant.&lt;br /&gt;Love this item. ♥&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> Have unpacked it but haven&#x27;t used it yet. Looks okay.</li>
            <li> Arrived broken. Clearly not &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34;. The plastic is cheaply made and affixed to the metal frame.</li>
            <li> Love this rack.  It is easy to handle and opens in just a matter of seconds.  Folds for storing purposes.  Great for drying your delicate washables.  Sturdy and reliable, and very economical, as well.  A definite &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; in your home.</li>
            <li> The rack was not wide enough</li>
            <li> Very dependable and I believe we can really save some money for the gas bill. Thank you,I just hope I bought 2 of them.</li>
            <li> We live full time in our 5th wheel toy hauler and I have a small portable washer. This works  great for a quick dry rack or for hanging out a load of clothes. Only used it 4 times so far but it works great, assembles easily to different heights /angles for drying dresses out or longer clothes like towels.</li>
            <li> Easy to set up- holds a lot</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for, the average vertical drying racks wore out quickly and could not support the multitude of jeans my family has but this rack is very sturdy and has more room than you think. I can fit about two loads of laundry on it and of course wet shoes when I need to. It&#x27;s a little big to use indoors but if you have the space it&#x27;s worth it. It was shipped sooner than expected and in good conditions. If I was unhappy with it&#x27;s condition I was also given a follow-up email offering a free replacement. Great customer service</li>
            <li> The unit works great...</li>
            <li> Good enough for the price. could be better.</li>
            <li> The drying rack arrived promptly, and in good condition. It is sturdy, and provides many options.</li>
            <li> Well designed and well made. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> It has it pluses in that it offers a lot of area to hand clothing, but so much of the supports and holders are cheap plastic. I broke one of the plastic supports the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> would have given 5 stars however one of the support rods was bent and one of the main rods was dented. Poor packaging, good product.</li>
            <li> Love it. .  Perfect for the RV.</li>
            <li> Durable and efficient.</li>
            <li> Love the quality and construction of this.</li>
            <li> A total rip off for the price! I paid $50 for it and it&#x27;s not worth it. I saw one at Costco for half the price and better. It even has another high bar to hang clothing. This one has less space to hang and double the price. I don&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> It seems to be doing what it is designed to do! Great job!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this! We had a flimsy drying rack from Target, or somewhere similar, and it broke down over a year ago. Our dryer recently stopped working so I finally got around to purchasing a new drying rack but went to Amazon for a sturdier version. This does not disappoint! It is very sturdy and can fit a good amount of clothing, or cloth diapers, on it. It&#x27;s great for indoor or outdoor use though I wouldn&#x27;t recommend leaving it outside all the time as you can do with some lines. I look forward to having a working dryer again but will continue using this for delicates and our cloth diapers.</li>
            <li> 1st rack had only one bent tube. 2nd rack has two bent tubes (metal spokes). The second one is useable. Hopeful the small bent spoke will hold up.&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend that you do not use this company, I paid more because I thought I would get QUALITY. I would like to be reimbursed for some of my agrivation and time shipping etc.</li>

Amazing capacityto take load  and the rack is very  sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.It can be easily foldable when not being used and compact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.It is adjustable in a variety of ways. You can lower one or both sides, a storage space in the middle which can be used for small clothes. There are two shoe racks at the bottom of each main leg.&lt;br /&gt;4.Great qyuality and since it is made of  stainless steel, except for the plastic support and plastic covering pieces means its is strong and will not be easily damaged.&lt;br /&gt;5.Its very light weighted.&lt;br /&gt;6.Shoe holders. Since we swim in a lot of waterfall areas we use water shoes&lt;br /&gt;7.Drying clothing in rack also saves clothings items from being damaged.&lt;br /&gt;8.Teeth on either end  rack for hanging delicates  and its very handy .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this product is well designed and extremely helpful and i am so happy to recieve this for testing/review purposes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much the one I had seen at my friends house in Germany but they have it about twice as wide. This one is very small</li>
            <li> This takes drying racks to a whole new level. Right out of the box it was clear; this is so easy to use and so sturdy. This solves so many problems with normal straight wire drying racks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is incredibly handsome - the sky blue plastic and stainless steel look wonderful. If you pulled this out on your boat, or balcony, or backyard, you would never be embarrassed with the look. In a good way, the rack looks European. I could easily picture this on a balcony in a European home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After thinking about this for a short while, it became clear this rack is useful for a lot of people: college, camping (not rustic camping but drive up campsites), beach house, boat, balcony in the city, backyard, art project drying, laundry room, or the deck. If you really wanted to get rid of the dryer and you lived alone, this is the perfect drying rack. This could easily replace the dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is such a sturdy rack. A lot of racks will tip over if you overload one side, not this rack. Everything is designed so that it is very difficult to tip over no matter how much you load up one side. Setting it up is so easy - spread open the two legs, the center small rack locks in place and keeps this stable on the floor. Then lift either wing up to the angle you want, because the center hinge has some friction, the wings stay exactly where you put them (what a great feature compared to those darn wire racks). Finally, lift up the support bar, snap the blue plastic holder in place, and then swing up the blue plastic lock. It takes more time to explain it than it does to set it up. With the wings flat, I was able to put a pair of wet jeans on the end bar - the rack did not tip over. Almost every rack I&#x27;ve ever seen falls over if you do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Folding the rack is super-fast. Release the two blue locking clips, pull up on the wing, the support arm will fall down, push the wings down, now lift up the center rack to release the two sides, and fold the whole thing up. It takes around 30 seconds to fold up, it is that easy. The whole rack has exactly the right weight - not too heavy and not too light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe how many pieces of clothing fit on this. I was able to put just about a full laundry load on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is an ingenious clip that took me some time to figure out. These three clips are a series of plastic loops that will hold things tightly. The clips can be moved to any of the bars. These things are brilliant - the clip will hold hangers in place so you can hang 6 to 10 shirts on one side of the rack. They clips will hold hosiery, underwear, athletic shorts, socks, kitchen towels, wash cloths - anything that can be pressed between the loops. The advantage of these hooks - things will not blow away in the wind. And they eliminate the need for clothes pins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The four blue clips on the bottom, I haven&#x27;t really figured out yet. They work well for shoes - you can hang two pairs of shoes on them. It seems like a lot of engineering for shoes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you get the idea that I love this rack? Yeah - it is truly amazing. Ikea sells a white wire rack for around $15. That thing is utilitarian and kind of works. At the time of writing this review, the Ohuhu rack costs around $35. The rack is a little pricey, but after using it, the thing is worth every single penny of that more premium price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a review sample.ing up.

            <li> Love it!!! Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> As described.  Made of quality materials and very sturdy. Different configurations are a plus.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, multi level, delightful way to bring the sunshine freshness to your laundry.</li>
            <li> I love this drying rack. I&#x27;ve been trying to be more energy friendly, so I searched for one that was light, wouldn&#x27;t rust, and was big enough for a small load of laundry. This has a pretty flexible design, it&#x27;s easy to set up and take down, and its folded state is small enough to fit in pretty tight spaces. I live in an Airstream so this is perfect for my lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the shoe stems are unnecessary so I just took them off to give me more room. I would love to see them make a stackable version so I can have two of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this in combination with the Scrubba Wash Bag for small loads, washing machine for bigger ones.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, light, big enough for many clothes. Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in this overly expensive drying rack.  One of the side &amp;#34;wings&amp;#34; broke after a month and the blue plastic pieces are poorly made.  They have sharp edges that make pulls on your clothes when you take your them off the rack.  Steer clear of this rack and save your money.  You&#x27;d be better off with any of the Whitmor racks!</li>
            <li> One of the bars was too short and missing blue plastic ring so the bar keeps falling off. Had to just use tape to keep it in place. Also had some other plastic blue rings already broken after 1 use.  Product could be better</li>
            <li> LOVE it! It&#x27;s so strong, and I can hang so many clothes on it. I adore the shoe drying handles, needed those and didn&#x27;t know it came with them! I love how you can adjust the height of the arms for taller items, and a base for stocky things. Overall, it&#x27;s MUCH better than my old wooden drying rack that would collapse with any weight. I give it an A+</li>
            <li> Only used it once but it seems much better built then anything dryer rack i have owned before</li>
            <li> Delivered expediently! A great product / exceeded our expectations. The wife put it to work right away :-).</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful, easy to use drying rack. Folds up quickly and holds a load of towels. Saves electricity(money) and helps the environment. I can&#x27;t say enough how much I like this rack. No assembly and stores in a very small area.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:edf4c8e326b2ce77c19b4a3b31a7ffe3]] The Ohuhu® Heavy Duty Adjustable Rust-proof Stainless Steel Gullwing Style Clothes Drying Rack will make your laundry chores much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first saw this, I was not sure how helpful it would be for my wife.  But she absolutely loves it.  I don&#x27;t think she can imagine how she would get along without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some of the really neat features:&lt;br /&gt;It is all stainless steel, except for the plastic support and plastic covering pieces.  This means that there is never a chance for rust that could damage your clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is adjustable in a variety of ways.  You can lower one or both sides.  Even with both sides lowered, you have a small storage space in the middle.  The entire rack will collapse into a very small footprint for storage.  (My wife has not taken advantage of this - she literally uses it all the time for hanging clothes, organizing laundry, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two shoe racks at the bottom of each main leg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clothes rack is very sturdy.  There are adjustable support arms that keep the rack sturdy and secure.&lt;br /&gt;You can use it to sort, fold, and hold garments that have been washed and dried.  You can use it as a drying rack for hand washed items, such as sweaters.  My wife also uses it as a collection point for items to be ironed - hanging them on one end and hanging the completed items on the other end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have a dedicated laundry table - and most people do not - this is a very handy, well priced rack.  Lots of features and folds up for easy storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife really has found it extremely useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for testing/review purposes.</li>
            <li> I specifically bought this drying rack because not only was it stainless steel, but it was narrow enough to fit in my tub.  I hand wash all of my bras and a few shirts and I really needed a drying rack to make it easier.  I used to hang some of my clothes on the curtain rod, which I hated to do because water would drip on the floor, but with this drying rack I am able to set it up in the bathtub and I can open one side to dry my clothes.  This drying rack is bigger than I thought it was going to be, but that&#x27;s o.k. because if I have to dry a runner rug outside I can set this up outside.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! No assembly required and is easy to open and fold away. Takes up very little space and fits a lot of clothes to&lt;br /&gt;air dry. I use it outside and let the clothes air dry in the sun. Wish I had this sooner!&lt;br /&gt;PPP</li>
            <li> So simple and easy to use. High quality and spacious.</li>
            <li> Love this thing! Only issue is that one of the plugs that helps keep the bars in place was not there on arrival. I needed it right away and decided to compromise with some caulk. Worked like a charm and I&#x27;m happy happy!</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife so she could dry her inner wear, and socks. This has been a pleasant gift to her since she uses it so often. Plus its not too big so doesn&#x27;t occupy much of the garden area. Its easy to set up.</li>
            <li> Not bad, but not that good either</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.  Lots of room.  &amp;#34;Assembles&amp;#34; easily.  Love that it folds ups and I can tuck it away.</li>
            <li> Well made, durable.  Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this rack a few times so far, so I can&#x27;t speak to its longevity.  However, so far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The things I like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  It will not rust.  It&#x27;s stainless steel so I don&#x27;t have to worry about rusting.&lt;br /&gt;2.  It&#x27;s heavy duty.  I read some of the reviews saying it&#x27;s flimsy and I&#x27;m wondering if they redid it or something, because one thing this isn&#x27;t is flimsy.  Mine doesn&#x27;t tip over, wobble, droop or anything.  I&#x27;ve hung a load with all sorts of stuff on it and it has held it so far.&lt;br /&gt;3.  It&#x27;s adjustable.  You can easily make it bigger or smaller depending on your needs.  Very easy to do and easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this is a good product that I hope to keep using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample for review.</li>
            <li> Really good stuff ....</li>
            <li> This is very sturdy, the only problem I have with it, is that it isn&#x27;t as wide as I would have liked. I don&#x27;t hang my clothes on a hanger, I lay them over the rack. This is the only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5.</li>
            <li> The Ohuhu heavy duty drying rack is wonderful. Lightweight, but steady and sturdy, easy to store, convenient to use. I remember the days of the old wooden racks, hard to set up, wobbly, the smooth stainless steel rods make this ideal for drying sweaters. The snaps are great for socks, delicate items, etc. Those labels that say machine wash, lay flat to dry- no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but don&#x27;t limit it to the garage for the occasional sweater drying palooza. Because of the it&#x27;s flat fold and portability, it&#x27;s perfect for camping, for the beach, for an RV. I don&#x27;t know why beach hotels, B&amp;Bs etc don&#x27;t have places to hang bathing gear but they never seem to. The Ohuhu drying rack is perfect after a day of swimming or rafting. It&#x27;s a good size but not huge and could be tucked into the corner of a room or put on the balcony.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would also be good if you live in a restricted community that doesn&#x27;t allow clotheslines, you could buy one or two and set them out, put away when clothes are dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an attractive, sturdy, lightweight dryer that can be used for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sample provided for review</li>
            <li> had a pair of shoes and a towel on it and came home to find it broken - a plastic hinge snapped. not heavy duty</li>
            <li> After struggling with the cheap wooden drying racks, I found this metal version.  It is very sturdy while still setting up and collapsing easily for storage.  I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly, packaged just right.  I love this clothes drying rack and have used it to dry swimwear and towels, a full load of clothes, and even to air out my feather bed.  It fits perfectly on my porch and stores away nicely.  So glad I purchased this product!!!</li>
            <li> VERY CAREFULLY OPEN THIS PRODUCT&amp;#62; IF ANYTHING IN THE BOX RATTLES&amp;#60; SEND IT BACK BECAUSE WHEN THIS PIECE IS INTACT AND OPENED CAREFULLY IT IS FANTASTIC</li>
            <li> Was broken when we got it and seemed flimsy for the money.  Sent it back.</li>
            <li> This rack can be configured in so many ways.&lt;br /&gt;It can&#x27;t be compared to the ones you find at big box stores, this one is in a class all by itself.&lt;br /&gt;Out of the box, just snip the zip ties and unfold in any way you like. The weight is substantial enough to have one wing out and the other down.&lt;br /&gt;Keep the wings up and a garment on a hanger can be hung.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month, and still love it. Right now it is poolside holding wet towels.&lt;br /&gt;Folds flat for storage. Slide it under the bed or in a closet.&lt;br /&gt;The best drying rack you&#x27;ll ever own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE : Product received to test with the option to review. No financial compensation is EVER accepted, and vendor may request that item be returned. I</li>
            <li> Some what disappointed with this product since it cost so much.&lt;br /&gt;It gets the job done but it is not as sturdy as  I expected.</li>
            <li> Love it! Built well and perfect for drying my delicates!</li>
            <li> One of the odd things I miss from my childhood is having a closeline in our backyard.  Even as a child I truly loved when my mother would air dry our clothes and sheets. Nowadays I enjoy it for even more reasons.  Air drying clothing is not only better for fabrics themselves but for your utilities as well.  The Ohuhu® Heavy Duty Gullwing Drying Rack caught my eye right away as it comes in a really awesome compact shape for storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rack quickly and easily expands out for a large drying area. It can be used indoors or outside so during the cold months, we can use it inside our home and then outside when it&#x27;s warmer.  very durable and sturdy regardless of where you choose to use it.  Right now we have it stored in our laundry room and we pull it out to the back deck on laundry days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the added four shoe holders for those wet shoes to help dry quicker!  I LOVE not having to run my dryer constantly!  This has been more than convenient and even my difficult husband set in his non-green friendly ways, loves it!  It&#x27;s very sturdy and definitely seems worth the cost and then some.  I do still use a clothesline now where I live but this helps for the smaller items or loads and is much more convenient than heading all the way outside on certain days!</li>
            <li> It looks wonderful!  Very large and strong.</li>
            <li> I love it! It is sturdy and has lots of room and options to hang your clothes, shoes , or whatever.</li>
            <li> I took the drying rack on our camping trip with the family and it was a hit!!! Better than hanging a close line between trees for the whole camp grounds to see. Perfect product, very useful.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy. Withstood the wind in Florida. Easy to set up and take down. Excellent quality. compact for storage</li>
            <li> Love this drying rack. Sturdy &amp; flexible.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty. Easy to set up. I bought the original style, not heavy duty as a used item. The original came with a part missing so I returned it and decided to get this one instead. The return was easy and I like this one better anyway.&lt;br /&gt;  Followup- I used this drying rack for the first time over the weekend.  Holds a ton of clothes, easy to set up and put away.  There are little rubber/plastic gadgets attached to the very ends of the gull wings that you can hang hangers for drying or to hand your clothes as you are tranferring everything to hangers.  I also used those things to hang things like bras by the straps.  I think I am going to really enjoy this thing!&lt;br /&gt;  Also the return of the first, used product was flawless and painless.  Never had to return anything to Amazon, so I was thankful</li>
            <li> Works great and folds up so it does not take up much room.  Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> We are very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The rack is super sturdy with a smart design. I hang anything on it when I want them dry naturally, clothes or food. It all worked out. I would rate it 5 stars</li>
            <li> Solid and functional dryer, has hooks for shooes, folds compactly for convenient storage.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> My shirts &amp; towels don&#x27;t fit across the rails. It&#x27;s a nice quality product, but it&#x27;s just way too skinny for my wash loads. I didn&#x27;t realize this in the product description, thought these drying racks were all a standard size</li>
            <li> This is very sturdy and hold a lot of clothes! Very easy to set up and take down. Folds down to about 3 inches wide for storate. When open it is large - so check measurements carefully if you are worried about space.</li>
            <li> Love it, Love it, Love it,  Purchased it to be able to dry sweaters after washing in the machine. Big enough to dry 3 women&#x27;s cashmere sweaters flat; one on each wing and one on the bottom rack. So simple and easy to set up, dry overnight, fold up in the morning and slide it neatly into a closet. It would be great if the company came up with a tight stretch mesh screen that could stretch over the wings when opened to be able avoid the bar marks on the sweaters. Even without the screen, it&#x27;s a terrific drying rack, a good shake of the sweaters usually takes care of the bar marks, but it would be a good addition.&lt;br /&gt;I use it for sweaters only, but there are many options for drying other items including 2 pairs of running shoes.&lt;br /&gt;I did a lot of comparing before I bought it. For the price, the size, the construction, the ease of set-up and storage, and the convenience of having&lt;br /&gt;Amazon deliver it to your door, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is such a sturdy rack.</li>
            <li> This is sturdy and light.  Perfect for drying our winter ski apparel.</li>
            <li> Love this!  Can use it inside or outside and it has places to dry shoes!</li>
            <li> This rack is sturdy but lightweight, takes lots of clothes.</li>
            <li> I like the rack but it is too narrow to dry a bath towel.  I really like the adjustable racks and sturdiness of this drying rack.  It would be much more useful though if it was about 4 inches wider.</li>
            <li> one of the two broke on assembly and there were no directions to complete.&lt;br /&gt;I need a refund  or replacement</li>
            <li> This is a great product! Light weight and can fold down for portability. We love it!</li>
            <li> Not qute what I expected, but I&#x27;m getting used to it.  oodquality.</li>
