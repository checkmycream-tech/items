            <li> After trying several other products I couldn&#x27;t wait to have it back again.</li>
            <li> My hair used to be dry, tangly, and was breaking.  </li>
            <li> I have course and wavy hair that gets very dry.</li>
            <li> This product is worth every penny, expensive as it is.</li>
            <li> I have long thick coarse hair and this shampoo does wonders for me!</li>
            <li> A gentleman sitting behind me in a meeting asked what I used on my hair as it looked \\&quot;good\\&quot;; he was wanting something for his six year old daughter who has somewhat dry, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> It lathers up with only a small amount, and using the shampoo has made my hair feel healthier.</li>
            <li> Not worth even 1/4 the price.</li>
            <li> Never weighs it down</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I believe both of these items are fake products. I am going to contact Eufora to see what they say. I have used these products in the past and they do not respond like this.</li>
            <li> This product is worth every penny, expensive as it is. It was given to me by a professional and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since. Noticeable difference when I don&#x27;t have access to it.</li>
            <li> The smaller container and the expense was a turn-off for me--until I used the shampoo.  It lathers up with only a small amount, and using the shampoo has made my hair feel healthier. I&#x27;ve decided to save my haircut money and spend it on this shampoo and let my hair grow out.</li>
            <li> FAKE! The product looks like the real one but contents inside are not the real thing. Not worth even 1/4 the price.</li>
            <li> All other shampoos have been spoiled for me! I have course and wavy hair that gets very dry. Used in combination with the Eufora Beautifying Serum, I have soft and shiny hair now with no frizz. Even if you think this shampoo is on the expensive side, I think its well worth knowing that you have a product you can rely on to make you look consistently great. I agree with some of the other reviewers that I now never have a bad hair day. I just ordered this from amazon for the first time and it hasn&#x27;t arrived yet - I hope its the real deal like I&#x27;ve purchased in salons.</li>
            <li> Shipping awesome ordered at noon one day here the next day.. Process quick and easy  I will order again soon. I&#x27;ve tried the shampoo already and it works great on dry lifeless hair.  Really brings back life</li>
            <li> I received this item and was anxious to try it. However, it appears that the bottle has been used because it is dirty and I am not sure if it was already opened. Did anyone else have this experience?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and ran out. After trying several other products I couldn&#x27;t wait to have it back again. It really make a difference. I use it with the conditioner. It works for me.</li>
            <li> This shampoo doesn&#x27;t leave residue, rinses clean.  It is great for my sensitive scalp.  Cheap shampoos leave little bumps on my head.  This is great smelling too.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It has improved my hair condition tenfold.  My hair used to be dry, tangly, and was breaking.  My hairdresser recommended the shampoo and conditioner.  I used to use Pantene.  This, of course, is more costly than the Pantene, but my hair looks great.  I am 68, and my shoulder-length hair looks great.  I get complimented all the time.</li>
            <li> My teenage son uses this daily. He has combo hair and still has cradle cap. This has been helping to get rid of the cradle cap, and it keeps the flakes at bay (he has thick dark hair). This shampoo works the best out of all that he has tried. I am so glad that we can still get Eufora thru Amazon since our local salon decided not to carry this brand anymore. Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> LOVE this shampoo.  You do not need to use a lot and it rinses out completely.  Leave my curly hair manageable.</li>
            <li> I returned it.  Wrong product for me.  Some how this product was sent to me even though I am sure I ordered a different one.</li>
            <li> I have used Eufora products for years.  They are all great,  The moisture cleanse is my daily with urgent repair occasionally.  My hair is heavily highlighted so needs moisture.  Never weighs it down it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo! It&#x27;s excellent for my fine, long hair. I usually use this and one other shampoo and rotate them.</li>

            <li> Corresponded to description, received promptly-same as what i had been buying elsewhere. Had hoped price would be better.  have nothing more to say it is just shampoo</li>
            <li> This coupled with the Moisture Solution Conditioner is perfect for my long, layered, color-treated hair.  My ends are smooth, soft and my hair smells fresh.

Made my day.</li>
            <li> Super Great Product and Service!!!!!!!!! :)</li>
            <li> I love Eufora.  As I said about the conditioner, I have never had a bad hair day with this product.  Aloe vera based instead of water.</li>
