            <li>They both really loved it.</li>
            <li>This is the point at which death begins to seem like a good alternative to the pain you&#x27;re in.</li>
            <li>Upon opening the box in the company of a friend, we immediately laughed, called it the \\&quot;death bed,\\&quot; and I planned on returning it.</li>
            <li>I still haven&#x27;t reached the point where I can use it without a shirt, but that&#x27;s okay because it feels great</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>

            <li>These things are amazing.</li>

            <li>I really recommend this mat, it&#x27;s great!</li>

            <li>I love it, love it, love it!</li>
            <li>My wife used it the very first night and had great relief , we love it and use it reguarly.</li>
            <li>Its not a cure, but it sure helps with the healing process.</li>
            <li>His complaining seems to have gone away:-)</li>
            <li>I felt so relaxed all day and in harmony with everybody :-)</li>
            <li>and I can feel the blood flow with more ease in my head and neck areas.  </li>
            <li>but once you use it a couple of times you will for sure start to feel the benefits.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions and even gave it more than one try</li>
            <li>There needs to be more written instructions with all the brands</li>
            <li>There needs to be more written instructions with all the brands</li>
            <li>The brand name one cost more than I wanted to pay, so I went online</li>
            <li>All I have to do is lie on my stomach on the mat for 20-30 minutes, and my abdominal area feels much better.</li>
            <li>I would love a chair at work</li>
            <li>I love it, helps me feel more blood flow, the kids like it, I am working out some TMJ and it seems to help,</li>
            <li>I do lay on it on the floor but also used the bed which I think worked better.  </li>
            <li>Better off going for acupunture.</li>
            <li>I spend most of my work hours in front of a computer.</li>
            <li>I love it, had it for a while now</li>
            <li>bearing was okay).</li>
            <li>and he helped raise me off of it too, but I&#x27;m sure I will be able to do that myself now</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about getting this when I ordered it.</li>
            <li>, however I am now so glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li>but you do feel more relaxed after you use it.</li>
            <li>I have slept much better at night</li>
            <li>- I think it puts me in a more relaxed state, making it easier to fall asleep.  </li>
            <li>I love that it comes in a carrying case.  </li>
            <li>Even with three towels on top, it hurt.  </li>
            <li>love this mat.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you have a shirt on , they are quite pokey atfFirst.</li>
            <li>The pad has made it easier for me to become more mobile.</li>
            <li>but I love the way it feels when I either sit on it or lay on it....</li>
            <li>on top of all that, I&#x27;m now a 44-46DDD in bra size.</li>
            <li>maybe more, considering the rates of on-the-job injuries from lifting and moving patients who can&#x27;t move themselves.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t take any more pain killers (non-narcotic or narcotic) for hours, and they weren&#x27;t helping anyway.</li>
            <li>and I knew I couldn&#x27;t take more pills for *</li>
            <li>I used it more toward the coccyx rather than neck area.</li>
            <li>-My love for this grows.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s it what more can I say.</li>
            <li>i saw acupressure mats at bed, bath ad beyond and fell in love.</li>
            <li>(my favorite for headaches)</li>
            <li>The more I use it, the more my nerves seem to wake up.</li>
            <li>Then one day, I came across this product on Amazon, extremely surprised at all the great reviews.</li>
            <li>and it helps relax my body so that I can sleep more sound without all the tossing and turning.</li>
            <li>Really feels good.</li>
            <li>: the original worked better than this one.</li>
            <li>The mat has a loop on the end where it can be easily hung up when not in use.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful for long car rides!!!!!</li>
            <li>It feels great on my back</li>
            <li>I paid $29.99 and shipping was free.</li>
            <li>But after lying on it for 3-5 minutes, it became comfortable.</li>
            <li>Using it for 15 minutes a day helps to relieve back pressure and feels great.</li>
            <li>great relief to the arthritis in my foot and improves overall circulation.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s mighty power of easing my pain and tension.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s become more of an entertainment piece for us than a useful one.</li>
            <li>its great to lay on to relax you after a long day at work.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m like many who try these mats for the first time.</li>
            <li>I was SO excited when it arrived.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also more aware of my breathing when I&#x27;m on the mat.</li>
            <li>But for the price it was worth it!</li>
            <li>It has a nice warming feeling to it and if you can tolerate the initial pain you will love it.  </li>
            <li>Thena slip it into a cloth sleeve or pillow case to keep clean.</li>
            <li>My open-minded 70-year old mother uses her own acupressure mat, and notices its beneficial effects as well.  </li>
            <li>Also concerned about how clean I can keep it.  </li>
            <li>Relieves some pain, nothing too special about it</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give them a full try out just a five minute trial run for my husband satisfaction.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give them a full try out just a five minute trial run for my husband satisfaction.</li>
            <li>so I changed all of them for Britta, moreover the S&amp;H was outstanding and really fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was good for a couple months after that, no major flare-ups.</li>
            <li>But was able to use the regular nail side for relief &amp; glad to have it along.</li>
            <li>Under 5 days which in our remote area is remarkable.</li>
            <li>Under 5 days which in our remote area is remarkable.</li>
            <li>She was able to sleep for the first night without pain the very night</li>
            <li>For this mat, I have to press down on the spikes for effects, and then the effects are not as good as the original.     </li>
            <li>Also it feels amazing on the back of your head!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best to start gradually with a thin shirt and then eventually with no shirt at all.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>&amp; then I find a double sided piece of velcro 2 inches wide by 16-18 inches perfect for holding the mat rolled up.</li>
            <li>brand had a slightly best price but not much difference between all the styles except hype of lower number of nails is better or triangles over round.</li>
            <li>This brand had a slightly best price but not much difference between all the styles except hype of lower number of nails is better or triangles over round.</li>
            <li>But it is well worth it.  </li>
            <li>Likes:&lt;br /&gt;-feel nice on my back and feet&lt;</li>
            <li>Definitely worth checking out.</li>
            <li>and this product is useful for blood circulation in the foot.  </li>
            <li>i notice my &amp;#34;muffin top&amp;#34; area is more sensitive</li>
            <li>couldn&#x27;t be happier or more surprised about this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Nayoya original mat for some time, and seeing real effects in pain relief.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for the real thing, then go for original round-shaped, sharper spikes.</li>
            <li>and he was so relaxed he could have gone right to sleep.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fantastic simple and easy to store or carry with you.</li>
            <li>First of, super fast delivery!</li>
            <li>In defense of the product, I do not have chronic back pain or insomnia - I just pulled a muscle and figured that if it does help with drawing more blood to the area than it is worth a shot.</li>
            <li>I like my mat very much.  </li>
            <li>I had to buy a new one, but the original Nayoya mat was out of stock...</li>
            <li>When you first start using it it hurts at first</li>
            <li>:) I even lay on this before bedtime and it definitely helps relax me to the point where I doze off.</li>
            <li>But the first time I tried it all my thoughts and anxiety and stress disappeared</li>
            <li>First, YEOUCH.  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried the mat, I fell asleep on it while on the floor, I was so unprepared for its effects.  </li>
            <li>When I experience back/neck pain, I feel better the next day.  </li>
            <li>and I think the pressure was better on my lower back using it that</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>This mat really does it !</li>
            <li>I found  that I was able to focus on relaxing my muscles even more than just laying around being lazy.  </li>
            <li>The first time I laid on it</li>
            <li>It is ok, just as advertised, don&#x27;t know if it as helped my back or not, but it does offer some degree of relief and relaxation.</li>
            <li>and I am willing to try most anything for relief especially when I have taken meds and waiting for them to kick in.</li>
            <li>I used the mat the first night after it arrived and every-other night since.  </li>
            <li>The first day I got it, I laid on it for about 10 minutes, and felt rejuvenated.</li>
            <li>It hurts a first, just relax, breath and feel the heat.  </li>
            <li>(had to keep a top on my body for a week until i could remove it), now i feel the spikes with an initial bit of pain</li>
            <li>Yes, RNs without insurance; the freedom and higher pay of agency or registry work, without the staff employee benefits.</li>
            <li>And all the ibuprofen or naproxen or Norco or Vicodin or even hot showers or all of these things combined sometimes can&#x27;t stop it.</li>
            <li>So there I am, curled in a fetal position in a blistering hot shower, moaning with involuntary tears coming out of my eyes because the pain.</li>
            <li>I saw the needle mats/spike mats on Amazon and first read about them, they intrigued me.</li>
            <li>I took a hot shower, really hot, hoping it would relax the muscles.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We would rather try a holistic approach to our health woes first before we see any doctors and this worked.</li>
            <li>Very durable and feels amazing after a long night of serving tables in Times Square!</li>
            <li>But this just gave me so much relief right from the start.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better to lay flat on the floor though.</li>
            <li>Feels good but hasn&#x27;t made a big difference with my back pain.  </li>
            <li>I saw this type of product at Whole Foods that cost a lot more for a smaller mat so ordered it from Amazon.</li>
            <li>but I have my 7 year old son, a 6 year old niece and a 2 year old niece who also love laying on it!</li>
            <li>The mat is as described, but I haven&#x27;t felt any of the positive effects yet.</li>
            <li>I have nerve damage from chemotherapy and this does a good job at stimulating the foot nerves, not sure if this is the use for this</li>
            <li>I hope to be able to use this mat for a very long time.</li>
            <li>I have laid on it everyday and night for sleep (had incredible insomnia due to the pain) and have now been able to sleep the entire night.</li>
            <li>If you have a high tolerance for pain, you&#x27;ll easily be able to use these to deal with your most serious pain.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>and it really helps.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really know if I should trust these reviews.</li>
            <li>So I thought, how much difference can there be?</li>
            <li>and I was very sceptical about its effect.</li>
            <li>It is very relaxing.</li>
            <li>I did and because how much pain I was in...</li>
            <li>When I experience no pain, but use the mat, I have a much sounder sleep experience.  </li>
            <li>Takes much of the heat &amp; soreness out of them at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>The mat seems to be very well made and comes with a carrying case.  </li>
            <li>This mat really helps to relax before bedtime.</li>
            <li>I really like the Acupressure Mat.  </li>
            <li>but after that it was very relaxing.  </li>
            <li>I tried a couple  pf mats and I really like this one.</li>
            <li>This is really a bed of nails.  </li>
            <li>Reclining on the spike mat is very relaxing.  </li>
            <li>It is very stress and pain relieving.</li>
            <li>Just exhausted relief at the cessation of pain, and the joy of having the pain gone.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend !</li>
            <li>I cannot begin to tell you how much this product helped me.  </li>
            <li>Have used it when I pulled my back- not the most comfortable to lay on but within a few hours of laying on it my back felt much better-</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this as a personal purchase as well as a gift to those suffering insomnia or intense stress preventing them from achieving a sound sleep.  </li>
            <li>only down side is it does not come with a case or a tie and is very surprising if you are unaware you are about to experience it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Originally bought this for husband and he uses it too but just for a back relief.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t take most pain meds due to sensitivities and allergies.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this mat is actually effective</li>
            <li>more or less nails is just hype...</li>
            <li>more or less nails is just hype...</li>
            <li>A few words of caution-give a good 45 minutes before doing anything topless because you will be red as a ripened vine tomato.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it -- because, when nothing else worked, THIS worked.</li>
            <li>friend had the foot mat and spoke highly of his results</li>
            <li>It looks like a wacky outer-space toy, but it&#x27;s a prickly little miracle.&lt;br /&gt;ThaNk</li>
            <li>However the process that works makes these work is going to be pretty much the same.</li>
            <li>However the process that works makes these work is going to be pretty much the same.</li>
            <li>Very much worth it, and way cheaper than the one Dr. Oz advertises, but is the same concept.</li>
            <li>The pain is excruciating and because it is muscle spasm based, none of the normal methods make it go</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do much good to lay on it in a thin T-shirt, although I could feel the spikes somewhat through my shirt.</li>
            <li>No one but someone who&#x27;s been through the same thing can understand how this kind of pain can grind you down as it goes on, hour after hour, sometimes day after day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After about 15 minutes, it felt less like pain and more like my entire back was lightly vibrating or buzzing.</li>
            <li>You have to take a chance if this concept is new to you and it would not be for everyone.</li>
            <li>husband is now off the hook from massaging my back, funny thing is...</li>
            <li>Double mats came first....</li>
            <li>I suspect the competition is pretty close to the same....</li>
            <li>Double mats came first....</li>
            <li>I suspect the competition is pretty close to the same....</li>
            <li>Anyway I used it the first time without a shirt and was up to 20 minutes by the second use.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I was skeptical about using this acupuncture mat, but after I did I had surprising results!</li>
            <li>First, I should say I have been on an eternally exhaustive quest for anything that will ease my neck and back pain.</li>
            <li>I made sure to only let my back touch it, as my neck is just too fragile at this</li>
            <li>And for me I find to get in position I wear a loose fitting pair of jeans/pj bottoms/shorts/sweats....and a long sleeve shirt</li>
            <li>The theory -- that the pain of hundreds of tiny plastic spikes would release your body&#x27;s own endorphins to combat the OTHER massive pain you&#x27;re having -- makes sense.</li>
            <li>Two of these full sized larger mats and the neck travel mat and the foot smaller mat.</li>
            <li>and at first it seemed like it wasn&#x27;t doing much, but once you use it for a second or third time you can feel the pain relief</li>
            <li>I am not sure how much the mat will help with back pain, but for the price it sure can&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s easy to slip jeans back in place and sit up enough to pull shirt back on</li>
            <li>It was both painful and wonderful at the same time, and relaxing.</li>

            <li> Boy was I pleasantly suprised.  </li>
            <li> It appears durable, has a cotton cover, and has a good foam pad inside.</li>
            <li> They both really loved it.</li>
            <li> This is the point at which death begins to seem like a good alternative to the pain you&#x27;re in.</li>
            <li> Upon opening the box in the company of a friend, we immediately laughed, called it the \\&quot;death bed,\\&quot; and I planned on returning it.</li>
            <li> I still haven&#x27;t reached the point where I can use it without a shirt, but that&#x27;s okay because it feels great</li>

            <li> That is nice, too.</li>
            <li> I love these spike mats and have recommended them to everyone that has had any kind of body ache.</li>
            <li> After 20 minutes, I had this feeling of great calm.</li>
            <li> I love it, love it, love it!</li>
            <li> My wife used it the very first night and had great relief , we love it and use it reguarly.</li>
            <li> Its not a cure, but it sure helps with the healing process.</li>
            <li> His complaining seems to have gone away:-)</li>
            <li> I felt so relaxed all day and in harmony with everybody :-)</li>
            <li> and I can feel the blood flow with more ease in my head and neck areas.  </li>
            <li> but once you use it a couple of times you will for sure start to feel the benefits.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and even gave it more than one try</li>
            <li> There needs to be more written instructions with all the brands</li>
            <li> There needs to be more written instructions with all the brands</li>
            <li> The brand name one cost more than I wanted to pay, so I went online</li>
            <li> All I have to do is lie on my stomach on the mat for 20-30 minutes, and my abdominal area feels much better.</li>
            <li> I would love a chair at work</li>
            <li> I love it, helps me feel more blood flow, the kids like it, I am working out some TMJ and it seems to help,</li>
            <li> I do lay on it on the floor but also used the bed which I think worked better.  </li>
            <li> Better off going for acupunture.</li>
            <li> I spend most of my work hours in front of a computer.</li>
            <li> I love it, had it for a while now</li>
            <li> bearing was okay).</li>
            <li> and he helped raise me off of it too, but I&#x27;m sure I will be able to do that myself now</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about getting this when I ordered it.</li>
            <li> , however I am now so glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> but you do feel more relaxed after you use it.</li>
            <li> I have slept much better at night</li>
            <li> - I think it puts me in a more relaxed state, making it easier to fall asleep.  </li>
            <li> I love that it comes in a carrying case.  </li>
            <li> Even with three towels on top, it hurt.  </li>
            <li> love this mat.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure you have a shirt on , they are quite pokey atfFirst.</li>
            <li> The pad has made it easier for me to become more mobile.</li>
            <li> but I love the way it feels when I either sit on it or lay on it....</li>
            <li> on top of all that, I&#x27;m now a 44-46DDD in bra size.</li>
            <li> maybe more, considering the rates of on-the-job injuries from lifting and moving patients who can&#x27;t move themselves.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t take any more pain killers (non-narcotic or narcotic) for hours, and they weren&#x27;t helping anyway.</li>
            <li> and I knew I couldn&#x27;t take more pills for *</li>
            <li> I used it more toward the coccyx rather than neck area.</li>
            <li> -My love for this grows.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s it what more can I say.</li>
            <li> i saw acupressure mats at bed, bath ad beyond and fell in love.</li>
            <li> (my favorite for headaches)</li>
            <li> The more I use it, the more my nerves seem to wake up.</li>
            <li> Then one day, I came across this product on Amazon, extremely surprised at all the great reviews.</li>
            <li> and it helps relax my body so that I can sleep more sound without all the tossing and turning.</li>
            <li> Really feels good.</li>
            <li> : the original worked better than this one.</li>
            <li> The mat has a loop on the end where it can be easily hung up when not in use.  </li>
            <li> Wonderful for long car rides!!!!!</li>
            <li> It feels great on my back</li>
            <li> I paid $29.99 and shipping was free.</li>
            <li> But after lying on it for 3-5 minutes, it became comfortable.</li>
            <li> Using it for 15 minutes a day helps to relieve back pressure and feels great.</li>
            <li> great relief to the arthritis in my foot and improves overall circulation.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s mighty power of easing my pain and tension.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s become more of an entertainment piece for us than a useful one.</li>
            <li> its great to lay on to relax you after a long day at work.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m like many who try these mats for the first time.</li>
            <li> I was SO excited when it arrived.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also more aware of my breathing when I&#x27;m on the mat.</li>
            <li> But for the price it was worth it!</li>
            <li> It has a nice warming feeling to it and if you can tolerate the initial pain you will love it.  </li>
            <li> Thena slip it into a cloth sleeve or pillow case to keep clean.</li>
            <li> My open-minded 70-year old mother uses her own acupressure mat, and notices its beneficial effects as well.  </li>
            <li> Also concerned about how clean I can keep it.  </li>
            <li> Relieves some pain, nothing too special about it</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give them a full try out just a five minute trial run for my husband satisfaction.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give them a full try out just a five minute trial run for my husband satisfaction.</li>
            <li> so I changed all of them for Britta, moreover the S&amp;H was outstanding and really fast.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was good for a couple months after that, no major flare-ups.</li>
            <li> But was able to use the regular nail side for relief &amp; glad to have it along.</li>
            <li> Under 5 days which in our remote area is remarkable.</li>
            <li> Under 5 days which in our remote area is remarkable.</li>
            <li> She was able to sleep for the first night without pain the very night</li>
            <li> For this mat, I have to press down on the spikes for effects, and then the effects are not as good as the original.     </li>
            <li> Also it feels amazing on the back of your head!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best to start gradually with a thin shirt and then eventually with no shirt at all.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> &amp; then I find a double sided piece of velcro 2 inches wide by 16-18 inches perfect for holding the mat rolled up.</li>
            <li> brand had a slightly best price but not much difference between all the styles except hype of lower number of nails is better or triangles over round.</li>
            <li> This brand had a slightly best price but not much difference between all the styles except hype of lower number of nails is better or triangles over round.</li>
            <li> But it is well worth it.  </li>
            <li> Likes:&lt;br /&gt;-feel nice on my back and feet&lt;</li>
            <li> Definitely worth checking out.</li>
            <li> and this product is useful for blood circulation in the foot.  </li>
            <li> i notice my &amp;#34;muffin top&amp;#34; area is more sensitive</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t be happier or more surprised about this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Nayoya original mat for some time, and seeing real effects in pain relief.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for the real thing, then go for original round-shaped, sharper spikes.</li>
            <li> and he was so relaxed he could have gone right to sleep.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fantastic simple and easy to store or carry with you.</li>
            <li> First of, super fast delivery!</li>
            <li> In defense of the product, I do not have chronic back pain or insomnia - I just pulled a muscle and figured that if it does help with drawing more blood to the area than it is worth a shot.</li>
            <li> I like my mat very much.  </li>
            <li> I had to buy a new one, but the original Nayoya mat was out of stock...</li>
            <li> When you first start using it it hurts at first</li>
            <li> :) I even lay on this before bedtime and it definitely helps relax me to the point where I doze off.</li>
            <li> But the first time I tried it all my thoughts and anxiety and stress disappeared</li>
            <li> First, YEOUCH.  </li>
            <li> The first time I tried the mat, I fell asleep on it while on the floor, I was so unprepared for its effects.  </li>
            <li> When I experience back/neck pain, I feel better the next day.  </li>
            <li> and I think the pressure was better on my lower back using it that</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> This mat really does it !</li>
            <li> I found  that I was able to focus on relaxing my muscles even more than just laying around being lazy.  </li>
            <li> The first time I laid on it</li>
            <li> It is ok, just as advertised, don&#x27;t know if it as helped my back or not, but it does offer some degree of relief and relaxation.</li>
            <li> and I am willing to try most anything for relief especially when I have taken meds and waiting for them to kick in.</li>
            <li> I used the mat the first night after it arrived and every-other night since.  </li>
            <li> The first day I got it, I laid on it for about 10 minutes, and felt rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> It hurts a first, just relax, breath and feel the heat.  </li>
            <li> (had to keep a top on my body for a week until i could remove it), now i feel the spikes with an initial bit of pain</li>
            <li> Yes, RNs without insurance; the freedom and higher pay of agency or registry work, without the staff employee benefits.</li>
            <li> And all the ibuprofen or naproxen or Norco or Vicodin or even hot showers or all of these things combined sometimes can&#x27;t stop it.</li>
            <li> So there I am, curled in a fetal position in a blistering hot shower, moaning with involuntary tears coming out of my eyes because the pain.</li>
            <li> I saw the needle mats/spike mats on Amazon and first read about them, they intrigued me.</li>
            <li> I took a hot shower, really hot, hoping it would relax the muscles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We would rather try a holistic approach to our health woes first before we see any doctors and this worked.</li>
            <li> Very durable and feels amazing after a long night of serving tables in Times Square!</li>
            <li> But this just gave me so much relief right from the start.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better to lay flat on the floor though.</li>
            <li> Feels good but hasn&#x27;t made a big difference with my back pain.  </li>
            <li> I saw this type of product at Whole Foods that cost a lot more for a smaller mat so ordered it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> but I have my 7 year old son, a 6 year old niece and a 2 year old niece who also love laying on it!</li>
            <li> The mat is as described, but I haven&#x27;t felt any of the positive effects yet.</li>
            <li> I have nerve damage from chemotherapy and this does a good job at stimulating the foot nerves, not sure if this is the use for this</li>
            <li> I hope to be able to use this mat for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I have laid on it everyday and night for sleep (had incredible insomnia due to the pain) and have now been able to sleep the entire night.</li>
            <li> If you have a high tolerance for pain, you&#x27;ll easily be able to use these to deal with your most serious pain.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> and it really helps.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really know if I should trust these reviews.</li>
            <li> So I thought, how much difference can there be?</li>
            <li> and I was very sceptical about its effect.</li>
            <li> It is very relaxing.</li>
            <li> I did and because how much pain I was in...</li>
            <li> When I experience no pain, but use the mat, I have a much sounder sleep experience.  </li>
            <li> Takes much of the heat &amp; soreness out of them at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> The mat seems to be very well made and comes with a carrying case.  </li>
            <li> This mat really helps to relax before bedtime.</li>
            <li> I really like the Acupressure Mat.  </li>
            <li> but after that it was very relaxing.  </li>
            <li> I tried a couple  pf mats and I really like this one.</li>
            <li> This is really a bed of nails.  </li>
            <li> Reclining on the spike mat is very relaxing.  </li>
            <li> It is very stress and pain relieving.</li>
            <li> Just exhausted relief at the cessation of pain, and the joy of having the pain gone.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend !</li>
            <li> I cannot begin to tell you how much this product helped me.  </li>
            <li> Have used it when I pulled my back- not the most comfortable to lay on but within a few hours of laying on it my back felt much better-</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this as a personal purchase as well as a gift to those suffering insomnia or intense stress preventing them from achieving a sound sleep.  </li>
            <li> only down side is it does not come with a case or a tie and is very surprising if you are unaware you are about to experience it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Originally bought this for husband and he uses it too but just for a back relief.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t take most pain meds due to sensitivities and allergies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this mat is actually effective</li>
            <li> more or less nails is just hype...</li>
            <li> more or less nails is just hype...</li>
            <li> A few words of caution-give a good 45 minutes before doing anything topless because you will be red as a ripened vine tomato.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it -- because, when nothing else worked, THIS worked.</li>
            <li> friend had the foot mat and spoke highly of his results</li>
            <li> It looks like a wacky outer-space toy, but it&#x27;s a prickly little miracle.&lt;br /&gt;ThaNk</li>
            <li> However the process that works makes these work is going to be pretty much the same.</li>
            <li> However the process that works makes these work is going to be pretty much the same.</li>
            <li> Very much worth it, and way cheaper than the one Dr. Oz advertises, but is the same concept.</li>
            <li> The pain is excruciating and because it is muscle spasm based, none of the normal methods make it go</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do much good to lay on it in a thin T-shirt, although I could feel the spikes somewhat through my shirt.</li>
            <li> No one but someone who&#x27;s been through the same thing can understand how this kind of pain can grind you down as it goes on, hour after hour, sometimes day after day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After about 15 minutes, it felt less like pain and more like my entire back was lightly vibrating or buzzing.</li>
            <li> You have to take a chance if this concept is new to you and it would not be for everyone.</li>
            <li> husband is now off the hook from massaging my back, funny thing is...</li>
            <li> Double mats came first....</li>
            <li> I suspect the competition is pretty close to the same....</li>
            <li> Double mats came first....</li>
            <li> I suspect the competition is pretty close to the same....</li>
            <li> Anyway I used it the first time without a shirt and was up to 20 minutes by the second use.  </li>
            <li> Personally, I was skeptical about using this acupuncture mat, but after I did I had surprising results!</li>
            <li> First, I should say I have been on an eternally exhaustive quest for anything that will ease my neck and back pain.</li>
            <li> I made sure to only let my back touch it, as my neck is just too fragile at this</li>
            <li> And for me I find to get in position I wear a loose fitting pair of jeans/pj bottoms/shorts/sweats....and a long sleeve shirt</li>
            <li> The theory -- that the pain of hundreds of tiny plastic spikes would release your body&#x27;s own endorphins to combat the OTHER massive pain you&#x27;re having -- makes sense.</li>
            <li> Two of these full sized larger mats and the neck travel mat and the foot smaller mat.</li>
            <li> and at first it seemed like it wasn&#x27;t doing much, but once you use it for a second or third time you can feel the pain relief</li>
            <li> I am not sure how much the mat will help with back pain, but for the price it sure can&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s easy to slip jeans back in place and sit up enough to pull shirt back on</li>
            <li> It was both painful and wonderful at the same time, and relaxing.</li>
            <li> It feels strange at first</li>
            <li> I do not like to lie on the floor so far</li>
            <li> This is enough time to give me the relief I need for the whole night.</li>
            <li> My 15 year old son enjoys using it after cross-country practice.</li>
            <li> WOW.  </li>
            <li> 20+ year old desks and chairs; state school</li>
            <li> This increase in circulation has assisted with my ability to feel comfortable stepping down on the foot( only after doc said wait</li>
            <li> So I pulled it out of the closet, laid it on the floor, and laid flat down on it so that the occipital knob on the back of my head was level with the top edge of the mat.</li>
            <li> it was exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> I figure 1 or two strips of the same double sided two inch velcro bands should not only hold the mats around my legs but help get the pressure just right too.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I figure 1 or two strips of the same double sided two inch velcro bands should not only hold the mats around my legs but help get the pressure just right too.   </li>
            <li> I think some of the other top rated pads may be hyped by people that have a financial interest in the pad - be careful of their shipping fees.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it is like that only for your whole back.</li>
            <li> MPS - similar to, but not the same as, nor as chronic as, fibromyalgia), TMJ, bruxism, and repetitive strain injuries from a decade plus of computer work on the most non-ergonomic office furniture you can imagine (</li>
            <li> It is still not difficult for me to lay on, but I can feel moe of what other reviewers say it feels like.</li>
            <li> The nails are made of plastic and initially feel very harsh, but with regular use, you will be able to bear the pricking.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m 29 and my back feels like an 80 year old woman&#x27;s) because of the tenderness.</li>
            <li> way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even put my bare feet on it when sitting in the evening.  </li>
            <li> &gt; When I lay bare backed on it</li>
            <li> you can use socks if your feet are tender to walk on it or bare foot if you can take it.</li>
            <li> help out me a lot just have a thin top</li>
            <li> Maybe it was laying flat on my back on the floor; that helps with back spasms, but not so much with head/neck spasms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it is suppose to do, My pain is much less.</li>
            <li> The first two minutes are a bit uncomfortable but after that it is not bad, when I lift off it stings a bit.</li>
            <li> A few months later I had the first of my two major tension/muscle spasm headaches/neckaches.</li>
            <li> I lay on this mat with my bare back from the start.</li>
            <li> This caused intense pain to radiate down my arms and also severe weakness.</li>
            <li> And, due to my various chronic pain problems, I have a high tolerance for pain.</li>
            <li> That is my only complaint-it is not long enough</li>
            <li> (I was already on the floor flat on my back by this point).</li>
            <li> He brought it, I unrolled it, and this time I put a pillow under it so the needles were raised and would press harder into the back of my head and the back of my neck (as well as my upper back/shoulders, mid back, etc.).</li>
            <li> At first I could hardly feel the spikes.</li>
            <li> If it hurts too much as first, I find by lifting yourself up a little then laying back down can help.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any benefits from using it but that could be because I don&#x27;t relax or use it for long enough.</li>
            <li> 4 minutes flat.</li>
            <li> My back often pops a few times when I first lay down which relieves pain.      </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a science person and it made some sense that you could stimulate the painful region with enough nerve pricks that your own system could release endorphins or chemcicals to work as pain medication.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Regardless, the needle mat was the only thing to break the pain cycle I was trapped in for nearly 16 hours.</li>
            <li> I have 4 sets of protruding discs in my cervical spine that cause constant neck and back pain.&lt;br /&gt;Alone in my apartment, I thought I&#x27;d check it out for just a sec.</li>
            <li> I was a little surprised.</li>
            <li> And no tylenol for over 30 years often stops cold most combination drugs....</li>
            <li> I am concerned about how long the mat will hold up to use since the spikes are just plastic.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s wide enough.</li>
            <li> My husband, who works construction, said it helps him relax and removes tension after a long day at work.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long is too long; my advice is to set a timer.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> and then the pants down enough for the mat to touch the lower back</li>
            <li> Now a month and a half later I continue to use it when I feel my back pain intensifying.</li>
            <li> This mat did absolutely nothing for me except make my pain worse from laying flat on my back on the floor.</li>
            <li> I have chosen to take the naturopathic route of not taking narcotics for the pain due to side-effects, so in total desperation for pain relief, I ordered this mat not knowing if it would help or not.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend bought one (more expensive) and he&#x27;s always stealing mine to use instead!</li>
            <li> :) A bit scared because of some of the reviews that said its extremely painful for which I have a very low tolerance for.</li>
            <li> I run an alternative health center and use Acupressure pin mats from different sources to treat my patients, but this product is the patients choice, they are asking allways for this mat against other brands</li>
            <li> The key is distributing your weight evenly, and a word of wisdom beware of having a cat jump on you while laying on it, not a fun</li>
            <li> After the birth of my fourth child I had a sciatic type of pain originating from my lumbar spine area, referring pain to my hip and down the side of my leg.</li>
            <li> It did, a bit, but only brought it down from 12 out of 10 to 9 or 10 out of 10.</li>
            <li> i accidently stepped on it the second day i had it and it punctured my foot with 6 of the needle points... BE CAREFUL!!</li>
            <li> I have used it a few times already, but I am not sure how much difference it makes for me.</li>
            <li> Or maybe hundreds of little pains all down your back distracts your nervous system from the BIG pain in your head/neck.</li>
            <li> felt it coming on, took meds to try to head it off, failed; took more meds; no help; took the narcotics I reserve for only this bad level of pain; they didn&#x27;t work; hot/moist packs didn&#x27;t work; hot shower didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> i would preferred it to be a little longer, and have one end that folded to create an area for the neck and the back of the head.</li>
            <li> Not sure about the long term medical benefits of it, that is unsubstantiated, but</li>
            <li> If it is too much for you, just wear a thin t-shirt/tank.</li>
            <li> In a few minutes, I am relaxed and the back pain seems to  disappear for awhile.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful getting on and getting off.  </li>
            <li> Just a relaxation thing for me -not really a pain reliever.  </li>
            <li> It only took a few minutes to get used to</li>
            <li> I expected it to work -- so that probably helped -- but I didn&#x27;t expect it to work</li>
            <li> It has not really relieved my problem, but it seems to help to an extent</li>
            <li> I feel it was $22 well spent.</li>
            <li> But when I need it I&#x27;m trying to keep it to just once a day when I go to bed because I don&#x27;t want to loose the benefit due to adaptation...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I use it for stiff back, shoulders and neck.</li>
            <li> And I wanted two mats and these were longer than some others and the two other shapes including travel pillow</li>
            <li> the other two items were a bit slower.</li>
            <li> And I wanted two mats and these were longer than some others and the two other shapes including travel pillow</li>
            <li> the other two items were a bit slower.</li>
            <li> Its easier to lay on than my other one.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I first read about this.</li>
            <li> Immediately I lay down on the \\&quot;bed of nails\\&quot;, and it was a bit uncomfortable and it felt hot.</li>
            <li> However, if I was grinding my teeth the night before, if there&#x27;s a huge temperature change at work (because HVAC systems are so reliable where I work... not) or a vent blowing directly on me, if my shoulder/neck/upper back were already stiff from a flare-up of MPS, if I can&#x27;t raise the workstation on which I use my laptop (or if other team members come and lower it when I&#x27;ve stepped away), I can be in for a nasty tension</li>
            <li> When I first saw an accupressure mat, I was a little skeptical until I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> At my current job (hospital RN), I have to use computers -- laptops, which pronate and cramp your arms as you type -- but at least I can raise the tray tables on which we use them to the level of my ribs.</li>
            <li> I put a moist heat pad on my neck/back of my head and laid down in the dark.</li>
            <li> I use it sitting down barefoot.</li>
            <li> the 40 minute mark my pain was down to 0-1/10.</li>
            <li> But for me and for those who are like me...need something &amp; have little other options....</li>
            <li> My friend said it was too sharp even with a heavy shirt</li>
            <li> The spikes are less sharper, and I can feel the difference in pain relief</li>
            <li> So I figured its less than $30, I can handle</li>
            <li> For me it lasts about half a day.</li>
            <li> Less migraines since using this for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Spiky little pieces of plastic trying to bore into your skin.  </li>
            <li> It took a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> The pain has been diagnosed as being chronic, so this is something I will have to deal with my entire life, but at least I know there is SOMETHING I can do to get some relief, where there was none to be found before!</li>
            <li> it is the feeling of  those Adidas sandles with all the little knobs that stick up that the soles of your feet rest on&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wish it was a little longer</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that although it makes my face revived, it is a hard to adjust the shape for conforming to the face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking of several outside the box approaches from covering the one side with a foam cover that the nails stick into or cutting the two sides apart making them into two pillows then.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m too chicken to go in for what is, despite being medically necessary, essentially an elective surgery.</li>
            <li> and I find that tension in my back and shoulders has decreased.</li>
            <li> I use it almost everyday now</li>
            <li> round verses</li>
            <li> round verses</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t get use to it, it&#x27;s not comfortable.</li>
            <li> Just a few hours reading a book while lying on this mat</li>
            <li> (I had heavy clothing on, mind you)</li>
            <li> I have fallen asleep on it and wake up with a bit less pain!  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it is mind over matter, but I lay on this for a half hour a night</li>
            <li> This mat was recommended to me by a friend because I have chronic stiff neck problems.</li>
            <li> I know you&#x27;re not supposed to lay on it that long, but though my pain was significantly decreased at 20 minutes, 6-7/10 is still a lot of pain</li>
            <li> I too have fallen asleep with it...but usually within 40-90 minutes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure on that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure on that.</li>
            <li> It works just as well as the expensive one, and has almost the same number of spikes (over 6,000).</li>
            <li> I usually toss and turn a lot when I sleep</li>
            <li> not sure what it is doing for me....</li>
            <li> You will have to choose, because the mat is small; I don&#x27;t recall that being mentioned in the details.</li>
            <li> and I just used this with a client with low back pain so bad that she was unable to sleep.</li>
            <li> I developed terrible spasm type pain across my back.</li>
            <li> Depth of nails now might have an effect either negative or postive depending on skin sensitivity or toughness.....</li>
            <li> Depth of nails now might have an effect either negative or postive depending on skin sensitivity or toughness.....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like every muscle in my face, jaw, scalp, head, neck, and shoulders spasm at the same time and remain clenched even though I&#x27;m trying desperately to relax it all.</li>
            <li> You have nothing to lose but your chronic pain... at least temporarily.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to get out of bed slowly anymore</li>
            <li> Lay on it for 5-10 minutes a day, and slowly build up your tolerance.</li>
            <li> Too thick</li>
            <li> spikes are kinda of small need a thin shirt or be shirtless when using it</li>
            <li> I have chronic back/shoulder problems and get massages often, but the same places continue to be painful.  </li>
            <li> If, however, you&#x27;re a lightweight when it comes to pain, and you can&#x27;t take it, you&#x27;ll probably find it difficult to impossible to actually lay on one of these needle/spike mats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I plan on using this everyday!!!</li>
            <li> Forget the thin shirt idea....</li>
            <li> any shirt at all thin even does not allow stimulation to occur...</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll wake up not happy.</li>
            <li> and I feel instantly tired.</li>
            <li> so I often put a thin fabric over that part of my body.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I roll it and place it behind my neck or shoulders.  </li>
            <li> Much MUCH worse.</li>
            <li> He says its too painful to lie down on.</li>
            <li> I bought it for him since he suffers from lower back pain and bad posture.  </li>
            <li> took a few weeks to get used to the spikes, and was quite painful</li>
            <li> I suffer from terrible stress and the physical ailments that come along with it.</li>
            <li> and so I&#x27;m considered difficult to treat.</li>
            <li> Strangely uncomfortable yet calls me.  </li>
            <li> Fail.</li>
            <li> i was skeptical this would work but was willihg to give it a shot.  </li>
            <li> I use it with a very thin shirt.  </li>
            <li> I read a review before in which the poor person&#x27;s pain was so bad, s/</li>
            <li> That was bracing and, well, painful, but I&#x27;ve had much worse.</li>
            <li> It sort of feels numb after a while, use your phone or watch TV to keep your mind off of it.</li>
            <li> Knocks you out cold at night.</li>
            <li> I could feel it coming on and desperately took 800mg of ibuprofen to try to stop it.</li>
            <li> I took some naproxen (Aleve) to boost the ibuprofen (probably placing myself at increased risk of GI bleed, but I was desperate).</li>
            <li> But in the midst of my desperate agony of pain, I remembered it.</li>
            <li> I have horrible horrible back pain (I have scoliosis, and had an epidural with my c-section), to the point where I visited a Chirpractor.</li>
            <li> BAD.</li>
            <li> I also find that when I have an upset stomach or bad cramps, the mat helps with that too!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t feel like it was doing anything but boring holes into my skin.</li>
            <li> Just miserable and a friend suggested I look into these style of mats.</li>
            <li> I got up and felt shockingly rejuvenated.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love these spike mats and have recommended them to everyone that has had any kind of body ache. its great to lay on to relax you after a long day at work. Helps with pain in my back and pain in my legs. Its not a cure, but it sure helps with the healing process.</li>
            <li> I suffer from terrible stress and the physical ailments that come along with it. I thought I would give this product a try and I really like it. It feels great on my back and I find that tension in my back and shoulders has decreased. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The mat is as described, but I haven&#x27;t felt any of the positive effects yet. I&#x27;m also unsure how to keep it sanitized.</li>
            <li> I ordered this acupressure mat to see if it would help relieve my back pain and at first it seemed like it wasn&#x27;t doing much, but once you use it for a second or third time you can feel the pain relief and it also helps you relax.  I use it almost everyday now and it really helps.  I recommed this product and this seller.</li>
            <li> When you first start using it it hurts at first but after awhile you start getting use to the feel of it.  The \\&quot;nails\\&quot; are made of plastic and do not hurt you.  It&#x27;s best to start gradually with a thin shirt and then eventually with no shirt at all.  I like it because you can put it on any part of your body and you will feel the blood flow going towards the skin.  It has a nice warming feeling to it and if you can tolerate the initial pain you will love it.  Not sure about the long term medical benefits of it, that is unsubstantiated, but it is a definite relaxation tool.  I fall asleep on it.</li>
            <li> I can write a review here without actually purchasing the mat... Don&#x27;t really know if I should trust these reviews.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it.  I bought it for him since he suffers from lower back pain and bad posture.  His complaining seems to have gone away:-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Nayoya original mat for some time, and seeing real effects in pain relief. I had to buy a new one, but the original Nayoya mat was out of stock... So I thought, how much difference can there be? It&#x27;s just spikes... and bought this lower-priced replacement.    It is different. The spikes are less sharper, and I can feel the difference in pain relief: the original worked better than this one. For this mat, I have to press down on the spikes for effects, and then the effects are not as good as the original.     If you are looking for the real thing, then go for original round-shaped, sharper spikes.</li>
            <li> I have horrible horrible back pain (I have scoliosis, and had an epidural with my c-section), to the point where I visited a Chirpractor. He said he could ease my pain with a series of adjustments and massages at a whopping $700! Yikes! I considered acupuncture, again I seen dollar signs. Then one day, I came across this product on Amazon, extremely surprised at all the great reviews. So I figured its less than $30, I can handle that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very next day, my mat was at my door! :) A bit scared because of some of the reviews that said its extremely painful for which I have a very low tolerance for. Immediately I lay down on the \\&quot;bed of nails\\&quot;, and it was a bit uncomfortable and it felt hot. After 5 minutes I&#x27;m up and felt the pain I have felt for years has lessened. Now a month and a half later I continue to use it when I feel my back pain intensifying. I don&#x27;t have to get out of bed slowly anymore (I&#x27;m 29 and my back feels like an 80 year old woman&#x27;s) because of the tenderness. :) I even lay on this before bedtime and it definitely helps relax me to the point where I doze off. I do not recommend laying on this for hours like I did! It hurt when I got off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband is now off the hook from massaging my back, funny thing is... He says its too painful to lie down on. Like everyone else mentioned, give it time. Lay on it for 5-10 minutes a day, and slowly build up your tolerance. It sort of feels numb after a while, use your phone or watch TV to keep your mind off of it. It works!</li>
            <li> I received this as a Christmas gift and I was very sceptical about its effect. But the first time I tried it all my thoughts and anxiety and stress disappeared and I fell asleep on it for about an hour! I felt so relaxed all day and in harmony with everybody :-)</li>
            <li> When I bought this mat, I was plagued with severe back and neck ache. I have been using this mat for the last 4-5 months and I can say that it works! I can feel the blocked/stiff muscles re-opening, or the blood flowing through. It is very relaxing. I especially recommend this mat for those who suffer from lower back pain, sciatica pain and ache in the shoulder blades. For the neck, I place it over my contour pillow and I can feel the blood flow with more ease in my head and neck areas.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the fact that it is too short! I wish there were a full-sized mat! The nails are made of plastic and initially feel very harsh, but with regular use, you will be able to bear the pricking. If it is too much for you, just wear a thin t-shirt/tank. Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> Great product to lay on or use as mat for feet with nerve damage. I have nerve damage from chemotherapy and this does a good job at stimulating the foot nerves, not sure if this is the use for this but it works for me. Originally bought this for husband and he uses it too but just for a back relief.  It feels strange at first but once you use it a couple of times you will for sure start to feel the benefits.</li>
            <li> First, YEOUCH.  This thing HURTS.  Second, I don&#x27;t get the big deal. It didn&#x27;t feel like it was doing anything but boring holes into my skin. I followed the instructions and even gave it more than one try but it didn&#x27;t do a thing for me.  I&#x27;ll be returning it.</li>
            <li> I like my mat very much.  I take off my shirt and lay back on it.  In a few minutes, I am relaxed and the back pain seems to  disappear for awhile.  Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m like many who try these mats for the first time. A non believer in such products and figure what&#x27;s the gimmick or just another con....well for me it worked. I can&#x27;t take most pain meds due to sensitivities and allergies. After foot surgery last year Oxycodone is out because of hives. And no tylenol for over 30 years often stops cold most combination drugs....and so I&#x27;m considered difficult to treat. And have no sympathy or understanding for those who find themselves addictive types because it&#x27;s the opposite for me. Torture is not addictive. I broke ribs last fall and things healed well enough...then suddenly in March and April I developed terrible spasm type pain across my back. Just miserable and a friend suggested I look into these style of mats. I did and because how much pain I was in...influenced me and I bought all three of these mats that night. Two of these full sized larger mats and the neck travel mat and the foot smaller mat. All before I knew if they would work. I&#x27;m a science person and it made some sense that you could stimulate the painful region with enough nerve pricks that your own system could release endorphins or chemcicals to work as pain medication. And guess that&#x27;s what happens. For me it lasts about half a day. But when I need it I&#x27;m trying to keep it to just once a day when I go to bed because I don&#x27;t want to loose the benefit due to adaptation...which is where your nervous system adapts to the stimulation and no longer produces the effects you were getting. It&#x27;s a feasible theory. But this just gave me so much relief right from the start. Forget the thin shirt idea....any shirt at all thin even does not allow stimulation to occur...you need skin contact. I do not like to lie on the floor so far I&#x27;ve used this on a couch and bed with cushions/pillows helping guide the mat where it does the best good for me. And for me I find to get in position I wear a loose fitting pair of jeans/pj bottoms/shorts/sweats....and a long sleeve shirt and once in position I slip the shirt off and then the pants down enough for the mat to touch the lower back and I&#x27;m set. I too have fallen asleep with it...but usually within 40-90 minutes I&#x27;m awake and want off it. So it&#x27;s easy to slip jeans back in place and sit up enough to pull shirt back on &amp; then I find a double sided piece of velcro 2 inches wide by 16-18 inches perfect for holding the mat rolled up. Thena slip it into a cloth sleeve or pillow case to keep clean. This is enough time to give me the relief I need for the whole night. I suspect it won&#x27;t work every kind of pain but it has worked for me on this. I took the neck roll with me on vacation too. Held off reviewing any of these until I got back. I didn&#x27;t like the larger nail sizes on the neck roll/travel item. But was able to use the regular nail side for relief &amp; glad to have it along. I did not use it&#x27;s inflatible pillow and found the double nail sided issue couldn&#x27;t slip it up my shirt for skin contact while traveling on the train or plane or car because the larger nails would snag on&lt;br /&gt;my shirt and even damaged one I tried it with. There may be some approaches to solve the double sided nail issue with that in the future. I&#x27;m thinking of several outside the box approaches from covering the one side with a foam cover that the nails stick into or cutting the two sides apart making them into two pillows then. Overall....all these pieces are a good devices but may not be perfect. You have to take a chance if this concept is new to you and it would not be for everyone. I already showed it to two people who are elderly and thought they might not like this as it could cause some discomfort or pain in the trying. But for me and for those who are like me...need something &amp; have little other options....oh give it a try. Perhaps not buy all products at once...like I did. I have edema too in my legs so when I saw one of their videos suggest you can wrap the mat around your leg...but how to hold for 20 minutes...ohwait the velcro strip...that&#x27;s double sided so it sticks to itself...so I bought two mats at once so I can eventually try both legs at the same time. I figure 1 or two strips of the same double sided two inch velcro bands should not only hold the mats around my legs but help get the pressure just right too.&lt;br /&gt;This brand had a slightly best price but not much difference between all the styles except hype of lower number of nails is better or triangles over round. However the process that works makes these work is going to be pretty much the same. I didn&#x27;t like the effect of the deeper and larger nails on the neck pillow however. I didn&#x27;t give them a full try out just a five minute trial run for my husband satisfaction. I just couldn&#x27;t relax enough to continue at the time in a motel room. Maybe in the comfort of my home I&#x27;ll try again sometime. But overall I went with this product for two reasons over it&#x27;s competition. The videos give you some idea how to use these items. There needs to be more written instructions with all the brands but there isn&#x27;t. And I wanted two mats and these were longer than some others and the two other shapes including travel pillow would let me take the system along on the road which I knew I might need. I&#x27;m quite happy with quality and speed on which they were shipped. Under 5 days which in our remote area is remarkable. Double mats came first....the other two items were a bit slower. I suspect the competition is pretty close to the same....more or less nails is just hype...round verses trianglular hype too. Stimulation the same. Depth of nails now might have an effect either negative or postive depending on skin sensitivity or toughness.....maybe men verse female skin. I&#x27;m not sure on that. I recommend to those with open minds and again this isn&#x27;t for everyone.t the velcro strip...that&#x27;s double sided so it sticks to itself...so I bought two mats at once so I can eventually try both legs at the same time.

            <li> When I first saw an accupressure mat, I was a little skeptical until I gave it a try. It was both painful and wonderful at the same time, and relaxing. The testimonial said it could help with insomnia, which I suffer. The brand name one cost more than I wanted to pay, so I went online and this one came up, and I ordered immediately. I was SO excited when it arrived. It works just as well as the expensive one, and has almost the same number of spikes (over 6,000). I still haven&#x27;t reached the point where I can use it without a shirt, but that&#x27;s okay because it feels great an relaxes me anyway. I also find that when I have an upset stomach or bad cramps, the mat helps with that too! All I have to do is lie on my stomach on the mat for 20-30 minutes, and my abdominal area feels much better. I&#x27;m also more aware of my breathing when I&#x27;m on the mat. It helps my insomnia, and I have fallen asleep on it, both on my back and on my stomach. I let a friend of mine use it when she was having an anxiety attack, and it helped her a lot. She&#x27;s going to buy one too. I really recommend this mat, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I have a cervical fusion on two different levels and thoracic outlet syndrome.  This Body Mat helps me with my chronic pain.</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself to relax my muscles after a stressful day but I have my 7 year old son, a 6 year old niece and a 2 year old niece who also love laying on it! Works great!</li>
            <li> Knocks you out cold at night. It hurts a bunch, then your body overcompensates and releases a bunch of sleepy numbing endorphins. You&#x27;ll be tempted to fall asleep on it. Don&#x27;t. You&#x27;ll wake up not happy.</li>
            <li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t purchased this item. I just can&#x27;t get use to it, it&#x27;s not comfortable. I have not seen any benefits from using it but that could be because I don&#x27;t relax or use it for long enough.</li>
            <li> I suffer from tension headaches and spasms in my lower back.  Lying on this mat helps greatly, especially in the lower back region.  I have fallen asleep on it and wake up with a bit less pain!  I would love a chair at work make with these spikes for my back and neck!</li>
            <li> This mat did absolutely nothing for me except make my pain worse from laying flat on my back on the floor.</li>
            <li> I run an alternative health center and use Acupressure pin mats from different sources to treat my patients, but this product is the patients choice, they are asking allways for this mat against other brands so I changed all of them for Britta, moreover the S&amp;H was outstanding and really fast.</li>
            <li> I love it, helps me feel more blood flow, the kids like it, I am working out some TMJ and it seems to help,</li>
            <li> I do not have back/neck pain but purchased the acupressure mat in order to experience a deeper sleep.  I do not consume Eastern medicine/roots and decided to let the facts dictate theory rather than the reverse, which most people are guilty of.  The first time I tried the mat, I fell asleep on it while on the floor, I was so unprepared for its effects.  The proper place to use the mat is your mattress / couch.  When I experience back/neck pain, I feel better the next day.  When I experience no pain, but use the mat, I have a much sounder sleep experience.  I have intentionally failed to use the mat some evenings to see if I sense a difference in my sleep pattern, holding all variables constant, and I feel much more well-rested after using the acupressure mat the night prior.  The plastic nails do not hurt, you feel a tingly sensation initially.  My open-minded 70-year old mother uses her own acupressure mat, and notices its beneficial effects as well.  Whether you suffer from back/neck/foot pain or lack pain, this mat will relax your muscles and mind.  I highly recommend this as a personal purchase as well as a gift to those suffering insomnia or intense stress preventing them from achieving a sound sleep.  It will be the best gift they ever received!</li>
            <li> Just a few hours reading a book while lying on this mat got rid of my morning back and hip kinks.  I only wish there was one designed for the curves of the neck area.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the reviews to help loosen back muscles.  I have lower back &amp; hip (sacrum) problems.  I have a clerical job with a standing work station &amp; by the time I get home each evening I feel the need for some muscle loosening.  I decided to make this mat part of my routine and see how it works for me.  It is everything reviews said. Spiky little pieces of plastic trying to bore into your skin.  Strangely uncomfortable yet calls me.  You know the saying \\&quot;hurts so good\\&quot;.  I think a person has to work up to laying on it without a shirt.  But it is well worth it.  Once I get use to laying on it, I can feel myself relaxing.  I do lay on it on the floor but also used the bed which I think worked better.  I have a tempur-pedic type mattress pad that conforms with the body and I think the pressure was better on my lower back using it that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even put my bare feet on it when sitting in the evening.  Takes much of the heat &amp; soreness out of them at the end of the day. I am concerned about how long the mat will hold up to use since the spikes are just plastic.  Also concerned about how clean I can keep it.  The mat seems to be very well made and comes with a carrying case.  The mat has a loop on the end where it can be easily hung up when not in use.  One side note is that I can relax in my chair in the evening without a dog jumping into my lap b/c they will not get close enough to jump with the mat on the floor in front of me.  I hope to be able to use this mat for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Likes:&lt;br /&gt;-feel nice on my back and feet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes:&lt;br /&gt;-the spikes are kinda of small need a thin shirt or be shirtless when using it</li>
            <li> This mat really helps to relax before bedtime. My back often pops a few times when I first lay down which relieves pain.      I feel this mat was the best buy out there.  I paid $29.99 and shipping was free. It appears durable, has a cotton cover, and has a good foam pad inside. I think some of the other top rated pads may be hyped by people that have a financial interest in the pad - be careful of their shipping fees. Anyway I used it the first time without a shirt and was up to 20 minutes by the second use.  Just be careful getting on and getting off.  If it hurts too much as first, I find by lifting yourself up a little then laying back down can help.</li>
            <li> I do not think that it does what they are saying it will do!!  I would like to return it but conveniently there was no &#x27;return label&#x27; in the package.</li>
            <li> After the birth of my fourth child I had a sciatic type of pain originating from my lumbar spine area, referring pain to my hip and down the side of my leg. Within 10 minutes on this mat I felt the muscle start to spasm and unwind releasing all of the tension and haven&#x27;t had any pain since!!! I read the reviews and hoped for the best when I ordered this, but couldn&#x27;t believe the immediate results I&#x27;ve experienced with this mat!! I am a licensed massage therapist and I just used this with a client with low back pain so bad that she was unable to sleep. She was able to sleep for the first night without pain the very night she tried this mat and has bought one for herself and her husband to use between massages. Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> It is as described but it does not hit the spots I needed it to. I have not noticed any difference since using it. Better off going for acupunture.</li>
            <li> I really like the Acupressure Mat.  I usually toss and turn a lot when I sleep, now I use this before I go to bed and it helps relax my body so that I can sleep more sound without all the tossing and turning.</li>
            <li> Personally, I was skeptical about using this acupuncture mat, but after I did I had surprising results! Definitely worth checking out.</li>
            <li> Have used it when I pulled my back- not the most comfortable to lay on but within a few hours of laying on it my back felt much better- 24 hours later I was moving with out pain and discomfort</li>
            <li> Feels good but hasn&#x27;t made a big difference with my back pain.  I have degenerative disc in back and neck and scoliosis so was hoping for some relief.  Just a relaxation thing for me -not really a pain reliever.  I use it with a very thin shirt.  Too thick and it doesn&#x27;t do anything but no shirt and it hurts.  My friend said it was too sharp even with a heavy shirt so I think it&#x27;s a very personal preference....</li>
            <li> This mat really does it ! I spend most of my work hours in front of a computer. After years I started having sore shoulders, numbness in my hands and lower back pain. I use this mat in the morning and in the evening ( 10 min is enough  for me) and do not have these symptoms day or night. I have recommended this product to number of people and everyone likes it. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Tried this product, but it didn&#x27;t seem to do anything for me, but then everyone is different, with different problems.</li>
            <li> I got this for a friend and my mom.  They both really loved it.</li>
            <li> my husband has difficulty with his knees since the 70s when they removed all his cartlidge (why?) This helps him get to the gym  and home without pain, thank you</li>
            <li> Great mat.  Perfect for what I needed it for.  It does exactly what it is suppose to do, My pain is much less.</li>
            <li> It took a little getting used to. But after lying on it for 3-5 minutes, it became comfortable. It rolls up and stores easily enough.</li>
            <li> I love it, had it for a while now, it helps me to relax and go to sleep. Great for the feet too</li>
            <li> Always consult with your doctor before purchasing any circulation product after surgery.  I had ankle surgery and this product is useful for blood circulation in the foot.  This increase in circulation has assisted with my ability to feel comfortable stepping down on the foot( only after doc said wait bearing was okay). I use it sitting down barefoot.</li>
            <li> I received this mat today and tried it immediately.  I love it!  It only took a few minutes to get used to but after that it was very relaxing.  I found  that I was able to focus on relaxing my muscles even more than just laying around being lazy.  I felt great after I got off of it too.  I probably stayed on it for @ 10 minutes.  I plan on using this everyday!!! P.S. I also had my husband help me lay back on it and he helped raise me off of it too, but I&#x27;m sure I will be able to do that myself now that I know what if feels like.</li>
            <li> I was diagnosed with having bilateral C7 vertebral transverse process abnormalities that cause a condition caused Thoracic Outlet Syndrome. This caused intense pain to radiate down my arms and also severe weakness. I have chosen to take the naturopathic route of not taking narcotics for the pain due to side-effects, so in total desperation for pain relief, I ordered this mat not knowing if it would help or not. The first time I laid on it I actually fell asleep!! I have laid on it everyday and night for sleep (had incredible insomnia due to the pain) and have now been able to sleep the entire night. The pain has been diagnosed as being chronic, so this is something I will have to deal with my entire life, but at least I know there is SOMETHING I can do to get some relief, where there was none to be found before!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about getting this when I ordered it. It was even scarier when I got it in the mail, however I am now so glad I made this purchase. I have a messed up vertebrae in my neck and get migraines.  Using this after using a heating pad for 10 minutes feels AWESOME! It works.</li>
            <li> It is ok, just as advertised, don&#x27;t know if it as helped my back or not, but it does offer some degree of relief and relaxation.</li>
            <li> I love it, love it, love it! It helps my sore shoulders and migraines. Need to get the roll too</li>
            <li> help out me a lot just have a thin top so i can work</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is mind over matter, but I lay on this for a half hour a night and I feel instantly tired. Very much worth it, and way cheaper than the one Dr. Oz advertises, but is the same concept.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how much the mat will help with back pain, but for the price it sure can&#x27;t hurt. I have used it a few times already, but I am not sure how much difference it makes for me. In defense of the product, I do not have chronic back pain or insomnia - I just pulled a muscle and figured that if it does help with drawing more blood to the area than it is worth a shot.</li>
            <li> I tried a couple  pf mats and I really like this one. Its easier to lay on than my other one.</li>
            <li> So I bought this thinking it was nuts!  I have a back injury and sometimes the pain is unreal and I am willing to try most anything for relief especially when I have taken meds and waiting for them to kick in. When I bought this my physical therapist had never heard of them, I have yet to meet anyone who has including docs and my occupational therapist.The key is distributing your weight evenly, and a word of wisdom beware of having a cat jump on you while laying on it, not a fun sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When I lay bare backed on it i notice my &amp;#34;muffin top&amp;#34; area is more sensitive so I often put a thin fabric over that part of my body.  The first two minutes are a bit uncomfortable but after that it is not bad, when I lift off it stings a bit. It does help to break up the deep ache back pain. My husband tried it, he didn&#x27;t have any discomfort and he was so relaxed he could have gone right to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using it with clothing on the sensation is very different, and relaxing!! Wonderful for long car rides!!!!! The best way I can describe it is the feeling of  those Adidas sandles with all the little knobs that stick up that the soles of your feet rest on&lt;br /&gt;it is like that only for your whole back. Also it feels amazing on the back of your head!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side is it does not come with a case or a tie and is very surprising if you are unaware you are about to experience it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck and Enjoy,&lt;br /&gt;Ariane</li>
            <li> I use this when feeling stressed and it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Relieves some pain, nothing too special about it but you do feel more relaxed after you use it. I use it at night before bed</li>
            <li> I used the mat the first night after it arrived and every-other night since.  After 2 ten minute sessions, I am sold.  I have slept much better at night - I think it puts me in a more relaxed state, making it easier to fall asleep.  A rather inexpensive option to relieving tension in my neck, upper back and shoulders.</li>
            <li> Less migraines since using this for a few weeks.  I love that it comes in a carrying case.  It makes it nice and portable!  I&#x27;ve already bought another one for a gift and I&#x27;m considering buying one to keep at the office.  Wish it was a little longer but it&#x27;s wide enough.</li>
            <li> This acupressure mat is great. The first day I got it, I laid on it for about 10 minutes, and felt rejuvenated. My 15 year old son enjoys using it after cross-country practice. My husband, who works construction, said it helps him relax and removes tension after a long day at work. This mat was recommended to me by a friend because I have chronic stiff neck problems. It truly helps me to relax and get back to what I need to do! Great value for the product.</li>
            <li> This is really a bed of nails.  Even with three towels on top, it hurt.  I am very disappointed.  I thought this was going to be the miracle to help my soreness!</li>
            <li> WOW.  Sceptical, but it works.  It hurts a first, just relax, breath and feel the heat.  20 mins on this a day.  I like it.&lt;br /&gt;I use it for stiff back, shoulders and neck.</li>
            <li> love this mat.  i am amazed how well i find myself relaxed using this. took a few weeks to get used to the spikes, and was quite painful (had to keep a top on my body for a week until i could remove it), now i feel the spikes with an initial bit of pain but then a warmth grows throughout my back and i lose track of the time. i started with 5 minutes and now am up to 15/20 minutes. definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Sitting with it on my back now. It&#x27;s better to lay flat on the floor though. Gives pressure where needed. Thinking of getting another one for my Son. Really feels good. Just make sure you have a shirt on , they are quite pokey atfFirst.</li>
            <li> Reclining on the spike mat is very relaxing.  Sometimes I roll it and place it behind my neck or shoulders.  That is nice, too.</li>
            <li> I saw this type of product at Whole Foods that cost a lot more for a smaller mat so ordered it from Amazon. It is very stress and pain relieving. The only complaint I have is that although it makes my face revived, it is a hard to adjust the shape for conforming to the face.</li>
            <li> My wife used it the very first night and had great relief , we love it and use it reguarly. Fantastic simple and easy to store or carry with you.</li>
            <li> It has helped the pain in my back. The pad has made it easier for me to become more mobile.</li>
            <li> This product is great for tension relief. Using it for 15 minutes a day helps to relieve back pressure and feels great.</li>
            <li> i would preferred it to be a little longer, and have one end that folded to create an area for the neck and the back of the head.</li>
            <li> I use it every day....not sure what it is doing for me....but I love the way it feels when I either sit on it or lay on it....</li>
            <li> One of the best I&#x27;ve used! My boyfriend bought one (more expensive) and he&#x27;s always stealing mine to use instead! Very durable and feels amazing after a long night of serving tables in Times Square! I stand on it, lay on it...great relief to the arthritis in my foot and improves overall circulation. Helps me sleep better too!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I first read about this. It popped up as a &amp;#34;people who looked at what you&#x27;re looking at also looked at tihs&amp;#34; suggestion. I was looking at stuff for back and neck problems because I have myofascial pain syndrome (MPS - similar to, but not the same as, nor as chronic as, fibromyalgia), TMJ, bruxism, and repetitive strain injuries from a decade plus of computer work on the most non-ergonomic office furniture you can imagine (20+ year old desks and chairs; state school; need I say more?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then on top of all that, I&#x27;m now a 44-46DDD in bra size. I&#x27;ve already had doctors tell me that they can write the necessary letters to my insurance company to designate a breast reduction as medically necessary. But I&#x27;m too chicken to go in for what is, despite being medically necessary, essentially an elective surgery. (Also I didn&#x27;t have any insurance for about 3 years until recently. Yes, RNs without insurance; the freedom and higher pay of agency or registry work, without the staff employee benefits. We exist and we&#x27;re just as screwed as everyone else w/o insurance... maybe more, considering the rates of on-the-job injuries from lifting and moving patients who can&#x27;t move themselves. But I digress.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, there are occasions when all of these problems flare up simultaneously. At my current job (hospital RN), I have to use computers -- laptops, which pronate and cramp your arms as you type -- but at least I can raise the tray tables on which we use them to the level of my ribs. However, if I was grinding my teeth the night before, if there&#x27;s a huge temperature change at work (because HVAC systems are so reliable where I work... not) or a vent blowing directly on me, if my shoulder/neck/upper back were already stiff from a flare-up of MPS, if I can&#x27;t raise the workstation on which I use my laptop (or if other team members come and lower it when I&#x27;ve stepped away), I can be in for a nasty tension headache/neckache. It&#x27;s like every muscle in my face, jaw, scalp, head, neck, and shoulders spasm at the same time and remain clenched even though I&#x27;m trying desperately to relax it all. The pain is excruciating and because it is muscle spasm based, none of the normal methods make it go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twice in the last six months I&#x27;ve had these muscle-spasm based headaches/neckaches. They&#x27;re excruciating. If asked to rate the pain, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a 12 on a 0-10 scale. And all the ibuprofen or naproxen or Norco or Vicodin or even hot showers or all of these things combined sometimes can&#x27;t stop it. A deep tissue massage would, but try getting a massage appointment on an &amp;#34;emergency&amp;#34; basis -- basically, that doesn&#x27;t exist. And my chiropractor cut his office hours and his massage staff anyway, if I even could get in on an emergency basis. So there I am, curled in a fetal position in a blistering hot shower, moaning with involuntary tears coming out of my eyes because the pain. is. so. BAD. And nothing will make it go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw the needle mats/spike mats on Amazon and first read about them, they intrigued me. The theory -- that the pain of hundreds of tiny plastic spikes would release your body&#x27;s own endorphins to combat the OTHER massive pain you&#x27;re having -- makes sense. Or maybe hundreds of little pains all down your back distracts your nervous system from the BIG pain in your head/neck. So I bought one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I received it, I tried laying on it. It didn&#x27;t do much good to lay on it in a thin T-shirt, although I could feel the spikes somewhat through my shirt. So I tried laying on it shirtless. That was bracing and, well, painful, but I&#x27;ve had much worse. Much MUCH worse. And, due to my various chronic pain problems, I have a high tolerance for pain. After about 15 minutes, it felt less like pain and more like my entire back was lightly vibrating or buzzing. After 20 minutes, I had this feeling of great calm. I got up and felt shockingly rejuvenated. I was a little surprised. I expected it to work -- so that probably helped -- but I didn&#x27;t expect it to work that well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The proof is in the pudding, though. A few months later I had the first of my two major tension/muscle spasm headaches/neckaches. I could feel it coming on and desperately took 800mg of ibuprofen to try to stop it. Fail. I took some naproxen (Aleve) to boost the ibuprofen (probably placing myself at increased risk of GI bleed, but I was desperate). Nothing, not a dent in my pain. By this time the pain had escalated from 7-8 to 9-10. So I took a Norco 10/325. Would you believe, NOTHING. (Yes. Because the pain is muscle spasm based, not actually *pain* based... so narcotics don&#x27;t do anything for it by that point.) I put a moist heat pad on my neck/back of my head and laid down in the dark. Still no relief. I took a hot shower, really hot, hoping it would relax the muscles. It did, a bit, but only brought it down from 12 out of 10 to 9 or 10 out of 10. This is the point at which death begins to seem like a good alternative to the pain you&#x27;re in. No one but someone who&#x27;s been through the same thing can understand how this kind of pain can grind you down as it goes on, hour after hour, sometimes day after day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After over 12 hours of excruciating pain, I remembered: I have that needle mat! I couldn&#x27;t take any more pain killers (non-narcotic or narcotic) for hours, and they weren&#x27;t helping anyway. So I pulled it out of the closet, laid it on the floor, and laid flat down on it so that the occipital knob on the back of my head was level with the top edge of the mat. Essentially the mat was covering 3/4 of my spine, from halfway up the back of my head (where your spine begins) to about lower mid-back (mid-thoracic vertebrae). I laid on it for 40 minutes. I know you&#x27;re not supposed to lay on it that long, but though my pain was significantly decreased at 20 minutes, 6-7/10 is still a lot of pain and I knew I couldn&#x27;t take more pills for *hours*.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By the 40 minute mark my pain was down to 0-1/10. Now, maybe it was all those drugs finally taking effect... but they should have taken effect hours and hours before. Maybe it was laying flat on my back on the floor; that helps with back spasms, but not so much with head/neck spasms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, the needle mat was the only thing to break the pain cycle I was trapped in for nearly 16 hours. It was the only thing, in the end, that truly relieved the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was good for a couple months after that, no major flare-ups. But then, on my freakin&#x27; birthday, I had another one. And I went through the same cycle -- felt it coming on, took meds to try to head it off, failed; took more meds; no help; took the narcotics I reserve for only this bad level of pain; they didn&#x27;t work; hot/moist packs didn&#x27;t work; hot shower didn&#x27;t work. I had forgotten about my needle mat. But in the midst of my desperate agony of pain, I remembered it. Asked my bf to bring it to me (I was already on the floor flat on my back by this point). He brought it, I unrolled it, and this time I put a pillow under it so the needles were raised and would press harder into the back of my head and the back of my neck (as well as my upper back/shoulders, mid back, etc.). And, once again, by about 30-35 min later, my pain was reduced from about 12/10 to 2/10. Then it went away entirely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two times I used it for severe pain, I didn&#x27;t get the feeling of rejuvenation. Just exhausted relief at the cessation of pain, and the joy of having the pain gone.But I don&#x27;t care. These things are amazing. If you have a high tolerance for pain, you&#x27;ll easily be able to use these to deal with your most serious pain. If, however, you&#x27;re a lightweight when it comes to pain, and you can&#x27;t take it, you&#x27;ll probably find it difficult to impossible to actually lay on one of these needle/spike mats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go for it. You have nothing to lose but your chronic pain... at least temporarily. I highly recommend it -- because, when nothing else worked, THIS worked.</li>
            <li> First of, super fast delivery! Second, my boyfriend and I laid on this mat and ouch! But if you stick it out you experience a tingling and then warmth and relaxation. My boyfriend fell asleep on it after 4 minutes! I could time him every time. 4 minutes flat. But don&#x27;t lay on it longer than it recommends or it leaves deeper holes in your skin.&lt;br /&gt;We would rather try a holistic approach to our health woes first before we see any doctors and this worked. Highly recommend ! And it&#x27;s affordable!</li>
            <li> This is the best thing! you can use socks if your feet are tender to walk on it or bare foot if you can take it. I use it every morning to walk across to jump start my body. when I think about it I will lay on it, it feels wonderful.</li>
            <li> Upon opening the box in the company of a friend, we immediately laughed, called it the \\&quot;death bed,\\&quot; and I planned on returning it. Immediately. What had I been thinking? First, I should say I have been on an eternally exhaustive quest for anything that will ease my neck and back pain. I have 4 sets of protruding discs in my cervical spine that cause constant neck and back pain.&lt;br /&gt;Alone in my apartment, I thought I&#x27;d check it out for just a sec. (I had heavy clothing on, mind you) before I taped it up for return. I made sure to only let my back touch it, as my neck is just too fragile at this point.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how or why- and I don&#x27;t care- but this thing WorKS! It doesn&#x27;t hurt, it feels relaxing, like the pain and stiffness are melting away. I used it more toward the coccyx rather than neck area. You will have to choose, because the mat is small; I don&#x27;t recall that being mentioned in the details. people. That is my only complaint-it is not long enough and I don&#x27;t recall that being mentioned in the details-but that qualm is eclipsed by it&#x27;s mighty power of easing my pain and tension.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be happier or more surprised about this product. As I said, it was bound for USPS. Thank goodness for curiosity. I have constant back pain, which felt as if it melted away upon laying on this crazy-looking thing. I read a review before in which the poor person&#x27;s pain was so bad, s/he couldn&#x27;t bear to lay on the floor. You don&#x27;t have to. Bring it to bed with you. You may drift off. I don&#x27;t know how long is too long; my advice is to set a timer.&lt;br /&gt;A word of caution-*do not step on it by mistake* :/&lt;br /&gt;This thing is a miracle. It looks like a wacky outer-space toy, but it&#x27;s a prickly little miracle.&lt;br /&gt;ThaNk YOU!&lt;br /&gt;Addendum-My love for this grows. I can now comfortably shed the thin T-shirt for maximum effect. A few words of caution-give a good 45 minutes before doing anything topless because you will be red as a ripened vine tomato.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I never do product reviews but I just had to for this.  i was skeptical this would work but was willihg to give it a shot.  Boy was I pleasantly suprised.  I have chronic back/shoulder problems and get massages often, but the same places continue to be painful.  Until i started using this mat.  I cannot begin to tell you how much this product helped me.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> It has not really relieved my problem, but it seems to help to an extent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s it what more can I say.</li>
            <li> i saw acupressure mats at bed, bath ad beyond and fell in love. ordered this one and it makes me feel like my skin is on fire.. i accidently stepped on it the second day i had it and it punctured my foot with 6 of the needle points... BE CAREFUL!! the mat is versatile, can set feet and legs on it, can lay on the floor or sit in a chair, can even roll it up and place under your neck (my favorite for headaches)</li>
            <li> I lay on this mat with my bare back from the start. At first I could hardly feel the spikes. The more I use it, the more my nerves seem to wake up. It is still not difficult for me to lay on, but I can feel moe of what other reviewers say it feels like. The muscle pain I have is some relieved as I lay on it. Sometimes I lay on it 2x in one day. I feel it was $22 well spent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this mat is actually effective but we like to use it. It&#x27;s become more of an entertainment piece for us than a useful one. But for the price it was worth it!</li>
            <li> friend had the foot mat and spoke highly of his results so I chose the mat for my back - it was exactly what I expected - price was great and it arrived in 2 days</li>
