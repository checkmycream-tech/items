            <li> Overall it is great. I think it does remove the dust and residue from makeup. But i&#x27;m not really sure about the wrinkles though.. But my acne scars got lighter than before. You must wear sunblock the nextday! Avoid the sun!</li>

            <li> I love this! It makes bright and smooth my face and helps easy to accept other skin care products.</li>
            <li> I love this product. With my face flashes. It is recommended for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;Exfoliation, facial settlement.&lt;br /&gt;Repurchase plan to continue to use.</li>
            <li> This was a what I expected product.&lt;br /&gt;and delivery was also fast.</li>
            <li> when I got the rapdex, the case was broken. I was a little disappointed but it was ok because the real things inside was fine.&lt;br /&gt;However once I have opened one of 14 rapidexs for the first time, the cotton applicator was supposed to get wet with serum but it was dried. I could not use it and then I opened another one, it was fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;personally, I love Rapidex but I am not happy that I got defective product..</li>

            <li> It is little irritating. It could make your skin red and feel burn. If you have a sensative skin, I do not recommand this product.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t work.... this product is not good for my skin . :(</li>
