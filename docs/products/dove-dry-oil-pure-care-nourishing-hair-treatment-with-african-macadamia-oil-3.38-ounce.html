            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>So nice to find something that works with heat and makes my hair look and feel so healthy!</li>
            <li>either way, my hair is easy to manage, smells nice, non-sticky and feels and  looks great.  </li>
            <li>It also works amazing as a hand moisturizer as well.</li>

            <li>Smells nice too.</li>
            <li>nice shine</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a nice product, but plan ahead before use.</li>
            <li>I really liked the way my hair felt after using it</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and I like the effect this has on damaged ends by smoothing and restoring shine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to use.</li>
            <li>Happiness  :-)</li>
            <li>It does impart a nice shine and it made my hair softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>found I also liked the aroma.  </li>
            <li>in nicely and does not make my hair oily</li>
            <li>This is a nice, rich oil that tames flyaway hair and conditions very nicely.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to try the Dove hair oil, and found it works exceptionally well.</li>
            <li>then purchased a full size bottle which is really good size and a really good price..</li>
            <li>Its all supposed to put shine in your hair, repair damage, stop fly aways, smooth hair....and mostly they all kind of work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It may be great for many types and conditions of hair, but this is not the product to use if you have fine hair.</li>
            <li>I love it and very fast delivery!!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The oil has a pleasant, light scent.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very strong.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of this stuff, kind of like baby oil</li>
            <li>It smells nice and works ok, but the bottle being glass</li>
            <li>it is much more cheaper than another brand of hair oil, and with lower price, it still does a amazing job.</li>
            <li>If you have very fine hair, I would try something else.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine</li>
            <li>I love love love love this stuff</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this product...</li>
            <li>And on top of the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>I will buy again.!! :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s shinier, and more manageable.</li>
            <li>The container tipped over in my cabinet, and the pump on top came off.</li>
            <li>Since this could be an anomalous flaw I didn&#x27;t take more off the star rating</li>
            <li>so I became aggressive in getting more.  </li>
            <li>I am  glad I persevered until I found the product</li>
            <li>I love this stuff..  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores any more, so I ordered it thru Amazon.</li>
            <li>I prefer Moroccan Oil which does have a shiny and more manageable effect on my hair</li>
            <li>is at the top of my list.  </li>
            <li>I use just a touch throughout my hair and more product on the ends.</li>
            <li>One of the better oils I&#x27;ve tried over the years.  </li>
            <li>I deal with dryness and fly-aways and have tried many products.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is hefty and very attractive, the pump applicator gives just a tiny bit with each pump.</li>
            <li>And even after washing my hands many times (we don&#x27;t have a dishwasher, and my hands are in soapy water...</li>
            <li>personally I love it not ever body</li>
            <li>It helps keep my ends healthy from heat styling.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is awesome and it has become a part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe I&#x27;ll get more expert with it over time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m mentioning this so the manufacturer will consider packing it better.  </li>
            <li>I put on a lot more than directed</li>
            <li>This works alright for that, but for the price, I&#x27;ve found better and cheaper in Organix moroccan penetrating oil.</li>
            <li>An over-powering fragrance may not appeal to everyone but the multi-purpose use of this item is appealing.</li>
            <li>I think I think I&#x27;ll use this on more than just my hair.  </li>
            <li>This nourishing oil does a great job of tamping down fly away hairs and leaves their hair shiny and sleek.  </li>
            <li>It works wonderful for my dry hair.</li>
            <li>A light, but pleasant, scent at first, but it seems to go</li>
            <li>Love the smell and how light it is.</li>
            <li>Smells great leaves hair so silky and soft</li>
            <li>It is light, silky feeling and exotic smelling.</li>
            <li>love love love makes my hair super soft and smells good</li>
            <li>Goes into my hair easily and doesn&#x27;t make it oily at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s easy to misjudge the amount needed.</li>
            <li>This might have been it if the smell wasn&#x27;t so dang strong.</li>
            <li>one thing I can tell, the smell is too strong and it is making me dizzy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why the companies have to do this, why to put so strong smell.  </li>
            <li>Still not &amp;#34;hair model&amp;#34; worthy, but pretty good.</li>
            <li>However, the treatment doesn&#x27;t appear to be having any long-term healing effects on my hair, which is fine</li>
            <li>I have fine, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>Its fine, wavy, frizzy and a bit color and heat damaged.  </li>
            <li>It has a very light, fresh scent.</li>
            <li>This hair oil has a nice smell that I found pleasant enough, and not overpowering with the two or three pumps&#x27; worth I applied.</li>
            <li>To top it off, it comes in a pump bottle, so it is easy to get just the right amount.</li>
            <li>I also found that it made a huge difference when using a blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>Helps with friz in humidity as well which is a huge bonus.</li>
            <li>Overall, great hair oil.</li>
            <li>Light, not greasy.  </li>
            <li>I received this for free for my review as part of the Amazon Vine program.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Macadamia is a fantastic scent.  </li>
            <li>now have enough of this great product to share with my daughter.  </li>
            <li>: This review is based on a free Advance Review Copy of this product provided through Amazon Vine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had no issue with using tongs and the heat did not affect the light gloss</li>
            <li>Along with the Organix oil, I also enjoy using the One n&#x27;</li>
            <li>When I followed the instructions to apply from the middle to the ends of the hair, my hair had great body and bounce after a blow-dry with a boar&#x27;s hair brush.</li>
            <li>My hair definitely looks healthier when I use it, having great touchability and scent, and added body to my hair style.</li>
            <li>Too oily for my fine hair, but worked fairly well on more course dry hair.</li>
            <li>Smells really good and makes my hair super soft.</li>
            <li>I had originally bought a bottle at Wal-Mart</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the original Moroccan oil that sells for $45</li>
            <li>I originally got a small sample of this in my Walmart beauty box, and immediately was blown away by how awesome it was.</li>
            <li>i must say i was excited to try this oil.  </li>
            <li>Not only did I like the scent, but as an Ojon user I found this item much more cost effective and easier to use.  </li>
            <li>During dry winter months, one pump, rubbing into the hands does a great job of controlling frenzies.  </li>
            <li>When I opened the package, I was surprised to see that the oil was in a lovely glass bottle with a spray top.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing, makes my hair soft and manageable for days after using this product, even after a wash or two.....</li>
            <li>so I had to buy a full size.  </li>
            <li>After reading many of the other reviews posted here, I have to agree, this is a beautifully packaged, high quality product.</li>
            <li>Some of the product seeped out into the box, but luckily everything else in the box was covered in plastic.</li>
            <li>Makes my fine curly blonde locks gorgeously curly without the heaviness, or too much shine.</li>
            <li>It has a light fragrance and works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>These products are great if you use a flat iron because they fry your hair and these oil treatments really help a lot.</li>
            <li>I love to try all the new oil products for hair.</li>
            <li>My hair combs through easily, then dries reasonably well-controlled.</li>
            <li>Not sure if I will reorder, but it seems like good stuff with healthy ingredients for your hair.</li>
            <li>Be warned, you can easily use too much of this product and leave your hair feeling greasy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This design probably keeps the oil from oxidizing too quickly, and keeping it fresh longer.</li>
            <li>Exactly As described!</li>
            <li>Nice light oil treatment for dry hair.</li>
            <li>hair is a golden blond, fine and straight.</li>
            <li>It helps your layers stay separate and distinct as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far I think this is my favorite oil of the three I&#x27;ve tested.</li>
            <li>It is also economical.</li>
            <li>but I think maybe using this after the shower or in the morning BEFORE I style it might be useful.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light-weight, smells great, and seems to tame his hair.</li>
            <li>For me I have been using 2 to 3 pumps and that seems to be the right amount for me.</li>
            <li>I use it on the ends of my hair and if you do it right</li>
            <li>my hair just slides right through my fingers.. if it were not for the sample being on the shampoo I would never know about this product because after I saw the trial size I looked to see if it was sold separately but could not find it at rite aid or cvs.</li>
            <li>Bumps up the right amount of softness and seduction to attract lots of attention, and lure them to your mermaid tresses.</li>
            <li>I used another drop on my elbows and it soaked right into my skin.  </li>
            <li>Light weight oil, smells decent</li>
            <li>It has a clean smell that I really like</li>
            <li>but a little more sophisticated.</li>
            <li>I liked the idea of African Macadamia Oil--macadamias are so creamy that it seems they would really nourish the hair as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a variety of oils from the popular high end ones to those sold in the ethnic beauty shops and the Dove Nourishing Treatment with African Macadamia Oil</li>
            <li>It serves the purpose of conditioner very well!</li>
            <li>I tried many different times and ways to reassemble it, but it would not go back on, except to perch on the top of the lower portion of the pump mechanism.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the shine last about a day.</li>
            <li>I will say that when this is in my hair, it does soften the ends and gives a pretty shine that I like.</li>
            <li>Mostly at the sides of my head and around the back to control the frizz.  </li>
            <li>I love this product for my short frizzy hair!</li>
            <li>have frizzy hair that gets dry and damaged very easily.</li>
            <li>The only people who look great with wet looking hair are models, and that is not my profession.  </li>
            <li>first ingredient is cyclopentalsiloxane which is a type of fast drying silicone.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So, having come to terms with this conditionerless hair washing method, I still find myself yearning for a way to smooth and tame fly-away hair, especially in the winter when static has my fine hair standing up in all directions.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try Dove Nourishing Treatment with African Macadamia Oil for many different reasons.</li>
            <li>I love this treatment for my very long hair!</li>
            <li>If your hair is particularly susceptible to products creating a greasy look, be aware that this is probably not the &amp;#34;lightweight&amp;#34; nourishing treatment you are looking for.  </li>
            <li>After washing, I&#x27;ve started using two tiny squirts of the Dove Nourishing Treatment, worked lightly into my wet hair, mostly on the surface and ends.</li>
            <li>I then started putting it on before straightening my hair and it just made my hair look very greasy.</li>
            <li>Overall, a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>and sometimes I forget, but it feels very nourishing (</li>
            <li>although VERY oily...</li>
            <li>They definitely need to replace the pump with something that can handle light pressure and remain attached.    </li>
            <li>I was also looking for a product that was a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I ordered 4 bottles from Amazon.com at a real savings.  </li>
            <li>so i really have to use product to keep my hair shiny.  </li>
            <li>It is oil-based so it can leave an oily film if you use too much.  </li>
            <li>I really like this oil.</li>
            <li>really does leave hair very glossy</li>
            <li>I also tried to use this as a pre-shampoo treatment, but it did absolutely nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li>do as much in regards to hair health to justify the price, or as much as I would like.</li>
            <li>I have very finicky hair.  </li>
            <li>product was super easy to use: Just pump 3 to 4 times and massage into your hair starting from mid length to tips.</li>
            <li>using just a small amount of this stuff makes it look like my hair is fresh, healthy, and perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I can use all the help I can get when it comes to protecting the ends of my hair which over time just die even if I really try not to cook them with the high heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dove</li>
            <li>A bit high priced for Dove, but like most of their other mid-range products.</li>
            <li>But I was very surprised at how light it actually was on my hair.</li>
            <li>This has to be the number one deal breaker for me because I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to smells, and I happen to not like the smell of baby powder.</li>
            <li>Love the way this product controls my hair without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li>It helps keep the static down.</li>
            <li>Live it!</li>
            <li>The pump bottle is convenient for portioning it out; sometimes I want less, sometimes I want more.  </li>
            <li>The reality is more mundane.  </li>
            <li>I found that, though use of this product helped with &#x27;de-tangling&#x27; and softening, after a few hours my hair seemed to have developed a mind of its own.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend.</li>
            <li>It sounds strange, but it actually works very well, but with this warning: only do this if you have good, soft water.</li>
            <li>recommend this more highly for people will curly, frizzy hair and/or dead ends.</li>
            <li>: Very shiny, soft hair.  </li>
            <li>I have to recommend it to anyone with frizz hair or people who have to use special products that dry the hair out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several conditioners and leave-in treatments, and haven&#x27;t found the right balance of hair help without the greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>took me several applications to get the right</li>
            <li>There is always some new thing for hair...</li>
            <li>My own hair is dry and extremely curly.</li>
            <li>very old lady-ish to me.  </li>
            <li>it makes my hair soooooo soft!</li>
            <li>Just The price was pretty higher than some other place.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend started using it on his hair as well and has nearly drained the sample bottle!</li>
            <li>A little goes a long long way also, so your really getting a good value for your money.</li>
            <li>This hair treatment provided a slight gloss to my hair where it is smooth</li>
            <li>I usually use my blow-dryer and curling iron daily, so I did feel like the oil was protecting my hair from heat damage, while giving it a nice shine.</li>
            <li>My hair ends up perfectly smooth, soft but not weighed down.  </li>
            <li>I used a tiny drop, rubbed between both hands, on my dry, flyaway (from static electricity) bangs and crown of my already styled hair, and the flyaways laid right down without making my hair greasy.</li>
            <li>As for the rest of my hair, I just smooth on a little oil and this product makes hair shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li>I have long, straight, blonde, dry hair that has a tendency to get oily very quick.  </li>
            <li>and it leaves my skin so smoothe and soft.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t use conditioner, you can&#x27;t use shampoo, as shampoo strips the hair of all natural oils.</li>
            <li>I have been happier with creamier products, or the (much cheaper) oils such as coconut.    </li>
            <li>( I purchase directly in person from a salon though, because you can never trust online from here for authenticity)</li>
            <li>I bought this item because when I bought my dove shampoo intense repair and conditioner it had a trial size dove nourishing treatment with African macadamia oil</li>
            <li>Leaves hair feeling soft, but not oily.</li>
            <li>Makes hair feel soft.</li>
            <li>My hair felt so soft...</li>
            <li>Love it, use it on my daughter&#x27;s fine/wavy hair as detangler; use it on my curly thick hair to revitalize and moisturize my curls every day.  </li>
            <li>I read other reviews before purchasing, especially from others with fine hair.</li>
            <li>was trying to imagine how big this bottle was going to be, as 3.38oz sounded kind of small to me, and it ended up being a lot bigger than I was expecting it to be.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this product works for other people, as other reviewers swear by it, but for me it just didn&#x27;t do the trick.</li>
            <li>I apply the treatment  evenly as directed four drops for me because my hair is so long and full, then blow dry,</li>
            <li>I first tried using it per the instructions on damp hair and saw absolutely no difference.</li>
            <li>B00HM6K6XQ Dove Pure Care Dry Oil Conditioner, 12 Ounce]]</li>
            <li>Not heavy enough for our daughter&#x27;s bi-racial naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>However, I had to gauge how much to use by trial and error since I used a little too much at first and possibly used it too close to my roots, so my hair was flatter than I wanted when I woke up</li>
            <li>I have typical Asian hair, and I normally use this oil (and any other kind of hair oil) when my hair is damp, and I rub a pea size amount of the oil into the tips of my hair and blow dry.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a major difference in just 2 months of use of softer healthier hair.</li>
            <li>At first I agreed with other posters, &amp;#34;Oooh,</li>
            <li>First I am not allergic to the spray and second it stats that it is a dry oil treatment.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and not at all greasy, even two days later.  </li>
            <li>Also, even though it says argan and moroccan oil in the name of the Dove oil, the actual oils are pretty far down the ingredient list.</li>
            <li>I have very dry and frizzy hair due to the special shampoo &amp; conditioners I have to use because of an allergy to sulfates.</li>
            <li>But as I have almost no sense of smell, this concerns me, because the fact that I can smell it might mean that it has a powerful scent to folks with a normal sense of smell.</li>
            <li>When I first used it, I was worried because it was slightly thicker than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>It also didn&#x27;t help my frizzies.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is large and goes a long way, especially if you only use 2-3 squirts at a time.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell if it is making any lasting effect on my hair, but after applying my hair is shinier and a little  moother (though not 5x worth).</li>
            <li>I also tried this in my friend&#x27;s hair, which is thick, long, and coarse, and it made much more of a difference in silkiness.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would rate this below an average silicone hair treatment since I find it does not give as much gloss.  </li>
            <li>(expectedly, just like other oils).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s really worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a variety of oils on my long, thick, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair tends to get a bit frizzy in the heat and this really helps it stay down.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just not sure it&#x27;s worth the cost, especially when it&#x27;s just glorified mineral oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its nice, and a teensy bit goes a long way..especially in my hair with is very thin and gets oily as the day goes by anyway.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this treatment on my ends for a few weeks now, and I have mixed feelings that are overall positive.</li>

            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> So nice to find something that works with heat and makes my hair look and feel so healthy!</li>
            <li> either way, my hair is easy to manage, smells nice, non-sticky and feels and  looks great.  </li>
            <li> It also works amazing as a hand moisturizer as well.</li>

            <li> Smells nice too.</li>
            <li> nice shine</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a nice product, but plan ahead before use.</li>
            <li> I really liked the way my hair felt after using it</li>
            <li> The smell is nice and I like the effect this has on damaged ends by smoothing and restoring shine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to use.</li>
            <li> Happiness  :-)</li>
            <li> It does impart a nice shine and it made my hair softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> found I also liked the aroma.  </li>
            <li> in nicely and does not make my hair oily</li>
            <li> This is a nice, rich oil that tames flyaway hair and conditions very nicely.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to try the Dove hair oil, and found it works exceptionally well.</li>
            <li> then purchased a full size bottle which is really good size and a really good price..</li>
            <li> Its all supposed to put shine in your hair, repair damage, stop fly aways, smooth hair....and mostly they all kind of work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It may be great for many types and conditions of hair, but this is not the product to use if you have fine hair.</li>
            <li> I love it and very fast delivery!!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The oil has a pleasant, light scent.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very strong.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell of this stuff, kind of like baby oil</li>
            <li> It smells nice and works ok, but the bottle being glass</li>
            <li> it is much more cheaper than another brand of hair oil, and with lower price, it still does a amazing job.</li>
            <li> If you have very fine hair, I would try something else.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine</li>
            <li> I love love love love this stuff</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product...</li>
            <li> And on top of the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> I will buy again.!! :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shinier, and more manageable.</li>
            <li> The container tipped over in my cabinet, and the pump on top came off.</li>
            <li> Since this could be an anomalous flaw I didn&#x27;t take more off the star rating</li>
            <li> so I became aggressive in getting more.  </li>
            <li> I am  glad I persevered until I found the product</li>
            <li> I love this stuff..  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores any more, so I ordered it thru Amazon.</li>
            <li> I prefer Moroccan Oil which does have a shiny and more manageable effect on my hair</li>
            <li> is at the top of my list.  </li>
            <li> I use just a touch throughout my hair and more product on the ends.</li>
            <li> One of the better oils I&#x27;ve tried over the years.  </li>
            <li> I deal with dryness and fly-aways and have tried many products.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is hefty and very attractive, the pump applicator gives just a tiny bit with each pump.</li>
            <li> And even after washing my hands many times (we don&#x27;t have a dishwasher, and my hands are in soapy water...</li>
            <li> personally I love it not ever body</li>
            <li> It helps keep my ends healthy from heat styling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is awesome and it has become a part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe I&#x27;ll get more expert with it over time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mentioning this so the manufacturer will consider packing it better.  </li>
            <li> I put on a lot more than directed</li>
            <li> This works alright for that, but for the price, I&#x27;ve found better and cheaper in Organix moroccan penetrating oil.</li>
            <li> An over-powering fragrance may not appeal to everyone but the multi-purpose use of this item is appealing.</li>
            <li> I think I think I&#x27;ll use this on more than just my hair.  </li>
            <li> This nourishing oil does a great job of tamping down fly away hairs and leaves their hair shiny and sleek.  </li>
            <li> It works wonderful for my dry hair.</li>
            <li> A light, but pleasant, scent at first, but it seems to go</li>
            <li> Love the smell and how light it is.</li>
            <li> Smells great leaves hair so silky and soft</li>
            <li> It is light, silky feeling and exotic smelling.</li>
            <li> love love love makes my hair super soft and smells good</li>
            <li> Goes into my hair easily and doesn&#x27;t make it oily at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to misjudge the amount needed.</li>
            <li> This might have been it if the smell wasn&#x27;t so dang strong.</li>
            <li> one thing I can tell, the smell is too strong and it is making me dizzy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why the companies have to do this, why to put so strong smell.  </li>
            <li> Still not &amp;#34;hair model&amp;#34; worthy, but pretty good.</li>
            <li> However, the treatment doesn&#x27;t appear to be having any long-term healing effects on my hair, which is fine</li>
            <li> I have fine, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Its fine, wavy, frizzy and a bit color and heat damaged.  </li>
            <li> It has a very light, fresh scent.</li>
            <li> This hair oil has a nice smell that I found pleasant enough, and not overpowering with the two or three pumps&#x27; worth I applied.</li>
            <li> To top it off, it comes in a pump bottle, so it is easy to get just the right amount.</li>
            <li> I also found that it made a huge difference when using a blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> Helps with friz in humidity as well which is a huge bonus.</li>
            <li> Overall, great hair oil.</li>
            <li> Light, not greasy.  </li>
            <li> I received this for free for my review as part of the Amazon Vine program.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Macadamia is a fantastic scent.  </li>
            <li> now have enough of this great product to share with my daughter.  </li>
            <li> : This review is based on a free Advance Review Copy of this product provided through Amazon Vine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had no issue with using tongs and the heat did not affect the light gloss</li>
            <li> Along with the Organix oil, I also enjoy using the One n&#x27;</li>
            <li> When I followed the instructions to apply from the middle to the ends of the hair, my hair had great body and bounce after a blow-dry with a boar&#x27;s hair brush.</li>
            <li> My hair definitely looks healthier when I use it, having great touchability and scent, and added body to my hair style.</li>
            <li> Too oily for my fine hair, but worked fairly well on more course dry hair.</li>
            <li> Smells really good and makes my hair super soft.</li>
            <li> I had originally bought a bottle at Wal-Mart</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the original Moroccan oil that sells for $45</li>
            <li> I originally got a small sample of this in my Walmart beauty box, and immediately was blown away by how awesome it was.</li>
            <li> i must say i was excited to try this oil.  </li>
            <li> Not only did I like the scent, but as an Ojon user I found this item much more cost effective and easier to use.  </li>
            <li> During dry winter months, one pump, rubbing into the hands does a great job of controlling frenzies.  </li>
            <li> When I opened the package, I was surprised to see that the oil was in a lovely glass bottle with a spray top.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, makes my hair soft and manageable for days after using this product, even after a wash or two.....</li>
            <li> so I had to buy a full size.  </li>
            <li> After reading many of the other reviews posted here, I have to agree, this is a beautifully packaged, high quality product.</li>
            <li> Some of the product seeped out into the box, but luckily everything else in the box was covered in plastic.</li>
            <li> Makes my fine curly blonde locks gorgeously curly without the heaviness, or too much shine.</li>
            <li> It has a light fragrance and works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> These products are great if you use a flat iron because they fry your hair and these oil treatments really help a lot.</li>
            <li> I love to try all the new oil products for hair.</li>
            <li> My hair combs through easily, then dries reasonably well-controlled.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I will reorder, but it seems like good stuff with healthy ingredients for your hair.</li>
            <li> Be warned, you can easily use too much of this product and leave your hair feeling greasy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This design probably keeps the oil from oxidizing too quickly, and keeping it fresh longer.</li>
            <li> Exactly As described!</li>
            <li> Nice light oil treatment for dry hair.</li>
            <li> hair is a golden blond, fine and straight.</li>
            <li> It helps your layers stay separate and distinct as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far I think this is my favorite oil of the three I&#x27;ve tested.</li>
            <li> It is also economical.</li>
            <li> but I think maybe using this after the shower or in the morning BEFORE I style it might be useful.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light-weight, smells great, and seems to tame his hair.</li>
            <li> For me I have been using 2 to 3 pumps and that seems to be the right amount for me.</li>
            <li> I use it on the ends of my hair and if you do it right</li>
            <li> my hair just slides right through my fingers.. if it were not for the sample being on the shampoo I would never know about this product because after I saw the trial size I looked to see if it was sold separately but could not find it at rite aid or cvs.</li>
            <li> Bumps up the right amount of softness and seduction to attract lots of attention, and lure them to your mermaid tresses.</li>
            <li> I used another drop on my elbows and it soaked right into my skin.  </li>
            <li> Light weight oil, smells decent</li>
            <li> It has a clean smell that I really like</li>
            <li> but a little more sophisticated.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of African Macadamia Oil--macadamias are so creamy that it seems they would really nourish the hair as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a variety of oils from the popular high end ones to those sold in the ethnic beauty shops and the Dove Nourishing Treatment with African Macadamia Oil</li>
            <li> It serves the purpose of conditioner very well!</li>
            <li> I tried many different times and ways to reassemble it, but it would not go back on, except to perch on the top of the lower portion of the pump mechanism.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the shine last about a day.</li>
            <li> I will say that when this is in my hair, it does soften the ends and gives a pretty shine that I like.</li>
            <li> Mostly at the sides of my head and around the back to control the frizz.  </li>
            <li> I love this product for my short frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> have frizzy hair that gets dry and damaged very easily.</li>
            <li> The only people who look great with wet looking hair are models, and that is not my profession.  </li>
            <li> first ingredient is cyclopentalsiloxane which is a type of fast drying silicone.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So, having come to terms with this conditionerless hair washing method, I still find myself yearning for a way to smooth and tame fly-away hair, especially in the winter when static has my fine hair standing up in all directions.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try Dove Nourishing Treatment with African Macadamia Oil for many different reasons.</li>
            <li> I love this treatment for my very long hair!</li>
            <li> If your hair is particularly susceptible to products creating a greasy look, be aware that this is probably not the &amp;#34;lightweight&amp;#34; nourishing treatment you are looking for.  </li>
            <li> After washing, I&#x27;ve started using two tiny squirts of the Dove Nourishing Treatment, worked lightly into my wet hair, mostly on the surface and ends.</li>
            <li> I then started putting it on before straightening my hair and it just made my hair look very greasy.</li>
            <li> Overall, a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> and sometimes I forget, but it feels very nourishing (</li>
            <li> although VERY oily...</li>
            <li> They definitely need to replace the pump with something that can handle light pressure and remain attached.    </li>
            <li> I was also looking for a product that was a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I ordered 4 bottles from Amazon.com at a real savings.  </li>
            <li> so i really have to use product to keep my hair shiny.  </li>
            <li> It is oil-based so it can leave an oily film if you use too much.  </li>
            <li> I really like this oil.</li>
            <li> really does leave hair very glossy</li>
            <li> I also tried to use this as a pre-shampoo treatment, but it did absolutely nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li> do as much in regards to hair health to justify the price, or as much as I would like.</li>
            <li> I have very finicky hair.  </li>
            <li> product was super easy to use: Just pump 3 to 4 times and massage into your hair starting from mid length to tips.</li>
            <li> using just a small amount of this stuff makes it look like my hair is fresh, healthy, and perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I can use all the help I can get when it comes to protecting the ends of my hair which over time just die even if I really try not to cook them with the high heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dove</li>
            <li> A bit high priced for Dove, but like most of their other mid-range products.</li>
            <li> But I was very surprised at how light it actually was on my hair.</li>
            <li> This has to be the number one deal breaker for me because I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to smells, and I happen to not like the smell of baby powder.</li>
            <li> Love the way this product controls my hair without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> It helps keep the static down.</li>
            <li> Live it!</li>
            <li> The pump bottle is convenient for portioning it out; sometimes I want less, sometimes I want more.  </li>
            <li> The reality is more mundane.  </li>
            <li> I found that, though use of this product helped with &#x27;de-tangling&#x27; and softening, after a few hours my hair seemed to have developed a mind of its own.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend.</li>
            <li> It sounds strange, but it actually works very well, but with this warning: only do this if you have good, soft water.</li>
            <li> recommend this more highly for people will curly, frizzy hair and/or dead ends.</li>
            <li> : Very shiny, soft hair.  </li>
            <li> I have to recommend it to anyone with frizz hair or people who have to use special products that dry the hair out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several conditioners and leave-in treatments, and haven&#x27;t found the right balance of hair help without the greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> took me several applications to get the right</li>
            <li> There is always some new thing for hair...</li>
            <li> My own hair is dry and extremely curly.</li>
            <li> very old lady-ish to me.  </li>
            <li> it makes my hair soooooo soft!</li>
            <li> Just The price was pretty higher than some other place.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend started using it on his hair as well and has nearly drained the sample bottle!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long long way also, so your really getting a good value for your money.</li>
            <li> This hair treatment provided a slight gloss to my hair where it is smooth</li>
            <li> I usually use my blow-dryer and curling iron daily, so I did feel like the oil was protecting my hair from heat damage, while giving it a nice shine.</li>
            <li> My hair ends up perfectly smooth, soft but not weighed down.  </li>
            <li> I used a tiny drop, rubbed between both hands, on my dry, flyaway (from static electricity) bangs and crown of my already styled hair, and the flyaways laid right down without making my hair greasy.</li>
            <li> As for the rest of my hair, I just smooth on a little oil and this product makes hair shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li> I have long, straight, blonde, dry hair that has a tendency to get oily very quick.  </li>
            <li> and it leaves my skin so smoothe and soft.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t use conditioner, you can&#x27;t use shampoo, as shampoo strips the hair of all natural oils.</li>
            <li> I have been happier with creamier products, or the (much cheaper) oils such as coconut.    </li>
            <li> ( I purchase directly in person from a salon though, because you can never trust online from here for authenticity)</li>
            <li> I bought this item because when I bought my dove shampoo intense repair and conditioner it had a trial size dove nourishing treatment with African macadamia oil</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling soft, but not oily.</li>
            <li> Makes hair feel soft.</li>
            <li> My hair felt so soft...</li>
            <li> Love it, use it on my daughter&#x27;s fine/wavy hair as detangler; use it on my curly thick hair to revitalize and moisturize my curls every day.  </li>
            <li> I read other reviews before purchasing, especially from others with fine hair.</li>
            <li> was trying to imagine how big this bottle was going to be, as 3.38oz sounded kind of small to me, and it ended up being a lot bigger than I was expecting it to be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this product works for other people, as other reviewers swear by it, but for me it just didn&#x27;t do the trick.</li>
            <li> I apply the treatment  evenly as directed four drops for me because my hair is so long and full, then blow dry,</li>
            <li> I first tried using it per the instructions on damp hair and saw absolutely no difference.</li>
            <li> B00HM6K6XQ Dove Pure Care Dry Oil Conditioner, 12 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> Not heavy enough for our daughter&#x27;s bi-racial naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> However, I had to gauge how much to use by trial and error since I used a little too much at first and possibly used it too close to my roots, so my hair was flatter than I wanted when I woke up</li>
            <li> I have typical Asian hair, and I normally use this oil (and any other kind of hair oil) when my hair is damp, and I rub a pea size amount of the oil into the tips of my hair and blow dry.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a major difference in just 2 months of use of softer healthier hair.</li>
            <li> At first I agreed with other posters, &amp;#34;Oooh,</li>
            <li> First I am not allergic to the spray and second it stats that it is a dry oil treatment.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and not at all greasy, even two days later.  </li>
            <li> Also, even though it says argan and moroccan oil in the name of the Dove oil, the actual oils are pretty far down the ingredient list.</li>
            <li> I have very dry and frizzy hair due to the special shampoo &amp; conditioners I have to use because of an allergy to sulfates.</li>
            <li> But as I have almost no sense of smell, this concerns me, because the fact that I can smell it might mean that it has a powerful scent to folks with a normal sense of smell.</li>
            <li> When I first used it, I was worried because it was slightly thicker than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t help my frizzies.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is large and goes a long way, especially if you only use 2-3 squirts at a time.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if it is making any lasting effect on my hair, but after applying my hair is shinier and a little  moother (though not 5x worth).</li>
            <li> I also tried this in my friend&#x27;s hair, which is thick, long, and coarse, and it made much more of a difference in silkiness.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would rate this below an average silicone hair treatment since I find it does not give as much gloss.  </li>
            <li> (expectedly, just like other oils).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s really worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a variety of oils on my long, thick, fine hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair tends to get a bit frizzy in the heat and this really helps it stay down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not sure it&#x27;s worth the cost, especially when it&#x27;s just glorified mineral oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its nice, and a teensy bit goes a long way..especially in my hair with is very thin and gets oily as the day goes by anyway.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this treatment on my ends for a few weeks now, and I have mixed feelings that are overall positive.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first it being a Dove oil treatment, but was very please with it&#x27;s lightness.  </li>
            <li> lately - chlorine, a hot iron and some coloring.  </li>
            <li> You can use it on damp hair, but I use it after the flat iron to manage the ends and impart shine.  </li>
            <li> So would only recommend this for a course dry hair type.</li>
            <li> Oscar de La Renta has a dry oil spray that is a lot like this only its a perfume</li>
            <li> my hair is very thick and coarse and drinks any oil right up.  </li>
            <li> I have recently developed an interest in hair oils because I have long hair and oil seems to help keep tangles down.</li>
            <li> If you can get past the smell (or if you like it) then it&#x27;s probably a decent product.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally wavy and can get a little frizzy.</li>
            <li> This product tames your hair and conditions the dry ends from flat iron use.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time getting this item - Dove Dry Oil, Pure Care</li>
            <li> One pump goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Not a complete moisturizer but does job for sheen on wash n</li>
            <li> The bottle lasts a long, long time.</li>
            <li> Came in earlier than the expected date too.</li>
            <li> I had waited a bit too long in between hair cuts and gave it a try on the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thin, fine hair and this product didn&#x27;t seem to do anything.</li>
            <li> one is not any different than any other hair oil I have tried, including Argan oil.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this oil for daily or every other day use.</li>
            <li> and if any other Dove products have the same fragrance.</li>
            <li> I still have dry and damaged ends, and saw no difference at all when using this product.</li>
            <li> My hair still looked dry and frazzled.  </li>
            <li> It helps dry hair so well.</li>
            <li> it made my hair very shiny and soft, but unfortunately it did leave my hair a bit greasy.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a dry oil and went this this one because of the ratings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> after blow dry.</li>
            <li> (I wash and dry my hair at night).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nourishing and does well on damp hair, dry hair and a spot treatment for dry frizzy ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I apply a small amount to the ends of my hair, after a wash, and dry either naturally or blow dry...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no fun having to open the bottle every time you want to use the oil.  </li>
            <li> And in a glass bottle, so if you drop it on the tiled floor of your bathroom, it will probably smash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say to use three or four squirts and massage it into your hair from the middle of the shaft, down to the ends.  </li>
            <li> It is also very heavily scented, so beware if you are sensitive to scents.</li>
            <li> You can apply it on either dry or wet hair.  </li>
            <li> This one has a fragrance that is somewhat better than other oils, particularly Argon oil which just plain stinks!  </li>
            <li> I used only a little of the product on my shoulder-length hair and was pleased with the silkiness (no more noticeable than with other argan oil products), but my hair began looking dirty the next day and it was not as shiny as other products I use, so I can&#x27;t recommend it and won&#x27;t continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I rinse my hair at night and add it while it&#x27;s still wet.</li>
            <li> I used a few drops and applied them to only the ends of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and regularly use a flat iron</li>
            <li> I had been looking for something that would help my hair not feel so dried out after blow drying and flat ironing</li>
            <li> I only needed very little oil to spread it evenly throughout my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure, but the bottle will last forever.</li>
            <li> other thing that I didn&#x27;t like about this product was that the pump didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> The smell of this oil is extremely overpowering of baby powder and the smell lingers until you wash your hair again.</li>
            <li> Dove treatment is useful for treating hair that is tired and has been abused by winter, hard water, irons, dryers, or other things.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is that when I received it, the white pump was partially broken.</li>
            <li> From back in the day when I used mineral oil for suntanning, I have never liked the effect of mineral oil on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I tend to prefer to use it on wet, towel dried hair before styling.  </li>
            <li> Its not too heavy (if used minimally).</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make it feel weighted down</li>
            <li> You may as well rub it into your hands instead of washing your money down the sink trying to get it off.</li>
            <li> The Dove oil doesn&#x27;t weigh it down, and doesn&#x27;t make it look oily.</li>
            <li> It leaves it greasy and weighted down and not shiny at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Dove oil also seems to hydrate my hair without weighing it down or making it look oily.  </li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure how it will look after my hair gets dry but</li>
            <li> I apply it to towel dried hair, then blow-dry and flat iron as usual.  </li>
            <li> The bottles arrived less than a week later.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I find my hair to be softer and less frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I use less than a dime size amount on my shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> It did help; and it made my hair a bit less frizzy.</li>
            <li> it less frizzy&lt;br</li>
            <li> price is a little steep for a mass-market/drugstore item but less than comparable high-end drugstore ones.</li>
            <li> it is a little stronger scented than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> Cons:  a little greasy, and no help for the frizzies.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My frizz is way down as well!</li>
            <li> For my hair, which is very thick, that wasn&#x27;t nearly enough product.  </li>
            <li> on my hair dressers recommendation I started using this product before I blow dried</li>
            <li> I put a few pumps (about 5-6) in my palms, rubbed them together and then distributed it throughout my hair.</li>
            <li> No need in letting it go to waste after you finish rubbing it in your hair.</li>
            <li> Nothing spectacular but nothing horrible.</li>
            <li> It was a bit heavy and greasy upon application.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy</li>
            <li> My hair type is curly and I straighten it everyday.  </li>
            <li> I add a few pumps to my conditioner, mix them together in my hands and apply to my hair.  </li>
            <li> use a curling iron ever few days and this will protect my ends.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always on the search for a hair serum that works, but isn&#x27;t too heavy.  </li>
            <li> A few drops a few times a day</li>
            <li> I found that for my hair, this product does weigh down my hair a bit, and I don&#x27;t get that usual bounce and movement</li>
            <li> Not exactly sure how to use this</li>
            <li> I usually apply it on a Friday evening so my hair doesn&#x27;t look so greasy when I return to work a couple of days</li>
            <li> I am sure we don&#x27;t need the awful fragrance.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would help my dead ends that frequently like to rear their ugly heads.  </li>
            <li> With hard water, your hair will be a frizzled</li>
            <li> I keep looking for an oil that will help my very dry ends, and unfortunately I&#x27;m going to have to keep looking.</li>
            <li> My wife and daughters all have thick hair that is susceptible to frizz in humid weather.  </li>
            <li> It seemed to help control flyaways and add some shine to my hair, but it was not amazing.</li>
            <li> I get very frustrated since my options are very limited and all the products tend to really dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> anyway it couldn&#x27;t  be any worse.</li>
            <li> When I received this oil in the mail, the pump was broken</li>
            <li> but then I have very thick hair!</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with it, I&#x27;ve just never used a hair product that smelled like baby powder before.</li>
            <li> So for $10, how could you go wrong??</li>
            <li> but I found it tiresome to get the application amount</li>
            <li> Smell isn&#x27;t too bad, not great, but not offensive either.</li>
            <li> I said ill give it a try my hair is so bad</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t unpleasant and not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> I hate oily hair and products that make my hair clumpy and oily.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> but it was annoying.  </li>
            <li> I would hate to accidentally spill it.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this product!  on my hair dressers recommendation I started using this product before I blow dried my hair (put in palm, add to ends of hair then work through all my hair).  It then protects my hair while drying and straightening.  I have noticed a major difference in just 2 months of use of softer healthier hair.</li>
            <li> Love the way this product controls my hair without weighing it down.  Smells nice too.</li>
            <li> Does not leave hair oily at all. Smells good. It doesn&#x27;t make it feel weighted down</li>
            <li> works well on hair extensions, not greasy and doesn&#x27;t make them tangle</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff! When I first used it, I was worried because it was slightly thicker than I thought it would be. But I was very surprised at how light it actually was on my hair. I put a few pumps (about 5-6) in my palms, rubbed them together and then distributed it throughout my hair. My hair LOVES this stuff! Had to get used to the scent though. Nothing wrong with it, I&#x27;ve just never used a hair product that smelled like baby powder before. It also works amazing as a hand moisturizer as well. No need in letting it go to waste after you finish rubbing it in your hair. You may as well rub it into your hands instead of washing your money down the sink trying to get it off. I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and how light it is. Not greasy at all. I use it all over my face and body and hair when I get out the shower and it leaves my skin so smoothe and soft. One pump goes a long way. Good item</li>
            <li> love love love makes my hair super soft and smells good</li>
            <li> Not oily..nice shine..soften hair..</li>
            <li> A very good hair oil.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for my hair. My hair tends to get a bit frizzy in the heat and this really helps it stay down. It helps your layers stay separate and distinct as well. Overall, great hair oil.</li>
            <li> Live it! Not a complete moisturizer but does job for sheen on wash n go</li>
            <li> I love love love love this stuff</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product...it makes my hair soooooo soft!</li>
            <li> Light weight oil, smells decent</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product!!!</li>
            <li> Smells great leaves hair so silky and soft</li>
            <li> I have very dry and frizzy hair due to the special shampoo &amp; conditioners I have to use because of an allergy to sulfates. I get very frustrated since my options are very limited and all the products tend to really dry out my hair. I was excited to try Dove Nourishing Treatment with African Macadamia Oil for many different reasons. First I am not allergic to the spray and second it stats that it is a dry oil treatment. I hate oily hair and products that make my hair clumpy and oily.&lt;br /&gt;This product was super easy to use: Just pump 3 to 4 times and massage into your hair starting from mid length to tips. For me I have been using 2 to 3 pumps and that seems to be the right amount for me. Goes into my hair easily and doesn&#x27;t make it oily at all. My frizz is way down as well! My hair now looks shiner (but not an oily shine way) feels softer and I don&#x27;t have frizz head anymore.&lt;br /&gt;For the price and what this can do for me I have to recommend it to anyone with frizz hair or people who have to use special products that dry the hair out.</li>
            <li> I use a variety of oil-type products in my hair and am always looking for something a bit cheaper that works just as well. This might have been it if the smell wasn&#x27;t so dang strong. And on top of the [[ASIN:B00HM6K6XQ Dove Pure Care Dry Oil Conditioner, 12 Ounce]] it was just overpowering. Otherwise, it seemed to work okay. Nothing spectacular but nothing horrible. If you can get past the smell (or if you like it) then it&#x27;s probably a decent product.</li>
            <li> Really good. I will buy again.!! :)</li>
            <li> Smells really good and makes my hair super soft. It&#x27;s lovely!!</li>
            <li> I have recently developed an interest in hair oils because I have long hair and oil seems to help keep tangles down. This is the third oil I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;The oil has a pleasant, light scent. I can&#x27;t tell if it is making any lasting effect on my hair, but after applying my hair is shinier and a little  moother (though not 5x worth). I also tried this in my friend&#x27;s hair, which is thick, long, and coarse, and it made much more of a difference in silkiness.&lt;br /&gt;So far I think this is my favorite oil of the three I&#x27;ve tested.</li>
            <li> Love it, use it on my daughter&#x27;s fine/wavy hair as detangler; use it on my curly thick hair to revitalize and moisturize my curls every day.  Works well with the shampoo and conditioner in the same line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff in my hair, on my skin, and in the shower (I put it on just before I rinse off, for when I don&#x27;t want my skin go feel too oily, but want a bit of skin protection.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells great, and is just as good as the pricier stuff I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I like the Dove Nourishing Treatment. I like it quite a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to quit using hair conditioner a couple years ago when I started having allergic reactions to it. Though I tried multiple brands, and hypoallergenic this-and-that kinds, I simply couldn&#x27;t use conditioner. If you don&#x27;t use conditioner, you can&#x27;t use shampoo, as shampoo strips the hair of all natural oils. Shampoos now are designed to be used with conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started washing my hair with baking soda. It sounds strange, but it actually works very well, but with this warning: only do this if you have good, soft water. With hard water, your hair will be a frizzled disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, having come to terms with this conditionerless hair washing method, I still find myself yearning for a way to smooth and tame fly-away hair, especially in the winter when static has my fine hair standing up in all directions. I was pleased to try the Dove hair oil, and found it works exceptionally well. After washing, I&#x27;ve started using two tiny squirts of the Dove Nourishing Treatment, worked lightly into my wet hair, mostly on the surface and ends. Then combed in. It serves the purpose of conditioner very well! My hair combs through easily, then dries reasonably well-controlled. It&#x27;s shinier, and more manageable. No itchiness or irritation like I get from conditioners. A light, but pleasant, scent at first, but it seems to go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is a golden blond, fine and straight. The Dove oil doesn&#x27;t weigh it down, and doesn&#x27;t make it look oily. It helps keep the static down. A very nice product.</li>
            <li> This light oil is wonderful! It adds shine, and tames the frizzies. It does not flatten hair out or make it greasy. It has a very light, fresh scent. To top it off, it comes in a pump bottle, so it is easy to get just the right amount. It is also economical. The bottle lasts a long, long time. I love this treatment for my very long hair!</li>
            <li> Love it! Love it! Love it!</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Makes my hair manageable</li>
            <li> Where was this back in the 80s?</li>
            <li> I keep looking for an oil that will help my very dry ends, and unfortunately I&#x27;m going to have to keep looking. I have very thin, fine hair and this product didn&#x27;t seem to do anything. I first tried using it per the instructions on damp hair and saw absolutely no difference. I then started putting it on before straightening my hair and it just made my hair look very greasy. I still have dry and damaged ends, and saw no difference at all when using this product. It is also very heavily scented, so beware if you are sensitive to scents. I&#x27;m sure this product works for other people, as other reviewers swear by it, but for me it just didn&#x27;t do the trick. If you have very fine hair, I would try something else.</li>
            <li> My wife and daughters all have thick hair that is susceptible to frizz in humid weather.  This nourishing oil does a great job of tamping down fly away hairs and leaves their hair shiny and sleek.  But it does not feel like there is oil in their hair.  It has a light fragrance and works pretty well.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Light, not greasy.  Pleasant smell.  You can apply it on either dry or wet hair.  I tend to prefer to use it on wet, towel dried hair before styling.  It leaves my hair soft and not at all greasy, even two days later.  The pump bottle is convenient for portioning it out; sometimes I want less, sometimes I want more.  Overall, a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> The best thing for your hair, goodbye split ends and hello smooth and silky manageable hair.</li>
            <li> There is always some new thing for hair...Keratin...Avocado Oil...Tea Tree Oil...and now Macadamia Oil....Its all supposed to put shine in your hair, repair damage, stop fly aways, smooth hair....and mostly they all kind of work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is not any different than any other hair oil I have tried, including Argan oil. They basically smell the same too. Its nice, and a teensy bit goes a long way..especially in my hair with is very thin and gets oily as the day goes by anyway.</li>
            <li> Not exactly sure how to use this and sometimes I forget, but it feels very nourishing (although VERY oily...it is a hair oil afterall). I love the smell of this stuff, kind of like baby oil but a little more sophisticated. It is too oily to use as an anti-frizz serum after my hair is styled but I think maybe using this after the shower or in the morning BEFORE I style it might be useful. I&#x27;m not sure, but the bottle will last forever. The only problem is that when I received it, the white pump was partially broken. Some of the product seeped out into the box, but luckily everything else in the box was covered in plastic. Product still comes out, but the cap doesn&#x27;t stay on by itself. The bottle is glass and there is a lot of product for the price. Not sure if I will reorder, but it seems like good stuff with healthy ingredients for your hair.</li>
            <li> If you have coconut oil or olive oil, use those!  It&#x27;s basically the same thing for a percentage of the price!  However, if you&#x27;re intent on trying the African Macadamia Oil, it will still work for you (expectedly, just like other oils).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s really worth it.</li>
            <li> This hair oil has a nice smell that I found pleasant enough, and not overpowering with the two or three pumps&#x27; worth I applied. The smell rapidly dissipated. It seemed to help control flyaways and add some shine to my hair, but it was not amazing. I have been happier with creamier products, or the (much cheaper) oils such as coconut.    The bottle it comes in is glass. The container tipped over in my cabinet, and the pump on top came off. I tried many different times and ways to reassemble it, but it would not go back on, except to perch on the top of the lower portion of the pump mechanism. I contacted Dove about the problem; they were helpful after I supplied several photos and proof of ownership. They definitely need to replace the pump with something that can handle light pressure and remain attached.    I received this for free for my review as part of the Amazon Vine program.</li>
            <li> If your hair is particularly susceptible to products creating a greasy look, be aware that this is probably not the &amp;#34;lightweight&amp;#34; nourishing treatment you are looking for.  I&#x27;m still waiting for the lightweight oil treatment that supposedly does not leave hair looking greasy. The only people who look great with wet looking hair are models, and that is not my profession.  Still, it is a good product for repair purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dove treatment is useful for treating hair that is tired and has been abused by winter, hard water, irons, dryers, or other things.  In my case, it entails a bit of planning to use this product.  I usually apply it on a Friday evening so my hair doesn&#x27;t look so greasy when I return to work a couple of days later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Macadamia is a fantastic scent.  The smell of an actual macadamia nut farm is beyond comparison to this product, but I don&#x27;t know if you could ever replicate a nut farm&#x27;s scent completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice product, but plan ahead before use.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of African Macadamia Oil--macadamias are so creamy that it seems they would really nourish the hair as advertised.  The reality is more mundane.  This hair treatment provided a slight gloss to my hair where it is smooth but my damaged ends didnt seem much different after several uses. It was a bit heavy and greasy upon application.  The fragrance is pleasant if a bit overly sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first ingredient is cyclopentalsiloxane which is a type of fast drying silicone.  I would rate this below an average silicone hair treatment since I find it does not give as much gloss.  This is probably because the second ingredient is mineral oil! From back in the day when I used mineral oil for suntanning, I have never liked the effect of mineral oil on my hair.  It leaves it greasy and weighted down and not shiny at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing that I didn&#x27;t like about this product was that the pump didn&#x27;t work.  Since this could be an anomalous flaw I didn&#x27;t take more off the star rating but it was annoying.  So my final recommendation is to give this a miss and find a product that just uses silicon.</li>
            <li> My own hair is dry and extremely curly. I found that, though use of this product helped with &#x27;de-tangling&#x27; and softening, after a few hours my hair seemed to have developed a mind of its own. It lifted as if I&#x27;d had my finger in an electrical socket. I shall continue to use this for conditioning before washing, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be a product for me to use afterwards.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for something that would help my hair not feel so dried out after blow drying and flat ironing it several times a week. I was also looking for a product that was a reasonable price. This product - which I saw reviewed in a magazine - met both those criteria, and also met my expectations. My hair feels softer and healthier, and smells very nice after I use the product. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the shine last about a day.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time getting this item - Dove Dry Oil, Pure Care Nourishing Hair Treatment - since I could not locate it in Greenville, North Carolina at Wal-Mart or Walgreen.  I had originally bought a bottle at Wal-Mart so I went back there to purchase another.  It was not on the shelf.  I really liked the way my hair felt after using it so I became aggressive in getting more.  I talked with 2 assistant managers who said they would try to get it for that Wal-Mart.  I waited one month after which I went back.  It still was not on the shelf.  I found out on the Internet that it was out of stock at Wal-Mart stores.  I even checked a Wal-Mart in Waynesboro, Virginia on a trip there - not on the shelf!  Six weeks had passed but I was not giving up.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I decided to order it on the Internet.  I ordered 4 bottles from Amazon.com at a real savings.  The bottles arrived less than a week later.&lt;br /&gt;I now have enough of this great product to share with my daughter.  I love this hair treatment!!  I am  glad I persevered until I found the product</li>
            <li> Very good product. Smells great. Doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out. I rinse my hair at night and add it while it&#x27;s still wet. I pull the hair up into a bun and sleep that way.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff..  I use it on the ends of my hair and if you do it right it&#x27;s not oily feeling.  It also smells really good .  I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores any more, so I ordered it thru Amazon.</li>
            <li> I initially purchased this because of a beauty blogger&#x27;s review, but it did not work as well as she stated it worked for her.  This may be in part because she was paid for that review.  My hair still looked dry and frazzled.  I prefer Moroccan Oil which does have a shiny and more manageable effect on my hair ( I purchase directly in person from a salon though, because you can never trust online from here for authenticity)</li>
            <li> The quality Of The product is very good. It helps dry hair so well. Just The price was pretty higher than some other place. I still get it Because of The convenience of delivery.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and regularly use a flat iron so i really have to use product to keep my hair shiny.  I&#x27;ve tried a variety of oils from the popular high end ones to those sold in the ethnic beauty shops and the Dove Nourishing Treatment with African Macadamia Oil is at the top of my list.  You can use it on damp hair, but I use it after the flat iron to manage the ends and impart shine.  Also use it the night before I shampoo for extra treatment.  Smells good too.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews before purchasing, especially from others with fine hair. I used only a little of the product on my shoulder-length hair and was pleased with the silkiness (no more noticeable than with other argan oil products), but my hair began looking dirty the next day and it was not as shiny as other products I use, so I can&#x27;t recommend it and won&#x27;t continue to use it. It may be great for many types and conditions of hair, but this is not the product to use if you have fine hair.</li>
            <li> I love to try all the new oil products for hair. These products are great if you use a flat iron because they fry your hair and these oil treatments really help a lot. This product tames your hair and conditions the dry ends from flat iron use. My hair is very fine and I can use all the help I can get when it comes to protecting the ends of my hair which over time just die even if I really try not to cook them with the high heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dove Nourishing Treatment nourishes the ends of my hair and I focus on that when I use this type of treatment. As for the rest of my hair, I just smooth on a little oil and this product makes hair shiny and manageable. I use just a touch throughout my hair and more product on the ends. This is a nice, rich oil that tames flyaway hair and conditions very nicely. The smell is nice and I like the effect this has on damaged ends by smoothing and restoring shine.</li>
            <li> Dove Nourishing Treatment with African Macadamia Oil / B00GTBZ8B0&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have frizzy hair that gets dry and damaged very easily. I&#x27;ve been using this treatment on my ends for a few weeks now, and I have mixed feelings that are overall positive. I will say that when this is in my hair, it does soften the ends and gives a pretty shine that I like. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and I don&#x27;t personally mind the smell, but it is a little stronger scented than I&#x27;d like. However, the treatment doesn&#x27;t appear to be having any long-term healing effects on my hair, which is fine (I didn&#x27;t expect miracles!) but something to keep in mind if you&#x27;re looking for a fix as opposed to just a daily shine treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: This review is based on a free Advance Review Copy of this product provided through Amazon Vine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Ana Mardoll</li>
            <li> Excellent products.  It works wonderful for my dry hair. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I have not been very nice to my hair lately - chlorine, a hot iron and some coloring.  The dryness was starting to show.  I&#x27;ve tried several conditioners and leave-in treatments, and haven&#x27;t found the right balance of hair help without the greasy feeling.  I do like the Dove - it made my hair very shiny and soft, but unfortunately it did leave my hair a bit greasy.  I experimented with using different amounts - just enough to comb through the ends, two squirts, three squirts - it didn&#x27;t seem to matter.  It also didn&#x27;t help my frizzies.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is large and goes a long way, especially if you only use 2-3 squirts at a time.  The smell isn&#x27;t unpleasant and not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Very shiny, soft hair.  Cons:  a little greasy, and no help for the frizzies.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely like it, I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the end-all hair helper for me.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, makes my hair soft and manageable for days after using this product, even after a wash or two.....</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first it being a Dove oil treatment, but was very please with it&#x27;s lightness.  I&#x27;ve been using the original Moroccan oil that sells for $45+.  My hair type is curly and I straighten it everyday.  Highly Recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a variety of oils on my long, thick, fine hair.  This one has a fragrance that is somewhat better than other oils, particularly Argon oil which just plain stinks!  This Dove oil also seems to hydrate my hair without weighing it down or making it look oily.  One of the better oils I&#x27;ve tried over the years.  Still not &amp;#34;hair model&amp;#34; worthy, but pretty good.</li>
            <li> I deal with dryness and fly-aways and have tried many products.  I do not like the feeling of &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; in my hair so I avoid hair sprays, etc.  This does help.  It is oil-based so it can leave an oily film if you use too much.  I add a few pumps to my conditioner, mix them together in my hands and apply to my hair.  I find my hair to be softer and less frizzy.  I do not use this around my bang area.  Mostly at the sides of my head and around the back to control the frizz.  It helps, I like the way my hair feels and looks and I&#x27;ll keep buying it.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!!! I love it and very fast delivery!!!!</li>
            <li> Wife has not noticed a difference since using this for 2 months.</li>
            <li> After reading many of the other reviews posted here, I have to agree, this is a beautifully packaged, high quality product. The bottle is hefty and very attractive, the pump applicator gives just a tiny bit with each pump. It&#x27;s nice to use. I used a tiny drop, rubbed between both hands, on my dry, flyaway (from static electricity) bangs and crown of my already styled hair, and the flyaways laid right down without making my hair greasy. But - I used just a tiny drop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note about the scent. At first I agreed with other posters, &amp;#34;Oooh, that&#x27;s smells so nice!&amp;#34; But as the day wore on I found the scent cloying, and I had used only a tiny drop. And even after washing my hands many times (we don&#x27;t have a dishwasher, and my hands are in soapy water... a lot), the scent was still on my hands.</li>
            <li> I just used this.  I am not sure how it will look after my hair gets dry but one thing I can tell, the smell is too strong and it is making me dizzy. I don&#x27;t understand why the companies have to do this, why to put so strong smell.  I am sure we don&#x27;t need the awful fragrance.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because when I bought my dove shampoo intense repair and conditioner it had a trial size dove nourishing treatment with African macadamia oil I said ill give it a try my hair is so bad anyway it couldn&#x27;t  be any worse. so I tried it and loved it!! then purchased a full size bottle which is really good size and a really good price.. it is the best I have ever had its not oily like it sounds for sure, makes my hair feel amazing. when I am done washing my hair I apply the treatment  evenly as directed four drops for me because my hair is so long and full, then blow dry, omg my hair feels so amazing when I am done with it. my hair just slides right through my fingers.. if it were not for the sample being on the shampoo I would never know about this product because after I saw the trial size I looked to see if it was sold separately but could not find it at rite aid or cvs. I would recommend this to anyone ..personally I love it not ever body will but just so you know its great..</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful! Makes my fine curly blonde locks gorgeously curly without the heaviness, or too much shine. Bumps up the right amount of softness and seduction to attract lots of attention, and lure them to your mermaid tresses. Happiness  :-)</li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair and I found this item a pleasant surprise. Not only did I like the scent, but as an Ojon user I found this item much more cost effective and easier to use.  During dry winter months, one pump, rubbing into the hands does a great job of controlling frenzies.  I also found that it made a huge difference when using a blow dryer.  I didn&#x27;t fell it was greasy. I will definitely reorder this item over my Ojon products. A little goes a long long way also, so your really getting a good value for your money.</li>
            <li> I apply a small amount to the ends of my hair, after a wash, and dry either naturally or blow dry...either way, my hair is easy to manage, smells nice, non-sticky and feels and  looks great.  I had no issue with using tongs and the heat did not affect the light gloss form the oil.  So nice to find something that works with heat and makes my hair look and feel so healthy!</li>
            <li> I have fine, frizzy hair. I really like this oil. I use less than a dime size amount on my shoulder length hair. I put it on damp hair and only on my ends. Its not too heavy (if used minimally). It does smell like baby powder but that dissipates over time. This bottle will last me well over a year. It helps keep my ends healthy from heat styling.</li>
            <li> a gift for daughter, she loves it</li>
            <li> I was looking for a dry oil and went this this one because of the ratings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is awesome and it has become a part of my daily routine. I can tell a noticeable difference in my hairs health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a curling iron ever few days and this will protect my ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and the glass bottle is awesome and I&#x27;ll definitely reuse it!</li>
            <li> Exactly As described! Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff ever! I originally got a small sample of this in my Walmart beauty box, and immediately was blown away by how awesome it was. I&#x27;ve never used a product like this before, so I honestly don&#x27;t really have anything to compare it to, but I have some killer dead ends (I haven&#x27;t gotten my hair cut in a year...whoops) and using just a small amount of this stuff makes it look like my hair is fresh, healthy, and perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was trying to imagine how big this bottle was going to be, as 3.38oz sounded kind of small to me, and it ended up being a lot bigger than I was expecting it to be. This will probably last me a whole year, since I only use about a nickel-sized dollop on my dead ends every couple of days. So for $10, how could you go wrong?? I will definitely be repurchasing this over and over again (if I ever run out!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t recommend this more highly for people will curly, frizzy hair and/or dead ends. They should call this stuff &amp;#34;miracle oil.&amp;#34; My hair has never looked better!</li>
            <li> Be warned, you can easily use too much of this product and leave your hair feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;It took me several applications to get the right amount.&lt;br /&gt;It really does leave hair very glossy but I found it tiresome to get the application amount just right.&lt;br /&gt;Pleasant scent when applying but the scent didn&#x27;t last.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I&#x27;ll get more expert with it over time.</li>
            <li> Nice light oil treatment for dry hair. Too oily for my fine hair, but worked fairly well on more course dry hair. Not heavy enough for our daughter&#x27;s bi-racial naturally curly hair. So would only recommend this for a course dry hair type. Smell isn&#x27;t too bad, not great, but not offensive either. A bit high priced for Dove, but like most of their other mid-range products.</li>
            <li> It says it&#x27;s not greasy, but I think it&#x27;s kinda greasy. It smells nice and works ok, but the bottle being glass and it being greasy, well, you might drop it and hurt yourself.</li>
            <li> When I received this oil in the mail, the pump was broken so I had to carefully open the bottle and pour some of the oil in the palm of my hand before applying it to my hair.  I&#x27;m mentioning this so the manufacturer will consider packing it better.  It&#x27;s no fun having to open the bottle every time you want to use the oil.  I would hate to accidentally spill it.  As for the oil itself, I like it.  It has a pleasant scent and it keeps my hair conditioned for hours at a time.  My hair&#x27;s tangle-free and the shine is also very nice.</li>
            <li> Love this! Makes my hair shiny but not oily. Helps with friz in humidity as well which is a huge bonus. I put on a lot more than directed but then I have very thick hair!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff smells wonderful and makes my hair shiny. Came in earlier than the expected date too.</li>
            <li> But somewhat more expensive.  And in a glass bottle, so if you drop it on the tiled floor of your bathroom, it will probably smash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say to use three or four squirts and massage it into your hair from the middle of the shaft, down to the ends.  For my hair, which is very thick, that wasn&#x27;t nearly enough product.  I had to experiment a bit to get a proper amount to do my hair any good, but I found that about eight or nine squirts did the trick.  It does impart a nice shine and it made my hair softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found I also liked the aroma.  But as I have almost no sense of smell, this concerns me, because the fact that I can smell it might mean that it has a powerful scent to folks with a normal sense of smell.</li>
            <li> The smell of this oil is extremely overpowering of baby powder and the smell lingers until you wash your hair again. This has to be the number one deal breaker for me because I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to smells, and I happen to not like the smell of baby powder. I have typical Asian hair, and I normally use this oil (and any other kind of hair oil) when my hair is damp, and I rub a pea size amount of the oil into the tips of my hair and blow dry. This works alright for that, but for the price, I&#x27;ve found better and cheaper in Organix moroccan penetrating oil. I also tried to use this as a pre-shampoo treatment, but it did absolutely nothing for my hair. Also, even though it says argan and moroccan oil in the name of the Dove oil, the actual oils are pretty far down the ingredient list. I found that for my hair, this product does weigh down my hair a bit, and I don&#x27;t get that usual bounce and movement after blow dry. Along with the Organix oil, I also enjoy using the One n&#x27; Only argan oil spray treatment, as that oil isn&#x27;t as viscous.</li>
            <li> When I opened the package, I was surprised to see that the oil was in a lovely glass bottle with a spray top. This design probably keeps the oil from oxidizing too quickly, and keeping it fresh longer. I only needed very little oil to spread it evenly throughout my hair. The oil had a pleasant fragrance and was not greasy at all. It actually felt light-weight, even evaporating somewhat. When I followed the instructions to apply from the middle to the ends of the hair, my hair had great body and bounce after a blow-dry with a boar&#x27;s hair brush. However, I had to gauge how much to use by trial and error since I used a little too much at first and possibly used it too close to my roots, so my hair was flatter than I wanted when I woke up (I wash and dry my hair at night). I guess if I wanted my hair on the sleeker side, then it came out perfectly. I usually use my blow-dryer and curling iron daily, so I did feel like the oil was protecting my hair from heat damage, while giving it a nice shine. My hair definitely looks healthier when I use it, having great touchability and scent, and added body to my hair style. I would recommend this oil for daily or every other day use.</li>
            <li> I have long, straight, blonde, dry hair that has a tendency to get oily very quick.  I was hoping this would help my dead ends that frequently like to rear their ugly heads.  It did help; and it made my hair a bit less frizzy. I&#x27;m just not sure it&#x27;s worth the cost, especially when it&#x27;s just glorified mineral oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Softens my hair a little&lt;br /&gt;Makes it less frizzy&lt;br /&gt;Helps protect my ends&lt;br /&gt;Goes in nicely and does not make my hair oily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;Glorified mineral oil&lt;br /&gt;High cost&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t do as much in regards to hair health to justify the price, or as much as I would like.</li>
            <li> It softens without leaving your hair greasy!</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling soft, but not oily. Controls fizz well for me.</li>
            <li> I love this product for my short frizzy hair! The fragrance is out of this world!!! I e-mailed Dove to ask about it and if any other Dove products have the same fragrance. Hoping that they have a body spray!</li>
            <li> An over-powering fragrance may not appeal to everyone but the multi-purpose use of this item is appealing. It&#x27;s nourishing and does well on damp hair, dry hair and a spot treatment for dry frizzy ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to misjudge the amount needed. Following the directions as a guide on the number of pumps of product to use helps to not overdo it. You still have to work with it to find what works best for your hair and styling technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is a little steep for a mass-market/drugstore item but less than comparable high-end drugstore ones. I&#x27;d still keep this as a hair care essential.</li>
            <li> it is much more cheaper than another brand of hair oil, and with lower price, it still does a amazing job.</li>
            <li> i must say i was excited to try this oil.  my hair is very thick and coarse and drinks any oil right up.  my only problem with it is the fragrance.  it&#x27;s very strong.  and not at all what i&#x27;d like to smell like.  very old lady-ish to me.  otherwise, it&#x27;s a great oil.</li>
            <li> I got this in a birchbox and from the moment I took the cap off I knew I was going to like it.  I used a few drops and applied them to only the ends of my hair.  It didn&#x27;t seem greasy and it didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  I used another drop on my elbows and it soaked right into my skin.  It has a clean smell that I really like so I had to buy a full size.  Oscar de La Renta has a dry oil spray that is a lot like this only its a perfume and I like that too.  I think I think I&#x27;ll use this on more than just my hair.  Definitely worth a try.  This worked better than my Aragon oil too and its really expensive</li>
            <li> I have very finicky hair.  Its fine, wavy, frizzy and a bit color and heat damaged.  I&#x27;m always on the search for a hair serum that works, but isn&#x27;t too heavy.  I&#x27;ve finally found it!!  It works perfectly!! I apply it to towel dried hair, then blow-dry and flat iron as usual.  My hair ends up perfectly smooth, soft but not weighed down.  Please try this product!  I&#x27;m now a user for life!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this in a monthly glam bag. I had waited a bit too long in between hair cuts and gave it a try on the ends of my hair. My hair is naturally wavy and can get a little frizzy. I used this with my heavy-duty hair mask and it did wonders. My boyfriend started using it on his hair as well and has nearly drained the sample bottle! He loves the smell, and he has curly hair as well (he straightens it). A few drops a few times a day and he seems hooked. It&#x27;s light-weight, smells great, and seems to tame his hair. It also seems like his hair is staying straighter longer this time than before. For me though, I just use it to keep the ends of my hair happy!</li>
            <li> Smell good. Makes hair feel soft.</li>
            <li> My hair felt so soft...</li>
            <li> This is undoubtedly one of the best oils I have ever used. It is light, silky feeling and exotic smelling. I use it after I shampoo and then daily for styling.</li>
