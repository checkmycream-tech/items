            <li>I was given a nice tour of popular brands by an employee.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful product fast delivery. ..would order again... :)</li>
            <li>Every time I smelled it, I loved it more and more.</li>
            <li>Everything was fine, the product fits the description given in the amazon page, the cover and the case where in good condition.</li>
            <li>They were very speedy with my product, I love this perfume so much, I am more then happy with this product!</li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised by how delicious and feminine it smells.</li>
            <li>the packaging is cute and it is very easy to take with you on the go.</li>
            <li>The packaging was great and it arrived very fast.</li>
            <li>Chemistry is a funny thing, and on me this lasts for about 6 hours and has great sillage.  </li>
            <li>Very light and fruity smell.</li>
            <li>NYC is great for those days when I can&#x27;t decide which of my fragrances is appropriate for what I have to do--this one never fails.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>This is one of my better smelling perfumes in  my collection.</li>
            <li>Lovely.</li>
            <li>However, this perfume just SCREAMS STRAWBERRY and is still a sophisticated scent.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>It is a lovely scent.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite scent...</li>
            <li>price was reasonable and happy with the delivery of the product.</li>
            <li>If you are a woman who loves this scent then you love the size of the bottle and the price point from Amazon.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m okay with that.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume and I love the price of it.</li>
            <li>Really enjoyed this as a Christmas gift.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like fruit, honey, and magic.</li>
            <li>sjp nyc perfume is one of my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m glad i found it on amazon.</li>
            <li>, I thnk its more floral but either way that gives you a tasted of what you will get.</li>
            <li>He smelled a bunch of different ones at the store and thought this one smelled the best.</li>
            <li>I think the bottle is cute looking too.</li>
            <li>Love Love Love this scent.</li>
            <li>I would buy it a million more time.</li>
            <li>So glad that I was able to find it online, considering it is no longer in stores.  </li>
            <li>lovely-</li>
            <li>love love love this scent.</li>
            <li>Love it for summer and for gifts.</li>
            <li>I love the smell</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m just in love with the smell</li>
            <li>Love love</li>
            <li>One of my favorite perfumes</li>
            <li>I love his scent.  </li>
            <li>I receive many compliments when I wear.</li>
            <li>She was very excited when she opened it</li>
            <li>It has a sweet and sexy smell and my boyfriend loves it!</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful soft floral blend.</li>
            <li>It is a nice floral, sweet scent.</li>
            <li>I like trying new things and this purchase was a great find.  </li>
            <li>I love \\&quot;Sex and the City\\&quot; and I love Sarah Jessica Parker, so of course I had to check out SJP NYC, which was inspired by the fabulous Carrie Bradshaw.</li>
            <li>Love this scent and everyone will too it&#x27;s a very noticeable pleasant sweet smell that will turn heads .</li>
            <li>Sweet, fruity, and not overpowering!</li>
            <li>If you like the idea of a strong strawberry note, give this a shot.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not so strong that you can smell it from twenty feet away</li>
            <li>I purchased this perfume as a gift for my mother and she liked it very much.</li>
            <li>and it really just smelled pleasant and sweet but not too overpowering.</li>
            <li>but it is a light scent, very sweet, my Husband says it smells strawberryish on me</li>
            <li>The first time I purchased SJP NYC Eau De Toilette was an experiment to see if I really liked the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I love this perfume and the price is not bad.</li>
            <li>Love it when someone wants to know what I&#x27;m wearing! :)</li>
            <li>I get the most compliments with this one of  definitely one of my new favs perfect for the purse with the case you don&#x27;t have to worry about loosing the cap</li>
            <li>Light enough to wear to work, but great for date night too.</li>
            <li>my boyfriend loves it, and he really dislikes perfume of any kind.</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying Sarah Jessica Parker has some really great smelling perfumes, and SJP NYC is one of them, but IT DOES NOT LAST!!!  </li>
            <li>The Sarah Jessica Parker line of scents is great, like Covet and Dawn and NYC, but NYC just doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>but it had such great reviews I had to give it a shot.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light, floral fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe I found this perfume on here for such a great price.</li>
            <li>However, I was surprised by how much I loved it.</li>
            <li>Frankly, as a guy, I think that scent would be hot on a girl... :)</li>
            <li>The staying power could be a little better, in my opinion, but for the price, this is a great deal.</li>
            <li>Its clean and lasts throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>Packaging and product was in great condition, and the 2 oz bottle is pretty big.</li>
            <li>plus, SJP is just so COOL, and Sex and the City does happen to be (yes, even today)</li>
            <li>The scent is sweet and feminine and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>It came quickly and well packaged with samples that she loves to get as well.</li>
            <li>Luckily even when I had the money I kept putting it off</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this perfume :)</li>
            <li>The price was to die for, and I am interested in all scents available from Sarah Jessica Parker.</li>
            <li>Very light, strong smell only takes 1 or 2 sprays</li>
            <li>I got this perfume for a Christmas present and it has rapidly become my favorite!</li>
            <li>I get compliments on this scent all the time and will definitely be buying more as soon as mine runs out!</li>
            <li>I wear this cologne daily and absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great everyday scent.  </li>
            <li>A great everyday perfume.</li>
            <li>Now this is the only perfume I wear because it smells so amazing.</li>
            <li>Basically, I am under qualified at all to give a review about perfumes being a 19 y/o male and all, but have to say that this perfume is one of a kind.  </li>
            <li>My son (20 yrs old) and his girlfriends ALL love this childlike  smelling perfume.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;SATC\\&quot; fans will love it, as will any other woman looking for a unique new scent to call her own.</li>
            <li>right out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>I was a little worried that it wouldn&#x27;t be the same product, wouldn&#x27;t be the full bottle, or might break in shipping, but it came to the house in perfect condition and was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>very much so thought I&#x27;d surprise her with it as a gift.</li>
            <li>Its a very reasonably priced and durable case.  </li>
            <li>Simply put...great value for such an amazing scent!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure why people are saying NYC doesn&#x27;t last</li>
            <li>so i can make it last longer :).</li>
            <li>It is light, but has some deep, sweet undertones that keep it from being too \\&quot;bright\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>When I tried it out, it was such a refreshing scent.</li>
            <li>It really is flirty and fun, and can be worn for any mood/occasion.</li>
            <li>I bought the first bottle from Macy&#x27;s and decided to try and find it online.  </li>
            <li>&#x3D;) Definately recommend to anyone looking for a solid purfume.</li>
            <li>Product arrived REALLY fast!</li>
            <li>Will continue to buy this forever, enough said! : )</li>
            <li>this is by far my new favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li>you think it would last all day, you will be good to smell it 5 minutes later!!  </li>
            <li>I am very upset about this, because  I paid full price for a new bottle of perfume.  </li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s not too strong, it&#x27;s easy to become desensitized to it after a few minutes.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I expected :-)</li>
            <li>This perfume smells good but it doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend likes slightly sweeter scented perfumes, and Sarah Jessica Parker&#x27;s NYC is great, but it just doesn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li>My daughter loved the fact that it was a big bottle and not a small one like she currently had.  </li>
            <li>There are some strawberry notes in there, but this fragrance is also floral and musky and overall fantastic.</li>
            <li>I just need to stop using it so much</li>
            <li>It was very embarrassing for me, when my sister opened this perfume X-mas gift  in front of my extended family and the bottle of perfume was already used.  </li>
            <li>I got the biggest bottle available and for only $16!</li>
            <li>Thanks so much</li>
            <li>I am very picky about my perfume, but my husband gave it to me as a Christmas stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>very girly.</li>
            <li>I had to search online to find the one I really wanted.  </li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>All the stores in the mall are mostly selling her other fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I only wish that the wild strawberry note was a little more prominent, but the scent lasts forever on me.  </li>
            <li>It is sweet smelling and will last all day without sending people into an asthma attacks!</li>
            <li>Watered down for sure.</li>
            <li>and I was not sure because she&#x27;s 13, but it is a nice scent and light enough for a young girl.</li>
            <li>I hope its available through you for a very long</li>
            <li>Even though I can&#x27;t smell it on myself after a few hours, people who are near me still can! :)  </li>
            <li>She lives in New Zealand and asked me to bring some when I visit her.</li>
            <li>Wish that I could have lifetime supply - will never love a perfume more...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually not into celebrity fragrances because they always seem to lack depth or abundance in scents.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s missing that ingredient that keeps perfumes potent and lasting.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I have to say I do really like the scent but its such a short lived fragrance that just a couple hours after applying it its completely diminished.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected!  </li>
            <li>However, I do prefer a more subtle fragrance that only people close to me will notice, rather than one that announces my entrance.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve gotten several compliments on it so far.</li>
            <li>Nice fruit base (not too sweet)</li>
            <li>Apparently they don&#x27;t make this specific one anymore.</li>
            <li>I was very disappointed because the dawn by SJP lasts all day and the perfume smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it would be good because it was obviously less expensive than DKNY, Versace and Gucci brands.  </li>

            <li> I was given a nice tour of popular brands by an employee.  </li>
            <li> Wonderful product fast delivery. ..would order again... :)</li>
            <li> Every time I smelled it, I loved it more and more.</li>
            <li> Everything was fine, the product fits the description given in the amazon page, the cover and the case where in good condition.</li>
            <li> They were very speedy with my product, I love this perfume so much, I am more then happy with this product!</li>
            <li> and I was pleasantly surprised by how delicious and feminine it smells.</li>
            <li> the packaging is cute and it is very easy to take with you on the go.</li>
            <li> The packaging was great and it arrived very fast.</li>
            <li> Chemistry is a funny thing, and on me this lasts for about 6 hours and has great sillage.  </li>
            <li> Very light and fruity smell.</li>
            <li> NYC is great for those days when I can&#x27;t decide which of my fragrances is appropriate for what I have to do--this one never fails.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> This is one of my better smelling perfumes in  my collection.</li>
            <li> Lovely.</li>
            <li> However, this perfume just SCREAMS STRAWBERRY and is still a sophisticated scent.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> It is a lovely scent.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent...</li>
            <li> price was reasonable and happy with the delivery of the product.</li>
            <li> If you are a woman who loves this scent then you love the size of the bottle and the price point from Amazon.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m okay with that.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and I love the price of it.</li>
            <li> Really enjoyed this as a Christmas gift.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like fruit, honey, and magic.</li>
            <li> sjp nyc perfume is one of my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m glad i found it on amazon.</li>
            <li> , I thnk its more floral but either way that gives you a tasted of what you will get.</li>
            <li> He smelled a bunch of different ones at the store and thought this one smelled the best.</li>
            <li> I think the bottle is cute looking too.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this scent.</li>
            <li> I would buy it a million more time.</li>
            <li> So glad that I was able to find it online, considering it is no longer in stores.  </li>
            <li> lovely-</li>
            <li> love love love this scent.</li>
            <li> Love it for summer and for gifts.</li>
            <li> I love the smell</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m just in love with the smell</li>
            <li> Love love</li>
            <li> One of my favorite perfumes</li>
            <li> I love his scent.  </li>
            <li> I receive many compliments when I wear.</li>
            <li> She was very excited when she opened it</li>
            <li> It has a sweet and sexy smell and my boyfriend loves it!</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful soft floral blend.</li>
            <li> It is a nice floral, sweet scent.</li>
            <li> I like trying new things and this purchase was a great find.  </li>
            <li> I love \\&quot;Sex and the City\\&quot; and I love Sarah Jessica Parker, so of course I had to check out SJP NYC, which was inspired by the fabulous Carrie Bradshaw.</li>
            <li> Love this scent and everyone will too it&#x27;s a very noticeable pleasant sweet smell that will turn heads .</li>
            <li> Sweet, fruity, and not overpowering!</li>
            <li> If you like the idea of a strong strawberry note, give this a shot.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so strong that you can smell it from twenty feet away</li>
            <li> I purchased this perfume as a gift for my mother and she liked it very much.</li>
            <li> and it really just smelled pleasant and sweet but not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> but it is a light scent, very sweet, my Husband says it smells strawberryish on me</li>
            <li> The first time I purchased SJP NYC Eau De Toilette was an experiment to see if I really liked the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I love this perfume and the price is not bad.</li>
            <li> Love it when someone wants to know what I&#x27;m wearing! :)</li>
            <li> I get the most compliments with this one of  definitely one of my new favs perfect for the purse with the case you don&#x27;t have to worry about loosing the cap</li>
            <li> Light enough to wear to work, but great for date night too.</li>
            <li> my boyfriend loves it, and he really dislikes perfume of any kind.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying Sarah Jessica Parker has some really great smelling perfumes, and SJP NYC is one of them, but IT DOES NOT LAST!!!  </li>
            <li> The Sarah Jessica Parker line of scents is great, like Covet and Dawn and NYC, but NYC just doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> but it had such great reviews I had to give it a shot.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s light, floral fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe I found this perfume on here for such a great price.</li>
            <li> However, I was surprised by how much I loved it.</li>
            <li> Frankly, as a guy, I think that scent would be hot on a girl... :)</li>
            <li> The staying power could be a little better, in my opinion, but for the price, this is a great deal.</li>
            <li> Its clean and lasts throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> Packaging and product was in great condition, and the 2 oz bottle is pretty big.</li>
            <li> plus, SJP is just so COOL, and Sex and the City does happen to be (yes, even today)</li>
            <li> The scent is sweet and feminine and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> It came quickly and well packaged with samples that she loves to get as well.</li>
            <li> Luckily even when I had the money I kept putting it off</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this perfume :)</li>
            <li> The price was to die for, and I am interested in all scents available from Sarah Jessica Parker.</li>
            <li> Very light, strong smell only takes 1 or 2 sprays</li>
            <li> I got this perfume for a Christmas present and it has rapidly become my favorite!</li>
            <li> I get compliments on this scent all the time and will definitely be buying more as soon as mine runs out!</li>
            <li> I wear this cologne daily and absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great everyday scent.  </li>
            <li> A great everyday perfume.</li>
            <li> Now this is the only perfume I wear because it smells so amazing.</li>
            <li> Basically, I am under qualified at all to give a review about perfumes being a 19 y/o male and all, but have to say that this perfume is one of a kind.  </li>
            <li> My son (20 yrs old) and his girlfriends ALL love this childlike  smelling perfume.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;SATC\\&quot; fans will love it, as will any other woman looking for a unique new scent to call her own.</li>
            <li> right out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried that it wouldn&#x27;t be the same product, wouldn&#x27;t be the full bottle, or might break in shipping, but it came to the house in perfect condition and was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> very much so thought I&#x27;d surprise her with it as a gift.</li>
            <li> Its a very reasonably priced and durable case.  </li>
            <li> Simply put...great value for such an amazing scent!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure why people are saying NYC doesn&#x27;t last</li>
            <li> so i can make it last longer :).</li>
            <li> It is light, but has some deep, sweet undertones that keep it from being too \\&quot;bright\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> When I tried it out, it was such a refreshing scent.</li>
            <li> It really is flirty and fun, and can be worn for any mood/occasion.</li>
            <li> I bought the first bottle from Macy&#x27;s and decided to try and find it online.  </li>
            <li> &#x3D;) Definately recommend to anyone looking for a solid purfume.</li>
            <li> Product arrived REALLY fast!</li>
            <li> Will continue to buy this forever, enough said! : )</li>
            <li> this is by far my new favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> you think it would last all day, you will be good to smell it 5 minutes later!!  </li>
            <li> I am very upset about this, because  I paid full price for a new bottle of perfume.  </li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s not too strong, it&#x27;s easy to become desensitized to it after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I expected :-)</li>
            <li> This perfume smells good but it doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend likes slightly sweeter scented perfumes, and Sarah Jessica Parker&#x27;s NYC is great, but it just doesn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li> My daughter loved the fact that it was a big bottle and not a small one like she currently had.  </li>
            <li> There are some strawberry notes in there, but this fragrance is also floral and musky and overall fantastic.</li>
            <li> I just need to stop using it so much</li>
            <li> It was very embarrassing for me, when my sister opened this perfume X-mas gift  in front of my extended family and the bottle of perfume was already used.  </li>
            <li> I got the biggest bottle available and for only $16!</li>
            <li> Thanks so much</li>
            <li> I am very picky about my perfume, but my husband gave it to me as a Christmas stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> very girly.</li>
            <li> I had to search online to find the one I really wanted.  </li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> All the stores in the mall are mostly selling her other fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I only wish that the wild strawberry note was a little more prominent, but the scent lasts forever on me.  </li>
            <li> It is sweet smelling and will last all day without sending people into an asthma attacks!</li>
            <li> Watered down for sure.</li>
            <li> and I was not sure because she&#x27;s 13, but it is a nice scent and light enough for a young girl.</li>
            <li> I hope its available through you for a very long</li>
            <li> Even though I can&#x27;t smell it on myself after a few hours, people who are near me still can! :)  </li>
            <li> She lives in New Zealand and asked me to bring some when I visit her.</li>
            <li> Wish that I could have lifetime supply - will never love a perfume more...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually not into celebrity fragrances because they always seem to lack depth or abundance in scents.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s missing that ingredient that keeps perfumes potent and lasting.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I have to say I do really like the scent but its such a short lived fragrance that just a couple hours after applying it its completely diminished.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected!  </li>
            <li> However, I do prefer a more subtle fragrance that only people close to me will notice, rather than one that announces my entrance.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve gotten several compliments on it so far.</li>
            <li> Nice fruit base (not too sweet)</li>
            <li> Apparently they don&#x27;t make this specific one anymore.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed because the dawn by SJP lasts all day and the perfume smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it would be good because it was obviously less expensive than DKNY, Versace and Gucci brands.  </li>
            <li> The perfume is long lasting, it is not very potent but not weak.</li>
            <li> however the staying power doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last too long</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell so good. :-(</li>
            <li> Problem is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long after spraying it on.  </li>
            <li> I wear it every single day</li>
            <li> It was a big let down.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about purchasing a \\&quot;bandwagon\\&quot; perfume, but I caved in and was curious to check it out.</li>
            <li> I usually spray about three sprays - neck, wrist and chest; and with that much I would expect it to last at least half a day.  </li>
            <li> Item arrived quicker than I expected!</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical about whether or not I was going to like this perfume</li>
            <li> but if a person were to walk past you in a smaller aisle in a store, they probably get a small whiff of it.</li>
            <li> This perfume, to me, has a slight fruity smell to it</li>
            <li> Most scents irritate my nose after a few minutes or the smell is just flat out terrible.</li>
            <li> I ordered this perfume online and was a little hesitant about it... since I couldn&#x27;t ensure the quality or anything.</li>
            <li> I am not much of a perfume girl typically, and usually lean toward the sweet/woodsy blends if I wear anything at all, so this was an usual pick for me.</li>
            <li> I was going to buy this perfume a few months ago at a perfume shop here</li>
            <li> This perfume is not easy to find in stores anymore.  </li>
            <li> I did not expect to like this fragrance because I&#x27;m not the type of girl who usually likes fruity perfume.</li>
            <li> As for the people who say it doesn&#x27;t last, I think thy are wrong.</li>
            <li> For me, it lasts just as long as my other very expensive perfumes.  </li>
            <li> and I can still smell it in the late afternoon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to want to knock someone down with the scent I&#x27;m wearing but to have a perfume wear off after only a hour is very disappointing.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a subtle, summery fragrance, I would give this a try.</li>
            <li> But that price is really ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little bit disappointed by this fragrance.</li>
            <li> The ones that stood out were all too expensive...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had random people in those situations stop and ask me what perfume I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
            <li> I probably got a bad bottle..</li>
            <li> So disappointed that this perfume is discontinued! :(</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in the quality of this fragrance, for $50</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> This perfume smells good but it doesn&#x27;t last that long. I was very disappointed because the dawn by SJP lasts all day and the perfume smells wonderful. It was a big let down.</li>
            <li> I got this perfume for a Christmas present and it has rapidly become my favorite! It has a scent that smells so good that people have asked me what I&#x27;m wearing or complimented the fragrance.  I&#x27;m not quite sure why people are saying NYC doesn&#x27;t last but I do not have this problem. I put it on in the mornings after I shower and I can still smell it in the late afternoon. For me, it lasts just as long as my other very expensive perfumes.  Simply put...great value for such an amazing scent!  SJP NYC fan for life.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quicker than I expected! (Which is always nice) This is the second bottle of this perfume that I have bought. I LOVE it. Everytime I wear it I get compliments and my boyfriend is forever telling me how good I smell. I would highly recommend this perfume :)</li>
            <li> I buy alot of perfume...alot. This is one of my better smelling perfumes in  my collection. I just need to stop using it so much so i can make it last longer :).</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and I am picky! It is sweet smelling and will last all day without sending people into an asthma attacks! Seller shipped promptly and great packaging!</li>
            <li> I own lots of wonderful fragrances, and I&#x27;m adding this one!  I only wish that the wild strawberry note was a little more prominent, but the scent lasts forever on me.  Chemistry is a funny thing, and on me this lasts for about 6 hours and has great sillage.  NYC is great for those days when I can&#x27;t decide which of my fragrances is appropriate for what I have to do--this one never fails.  It&#x27;s a great everyday scent.  I&#x27;ve actually ordered two of the 2 oz. size bottles.  Lovely.</li>
            <li> Basically, I am under qualified at all to give a review about perfumes being a 19 y/o male and all, but have to say that this perfume is one of a kind.  It all started when my brother went to Lord and Taylor to use the bathroom.  Whilst waiting, I decided to check out the perfumes as a potential Xmas gift.  I was given a nice tour of popular brands by an employee.  The ones that stood out were all too expensive...with the exception of this.  I didn&#x27;t think it would be good because it was obviously less expensive than DKNY, Versace and Gucci brands.  However, this perfume just SCREAMS STRAWBERRY and is still a sophisticated scent.  If you like the idea of a strong strawberry note, give this a shot.  I believe Oprah herself has raved about SJP perfume.  Frankly, as a guy, I think that scent would be hot on a girl... :)</li>
            <li> I got this perfume about a year ago. I was in a Sephora in JC Penny&#x27;s and was just taking whiffs of perfume to kill time while my friend did her shopping. I&#x27;ve never been one for perfumes or sprays. Most scents irritate my nose after a few minutes or the smell is just flat out terrible. I smelled this one and it really just smelled pleasant and sweet but not too overpowering. I bought it on a whim and I&#x27;m so glad I did. I wear it every single day and I get compliments all the time. It&#x27;s not so strong that you can smell it from twenty feet away but if a person were to walk past you in a smaller aisle in a store, they probably get a small whiff of it. I&#x27;ve had random people in those situations stop and ask me what perfume I&#x27;m wearing. As for the people who say it doesn&#x27;t last, I think thy are wrong. Since it&#x27;s not too strong, it&#x27;s easy to become desensitized to it after a few minutes. I&#x27;ll spray some on at about 8am and not see my boyfriend until 10:30pm and he&#x27;ll tell me how good I smell. Even going to the bar I&#x27;ve had girls and guys tell me I smell good. I&#x27;m not even a SJP fan at all. I&#x27;ve never seen Sex in the City. I just happened to come across something that smelled good and it&#x27;s been working great for me. I&#x27;m so scared about it getting discontinued because I don&#x27;t want to wear another perfume!</li>
            <li> I am not much of a perfume girl typically, and usually lean toward the sweet/woodsy blends if I wear anything at all, so this was an usual pick for me. I LOVE it! It is light, but has some deep, sweet undertones that keep it from being too \\&quot;bright\\&quot;. These deeper tones show up once you&#x27;ve had it on for awhile rather than right out of the bottle. A lot of people have commented on staying-power - I have not found this to be an issue. However, I do prefer a more subtle fragrance that only people close to me will notice, rather than one that announces my entrance. If you&#x27;re looking for a subtle, summery fragrance, I would give this a try.</li>
            <li> ...i want to eat it! this is by far my new favorite fragrance. my boyfriend loves it, and he really dislikes perfume of any kind. plus, SJP is just so COOL, and Sex and the City does happen to be (yes, even today) my favorite TV show ever! i am in heaven!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my grandaughter for her birthday.  She was very excited when she opened it, I knew I had made a good choice.  It smelled good too.  I got a great price on it, and that makes me happy.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about purchasing a \\&quot;bandwagon\\&quot; perfume, but I caved in and was curious to check it out. I must admit my expectations were low. When I tried it out, it was such a refreshing scent. It really is flirty and fun, and can be worn for any mood/occasion. I highly recommend, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying Sarah Jessica Parker has some really great smelling perfumes, and SJP NYC is one of them, but IT DOES NOT LAST!!!  I am very disappointed in the quality of this fragrance, for $50 you think it would last all day, you will be good to smell it 5 minutes later!!  Add some oil to this fragrance Sarah, and it also will be great!!</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling perfume i have owned to date!! my sister-in-law was wearing it during the holidays and after smelling it on her i bought it for myslef for Christmas!</li>
            <li> This product is great.  I bought the first bottle from Macy&#x27;s and decided to try and find it online.  I was a little worried that it wouldn&#x27;t be the same product, wouldn&#x27;t be the full bottle, or might break in shipping, but it came to the house in perfect condition and was exactly what I wanted.  I was very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The bottle of perfume was used!  It was very embarrassing for me, when my sister opened this perfume X-mas gift  in front of my extended family and the bottle of perfume was already used.  I am very upset about this, because  I paid full price for a new bottle of perfume.  Shameful.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume as a gift for a friend. She enjoys the fragrance very much so thought I&#x27;d surprise her with it as a gift.</li>
            <li> It is a lovely scent.  The price was to die for, and I am interested in all scents available from Sarah Jessica Parker.</li>
            <li> Love SJP scents! This is a beautiful soft floral blend. Not overbearing...., just perfect!! Love it! Love it when someone wants to know what I&#x27;m wearing! :)</li>
            <li> Greatest perfume ever! Sweet, fruity, and not overpowering! Wish that I could have lifetime supply - will never love a perfume more...</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent...just wish it hadn&#x27;t been taken out of the stores. I get told all the time how good I smell!</li>
            <li> I ordered this perfume online and was a little hesitant about it... since I couldn&#x27;t ensure the quality or anything. But when I received it, I was extremely happy! What a great product, and I love the scent! I would definitely recommend this to a friend!</li>
            <li> I purchased this perfume as a gift for my mother and she liked it very much. The packaging was great and it arrived very fast. It was perfect!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and just what I wanted! I get compliments on this scent all the time and will definitely be buying more as soon as mine runs out! I wear it practically every day!</li>
            <li> My niece asked for this and I was not sure because she&#x27;s 13, but it is a nice scent and light enough for a young girl. It came quickly and well packaged with samples that she loves to get as well.</li>
            <li> Scent definitely does not last, not even an hour. It&#x27;s missing that ingredient that keeps perfumes potent and lasting. Watered down for sure. Very disappointed. But that&#x27;s what you get when you buy a perfume online, you can&#x27;t test it out, regardless of the reviews. I probably got a bad bottle..</li>
            <li> Great Value! One of my favorites!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume and happy I found it again.  I hope its available through you for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;The price was reasonable and happy with the delivery of the product.</li>
            <li> Great size price point.  If you are a woman who loves this scent then you love the size of the bottle and the price point from Amazon.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend likes slightly sweeter scented perfumes, and Sarah Jessica Parker&#x27;s NYC is great, but it just doesn&#x27;t last.  The Sarah Jessica Parker line of scents is great, like Covet and Dawn and NYC, but NYC just doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> Nice fruit base (not too sweet) however the staying power doesn&#x27;t last long.  I had to reapply after 4-6 hrs.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product fast delivery. ..would order again... :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little bit disappointed by this fragrance. It doesn&#x27;t smell so good. :-(</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical about whether or not I was going to like this perfume but it had such great reviews I had to give it a shot. I have to say I do really like the scent but its such a short lived fragrance that just a couple hours after applying it its completely diminished. I&#x27;m not one to want to knock someone down with the scent I&#x27;m wearing but to have a perfume wear off after only a hour is very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I was going to buy this perfume a few months ago at a perfume shop here but it was $52 and I was low on cash. Luckily even when I had the money I kept putting it off and I&#x27;m so happy I waited. I got the biggest bottle available and for only $16! Thank you Amazon! The scent is so beautiful! Doesn&#x27;t last too long but I&#x27;m okay with that.</li>
            <li> This was cheaper here than anywhere else I looked. This is my 2nd bottle. It is a nice floral, sweet scent.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and I love the price of it. Definitely getting a deal!</li>
            <li> I get the most compliments with this one of  definitely one of my new favs perfect for the purse with the case you don&#x27;t have to worry about loosing the cap</li>
            <li> My daughter loved the fact that it was a big bottle and not a small one like she currently had.  Really enjoyed this as a Christmas gift.  Thanks so much</li>
            <li> So disappointed that this perfume is discontinued! :( I need to stock up!</li>
            <li> Perfect Seller! Love Product! No Problems!! THANK YOU!!! I personally love this fragrance!  This is a very good price. I ordered two. My son (20 yrs old) and his girlfriends ALL love this childlike  smelling perfume.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my best friend for Christmas. She has it currently but is running low on the bottle. Apparently they don&#x27;t make this specific one anymore. Thought it would be a good gift, also considered purchasing it myself. It&#x27;s a heavenly smell! It&#x27;s like fruit, honey, and magic. &#x3D;) Definately recommend to anyone looking for a solid purfume.</li>
            <li> sjp nyc perfume is one of my favorite perfume.I love the way it smells and i&#x27;m glad i found it on amazon.</li>
            <li> Actually I don&#x27;t wear fragrance, but my grand-daughter does and just loves SJP NYC.  She lives in New Zealand and asked me to bring some when I visit her.</li>
            <li> I did not choose this for myself. I am very picky about my perfume, but my husband gave it to me as a Christmas stocking stuffer. he read the reviews and got it based on that. I must say it smells Great! Very light, strong smell only takes 1 or 2 sprays but it is a light scent, very sweet, my Husband says it smells strawberryish on me, I thnk its more floral but either way that gives you a tasted of what you will get. the packaging is cute and it is very easy to take with you on the go. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
            <li> My husband bought me this perfume as a gift one time and I think it smells really good. He smelled a bunch of different ones at the store and thought this one smelled the best. I think the bottle is cute looking too.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this scent. I would buy it a million more time. It was exactly what I expected :-)</li>
            <li> Smells so good and I&#x27;ve gotten several compliments on it so far. It&#x27;s fruity and girly. A great everyday perfume.</li>
            <li> Best prices around !!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected!  I wear this cologne daily and absolutely love it!  I would recommend this one to everyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been one to have a specific perfume that I always wear but when I smelled this perfume a year or two ago, I decided to change my ways! Now this is the only perfume I wear because it smells so amazing. The scent is sweet and feminine and it lasts all day. I love this perfume!</li>
            <li> this is the best perfume ever I absolutly love it! It has a sweet and sexy smell and my boyfriend loves it!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  So glad that I was able to find it online, considering it is no longer in stores.  Does not give me a headache!</li>
            <li> Product arrived REALLY fast! Packaging and product was in great condition, and the 2 oz bottle is pretty big. I&#x27;ve used this perfume before and it smells lovely- I alway get complimented for smelling good</li>
            <li> love love love this scent. very girly. always get compliments when wearing</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and the price is not bad. The perfume is long lasting, it is not very potent but not weak. It reminds me of a flowery smell. I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love it for summer and for gifts.</li>
            <li> The first time I purchased SJP NYC Eau De Toilette was an experiment to see if I really liked the fragrance.  I like trying new things and this purchase was a great find.  It turned out I loved it&#x27;s light, floral fragrance.  This is my second bottle and I am sold on this product.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and the price was perfect! Also the shipping speed couldn&#x27;t get better! They were very speedy with my product, I love this perfume so much, I am more then happy with this product! Thank you</li>
            <li> I like it. But that price is really ridiculous. I had bougt it in $14.</li>
            <li> This perfume is not easy to find in stores anymore.  All the stores in the mall are mostly selling her other fragrance.  I had to search online to find the one I really wanted.  Light enough to wear to work, but great for date night too.</li>
            <li> This perfume, to me, has a slight fruity smell to it and I really like it.  Problem is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long after spraying it on.  I usually spray about three sprays - neck, wrist and chest; and with that much I would expect it to last at least half a day.  I like it enough to continue buying it and wearing it for the price.</li>
            <li> I love it! I love the smell and i have been complimented on it a lot and I&#x27;m just in love with the smell</li>
            <li> Love love I get so many compliments! One of my favorite perfumes</li>
            <li> Everything was fine, the product fits the description given in the amazon page, the cover and the case where in good condition.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe I found this perfume on here for such a great price. I had tried a sample one day and the scent haunted me all afternoon. Every time I smelled it, I loved it more and more. It&#x27;s fun and flirty, and perfect for a  sunny spring day.</li>
            <li> I love his scent.  Its clean and lasts throughout the day.  Its a very reasonably priced and durable case.  I travel and I never worry about the bottle shattering.</li>
            <li> Great price on Amazon, and my favorite perfume ever!!! I hope they always carry and make this.  I do not want to use another perfume ever again!</li>
            <li> I receive many compliments when I wear. Very light and fruity smell. Does not cause headaches. Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> I love Sarah Jessica Parker and this perfume is amazing! Will continue to buy this forever, enough said! : )</li>
            <li> My friend introduced me to this fragrance about 2 years ago and I was pleasantly surprised by how delicious and feminine it smells. I&#x27;m usually not into celebrity fragrances because they always seem to lack depth or abundance in scents. This Sarah Jessica Parker is not that way at all. It smells like a forbidden dessert that you can smell from across the room and can&#x27;t wait to devour. The scent stays with you for hours but isn&#x27;t over powering.</li>
            <li> Even though I can&#x27;t smell it on myself after a few hours, people who are near me still can! :)  Great product, great scent and great price!</li>
