            <li> A lot of returning vets are wearing a below knee artificial leg as I am.  Theirs, however looks like one with a carbon fiber foot and steel and chrome.  It costs extra to get a cosmetic cover and the VA won&#x27;t spend the money.  Also a lot of prosthetists don&#x27;t know how to make one look real. I got some 60 lb density foam and barge contact cement and glued on a lot of foam pieces then spent a morning with an electric carving knife and shaped the leg to actually look like one.  I then pulled on a Hanes thigh high nylon over it.  Then I pulled on a foam rubber wet suit leg I cut off a farmer john wet suit and added a wet suit foam sock, both standard issue.  I put 2 of these compression knee socks over the wet suit rubber and presto-amazo, I have a leg that looks like one and is light and functional.  Most of the stuff was ordered from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;To give you an idea of how it looks, when I wear shorts and park in a handicapped spot, some woman usually hollers at me, &amp;#34;Hey, you don&#x27;t look handicapped to me.  Get out of there.&amp;#34;  So you see, it works.</li>
            <li> The zip would not stay up</li>
            <li> They were not snug enough around the lower leg area and the top area irritated my legs - rubbed and poked them - I threw them out.</li>
            <li> It feel a little uncomfortable the zipper and is not easy close the zipper</li>
            <li> Very bad  quality  I wore once and the Zipper did not work anymore. I am very disapointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Easy to put on &amp; comfortable. Don&#x27;t bother with the non zip type.</li>
            <li> very good its tha best and awesome</li>
            <li> Very easy to put on and comfortable to wear</li>
            <li> The socks are difficult to put on when you have arthritic hands.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t grip in the same manor as the regular pull ons.  They slide up and pinch the foot, not worthy of a purchase.</li>
            <li> Very poor product  The zippers will not stay closed on over half of the socks  Very disappointed in this company Space and their products</li>
            <li> These work great for my husband. swelling is gone!</li>
            <li> Am sorry to say this product is terrible. The customer service is fabulous but 4 out of 4 socks will not stay zipped.</li>
            <li> This did not work for me at all.  I could not zip it up.  I just threw it away.</li>
            <li> Because there is no size chart on website, I ordered the wrong size which was too small and am returning them. Despite what others have said, I have had no problem returning them.</li>
            <li> Excellent compression knee socks.  I need to  wear one on just one leg so get one pair is like getting two.  I use the other sock while at home and wear the proper one when out or when someone might notice it.  Easy to put one and zipper works as if it&#x27;s new.  Will be ordering more of these as I need them.</li>
            <li> They are to long. I need a petite size I guess. I would have ordered more, but they first need to fit</li>
            <li> Get them!!! It will make you or your loved one feel like they can&#x27;t least control what they really don&#x27;t want to wear - have some style and the support needed- you can get them on easy and control when you need a little space and air</li>
            <li> Zipper irritated skin.</li>
            <li> My legs were too swollen when the socks arrived so I couldn&#x27;t get them on.  Wore them later ... easy to get on because of the zipper.</li>
