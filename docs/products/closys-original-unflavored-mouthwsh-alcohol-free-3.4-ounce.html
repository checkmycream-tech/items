    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It works wonderful for a mouthwash with, or without sores.</li>
            <li>it is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Happy with the results of the program, of which Closys is one part.</li>
            <li>This works great for traveling or when staying the night away from home.</li>
            <li>The Dr. Ellie system is working great for my teeth.  </li>
            <li>this stuff is great.</li>
            <li>Its a good mouthwash.</li>
            <li>Good for 4-5 days.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product that seems to do the job it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a good size for giving Dr. Elie&#x27;s system a trial run.</li>
            <li>And my latest cleaning went great.  </li>
            <li>I think more dentists should recommend Closys!</li>
            <li>no fluoride and no flavor, perfect for sensitive people like me :)</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>But, frankly, I&#x27;ve found the book a better read and easier to understand</li>

            <li>Goodbye: A Do-It-Yourself Mouth Care System for Healthy, Clean Gums and Teeth]] by Elie Phillips DDS.</li>
            <li>I wrote a detailed overview under that item&#x27;s listing, if you are interested in learning more about her</li>
            <li>I love garlic and onions and fish, and so far, my husband says it&#x27;s been able to get rid of the smell.</li>
            <li>like the fact that this rinse has no artificial colors, flavors, taste enhancers, sweeteners, alcohol, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>of the reviews I have read by people who use this as a standalone rinse are very positive about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(It says right on the label of the Pro-Health Rinse that it may cause surface staining.  </li>
            <li>and this was just right.</li>
            <li>you just want to give this rinse a trial before committing to ordering a lot of it, or if you want a small travel-size bottle for popping in your briefcase/purse/backpack/suitcase, the 3.4-ounce bottle is a good buy at just over two dollars at the moment, and it&#x27;s an \\&quot;add-on\\&quot; product which means it ships free with a valid Amazon order.</li>
            <li>Between the Closys toothpaste and rinse, my mouth just feels super clean, not dried out like before.  </li>
            <li>I WAS AMAZED At first</li>
            <li>A grand total of 32 ounces.</li>
            <li>best value per ounce is with the two large bottles, but I also bought one 16-ounce bottle because it&#x27;s easier to use that size of bottle on a daily basis in my bathroom (when it runs low, I will fill it up from the 32-ounce bottle which I store outside the bathroom).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you can pair this coupon with a drugstore chain&#x27;s discount such as CVS&#x27; occasional offer of 20 or 25% off all regular-priced items, a 32-ounce bottle bought in a bricks-and-mortar store might cost in the region of $9 or $10 that way, which is a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is much more effective on bad breath, plaque, and making your mouth feel fresh and clean!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll certainly keep purchasing it for the foreseeable future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And easy to refill from the larger bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figure that if swishing CloSYS around in my mouth twice a day can help save me from needing to see a periodontist or receiving yet another chair-side lecture by my dentist&#x27;s super critical hygienist, it&#x27;ll be well worth its price.</li>
            <li>This travel size bottle is very convenient, just what I needed.</li>
            <li>Hasn&#x27;t really helped, but hasn&#x27;t really hurt.</li>
            <li>The Closys I have received from Amazon always seems very fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the larger sized bottles are available at CVS.</li>
            <li>Some mouthwashes really sting and others taste minty, but Closys tastes like water but still seems to do the job.  </li>
            <li>I usually buy the great big bottle as I am a fan of the product.</li>
            <li>kind of bacteria that are found in gum pockets around your teeth&amp;#34; and especially recommends it for seniors, teenagers and people with extremely dry mouths.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is free of alcohol and does not sting or dry</li>
            <li>If dry mouth isn&#x27;t normally an issue for you, you should be fine.</li>
            <li>All in all, I&#x27;ll use this as an AM rinse, but stick to my normal routine at night</li>

            <li>bottles and, when I did, added this little guy, which is great for purses, travel and other over-nighters, especially those that might involve some kissing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has barely any taste (it tastes mostly like water), but all sizes of Closys -- aside from the 3.4 ounce travel/trial size bottle -- come with a little container of peppermint oil flavor drops for those customers who choose to add some flavor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so i can get the large size cheaper with the coupon included in the big bottles.</li>
            <li>Closys rinse is a clear, non-staining mouth rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the way -- Closys offers a printable dollar-off coupon on their website, and you can print it off twice a month, each month.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the flavor like the big ones, but still leaves the same fresh taste.</li>
            <li>In other words, tastes pretty crappy without any flavor.</li>
            <li>I can tell they are out-of-date because even though the paperboard box and the rinse bottle do not have any expiration date on them, the free sample of toothpaste that is enclosed inside the box has an expiration date of July 2011 (nearly 16 months ago), so it is logical that those bottles came off the assembly line quite some time ago (at least 2 and a half years ago, I should think), and I would rather have a bottle that is slightly newer than that</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Have used Closys for approx. 2 years since starting Dr. Ellie&#x27;s dental program. Happy with the results of the program, of which Closys is one part. This travel size bottle is very convenient, just what I needed.</li>
            <li> Buy a larger version that comes with the flavor packet.</li>
            <li> Working down the list of treatments to effect an improvement in chronic oral lichen planus. Hasn&#x27;t really helped, but hasn&#x27;t really hurt. Its a good mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I had my first case of gingivitis in middle age. This stuff was on the counter in one pharmacy. I was told that other doctors were buyint it up. I thought I would give it a try. I did some research on how it works (basically a stable chlorine molecule to be germicidal and cut out the flora that causes bad breath. I WAS AMAZED At first I thought it a bit costly, but now that I use the very small amount needed. I use it AM PM and sometimes after meals...and bam any bad taste is gone...still not available in many places. Bought last two bottles on Amazon!!Love Amazon Prime</li>
            <li> I bought this on someone&#x27;s recommendation. Unlike Listerine, it has no flavor, but has a small vial of peppermint if you want it. I don&#x27;t. This is much more effective on bad breath, plaque, and making your mouth feel fresh and clean! Buy 2 big bottles at a time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the fence still...this was supposed to come with some flavor thingy, but it didn&#x27;t. So it just kinda tastes like watered down Clorox. In other words, tastes pretty crappy without any flavor. I&#x27;m not sure if they forgot to put the packet or whatever in the package or it just doesn&#x27;t come with the small size, Which is stupid because me buying and re-buying the larger size depends on how much I like the small one.</li>
            <li> Passed through airport checkpoints for international travel without any issue. The quantity in the bottle lasted. Good for 4-5 days.</li>
            <li> This works great for traveling or when staying the night away from home. It doesn&#x27;t have the flavor like the big ones, but still leaves the same fresh taste.</li>

The Dr. Ellie system is working great for my teeth.  I wrote a detailed overview under that item&#x27;s listing, if you are interested in learning more about her system.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the Dr. Ellie program involves using 3 different dental rinses back-to-back every time you brush your teeth, I can&#x27;t tease apart the effects of the Closys by itself -- however, it seems to be working well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the reviews I have read by people who use this as a standalone rinse are very positive about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll certainly keep purchasing it for the foreseeable future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;By the way -- Closys offers a printable dollar-off coupon on their website, and you can print it off twice a month, each month.

The Closys I have received from Amazon always seems very fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;At the present time, Amazon sells this rinse in three sizes:  two 32-ounce bottles packed together [[ASIN:B001ET7L8K Closys Alcohol-Free Oral Rinse, With Flavor Control, 32 fl oz (946 ml) (Pack of 2)]], one 16-ounce bottle [[ASIN:B00156C2FE CloSYS Antiseptic Oral Rinse with Flavor Control 16 fl oz (473 ml)]], and one 3.4-ounce miniature bottle [[ASIN:B007PN203K Closys Oral Rinse, 3.4 Ounce]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best value per ounce is with the two large bottles, but I also bought one 16-ounce bottle because it&#x27;s easier to use that size of bottle on a daily basis in my bathroom (when it runs low, I will fill it up from the 32-ounce bottle which I store outside the bathroom).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you just want to give this rinse a trial before committing to ordering a lot of it, or if you want a small travel-size bottle for popping in your briefcase/purse/backpack/suitcase, the 3.4-ounce bottle is a good buy at just over two dollars at the moment, and it&#x27;s an \\&quot;add-on\\&quot; product which means it ships free with a valid Amazon order.</li>
            <li> no fluoride and no flavor, perfect for sensitive people like me :)</li>
            <li> Recommended by my hygienist after I complained of the terrible staining I was getting from the Crest Pro-Health Rinse.  I got the toothpaste as well.  I have perio issues.  I like that it has no flavor.  It leaves my mouth feeling clean, not coated in artificial flavorings like other stuff.  And NO Staining!  I started using it three months ago, and still drink coffee and tea, and still no staining, so it was definitely the ingredient in the Pro-Health Rinse causing the staining.  (It says right on the label of the Pro-Health Rinse that it may cause surface staining.  Colgate now has a rinse that uses this ingredient.)  Between the Closys toothpaste and rinse, my mouth just feels super clean, not dried out like before.  And my latest cleaning went great.  I buy the big bottles of Closys Rinse at my local CVS &#x27;cause it&#x27;s cheaper, and I get coupons at Closys.com.  But the toothpaste is unavailable locally.  I got these little bottles for travel.  I think more dentists should recommend Closys!</li>
            <li> CloSYS works as advertised.  I was looking for an alternative to the Biotene mouthwash, because of how slimy it feels.  I get dry mouth when I sleep, hence the use of Biotene.  After one use at bedtime, I awoke with my mouth basically dry-locked.  All in all, I&#x27;ll use this as an AM rinse, but stick to my normal routine at night so I don&#x27;t dry out.  If dry mouth isn&#x27;t normally an issue for you, you should be fine.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s orthodontist prescribed this mouthwash for her. It&#x27;s a good product that seems to do the job it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have been using it for almost a year. I am irritated however, because I was suppose to get 64 oz. instead only one container showed up. A grand total of 32 ounces.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by our daughter who is a dental hygienist when I had mouth sores. I try to keep it on hand at all times. It works wonderful for a mouthwash with, or without sores.</li>
            <li> my dentist told me about this product.  it is wonderful.  I don&#x27;t use the flavoring it comes with.  I am amazed at how well it makes my mouth feel in the morning, and evening.  I love garlic and onions and fish, and so far, my husband says it&#x27;s been able to get rid of the smell. I use it after brushing my teeth, flossing, re-brush, tongue brush and scrape.  I use this small bottle for travel.  the larger sized bottles are available at CVS.</li>
            <li> I usually buy the great big bottle as I am a fan of the product. I needed bottle small enough to travel with and this was just right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all.  Some mouthwashes really sting and others taste minty, but Closys tastes like water but still seems to do the job.  You can add a minty taste if you want (a small bottle is included) but I just like it plain.  I plan to continue using this.</li>
            <li> I recently began using CloSYS as part of the twice daily routine recommended in the book [[ASIN:1929774672 Kiss Your Dentist Goodbye: A Do-It-Yourself Mouth Care System for Healthy, Clean Gums and Teeth]] by Elie Phillips DDS. A pre-rinse with CloSYS before brushing, says Dr. Elie, &amp;#34;is extremely gentle on the delicate mouth tissues and yet actively removes some kinds of harmful mouth bacteria.&amp;#34; She also finds it helpful for removing &amp;#34;the kind of bacteria that are found in gum pockets around your teeth&amp;#34; and especially recommends it for seniors, teenagers and people with extremely dry mouths. She claims that when used before brushing and without any added flavor, this chlorine dioxide rinse can not only strengthen and protect teeth, it can also have an immediate effect on bad breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started with the 16 oz. bottles, recently moved up to the 32 oz. bottles and, when I did, added this little guy, which is great for purses, travel and other over-nighters, especially those that might involve some kissing. It&#x27;s also a good size for giving Dr. Elie&#x27;s system a trial run. And easy to refill from the larger bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figure that if swishing CloSYS around in my mouth twice a day can help save me from needing to see a periodontist or receiving yet another chair-side lecture by my dentist&#x27;s super critical hygienist, it&#x27;ll be well worth its price. And then some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Phillips also has a web site with info on her mouth care system that you might want to check out. But, frankly, I&#x27;ve found the book a better read and easier to understand (I expect there are some editors we have to thank for that.)</li>
            <li> i need this small bottle for travel. last time i took my giant bottle - too mcuh extra weight. ever since i started this, no more morning breath. this stuff is great. i am hooked. always watch the stores for the sales so i can get the large size cheaper with the coupon included in the big bottles. will use the big bottle to refill this. can&#x27;t go without.</li>
