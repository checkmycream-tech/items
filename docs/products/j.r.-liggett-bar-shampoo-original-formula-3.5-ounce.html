            <li>It felt great.</li>
            <li>J.R. Liggetts is a great shampoo bar.</li>
            <li>This is a great item.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just great.  </li>
            <li>This soap is great.</li>
            <li>and because of the GREAT PRICE ($1.76 /ounce).  </li>
            <li>It has a light very pleasant scent and leaves my hair in excellent condition.  </li>
            <li>love this soap!!</li>
            <li>The lather is very nice.</li>
            <li>It lathers great, and has a really pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>but I opt to find even better so still on the search for the perfect shampoo bar.  </li>
            <li>The combination of these 2 products has my hair looking beautiful, healthy and shiny!</li>
            <li>so it may be wise to shop around before buying from Amazon.</li>
            <li>but my husband loved it.  </li>
            <li>good,</li>
            <li>It was a good idea and worked well for my body and clothes.</li>
            <li>I have shoulder-length, oily, brunette hair, and it&#x27;s surprising how well my hair responds to this bar shampoo.</li>
            <li>and it arrived in good condition.</li>
            <li>And while it doesn&#x27;t smell as good, it does work as well.  </li>
            <li>Good product and service.</li>
            <li>Heard it was good soap for washing and shampoo.</li>
            <li>Although the waves looked good, I did not like the fact that my hair was all stuck together and tangled.</li>
            <li>and I get good wave/curl definition.</li>
            <li>i like it because it does a good job of cleaning my hair-</li>
            <li>Smells good and does a good work on washing your hair.</li>
            <li>Very nice, compact and handy as an all-purpose soap.</li>
            <li>I bought 2 bars, the original formula, and the jojoba and peppermint formula, and I gotta say, damn I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li>Extremely healthy and beautiful looking.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant scent and lathers nicely.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this wonderful old-fashioned formula.</li>
            <li>It smooths fly away hair and leaves your hair healthy.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is great for home, but even better for travel.</li>
            <li>Many reviews I read said that their results were great, but there is a learning curve and it takes a week or so for your hair to adjust to the change, and there&#x27;s a waxy feeling after washing</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it leathers very nicely, BUT</li>
            <li>We love this soap!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love this bar!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite one!</li>
            <li>Great shampoo and arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li>but when I did it was amazing.</li>
            <li>It lathers so amazingly.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the results</li>
            <li>doctor can&#x27;t believe it,as a matter of fact, she says that my condition can \\&quot;heal on it&#x27;s own suddenly\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I kind of like just running my hands around in my hair during the day if I&#x27;m spacing out for a minute.</li>
            <li>this stuff is really really nice.</li>
            <li>This bar lathers nicely with the help of coconut oil as opposed to sulfates.</li>
            <li>It really cleans and rinses wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>however, I like it when my hair has a nice scent...</li>
            <li>but FYI it&#x27;s rose</li>
            <li>Amazing product my hair is clean!!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff - so easy to use, great results.</li>
            <li>it dissolves very very easily.</li>
            <li>This one happens to lather very easily.</li>
            <li>When used with soft water - it is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>First of all, it arrived a week before sheduled wich was amazing and a great surprise.</li>
            <li>This is a great shampoo and really fun to use.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product, produces a lush lather, is healthy for the hair.</li>
            <li>Oh well...it was too good to be true.</li>
            <li>It goes into hair very smoothly.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this shampoo bar.</li>
            <li>I have not had to use conditioner or a vinegar rinse at all with this shampoo bar, and my hair has more body than ever and seems to be truer in color.</li>
            <li>So I happened upon this product, ordered it and after 2 uses, I am in love with it.  </li>
            <li>Much better than &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I SO wanted to love this.</li>
            <li>Which is why I I considered buying this shampoo, as it says most people don&#x27;t need conditioner after using it</li>
            <li>and it helps with static in hair...</li>
            <li>and it make brushing my hair afterwards a more pleasurable task.&lt;br</li>
            <li>safe use in colored hair</li>
            <li>, I love it</li>
            <li>have had a healthy scalp since.</li>
            <li>Do NOT let this adjustment period discourage you from using this fantastic product, though!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing better or more convenient.    </li>
            <li>So many reviews have nailed this experience already, but here goes.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t know how many fancy shampoos this has</li>
            <li>Will gladly continue using and purchase this brand again.</li>
            <li>(I like to pack light!)</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Bought it because it looked interesting - a bar shampoo??  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>This stopped working sooner than most -</li>
            <li>My sister and I have used this shampoo for years and have converted many people to it also.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this.</li>
            <li>Perfect for flying (not a liquid or gel), especially because it takes up almost no</li>
            <li>My hair looks and feels so much more healthy after using this product.</li>
            <li>Simply the best.  </li>
            <li>Of course, I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day anymore, which incidentally, most women with longer hair should not do anyway.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s MAGIC</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this shampoo many times and love it.</li>
            <li>So much more environmentally sustainable than plastic bottles.</li>
            <li>We are on a mission to eradicate the use of plastic from our lives, so we&#x27;ve been trying lots of alternative shampoo methods, including baking soda (many people swear by this</li>
            <li>I like this product, and was happy to find it at a reasonable price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Now I am really glad that I tried it.</li>
            <li>&quot; I would also recommend this to people who want to be able to bring shampoo with them while traveling but do not want to deal with plastic bottles.</li>
            <li>Glad to find this on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I am holding out hope I can try it again and have it work :)</li>
            <li>or I wouldn&#x27;t even be able to comb it afterwards.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Will buy more of this.  </li>
            <li>Love this soap.  </li>
            <li>While it worked really well, it didn&#x27;t smell great and there was some effort</li>
            <li>The smell is interesting, it may put off some, but I love it.</li>
            <li>love not having a plastic bottle to throw away.  </li>
            <li>i will order more when i run out.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I did a TON of research looking for a better alternative, and this bar shampoo had the highest rating.</li>
            <li>I was able to go three days without my hair looking/getting oily before another wash.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely stocking up on this for all my travels :-)</li>
            <li>Years ago I tried a bar shampoo and wasn&#x27;t really pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo… love how it cleans my hair… love how I&#x27;m not using any plastic… love everything about it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s better product out there.</li>
            <li>Take the bar and rub it in your hair to get more &amp;#34;bubbles&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Lather is rich and I love it!</li>
            <li>I have been using this for over a year now, and I love</li>
            <li>In fact, it seems to have more body than it used to.</li>
            <li>Bought originally for the convenience during a camping trip... ended up loving it</li>
            <li>the plus side, it didn&#x27;t have any sort of strong scent (a bonus if you don&#x27;t want to attract bugs!), and it lathered up fine.</li>
            <li>It is very light weight, easy to pack and carry in the field.</li>
            <li>I switched away from normal shampoo 4 months ago and was using a Baking Soda / ACV process on my hair, but my hair never truly felt great.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it&#x27;s so great not to strip my hair of all its natural oils every time I wash it.</li>
            <li>Great product, have been 3 months shampoo free now thanks to this bar</li>
            <li>With the negatives aside I have to say this product is perfect for people traveling or for those that no longer want to use shampoo&#x27;s that dry out your hair.    </li>
            <li>I am so pleased, and it is really easy to use.</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s current size is perfect for travel, you can easily fit two of these into those soap dish travel cases.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve visited numerous doctors,dermatologists,etc, seeking the best treatments available.  </li>
            <li>My scalp is as clean as it was when I was a child!</li>
            <li>and my husband has straight-as-a-board fine hair, and we both love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I love this bar for my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I am able to use it from head to toe without skin irritation, and it leaves my fine hair clean and manageable!</li>
            <li>My hair gets nice and clean but there is still a slight amount of my hair&#x27;s oils which is wonderful, because I think a lot of us strive for this.</li>
            <li>all natural, no plastic packaging, great for travel, etc., etc.</li>
            <li>Works great so far.</li>
            <li>This is a great natural shampoo.</li>
            <li>At my parents&#x27; house it works great, because they have soft water.  </li>
            <li>It was a great buy, I recomend it for sensitive scalps like I have.</li>
            <li>to use, lathers well, smells great and leaves the hair clean, soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>My Dad and even my 83 yr old Grandma now love and use this shampoo bar!!</li>
            <li>Besides the SLS factor, JR liggett&#x27;s is more environmentally friendly.</li>
            <li>also tried the JR Liggett&#x27;s Jojoba shampoo, and I think I like this original type better.</li>
            <li>My hair feels clean and healthy</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can easily take just the bar, the paper wrapper and a ZipLoc on a trip and have all you need.  </li>
            <li>I love the literal squeaky clean I can get from my hair.  </li>
            <li>Lathers easily.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve used it intermittently since June)and lathers on easily.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get this to work well in my adult hair, but it works amazing in my children&#x27;s!  </li>
            <li>I liked this product at first.  </li>
            <li>Pretty nice, no problems</li>
            <li>Some reviewers note that this product doesn&#x27;t lather - actually, it lathers beautifully.</li>
            <li>It worked fine for a couple of weeks and then, like others have mentioned:  </li>
            <li>I have hair that is fine and somewhat curly.  </li>
            <li>and it works just fine.  </li>
            <li>and it is just fine.</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>but I did an Acv rinse and everything was fine after that.</li>
            <li>but the options available to use smell really strong, all day</li>
            <li>I noticed since I started using this product, my hair drys much more quickly.</li>
            <li>Mild fragrance and lots of lather!  </li>
            <li>Low odor, easy to use and great results.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is amazing and does exactly what it says, washes clean with NO BUILDUP and RESIDUE from repeated washings.</li>
            <li>If they were to double the size it would be great.</li>
            <li>After 1 week I noticed a noticeable improvement in my scalp, and after a month I&#x27;m 100% dandruff free.</li>
            <li>and I think my scalp and hair look/feel better after a weeks worth of use.</li>
            <li>Lathers up easily, rinses out clean.  </li>
            <li>I liked this soap so much that I ordered the herbal version and can&#x27;t wait to try that one out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After I get out of the shower I LIGHTLY apply olive oil to my ends then work my way up through my hair.</li>
            <li>I read a lot about using this kind of shampoo before I bought it, so I knew I&#x27;d have to use it for a while before I could really know how it worked.</li>
            <li>Great, simple ingredients, and deals with dandruff.  </li>
            <li>It has a light fluffy lather and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good; I&#x27;ve washed 3x with this</li>
            <li>Thank you J.R. Liggett for making such an awesome NATURAL product!!!</li>
            <li>I definitely liked the convenience of it and that it made my hair feel squeaky clean but wasn&#x27;t sure if my hair looked any better than when I used my regular shampoo.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will never go back to shampoo or conditioner filled with chemicals again!!!  </li>
            <li>This bar strikes the perfect balance of my hair feeling clean but not too dried out.</li>
            <li>I use the natural original bar and it has a mild pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>Smells so light and clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure others have mentioned this, but since it&#x27;s the primary reason for this review, I have to say it again.  </li>
            <li>I had to restrain myself from writing a review after my first use because I loved the results so much.</li>
            <li>All of them told me the same thing \\&quot;scalp dermatitis is not curable, you will live with the condition for the rest of your life and the best we can do is manage your condition\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I find I still have to use a bit of conditioner on my tips, but that&#x27;ll probably change as my hair starts producing its own oils normally again.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like making your own soap (or if you&#x27;re just too busy, like me), there are more economical bars out there.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s travel friendly, too.</li>
            <li>so I got the original formula here.  </li>
            <li>If you enjoy &amp; appreciate natural products, you will LOVE this one!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even better than I first thought.</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure what I thought.</li>
            <li>I gave this a star because it&#x27;s so ECO FRIENDLY</li>
            <li>I have mid-back length, very fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel clean after using it anymore.</li>
            <li>i learned about sls in most commercia shampoo&#x27;s and decided to seek out a more natural shampoo.</li>
            <li>It lathers so well and leaves my hair feeling clean.</li>
            <li>My hair felt clean, and the bar lasts and lasts.  </li>
            <li>Yes, your hair is squeaky clean, and as others mentioned, you may think you need to use conditioner - but don&#x27;t - you don&#x27;t need too.</li>
            <li>Washes hair clean.  </li>
            <li>I know my hair was clean</li>
            <li>Clean feeling without feeling stripped if that makes sense.  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34; formula scent could be described as unisex, clean, and unobtrusive.</li>
            <li>I still can&#x27;t believe that, looking at the ingredient list, this can clean my hair.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo bar lathers well and leaves my hair clean with no product build up.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my hair from frizzing in humid weather, and my hair feels clean and hydrated.</li>
            <li>My hair never felt so clean.</li>
            <li>No waxy feeling (although my hair does feel squeaky clean after washing the soap out)</li>
            <li>I felt clean.</li>
            <li>My hair is clean, shiny, with no tangles.</li>
            <li>There are so many positive things about it:</li>
            <li>The original has a light rosy scent and is quite fun to use.</li>
            <li>There is nothing special about this \\&quot;shampoo\\&quot; bar.</li>
            <li>so I need something with alot more moisture, but if you have fine hair or normal hair</li>
            <li>Upon first use, of course, no poo for a week, but while rinsing this from my hair, it immediately felt squeaky clean!  </li>
            <li>and I was super excited to try it.</li>
            <li>It has a very light scent that is barely detectable, but pleasant and natural.</li>
            <li>She says that my hair is much softer and shinier that before.  :)</li>
            <li>This stuff is really cool.  </li>
            <li>Much more convent than liquids and travels well without taking up much space.</li>
            <li>I also feel really good about sending those suds into our water system (versus commercial shampoos.)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of what I would expect an \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; soap to smell like.</li>
            <li>They never try to doctor your hair as much as liquids, plus you&#x27;re not wasting resources moving water around, and wasting your money thinking you&#x27;re getting more shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have a bit of a wave and this shampoo brings out the natural texture perfectly when I just comb through and air dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this shampoo probably works great with soft water, but since I don&#x27;t have soft water, I can&#x27;t really say.  </li>
            <li>It is also great for people trying to get away from sulfates, alcohol, and other damaging chemicals.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product was shipped out quickly.</li>
            <li>The scent it exudes is a mild herbal scent and in a pinch it can be used as a body soap as well.</li>
            <li>but I think liquid shampoo is more better than solid soap.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly</li>
            <li>When preparing for an overseas trip I had to find it again, luckily Amazon had it available.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li>I have super curly hair and use Lisa Rachael Argon Oil Cleansing Conditioner the rest of the time.</li>
            <li>Really cleans my hair squeaky clean but with fine hair it leaves tangles even if I use a apple cider vinegar rinse.  </li>
            <li>J R Liggett Old-Fashioned Shampoo Original Formula is a great product if you find that bottled shampoos dry out your hair too much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other shampoo bars before and this is the best so far</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and clean and I love using it.</li>
            <li>My hair is so easy to comb after this step and very shiny after it dries.  </li>
            <li>To sum it up, JR Liggett&#x27;s is a fantastic, environmentally responsible product with all-natural and safe ingredients, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>So now, after three uses, I&#x27;m positive that my results will always be this fantastic.</li>
            <li>Love the old fashioned bar shampoo!</li>
            <li>I should just buy this in bulk: I&#x27;ve been using it regularly for more than a year now!</li>
            <li>I did that the first time, but I have shoulder-length hair!</li>
            <li>and I guess will last two more months easily.</li>
            <li>me :) was surprised how quickly it came..</li>
            <li>This is an excellent change to make from bottled shampoos if you&#x27;re trying to waste less plastic, fossil fuels (this is much lighter to ship), and be good to your skin.</li>
            <li>Sometimes, you have to take a minute for it to really lather, but when it does, it is really fabulous.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this shampoo for several months now, and the change in my hair is amazing.</li>
            <li>Sulfate free and so gentle on your hair.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;d known that a sulfate free shampoo felt like this, I&#x27;d have tried one much sooner.</li>
            <li>and I did get my moneys worth.</li>
            <li>my hair is softer and cleaner-feeling than it has ever been in my entire life and my husband says it smells nice.</li>
            <li>After washing, rising with water and Apple Cider Vinegar and blowdrying, my hair felt amazingly soft and it looked shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by the lather (didn&#x27;t expect it to) and love the way my gray hair feels and behaves.</li>
            <li>And there&#x27;s just something fun about sudsing up by wiping a bar of shampoo soap all over your head.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something natural since I had been reading about so many women doing the &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; experiment.  </li>
            <li>Bar soap is always a lot of fun to use.</li>
            <li>fit the bill pretty much to a T!</li>
            <li>I was looking to a good natural alternative to shampoo and this is way better than I could have expected.</li>
            <li>The ingredients read out as a bunch of different natural oils, has a pleasant mild smell.</li>
            <li>I like the lather this soap produced and it made my hair feel soft and very clean with just one wash.</li>
            <li>If I avoid highly processed foods because they aren&#x27;t good for me, why wouldn&#x27;t I apply the same logic for my shampoo?  </li>
            <li>Does leave ends feeling &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; but use organic Argan oil right after shampoo</li>
            <li>Takes some practice though, to not get scared how the hair feel right after shampooed.</li>
            <li>But after a week of using JR Ligget&#x27;s shampoo-it clears right up.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much lighter to pack than a bottle of shampoo and my hair was really clean.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle for my scalp, clean wash.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft, full of body, and smooth instead of frizzy after blow drying.</li>
            <li>It really does clean your hair without stripping out the oils.  </li>
            <li>but my hair felt so clean and much much softer afterwards.  </li>
            <li>It does not take much to get your hair clean.</li>
            <li>Most commercial shampoos bother my scalp but this is wonderfully mild while being strong enough to remove hair spray easily.  </li>
            <li>And it leaves my hair feeling soft and clean!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a space saver, cuts down on plastic bottles, lathers very well, smells good, and leaves my hair clean.  </li>
            <li>As before, I have been very pleased with the product, and the delivery was just as expected.</li>
            <li>pleased I finally found what works best for me as I do have sensitive skin (dermatitis) and no more itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s true, the first time you use it, it really does do something for your hair.  </li>
            <li>Yet it also is strong enough to make it clean.</li>
            <li>no conditioner needed, less tangles than the BS+ACV method, and it leaves my hair feeling and looking good for a couple of days.</li>
            <li>Its all natural, has a mild clean scent and it lasts forever.</li>
            <li>those people who get a build up from washing their hair with natural soaps in hard water, a couple of table spoons of apple cider vinegar in a generous glass (16 ozs) of hot water makes an excellent rinse.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t like it), regular bar soap (worked great when we had a water softener, but not so great in hard water), and bulk shampoo (which is still in plastic, but at least it&#x27;s in large containers, and we take it home in our own glass jars...</li>
            <li>Very gentle and no dertergents</li>
            <li>I recommend that if you switch to JR Liggett&#x27;s, you do it at a time that you will not have to go out very much</li>
            <li>you very much</li>
            <li>Regular shampoos always left my hair frizzy, fly away and very spongy right after washing.</li>
            <li>The texture was super soft, it melted easy without melting too much and it washed very well.</li>
            <li>Bar is excellent for travel (I keep it in an inexpensive soap box and let it air dry after every use - don&#x27;t leave it in the shower unless you want a sticky, gooey mess...</li>
            <li>still wash it every 2-3 days, but it definitely looks a lot better during that period.</li>
            <li>I wish I could find it locally, but I&#x27;m glad Amazon has</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t exactly comment as to how well this shampoo did for those two things.</li>
            <li>even if $6 seems a bit much for a 3.5 ounce bar, you must take in to consideration the fact that you don&#x27;t need to buy conditioner and that the bar lasts to between 6 months and a year!</li>
            <li>A month later the bar is still mostly there</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I finally decided to try it!</li>
            <li>Maybe a liquid formula of this same shampoo will better suit me.</li>
            <li>All soap is oil based, and changing from one type to another will make a difference the first couple of uses - then it stops working.  </li>
            <li>, I want to really recommend this product to the people that suffer from dandruff, give it a try!.</li>
            <li>Probably better for men/people with short hair.</li>
            <li>I have a feeling it may last many months.</li>
            <li>I love the product and it&#x27;s almost like a brand-new lifestyle after using bottled shampoos every day for years-which only damaged my hair.</li>
            <li>This not my first bar of the product, as I&#x27;ve had it from non-Amazonian sources before.  </li>
            <li>Some people may go through a transition period when first using this and may experience some waxy, oily buildup on the scalp.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>First time I tried a shampoo bar.</li>
            <li>If Liggett&#x27;s formula is changed, I&#x27;d be willing to try it again.</li>
            <li>I have contact dermatitis and have not been able to find a commercial shampoo that doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itch.</li>
            <li>I have long, very fine wavy/frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>Recently converted my family to SLS free products and we are absolutely smitten with J.R. Liggett&#x27;s Original Shampoo.</li>
            <li>first used JR Liggett&#x27;s over 20 years ago on a long bicycle trip, where space and weight are very important.  </li>
            <li>I now use Lush solid shampoo ([...]) which is more pricey ($2.80-$6.30 / ounce) but still eco friendly and it works really well.</li>
            <li>but as for now, I&#x27;m okay with trying a few new ones. :)</li>
            <li>A balance between a natural body and sheen while still having a clean look and smell.</li>
            <li>Now my hair feels clean and is shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>The shampoo leaves your hair feeling squeaky clean but the rinse removes any waxiness from the shampoo and leaves your hair feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>I had been looking for a natural way to clean my hair and save money.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels soft, bouncy and clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once, so far I really liked it.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel clean, but not stripped of natural oils, which ends up making people with oily hair like me end up producing more oil in the long run.</li>
            <li>My hair is short but knots easily</li>
            <li>so make sure it can dry</li>
            <li>warm it up first, then pour on my hair, let it sit for a few minutes and rinse.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-I also noticed some sort of a build up after a week or so (weird, considering I live in the beautiful Pacific Northwest and our water is some of the softest in the country!)</li>
            <li>This bar dried it out nicely without making it too dry and made my hair curl more than it ever has before--</li>
            <li>I typically use a more natural shampoo for oily scalp (made by Lush)--I tried this hoping for a less-expensive and even more natural alternative.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and fine hair, and I was looking for a natural product that I could use as shampoo and as body wash.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sounds like work, but it&#x27;s not really once you get a routine down, and it&#x27;s a great natural product, that I&#x27;m excited to take on an upcoming trip.</li>
            <li>I wish I would have known there were other types of this bar I would have gotten one for dry hair as this one isn&#x27;t great .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m never going back to regular shampoo, this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Made my hair very sticky feely.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately it really isn&#x27;t working for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried using it consistently for 2 weeks now (every 2-3 days, as I normally do).</li>
            <li>I have been using the shampoo bar twice a day for a whole month</li>
            <li>It made my hair feel very waxy and sticky.</li>
            <li>Works very well too.  </li>
            <li>I really like the whole idea of bar shampoo, but JR Liggett just wasn&#x27;t for me...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have an issue with body or volume</li>
            <li>It makes it so much easier to rinse out and evenly distribute the shampoo...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably because of how much hair I have, but still...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a picky person, but I do think that $5.09 was a reasonable price</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>really like this product.</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>I store it in the wooden holder that is available.</li>
            <li>Just didnt work for me really...</li>
            <li>shampoo/conditioner, so i have to be particularly careful to make sure i rub it all the way in all over my scalp.</li>
            <li>do use a separate conditioner with this soap on most days (Organix Coconut Milk) as my hair does get tangled even though I wash it carefully.</li>
            <li>It smelled like cheap Irish Spring soap.</li>
            <li>Delivery fast, east and convenient.</li>
            <li>Does the job and lasts much longer than any bottle of poison I used to use</li>
            <li>My hair used to be voluminous and very wavy.</li>
            <li>After the adjustment period, it will keep your hair MUCH cleaner.</li>
            <li>Want my whole family to use it.</li>
            <li>, how much it lathered.  </li>
            <li>My hair is so much softer and shinier with this method than with chemically laden store bought shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like it</li>
            <li>I have very wavy hair, sometimes curly.</li>
            <li>I read so much about this shampoo</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin, and therefore, oily hair.</li>
            <li>, I could easily brush it out while still wet with a natural bristle brush, and my hair just feels so clean.</li>
            <li>so much</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t quite ready to go that route</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m doing the whole &amp;#34;shampoo free&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Rub it into your hands or straight into your hair.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>My whole family loves it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Love how simple it is and how .clean and soft it leaves my hair</li>
            <li>Took about a week for my hair to adjust (no more &amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34; feel), and now I love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve searched and tried so many shampoos and conditioners due to itchy scalp.  </li>
            <li>May now be able to shampoo every other day, extending the life.  </li>
            <li>Well I&#x27;m happy to report that this product DOES work with hard water and it works well in general.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Enters this simple shampoo bar with few ingredients, how simple and effective this shampoo is!!</li>
            <li>The great thing is that you don&#x27;t need to wash your hair every single day because the shampoo maintains your natural shine and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy the next day like so many high end (read waste of money) shampoos.</li>
            <li>and you can easily clean your hair with it in the same way.</li>
            <li>It was smaller than I thought it would be, but I like how it leave my hair feeling clean.</li>
            <li>Without all the extra chemicals that bottled shampoos use, my hair comes out shiny and clean and manageable every time I use it.</li>
            <li>But possibly my skin is still adjusting to clean life without SLS causing this?  </li>
            <li>when I woke up and saw my hair after trying this, I couldn&#x27;t believe how incredibly wavy it was (even a few little curls), and so much body...</li>
            <li>I have fairly normal straight hair, perhaps a bit oily.</li>
            <li>I wash twice a week, and in between time my hair stays soft and pretty, and I don&#x27;t need to condition.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it my hair was as soft as it&#x27;s ever been.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have very naturally oil hair, my hair is typically wavy and dry, so for me it is great.</li>
            <li>, we&#x27;ve tried a few different formulas of the jr liggets shampoo bars, and the original was our favorite.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommended for travel (particularly backpacking).</li>
            <li>/&gt;- lasts a decent amount of time</li>
            <li>Did not need conditioner as it left hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a classic.</li>
            <li>The wrapper says that it lasts as long as a 24 ounce bottle of shampoo would last, but I&#x27;m not quite sure of that - it depends on how much you lather up each time.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice, lathers beautifully, long lasting, leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Over the last few years I&#x27;ve been getting more interested in, and purchasing personal care products and cleaners that are less toxic to the environment and made with fewer and simpler ingredients (ones I can read and understand :P).  </li>
            <li>Much better than conventional shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shampoo bar.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shampoo bar.</li>
            <li>I like that your hair does feel extremely clean after you use it, but I do not like how long it takes to lather.</li>
            <li>is that my hair can be a little static afterward</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair and scalp fresh and squeaky clean without all the harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>FYI, my hair got super dry and was really static-y after using. :</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for anyone wanting a truly natural, affordable hair washing solution that really works.</li>
            <li>Does clean your hair well and feels light and natural with this product, like the fact it has very few chemicals in this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I figured that the natural ingredients would help soothe my skin, but nothing really happened...</li>
            <li>My hair is thoroughly clean, and it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out.</li>
            <li>It looks shinier and is softer, and it does not seem to get naturally oily as fast as it does using bottled shampoos from the store.  </li>
            <li>I also really like that this is made with all natural ingredients, and that it&#x27;s eco-friendly.  </li>
            <li>You can feel that your hair is clean but it doesn&#x27;t feel dry.</li>
            <li>So much for going natural..</li>
            <li>My hair gets oily pretty fast, so I shampoo daily.</li>
            <li>I pretty much have no choice but to continue to use my regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li>As soon as I discontinued using the Liggett&#x27;s shampoo bar, my scalp returned to normal.  </li>
            <li>and it is a bit of a different process, but the results are totally worth it</li>
            <li>Lather and rinse as normal.</li>
            <li>Be sure to store it somewhere (or on something) that won&#x27;t allow water to be trapped under the bar</li>
            <li>Some shampoos seemed OK, but after using a few times my scalp was irritated.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know what caused it, and I&#x27;m disappointed that I didn&#x27;t have a good experience with this product like many others have.</li>
            <li>I use this everyday and my scalp NEVER itches any more.</li>
            <li>Obviously, this shampoo bar works for some people since it has recieved some very positive reviews.</li>
            <li>It smells great, and I am anxious to try the peppermint and other flavored kinds.</li>
            <li>Gets my facial stubble nice and clean before shaving without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li>It definitely feels like this bar totally strips your hair of all moisture in the shower (it&#x27;ll feel super squeaky and waxy-like), but it certainly isn&#x27;t the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My naturally straight Asian hair became very wavy after using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>After rinsing off, wasn&#x27;t sure if needed conditioner, but once I dried my hair, it was so soft and</li>
            <li>Hair feels super dry and the scent wasn&#x27;t listed</li>
            <li>Love this little bar!</li>
            <li>I like this soap very much and would use it when I need extra refreshment and bounce!</li>
            <li>I recommend that when you use it, you put it in your hair right when you get it wet, and leave it in until the very end of your shower (after you&#x27;ve soaped your body, shaved your legs,</li>
            <li>My long hair was easily managed without all the extra conditioners, mousse and sprays.</li>
            <li>The wrapper is recyclable, and there&#x27;s no waste once you&#x27;ve used the bar up!  </li>
            <li>After reading some comments and forums, I thought that increased shedding is normal while switching from liquid shampoo (natural, no sulfates, parabens, silicones,...) to a bar shampoo.</li>
            <li>The acidic vinegar will smooth them down again.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t use any conditioner, this leaves your hair soft but I&#x27;ve also been able to style with very little product.  </li>
            <li>decided to try it again in my new home that has soft water.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not high maintenance when it comes to my hair (thick-ish &amp; wavy), since it&#x27;s always up in a bun due to work, but I still want it to be looking great as I get older and not full of chemicals/preservatives, fillers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use (just rub it along your hair a few times and then work it in -</li>
            <li>Pleasant, faint smell of roses, not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I tried other bar shampoos (too drying), Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Baby Mild (too harsh for hair), LUSH soaps (full of chemicals and too much scent), and even tried going without shampoo (no &#x27;poo - didn&#x27;t work for me).</li>
            <li>I can go 2 days with no washing, which I love due to how long it is.</li>
            <li>This shampoo made my hair feel a little funny at first</li>
            <li>I also now wash my hair every other day, because it doesn&#x27;t get oily so quickly anymore.  </li>
            <li>No excessive build-up so far, no strong odors (I prefer unscented body products, though I believe there are scented options available if that&#x27;s your thing).&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it left my hair feeling gross and hard to manage; this didn&#x27;t get better over time either, it always felt pretty much exactly the same.</li>
            <li>though I take the shampoo out of the shower to air try everyday, it is a huge blob of jelly.</li>
            <li>I have went back to using my old \\&quot;natural\\&quot; liquid shampoo and my hair feels much cleaner with no \\&quot;build-up\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>However, after using this shampoo daily at home for about 2 months, I developed intense itching in my scalp.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s easily fixed.</li>
            <li>All natural, use for hair and body.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural, no bottles and it won&#x27;t hurt the environment.</li>
            <li>It felt as if I couldn&#x27;t wash it out completely.</li>
            <li>If I ever move somewhere where the water is really soft, I will try to use this product again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-I bought this shampoo for $5.09 (including tax) at a local whole foods store...</li>
            <li>As it get&#x27;s near the end of its use</li>
            <li>i have sensitive skin fron head to toe and have always had dandruff which required me to wash and scrub my scalp every day.</li>
            <li>This overproduction makes you need to wash your hair constantly to keep the oil at a reasonable level.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t need a conditioner to make it soft.</li>
            <li>However, I found that it left a film in my hair, even after I lathered up twice and rinsed VERY well.</li>
            <li>This shampoo lasts about three to five months if two people are using it nearly every day.</li>
            <li>and the third - oh for the luv of - not so much.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to switch to an all natural shampoo without sulfates so I can stop stripping my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not every day you find natural products for an affordable price.</li>
            <li>For those who have never used natural shampoo/conditioner it does take a period of time for your hair to adjust-</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, and I need shampoos that won&#x27;t take its natural oils out and make it frizzy.</li>
            <li>I was amazed when I use the bar directly on my scalp, swiping a couple times</li>
            <li>The natural oils in the scalp was adjusting to just using this bar</li>
            <li>So far no oily build up like what would occur with shampoo.</li>
            <li>Plus, the cheapest price I&#x27;ve found so far has been on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This shampoo bar makes my hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li>The paper packaging feels old school to me.  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>But about week #4 my hair seemed to adjust and is soft and shiny now.  </li>
            <li>i had brittle, burnt hair and using this soap for 2 months made it baby soft..</li>
            <li>If you find it dries your hair out too much, try spritzing your hair moderately thoroughly with a mixture of 75% vinegar and 25% water after you use it.</li>
            <li>If you wash this out completely, you won&#x27;t smell, and it will help retain your hair&#x27;s natural pH.</li>
            <li>so I chose to go with a natural shampoo.  </li>
            <li>My hair is easier to control (I have naturally curly hair)</li>
            <li>Just rub the bar on directly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Liggetts - apply directly to head.</li>
            <li>The only issue I have with this product, which does not speak to its quality, is that I go through a bar much faster than the manufacturer claims.</li>
            <li>Some soaps don&#x27;t list that they contain it, because it dissipates during the soapmaking process, but it is an ingredient even in natural soaps.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>During that time, my hair was somewhat thicker, but it was also constantly filled with static, and just seemed really dry (which is weird, because I normally have oily hair).  </li>
            <li>Anyway, it seems so odd at first to use a bar of soap on your hair, but this really works well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a liquid, so you can take it anywhere, and it adds less weight to your luggage than a full bottle of liquid gel</li>
            <li>Even the most gentle of regular bottle shampoos turn my head into an oil slick after only a day, so this stuff is a lifesaver to my scalp.</li>
            <li>after I first washed, my hair felt a little odd, but I turned out beautiful after I air dried and flat ironed.</li>
            <li>I am on my first 3.5 ounce bar, which is smaller than the standard bath soap bar a 4 ounces.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Only three stars for this since it is so small for the price and claims to be more than what it is - a standard bar of soap.</li>
            <li>After rinsing it off, my hair is so squeaky clean that I only need to wash it every other day (</li>
            <li>I have waist length fine, straight hair and my only complaint</li>
            <li>BTW, I have long waist-length straight hair.</li>
            <li>but it really lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>My normally oily hair only needs to be washed 2 times per week, and I don&#x27;t even have to use conditioner.</li>
            <li>This is the only shampoo that works for me--  and leaves my hair feeling soft and thick and healthy.</li>
            <li>It feels fluffy and full after shampooing.  </li>
            <li>It takes very little to get lots of lather and the scent is a wholesome clean natural scent.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo bar is gentle enough to use daily, although you will probably find you don&#x27;t need to.</li>
            <li>A few quick passes through your hair is all you need.</li>
            <li>Am just starting my second bar, having welded the first bar to the second.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re little, and if you don&#x27;t take good care of them (storing them in a dry metal box, for example), they vanish in few days.</li>
            <li>At first I was skeptical on how easy this would be to apply to my hair</li>
            <li>The bar is small (smaller than I expected), but lasts a good long while (equals a 24 oz.</li>
            <li>It is a bar of plain old soap (oils, lye, and water), the kind you can make in your kitchen with a little knowledge and some standard chemical safety gear.</li>
            <li>It left my scalp dry but the hair near it was very waxy and felt greasy..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m older and have grey hair and this seems to help prevent my hair from being too &amp;#34;fly-away&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Lots of fluffy lather; rinses cleanly unless the water is super hard; hair feels alarmingly stiff while wet, but no tangles; and then -- it dries and hair looks better than it has in years.</li>
            <li>scalp gets oily very easily, however, hence the use of expensive Lush shampoo--if your don&#x27;t have &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; hair then maybe it&#x27;ll work for you.</li>
            <li>The fact of the matter is that SLS was pretty much created to work well with hard water--and it does.  </li>
            <li>For starters, it does not contain the harsh detergent Sodium Laurel Sulfate, which most conventional shampoos have.</li>
            <li>The small size fits Into my toilet kit easily.</li>
            <li>as an adult, I would only use this once in while</li>
            <li>The immediate difference I noticed with my kiddos hair was the natural shine, manageability, and bounce had sprung back.</li>
            <li>I stumbled upon this, and even though I&#x27;d seen it in my local natural food store, hadn&#x27;t tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After using my regular shampoo 2x, the shedding was back to normal levels and didn&#x27;t come back.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After using baking soda, my hair would feel kind of waxy and weird..</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t last very long, made hair feel weird, gets all mushy, but it&#x27;s cool because it&#x27;s old school, I wouldn&#x27;t get it again though, regular shampoo is just fine</li>
            <li>The smell was odd to me at first</li>
            <li>At first it seems like their is slightly sticky oil in your hair, but it goes away after a minute or so.</li>
            <li>If this sounds too high maintenance, keep in mind that it should only take a week to get used to the soap, and after that you can ditch the vinegar or only use it occasionally.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to go the more natural route with my beauty products, so I decided to try this bar shampoo since it&#x27;s free of all the crap that commercial products have in them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other shampoo bars, and I really like this one.  </li>
            <li>Simple, long lasting, and gentle on my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to alternate with regular liquid shampoo to bring it back looking normal.  </li>
            <li>I have semi long thick hair and with most shampoos I had to wash every day or my hair would be a big grease ball, not so with this.</li>
            <li>My main complaint is the price and the fact that is is used up quickly, Note keep it out of shower and dry or it will dissolve faster.</li>
            <li>No rashes, no dry itchy skin,</li>
            <li>It does not dry my hair out and it makes my hair feel softer after I wash it.</li>
            <li>I have long natural silky shiny straight black hair and this shampoo bar disappointed me greatly.  </li>
            <li>Of course, my hair took about a week to get used to the sudden lack of SLS in my shampoo - which caused it to be very, very greasy for a few days to a week.</li>
            <li>I now wash my hair every three days (I just rinse with water on the off days) and it is much smoother, shinier and less frizzy.</li>
            <li>After you dry your hair you can feel and see that it retains moisture and has what feels like natural oils in your hair.</li>
            <li>i left the bar in a container (apparently) with water in it, and the bar literally dissolved entirely.</li>
            <li>I realized that you really need to rub the bar down your hair to get enough on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s SO worth it because it  makes my hair really, really soft and thick, and my curls look nicer than when I used SLS based shampoos!  </li>

            <li> This is a great item.  </li>

            <li> This soap is great.</li>

            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> but I opt to find even better so still on the search for the perfect shampoo bar.  </li>
            <li> The combination of these 2 products has my hair looking beautiful, healthy and shiny!</li>
            <li> so it may be wise to shop around before buying from Amazon.</li>
            <li> but my husband loved it.  </li>
            <li> good,</li>
            <li> It was a good idea and worked well for my body and clothes.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder-length, oily, brunette hair, and it&#x27;s surprising how well my hair responds to this bar shampoo.</li>
            <li> and it arrived in good condition.</li>
            <li> And while it doesn&#x27;t smell as good, it does work as well.  </li>
            <li> Good product and service.</li>
            <li> Heard it was good soap for washing and shampoo.</li>
            <li> Although the waves looked good, I did not like the fact that my hair was all stuck together and tangled.</li>
            <li> and I get good wave/curl definition.</li>
            <li> i like it because it does a good job of cleaning my hair-</li>
            <li> Smells good and does a good work on washing your hair.</li>
            <li> Very nice, compact and handy as an all-purpose soap.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 bars, the original formula, and the jojoba and peppermint formula, and I gotta say, damn I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> Extremely healthy and beautiful looking.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant scent and lathers nicely.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this wonderful old-fashioned formula.</li>
            <li> It smooths fly away hair and leaves your hair healthy.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great for home, but even better for travel.</li>
            <li> Many reviews I read said that their results were great, but there is a learning curve and it takes a week or so for your hair to adjust to the change, and there&#x27;s a waxy feeling after washing</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it leathers very nicely, BUT</li>
            <li> We love this soap!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love this bar!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite one!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li> but when I did it was amazing.</li>
            <li> It lathers so amazingly.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the results</li>
            <li> doctor can&#x27;t believe it,as a matter of fact, she says that my condition can \\&quot;heal on it&#x27;s own suddenly\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I kind of like just running my hands around in my hair during the day if I&#x27;m spacing out for a minute.</li>
            <li> this stuff is really really nice.</li>
            <li> This bar lathers nicely with the help of coconut oil as opposed to sulfates.</li>
            <li> It really cleans and rinses wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> however, I like it when my hair has a nice scent...</li>
            <li> but FYI it&#x27;s rose</li>
            <li> Amazing product my hair is clean!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff - so easy to use, great results.</li>
            <li> it dissolves very very easily.</li>
            <li> This one happens to lather very easily.</li>
            <li> When used with soft water - it is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> First of all, it arrived a week before sheduled wich was amazing and a great surprise.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo and really fun to use.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, produces a lush lather, is healthy for the hair.</li>
            <li> Oh well...it was too good to be true.</li>
            <li> It goes into hair very smoothly.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this shampoo bar.</li>
            <li> I have not had to use conditioner or a vinegar rinse at all with this shampoo bar, and my hair has more body than ever and seems to be truer in color.</li>
            <li> So I happened upon this product, ordered it and after 2 uses, I am in love with it.  </li>
            <li> Much better than &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I SO wanted to love this.</li>
            <li> Which is why I I considered buying this shampoo, as it says most people don&#x27;t need conditioner after using it</li>
            <li> and it helps with static in hair...</li>
            <li> and it make brushing my hair afterwards a more pleasurable task.&lt;br</li>
            <li> safe use in colored hair</li>
            <li> , I love it</li>
            <li> have had a healthy scalp since.</li>
            <li> Do NOT let this adjustment period discourage you from using this fantastic product, though!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing better or more convenient.    </li>
            <li> So many reviews have nailed this experience already, but here goes.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t know how many fancy shampoos this has</li>
            <li> Will gladly continue using and purchase this brand again.</li>
            <li> (I like to pack light!)</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Bought it because it looked interesting - a bar shampoo??  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> This stopped working sooner than most -</li>
            <li> My sister and I have used this shampoo for years and have converted many people to it also.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this.</li>
            <li> Perfect for flying (not a liquid or gel), especially because it takes up almost no</li>
            <li> My hair looks and feels so much more healthy after using this product.</li>
            <li> Simply the best.  </li>
            <li> Of course, I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day anymore, which incidentally, most women with longer hair should not do anyway.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s MAGIC</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this shampoo many times and love it.</li>
            <li> So much more environmentally sustainable than plastic bottles.</li>
            <li> We are on a mission to eradicate the use of plastic from our lives, so we&#x27;ve been trying lots of alternative shampoo methods, including baking soda (many people swear by this</li>
            <li> I like this product, and was happy to find it at a reasonable price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Now I am really glad that I tried it.</li>
            <li> &quot; I would also recommend this to people who want to be able to bring shampoo with them while traveling but do not want to deal with plastic bottles.</li>
            <li> Glad to find this on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I am holding out hope I can try it again and have it work :)</li>
            <li> or I wouldn&#x27;t even be able to comb it afterwards.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Will buy more of this.  </li>
            <li> Love this soap.  </li>
            <li> While it worked really well, it didn&#x27;t smell great and there was some effort</li>
            <li> The smell is interesting, it may put off some, but I love it.</li>
            <li> love not having a plastic bottle to throw away.  </li>
            <li> i will order more when i run out.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I did a TON of research looking for a better alternative, and this bar shampoo had the highest rating.</li>
            <li> I was able to go three days without my hair looking/getting oily before another wash.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely stocking up on this for all my travels :-)</li>
            <li> Years ago I tried a bar shampoo and wasn&#x27;t really pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> I love this shampoo… love how it cleans my hair… love how I&#x27;m not using any plastic… love everything about it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s better product out there.</li>
            <li> Take the bar and rub it in your hair to get more &amp;#34;bubbles&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Lather is rich and I love it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a year now, and I love</li>
            <li> In fact, it seems to have more body than it used to.</li>
            <li> Bought originally for the convenience during a camping trip... ended up loving it</li>
            <li> the plus side, it didn&#x27;t have any sort of strong scent (a bonus if you don&#x27;t want to attract bugs!), and it lathered up fine.</li>
            <li> It is very light weight, easy to pack and carry in the field.</li>
            <li> I switched away from normal shampoo 4 months ago and was using a Baking Soda / ACV process on my hair, but my hair never truly felt great.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it&#x27;s so great not to strip my hair of all its natural oils every time I wash it.</li>
            <li> Great product, have been 3 months shampoo free now thanks to this bar</li>
            <li> With the negatives aside I have to say this product is perfect for people traveling or for those that no longer want to use shampoo&#x27;s that dry out your hair.    </li>
            <li> I am so pleased, and it is really easy to use.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s current size is perfect for travel, you can easily fit two of these into those soap dish travel cases.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve visited numerous doctors,dermatologists,etc, seeking the best treatments available.  </li>
            <li> My scalp is as clean as it was when I was a child!</li>
            <li> and my husband has straight-as-a-board fine hair, and we both love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I love this bar for my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I am able to use it from head to toe without skin irritation, and it leaves my fine hair clean and manageable!</li>
            <li> My hair gets nice and clean but there is still a slight amount of my hair&#x27;s oils which is wonderful, because I think a lot of us strive for this.</li>
            <li> all natural, no plastic packaging, great for travel, etc., etc.</li>
            <li> Works great so far.</li>
            <li> This is a great natural shampoo.</li>
            <li> At my parents&#x27; house it works great, because they have soft water.  </li>
            <li> It was a great buy, I recomend it for sensitive scalps like I have.</li>
            <li> to use, lathers well, smells great and leaves the hair clean, soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> My Dad and even my 83 yr old Grandma now love and use this shampoo bar!!</li>
            <li> Besides the SLS factor, JR liggett&#x27;s is more environmentally friendly.</li>
            <li> also tried the JR Liggett&#x27;s Jojoba shampoo, and I think I like this original type better.</li>
            <li> My hair feels clean and healthy</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can easily take just the bar, the paper wrapper and a ZipLoc on a trip and have all you need.  </li>
            <li> I love the literal squeaky clean I can get from my hair.  </li>
            <li> Lathers easily.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve used it intermittently since June)and lathers on easily.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get this to work well in my adult hair, but it works amazing in my children&#x27;s!  </li>
            <li> I liked this product at first.  </li>
            <li> Pretty nice, no problems</li>
            <li> Some reviewers note that this product doesn&#x27;t lather - actually, it lathers beautifully.</li>
            <li> It worked fine for a couple of weeks and then, like others have mentioned:  </li>
            <li> I have hair that is fine and somewhat curly.  </li>
            <li> and it works just fine.  </li>
            <li> and it is just fine.</li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> but I did an Acv rinse and everything was fine after that.</li>
            <li> but the options available to use smell really strong, all day</li>
            <li> I noticed since I started using this product, my hair drys much more quickly.</li>
            <li> Mild fragrance and lots of lather!  </li>
            <li> Low odor, easy to use and great results.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo is amazing and does exactly what it says, washes clean with NO BUILDUP and RESIDUE from repeated washings.</li>
            <li> If they were to double the size it would be great.</li>
            <li> After 1 week I noticed a noticeable improvement in my scalp, and after a month I&#x27;m 100% dandruff free.</li>
            <li> and I think my scalp and hair look/feel better after a weeks worth of use.</li>
            <li> Lathers up easily, rinses out clean.  </li>
            <li> I liked this soap so much that I ordered the herbal version and can&#x27;t wait to try that one out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After I get out of the shower I LIGHTLY apply olive oil to my ends then work my way up through my hair.</li>
            <li> I read a lot about using this kind of shampoo before I bought it, so I knew I&#x27;d have to use it for a while before I could really know how it worked.</li>
            <li> Great, simple ingredients, and deals with dandruff.  </li>
            <li> It has a light fluffy lather and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good; I&#x27;ve washed 3x with this</li>
            <li> Thank you J.R. Liggett for making such an awesome NATURAL product!!!</li>
            <li> I definitely liked the convenience of it and that it made my hair feel squeaky clean but wasn&#x27;t sure if my hair looked any better than when I used my regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will never go back to shampoo or conditioner filled with chemicals again!!!  </li>
            <li> This bar strikes the perfect balance of my hair feeling clean but not too dried out.</li>
            <li> I use the natural original bar and it has a mild pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li> Smells so light and clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure others have mentioned this, but since it&#x27;s the primary reason for this review, I have to say it again.  </li>
            <li> I had to restrain myself from writing a review after my first use because I loved the results so much.</li>
            <li> All of them told me the same thing \\&quot;scalp dermatitis is not curable, you will live with the condition for the rest of your life and the best we can do is manage your condition\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I find I still have to use a bit of conditioner on my tips, but that&#x27;ll probably change as my hair starts producing its own oils normally again.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like making your own soap (or if you&#x27;re just too busy, like me), there are more economical bars out there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s travel friendly, too.</li>
            <li> so I got the original formula here.  </li>
            <li> If you enjoy &amp; appreciate natural products, you will LOVE this one!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even better than I first thought.</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure what I thought.</li>
            <li> I gave this a star because it&#x27;s so ECO FRIENDLY</li>
            <li> I have mid-back length, very fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel clean after using it anymore.</li>
            <li> i learned about sls in most commercia shampoo&#x27;s and decided to seek out a more natural shampoo.</li>
            <li> It lathers so well and leaves my hair feeling clean.</li>
            <li> My hair felt clean, and the bar lasts and lasts.  </li>
            <li> Yes, your hair is squeaky clean, and as others mentioned, you may think you need to use conditioner - but don&#x27;t - you don&#x27;t need too.</li>
            <li> Washes hair clean.  </li>
            <li> I know my hair was clean</li>
            <li> Clean feeling without feeling stripped if that makes sense.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34; formula scent could be described as unisex, clean, and unobtrusive.</li>
            <li> I still can&#x27;t believe that, looking at the ingredient list, this can clean my hair.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo bar lathers well and leaves my hair clean with no product build up.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my hair from frizzing in humid weather, and my hair feels clean and hydrated.</li>
            <li> My hair never felt so clean.</li>
            <li> No waxy feeling (although my hair does feel squeaky clean after washing the soap out)</li>
            <li> I felt clean.</li>
            <li> My hair is clean, shiny, with no tangles.</li>
            <li> There are so many positive things about it:</li>
            <li> The original has a light rosy scent and is quite fun to use.</li>
            <li> There is nothing special about this \\&quot;shampoo\\&quot; bar.</li>
            <li> so I need something with alot more moisture, but if you have fine hair or normal hair</li>
            <li> Upon first use, of course, no poo for a week, but while rinsing this from my hair, it immediately felt squeaky clean!  </li>
            <li> and I was super excited to try it.</li>
            <li> It has a very light scent that is barely detectable, but pleasant and natural.</li>
            <li> She says that my hair is much softer and shinier that before.  :)</li>
            <li> This stuff is really cool.  </li>
            <li> Much more convent than liquids and travels well without taking up much space.</li>
            <li> I also feel really good about sending those suds into our water system (versus commercial shampoos.)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of what I would expect an \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; soap to smell like.</li>
            <li> They never try to doctor your hair as much as liquids, plus you&#x27;re not wasting resources moving water around, and wasting your money thinking you&#x27;re getting more shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have a bit of a wave and this shampoo brings out the natural texture perfectly when I just comb through and air dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this shampoo probably works great with soft water, but since I don&#x27;t have soft water, I can&#x27;t really say.  </li>
            <li> It is also great for people trying to get away from sulfates, alcohol, and other damaging chemicals.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product was shipped out quickly.</li>
            <li> The scent it exudes is a mild herbal scent and in a pinch it can be used as a body soap as well.</li>
            <li> but I think liquid shampoo is more better than solid soap.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly</li>
            <li> When preparing for an overseas trip I had to find it again, luckily Amazon had it available.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li> I have super curly hair and use Lisa Rachael Argon Oil Cleansing Conditioner the rest of the time.</li>
            <li> Really cleans my hair squeaky clean but with fine hair it leaves tangles even if I use a apple cider vinegar rinse.  </li>
            <li> J R Liggett Old-Fashioned Shampoo Original Formula is a great product if you find that bottled shampoos dry out your hair too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other shampoo bars before and this is the best so far</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and clean and I love using it.</li>
            <li> My hair is so easy to comb after this step and very shiny after it dries.  </li>
            <li> To sum it up, JR Liggett&#x27;s is a fantastic, environmentally responsible product with all-natural and safe ingredients, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> So now, after three uses, I&#x27;m positive that my results will always be this fantastic.</li>
            <li> Love the old fashioned bar shampoo!</li>
            <li> I should just buy this in bulk: I&#x27;ve been using it regularly for more than a year now!</li>
            <li> I did that the first time, but I have shoulder-length hair!</li>
            <li> and I guess will last two more months easily.</li>
            <li> me :) was surprised how quickly it came..</li>
            <li> This is an excellent change to make from bottled shampoos if you&#x27;re trying to waste less plastic, fossil fuels (this is much lighter to ship), and be good to your skin.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, you have to take a minute for it to really lather, but when it does, it is really fabulous.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for several months now, and the change in my hair is amazing.</li>
            <li> Sulfate free and so gentle on your hair.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;d known that a sulfate free shampoo felt like this, I&#x27;d have tried one much sooner.</li>
            <li> and I did get my moneys worth.</li>
            <li> my hair is softer and cleaner-feeling than it has ever been in my entire life and my husband says it smells nice.</li>
            <li> After washing, rising with water and Apple Cider Vinegar and blowdrying, my hair felt amazingly soft and it looked shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the lather (didn&#x27;t expect it to) and love the way my gray hair feels and behaves.</li>
            <li> And there&#x27;s just something fun about sudsing up by wiping a bar of shampoo soap all over your head.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something natural since I had been reading about so many women doing the &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; experiment.  </li>
            <li> Bar soap is always a lot of fun to use.</li>
            <li> fit the bill pretty much to a T!</li>
            <li> I was looking to a good natural alternative to shampoo and this is way better than I could have expected.</li>
            <li> The ingredients read out as a bunch of different natural oils, has a pleasant mild smell.</li>
            <li> I like the lather this soap produced and it made my hair feel soft and very clean with just one wash.</li>
            <li> If I avoid highly processed foods because they aren&#x27;t good for me, why wouldn&#x27;t I apply the same logic for my shampoo?  </li>
            <li> Does leave ends feeling &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; but use organic Argan oil right after shampoo</li>
            <li> Takes some practice though, to not get scared how the hair feel right after shampooed.</li>
            <li> But after a week of using JR Ligget&#x27;s shampoo-it clears right up.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much lighter to pack than a bottle of shampoo and my hair was really clean.  </li>
            <li> It is gentle for my scalp, clean wash.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft, full of body, and smooth instead of frizzy after blow drying.</li>
            <li> It really does clean your hair without stripping out the oils.  </li>
            <li> but my hair felt so clean and much much softer afterwards.  </li>
            <li> It does not take much to get your hair clean.</li>
            <li> Most commercial shampoos bother my scalp but this is wonderfully mild while being strong enough to remove hair spray easily.  </li>
            <li> And it leaves my hair feeling soft and clean!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a space saver, cuts down on plastic bottles, lathers very well, smells good, and leaves my hair clean.  </li>
            <li> As before, I have been very pleased with the product, and the delivery was just as expected.</li>
            <li> pleased I finally found what works best for me as I do have sensitive skin (dermatitis) and no more itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s true, the first time you use it, it really does do something for your hair.  </li>
            <li> Yet it also is strong enough to make it clean.</li>
            <li> no conditioner needed, less tangles than the BS+ACV method, and it leaves my hair feeling and looking good for a couple of days.</li>
            <li> Its all natural, has a mild clean scent and it lasts forever.</li>
            <li> those people who get a build up from washing their hair with natural soaps in hard water, a couple of table spoons of apple cider vinegar in a generous glass (16 ozs) of hot water makes an excellent rinse.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t like it), regular bar soap (worked great when we had a water softener, but not so great in hard water), and bulk shampoo (which is still in plastic, but at least it&#x27;s in large containers, and we take it home in our own glass jars...</li>
            <li> Very gentle and no dertergents</li>
            <li> I recommend that if you switch to JR Liggett&#x27;s, you do it at a time that you will not have to go out very much</li>
            <li> you very much</li>
            <li> Regular shampoos always left my hair frizzy, fly away and very spongy right after washing.</li>
            <li> The texture was super soft, it melted easy without melting too much and it washed very well.</li>
            <li> Bar is excellent for travel (I keep it in an inexpensive soap box and let it air dry after every use - don&#x27;t leave it in the shower unless you want a sticky, gooey mess...</li>
            <li> still wash it every 2-3 days, but it definitely looks a lot better during that period.</li>
            <li> I wish I could find it locally, but I&#x27;m glad Amazon has</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t exactly comment as to how well this shampoo did for those two things.</li>
            <li> even if $6 seems a bit much for a 3.5 ounce bar, you must take in to consideration the fact that you don&#x27;t need to buy conditioner and that the bar lasts to between 6 months and a year!</li>
            <li> A month later the bar is still mostly there</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I finally decided to try it!</li>
            <li> Maybe a liquid formula of this same shampoo will better suit me.</li>
            <li> All soap is oil based, and changing from one type to another will make a difference the first couple of uses - then it stops working.  </li>
            <li> , I want to really recommend this product to the people that suffer from dandruff, give it a try!.</li>
            <li> Probably better for men/people with short hair.</li>
            <li> I have a feeling it may last many months.</li>
            <li> I love the product and it&#x27;s almost like a brand-new lifestyle after using bottled shampoos every day for years-which only damaged my hair.</li>
            <li> This not my first bar of the product, as I&#x27;ve had it from non-Amazonian sources before.  </li>
            <li> Some people may go through a transition period when first using this and may experience some waxy, oily buildup on the scalp.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> First time I tried a shampoo bar.</li>
            <li> If Liggett&#x27;s formula is changed, I&#x27;d be willing to try it again.</li>
            <li> I have contact dermatitis and have not been able to find a commercial shampoo that doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itch.</li>
            <li> I have long, very fine wavy/frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Recently converted my family to SLS free products and we are absolutely smitten with J.R. Liggett&#x27;s Original Shampoo.</li>
            <li> first used JR Liggett&#x27;s over 20 years ago on a long bicycle trip, where space and weight are very important.  </li>
            <li> I now use Lush solid shampoo ([...]) which is more pricey ($2.80-$6.30 / ounce) but still eco friendly and it works really well.</li>
            <li> but as for now, I&#x27;m okay with trying a few new ones. :)</li>
            <li> A balance between a natural body and sheen while still having a clean look and smell.</li>
            <li> Now my hair feels clean and is shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> The shampoo leaves your hair feeling squeaky clean but the rinse removes any waxiness from the shampoo and leaves your hair feeling soft.  </li>
            <li> I had been looking for a natural way to clean my hair and save money.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels soft, bouncy and clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once, so far I really liked it.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel clean, but not stripped of natural oils, which ends up making people with oily hair like me end up producing more oil in the long run.</li>
            <li> My hair is short but knots easily</li>
            <li> so make sure it can dry</li>
            <li> warm it up first, then pour on my hair, let it sit for a few minutes and rinse.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-I also noticed some sort of a build up after a week or so (weird, considering I live in the beautiful Pacific Northwest and our water is some of the softest in the country!)</li>
            <li> This bar dried it out nicely without making it too dry and made my hair curl more than it ever has before--</li>
            <li> I typically use a more natural shampoo for oily scalp (made by Lush)--I tried this hoping for a less-expensive and even more natural alternative.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and fine hair, and I was looking for a natural product that I could use as shampoo and as body wash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sounds like work, but it&#x27;s not really once you get a routine down, and it&#x27;s a great natural product, that I&#x27;m excited to take on an upcoming trip.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have known there were other types of this bar I would have gotten one for dry hair as this one isn&#x27;t great .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never going back to regular shampoo, this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> Made my hair very sticky feely.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it really isn&#x27;t working for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using it consistently for 2 weeks now (every 2-3 days, as I normally do).</li>
            <li> I have been using the shampoo bar twice a day for a whole month</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel very waxy and sticky.</li>
            <li> Works very well too.  </li>
            <li> I really like the whole idea of bar shampoo, but JR Liggett just wasn&#x27;t for me...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have an issue with body or volume</li>
            <li> It makes it so much easier to rinse out and evenly distribute the shampoo...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably because of how much hair I have, but still...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a picky person, but I do think that $5.09 was a reasonable price</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> really like this product.</li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> I store it in the wooden holder that is available.</li>
            <li> Just didnt work for me really...</li>
            <li> shampoo/conditioner, so i have to be particularly careful to make sure i rub it all the way in all over my scalp.</li>
            <li> do use a separate conditioner with this soap on most days (Organix Coconut Milk) as my hair does get tangled even though I wash it carefully.</li>
            <li> It smelled like cheap Irish Spring soap.</li>
            <li> Delivery fast, east and convenient.</li>
            <li> Does the job and lasts much longer than any bottle of poison I used to use</li>
            <li> My hair used to be voluminous and very wavy.</li>
            <li> After the adjustment period, it will keep your hair MUCH cleaner.</li>
            <li> Want my whole family to use it.</li>
            <li> , how much it lathered.  </li>
            <li> My hair is so much softer and shinier with this method than with chemically laden store bought shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like it</li>
            <li> I have very wavy hair, sometimes curly.</li>
            <li> I read so much about this shampoo</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, and therefore, oily hair.</li>
            <li> , I could easily brush it out while still wet with a natural bristle brush, and my hair just feels so clean.</li>
            <li> so much</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t quite ready to go that route</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m doing the whole &amp;#34;shampoo free&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Rub it into your hands or straight into your hair.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> My whole family loves it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Love how simple it is and how .clean and soft it leaves my hair</li>
            <li> Took about a week for my hair to adjust (no more &amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34; feel), and now I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched and tried so many shampoos and conditioners due to itchy scalp.  </li>
            <li> May now be able to shampoo every other day, extending the life.  </li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;m happy to report that this product DOES work with hard water and it works well in general.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Enters this simple shampoo bar with few ingredients, how simple and effective this shampoo is!!</li>
            <li> The great thing is that you don&#x27;t need to wash your hair every single day because the shampoo maintains your natural shine and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy the next day like so many high end (read waste of money) shampoos.</li>
            <li> and you can easily clean your hair with it in the same way.</li>
            <li> It was smaller than I thought it would be, but I like how it leave my hair feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Without all the extra chemicals that bottled shampoos use, my hair comes out shiny and clean and manageable every time I use it.</li>
            <li> But possibly my skin is still adjusting to clean life without SLS causing this?  </li>
            <li> when I woke up and saw my hair after trying this, I couldn&#x27;t believe how incredibly wavy it was (even a few little curls), and so much body...</li>
            <li> I have fairly normal straight hair, perhaps a bit oily.</li>
            <li> I wash twice a week, and in between time my hair stays soft and pretty, and I don&#x27;t need to condition.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it my hair was as soft as it&#x27;s ever been.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have very naturally oil hair, my hair is typically wavy and dry, so for me it is great.</li>
            <li> , we&#x27;ve tried a few different formulas of the jr liggets shampoo bars, and the original was our favorite.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommended for travel (particularly backpacking).</li>
            <li> /&gt;- lasts a decent amount of time</li>
            <li> Did not need conditioner as it left hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a classic.</li>
            <li> The wrapper says that it lasts as long as a 24 ounce bottle of shampoo would last, but I&#x27;m not quite sure of that - it depends on how much you lather up each time.  </li>
            <li> Smells nice, lathers beautifully, long lasting, leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Over the last few years I&#x27;ve been getting more interested in, and purchasing personal care products and cleaners that are less toxic to the environment and made with fewer and simpler ingredients (ones I can read and understand :P).  </li>
            <li> Much better than conventional shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shampoo bar.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shampoo bar.</li>
            <li> I like that your hair does feel extremely clean after you use it, but I do not like how long it takes to lather.</li>
            <li> is that my hair can be a little static afterward</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair and scalp fresh and squeaky clean without all the harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> FYI, my hair got super dry and was really static-y after using. :</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for anyone wanting a truly natural, affordable hair washing solution that really works.</li>
            <li> Does clean your hair well and feels light and natural with this product, like the fact it has very few chemicals in this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I figured that the natural ingredients would help soothe my skin, but nothing really happened...</li>
            <li> My hair is thoroughly clean, and it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out.</li>
            <li> It looks shinier and is softer, and it does not seem to get naturally oily as fast as it does using bottled shampoos from the store.  </li>
            <li> I also really like that this is made with all natural ingredients, and that it&#x27;s eco-friendly.  </li>
            <li> You can feel that your hair is clean but it doesn&#x27;t feel dry.</li>
            <li> So much for going natural..</li>
            <li> My hair gets oily pretty fast, so I shampoo daily.</li>
            <li> I pretty much have no choice but to continue to use my regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li> As soon as I discontinued using the Liggett&#x27;s shampoo bar, my scalp returned to normal.  </li>
            <li> and it is a bit of a different process, but the results are totally worth it</li>
            <li> Lather and rinse as normal.</li>
            <li> Be sure to store it somewhere (or on something) that won&#x27;t allow water to be trapped under the bar</li>
            <li> Some shampoos seemed OK, but after using a few times my scalp was irritated.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know what caused it, and I&#x27;m disappointed that I didn&#x27;t have a good experience with this product like many others have.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and my scalp NEVER itches any more.</li>
            <li> Obviously, this shampoo bar works for some people since it has recieved some very positive reviews.</li>
            <li> It smells great, and I am anxious to try the peppermint and other flavored kinds.</li>
            <li> Gets my facial stubble nice and clean before shaving without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> It definitely feels like this bar totally strips your hair of all moisture in the shower (it&#x27;ll feel super squeaky and waxy-like), but it certainly isn&#x27;t the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My naturally straight Asian hair became very wavy after using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> After rinsing off, wasn&#x27;t sure if needed conditioner, but once I dried my hair, it was so soft and</li>
            <li> Hair feels super dry and the scent wasn&#x27;t listed</li>
            <li> Love this little bar!</li>
            <li> I like this soap very much and would use it when I need extra refreshment and bounce!</li>
            <li> I recommend that when you use it, you put it in your hair right when you get it wet, and leave it in until the very end of your shower (after you&#x27;ve soaped your body, shaved your legs,</li>
            <li> My long hair was easily managed without all the extra conditioners, mousse and sprays.</li>
            <li> The wrapper is recyclable, and there&#x27;s no waste once you&#x27;ve used the bar up!  </li>
            <li> After reading some comments and forums, I thought that increased shedding is normal while switching from liquid shampoo (natural, no sulfates, parabens, silicones,...) to a bar shampoo.</li>
            <li> The acidic vinegar will smooth them down again.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t use any conditioner, this leaves your hair soft but I&#x27;ve also been able to style with very little product.  </li>
            <li> decided to try it again in my new home that has soft water.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not high maintenance when it comes to my hair (thick-ish &amp; wavy), since it&#x27;s always up in a bun due to work, but I still want it to be looking great as I get older and not full of chemicals/preservatives, fillers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use (just rub it along your hair a few times and then work it in -</li>
            <li> Pleasant, faint smell of roses, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I tried other bar shampoos (too drying), Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Baby Mild (too harsh for hair), LUSH soaps (full of chemicals and too much scent), and even tried going without shampoo (no &#x27;poo - didn&#x27;t work for me).</li>
            <li> I can go 2 days with no washing, which I love due to how long it is.</li>
            <li> This shampoo made my hair feel a little funny at first</li>
            <li> I also now wash my hair every other day, because it doesn&#x27;t get oily so quickly anymore.  </li>
            <li> No excessive build-up so far, no strong odors (I prefer unscented body products, though I believe there are scented options available if that&#x27;s your thing).&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it left my hair feeling gross and hard to manage; this didn&#x27;t get better over time either, it always felt pretty much exactly the same.</li>
            <li> though I take the shampoo out of the shower to air try everyday, it is a huge blob of jelly.</li>
            <li> I have went back to using my old \\&quot;natural\\&quot; liquid shampoo and my hair feels much cleaner with no \\&quot;build-up\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> However, after using this shampoo daily at home for about 2 months, I developed intense itching in my scalp.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s easily fixed.</li>
            <li> All natural, use for hair and body.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural, no bottles and it won&#x27;t hurt the environment.</li>
            <li> It felt as if I couldn&#x27;t wash it out completely.</li>
            <li> If I ever move somewhere where the water is really soft, I will try to use this product again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I bought this shampoo for $5.09 (including tax) at a local whole foods store...</li>
            <li> As it get&#x27;s near the end of its use</li>
            <li> i have sensitive skin fron head to toe and have always had dandruff which required me to wash and scrub my scalp every day.</li>
            <li> This overproduction makes you need to wash your hair constantly to keep the oil at a reasonable level.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t need a conditioner to make it soft.</li>
            <li> However, I found that it left a film in my hair, even after I lathered up twice and rinsed VERY well.</li>
            <li> This shampoo lasts about three to five months if two people are using it nearly every day.</li>
            <li> and the third - oh for the luv of - not so much.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to switch to an all natural shampoo without sulfates so I can stop stripping my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not every day you find natural products for an affordable price.</li>
            <li> For those who have never used natural shampoo/conditioner it does take a period of time for your hair to adjust-</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, and I need shampoos that won&#x27;t take its natural oils out and make it frizzy.</li>
            <li> I was amazed when I use the bar directly on my scalp, swiping a couple times</li>
            <li> The natural oils in the scalp was adjusting to just using this bar</li>
            <li> So far no oily build up like what would occur with shampoo.</li>
            <li> Plus, the cheapest price I&#x27;ve found so far has been on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This shampoo bar makes my hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li> The paper packaging feels old school to me.  </li>
            <li> My hair is soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> But about week #4 my hair seemed to adjust and is soft and shiny now.  </li>
            <li> i had brittle, burnt hair and using this soap for 2 months made it baby soft..</li>
            <li> If you find it dries your hair out too much, try spritzing your hair moderately thoroughly with a mixture of 75% vinegar and 25% water after you use it.</li>
            <li> If you wash this out completely, you won&#x27;t smell, and it will help retain your hair&#x27;s natural pH.</li>
            <li> so I chose to go with a natural shampoo.  </li>
            <li> My hair is easier to control (I have naturally curly hair)</li>
            <li> Just rub the bar on directly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Liggetts - apply directly to head.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have with this product, which does not speak to its quality, is that I go through a bar much faster than the manufacturer claims.</li>
            <li> Some soaps don&#x27;t list that they contain it, because it dissipates during the soapmaking process, but it is an ingredient even in natural soaps.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> During that time, my hair was somewhat thicker, but it was also constantly filled with static, and just seemed really dry (which is weird, because I normally have oily hair).  </li>
            <li> Anyway, it seems so odd at first to use a bar of soap on your hair, but this really works well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a liquid, so you can take it anywhere, and it adds less weight to your luggage than a full bottle of liquid gel</li>
            <li> Even the most gentle of regular bottle shampoos turn my head into an oil slick after only a day, so this stuff is a lifesaver to my scalp.</li>
            <li> after I first washed, my hair felt a little odd, but I turned out beautiful after I air dried and flat ironed.</li>
            <li> I am on my first 3.5 ounce bar, which is smaller than the standard bath soap bar a 4 ounces.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Only three stars for this since it is so small for the price and claims to be more than what it is - a standard bar of soap.</li>
            <li> After rinsing it off, my hair is so squeaky clean that I only need to wash it every other day (</li>
            <li> I have waist length fine, straight hair and my only complaint</li>
            <li> BTW, I have long waist-length straight hair.</li>
            <li> but it really lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> My normally oily hair only needs to be washed 2 times per week, and I don&#x27;t even have to use conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo that works for me--  and leaves my hair feeling soft and thick and healthy.</li>
            <li> It feels fluffy and full after shampooing.  </li>
            <li> It takes very little to get lots of lather and the scent is a wholesome clean natural scent.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo bar is gentle enough to use daily, although you will probably find you don&#x27;t need to.</li>
            <li> A few quick passes through your hair is all you need.</li>
            <li> Am just starting my second bar, having welded the first bar to the second.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re little, and if you don&#x27;t take good care of them (storing them in a dry metal box, for example), they vanish in few days.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical on how easy this would be to apply to my hair</li>
            <li> The bar is small (smaller than I expected), but lasts a good long while (equals a 24 oz.</li>
            <li> It is a bar of plain old soap (oils, lye, and water), the kind you can make in your kitchen with a little knowledge and some standard chemical safety gear.</li>
            <li> It left my scalp dry but the hair near it was very waxy and felt greasy..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m older and have grey hair and this seems to help prevent my hair from being too &amp;#34;fly-away&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Lots of fluffy lather; rinses cleanly unless the water is super hard; hair feels alarmingly stiff while wet, but no tangles; and then -- it dries and hair looks better than it has in years.</li>
            <li> scalp gets oily very easily, however, hence the use of expensive Lush shampoo--if your don&#x27;t have &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; hair then maybe it&#x27;ll work for you.</li>
            <li> The fact of the matter is that SLS was pretty much created to work well with hard water--and it does.  </li>
            <li> For starters, it does not contain the harsh detergent Sodium Laurel Sulfate, which most conventional shampoos have.</li>
            <li> The small size fits Into my toilet kit easily.</li>
            <li> as an adult, I would only use this once in while</li>
            <li> The immediate difference I noticed with my kiddos hair was the natural shine, manageability, and bounce had sprung back.</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon this, and even though I&#x27;d seen it in my local natural food store, hadn&#x27;t tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using my regular shampoo 2x, the shedding was back to normal levels and didn&#x27;t come back.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After using baking soda, my hair would feel kind of waxy and weird..</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last very long, made hair feel weird, gets all mushy, but it&#x27;s cool because it&#x27;s old school, I wouldn&#x27;t get it again though, regular shampoo is just fine</li>
            <li> The smell was odd to me at first</li>
            <li> At first it seems like their is slightly sticky oil in your hair, but it goes away after a minute or so.</li>
            <li> If this sounds too high maintenance, keep in mind that it should only take a week to get used to the soap, and after that you can ditch the vinegar or only use it occasionally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to go the more natural route with my beauty products, so I decided to try this bar shampoo since it&#x27;s free of all the crap that commercial products have in them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other shampoo bars, and I really like this one.  </li>
            <li> Simple, long lasting, and gentle on my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to alternate with regular liquid shampoo to bring it back looking normal.  </li>
            <li> I have semi long thick hair and with most shampoos I had to wash every day or my hair would be a big grease ball, not so with this.</li>
            <li> My main complaint is the price and the fact that is is used up quickly, Note keep it out of shower and dry or it will dissolve faster.</li>
            <li> No rashes, no dry itchy skin,</li>
            <li> It does not dry my hair out and it makes my hair feel softer after I wash it.</li>
            <li> I have long natural silky shiny straight black hair and this shampoo bar disappointed me greatly.  </li>
            <li> Of course, my hair took about a week to get used to the sudden lack of SLS in my shampoo - which caused it to be very, very greasy for a few days to a week.</li>
            <li> I now wash my hair every three days (I just rinse with water on the off days) and it is much smoother, shinier and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> After you dry your hair you can feel and see that it retains moisture and has what feels like natural oils in your hair.</li>
            <li> i left the bar in a container (apparently) with water in it, and the bar literally dissolved entirely.</li>
            <li> I realized that you really need to rub the bar down your hair to get enough on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s SO worth it because it  makes my hair really, really soft and thick, and my curls look nicer than when I used SLS based shampoos!  </li>
            <li> I really like it and think the bar of shampoo will last for a long time as it only takes one little swipe across the back of my head to get all the lather necessary to wash my hair.  </li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo, I usually just use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s for both body and hair which I also love but Dr. Bronner&#x27;s is a little hard on your hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;i have more-or-less straight, thick, long dirty blonde hair and this keeps it soft and quite nice if i shampoo</li>
            <li> It comes wrapped only in a small piece of paper, rather than a large plastic bottle.</li>
            <li> It made my hair extremely dry and it felt like it had left a lot of residue on my hair inspite of me washing it off multiple times.</li>
            <li> I had previously tried every home made/truly natural option for washing my hair, and these are the only things that work.</li>
            <li> so I take an extra minute or so scrub it out in the shower by rubbing it between my hands, then when I get out I take an extra minute to rub it dry with a towel.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels better and softer, I hardly need to use conditioner-and I have extremely thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Did not realize it would be so small for so much money.  </li>
            <li> However, one day I realized, that I lost so much hair, that my hair is visibly thinner and that the excessive shedding is not going away, so I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> It lathers well, and seems like it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> long will the bar last?</li>
            <li> it made my hair flat and without any shine.  </li>
            <li> and I cannot comment on how long it lasts as I have only had it a month,</li>
            <li> but it does not last long.</li>
            <li> I tried a couple of other shampoos that left my hair feeling heavy with too much product.  </li>
            <li> It become very flat.  </li>
            <li> Also, now my hair gets far less greasy.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny, knowing its natural with no preservatives or fake scents.</li>
            <li> Not only did my hair lost its shine after using this shampoo bar, my hair felt so dry while rinsing (felt like i had glue on my hair).  </li>
            <li> I loved the fact that it is made by natural ingredients, but I hated the smell.</li>
            <li> have also noticed that I am not shedding a single hair in the shower for several days in a row.</li>
            <li> It is smaller than I expected, but a bar will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have long (nearly waist length) hair and was considering chopping it off since I MUST shampoo my hair daily, and it was a dry mess.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though I should mention, my hair, the first week (2-3 shampoos), did take adjusting and seemed a little stringy (a little oily).  </li>
            <li> I like the idea of this product, but it just seems to build up too much in my hair with our hard water.  </li>
            <li> I can use it every day / every other day with no need for conditioner and no dry scalp / dandruff.</li>
            <li> I only need to wash my hair every third day now instead of every day like I had to with conventional methods.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid of the word soap, it is more like a shampoo.</li>
            <li> It lasted a long time.  </li>
            <li> I work in a natural foods store, where I ignored this humble bar for years.</li>
            <li> 3.5 oz turned out to be a smaller bar than I expected but it lasts quite a while.  </li>
            <li> My hair is wavy, long and medium thickness.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe that it lasts as long as it states though?</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time</li>
            <li> I have thick, dry, curly hair, and it is working very well for me.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use any other shampoo after I tried these ones several years ago.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time too!</li>
            <li> Another product I bought following suggestions from other pilgrims that did the Camino de Santiago.</li>
            <li> Instead of having dry, damaged hair it&#x27;s nourished and silky.</li>
            <li> If you have dry, brittle hair as a result of thyroid problems, you will find that  this shampoo can work wonders for you.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair and gives it some body.  </li>
            <li> So, use it for what it was designed to do, as a shampoo, then dry and store.</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling dry, it doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling like it is brittle.  </li>
            <li> I still use regular shampoo one every week or two (or after I&#x27;ve gotten it super dirty), but that&#x27;s just personal preference.</li>
            <li> do take a few extra steps in order to further condition my hair:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bell</li>
            <li> , so I had to shampoo every single damn day.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave hair a tangled mess or anything, but I still found it helpful to comb my hair before washing it - especially when my hair was still long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also had trouble with hair loss due to hypothyroid and wanted to find natural methods to keep my scalp</li>
            <li> Feels just like and works like shampoo/soap except my hair feels just a tiny bit softer and less dry.</li>
            <li> It does wash out differently than a typical shampoo, and</li>
            <li> After rinsing off it has different feel than typical shampoos.</li>
            <li> However, before purchasing you should know that if you have super hard water, it may be hard for you to use this soap.</li>
            <li> I have thick, dark hair that gets oily fast.</li>
            <li> (you will come back to a puddle of soapy mess if if fills with water by an unsuspecting family member.)  </li>
            <li> I have thick, dark hair prone to being oily, and have had issues with a flaky, dry scalp (particularly around winter).</li>
            <li> I have very hard well water but have a water softener, but maybe the softener doesn&#x27;t work very well?  </li>
            <li> Little smaller than I thought, bit works well as advertised.</li>
            <li> Have only tried once, a little lather, not much</li>
            <li> I will definitely repurchase, but not for a while because I think this little bar has a few months of use left.</li>
            <li> Also, unlike other shampoos it does not leave your hair feeling dry and rough.</li>
            <li> This shampoo does not have SLS in it, and I can go quite a while without washing it - usually my skin feels yucky long before my hair starts to feel gross in any way.  </li>
            <li> It feels waxy and funky while still wet but that feeling leaves as my hair dries.</li>
            <li> This is olive oil based shampoo with minimal amount of chemicals.</li>
            <li> The smell was not intense unlike what I had thought it might be.</li>
            <li> but when it dissolved i somewhat arbitrarily changed to this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought a different bottle shampoo a month ago and it completely, utterly dried my hair out.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work like I thought it would, but that&#x27;s because it took me a couple of tries to figure out the method of the madness.</li>
            <li> A lot of reviews and even in the product descriptions I&#x27;ve read talk about this step like it&#x27;s optional, but not rinsing with vinegar afterward will leave your hair feeling rough and tangled.</li>
            <li> i have absolutely no complaints.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and soft,  not too oily, and doesn&#x27;t require washing every day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-The reason why I wanted bought this shampoo in the first place is because I have very sensitive skin and, as of recently, a bad case of contact dermatitis.</li>
            <li> Did not work well for my slightly oily long hair.</li>
            <li> I am a woman who loves fashion and was looking for a plastic-free shampoo that wouldn&#x27;t make my hair look like it was greasy, dry or weighed down.</li>
            <li> I bought this product due to the minimal ingredients and packaging.  </li>
            <li> In addition, it may take a while for your hair to get used to something that doesn&#x27;t have sodium laureth/lauryl  sulfate--the detergent (yes, detergent) that is in most conventional shampoos, which are incidentally really bad for your hair.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every other day and one of these bars lasts for around 2 months.</li>
            <li> I also saw probably 3 other brands of bar shampoo that I&#x27;m now going to try (I had no idea there was a market for this</li>
            <li> I have water softener and it lathers up extremely well.</li>
            <li> It lasts longer than I would expect a small bar of soap to last.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for about a week, but I&#x27;ve seen small improvements.</li>
            <li> ; to some other purchase.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Few drops of essential oils (no more than 3-4 drops of oils like Lavandin, Frankincense, Rosemary, Helichrysum, Palo Santo, Spikenard, or Patchouli)&lt;br /&gt;Fill</li>
            <li> I think that is due to the hair follicles having a waxy buildup and pores</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use conditioner, just a little argan oil after I blow dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> i like the fact that there are very few ingredients which i can actually pronounce in the product.</li>
            <li> -Could come in a bigger size for those not traveling  -Weird &#x27;gelification&#x27; process near the products end-life.</li>
            <li> Sometimes my hair feels dry, but I fix it with a few drops of conditioner.</li>
            <li> Just keep it somewhere to dry everyday</li>
            <li> I comb it through my hair to distribute it evenly, but it&#x27;s always hard to tell if I&#x27;ve used enough due to its lack of lather.  </li>
            <li> My hair is long, medium thick, dry &amp; color-treated.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Iv been off of any conventional shampoos for about 6 months</li>
            <li> After reading mixed reviews about the product itself and use with hard water, I knew if I were going to try it</li>
            <li> It does well for my dark curls, removes excess oil (contrary to label?)</li>
            <li> I have very thick, dry hair almost down to my waist that I wash daily.</li>
            <li> If I go through the day without showering I could still wear my hair down and go out without thinking about it.</li>
            <li> One note: I stopped using conditioner because it doesn&#x27;t seem to be needed with this shampoo and weighed my hair down a lot.</li>
            <li> I just rub the bar on my head and down the rest of my hair, and then lather up, massage into my scalp, and rinse out.</li>
            <li> I would always shed a half dozen strands of hair after rinsing the shampoo &amp; conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Reduced my hair dropping by about half.</li>
            <li> and I am about half way thru the bar.  </li>
            <li> This product seriously didn&#x27;t work well at all back then.  </li>
            <li> This happened after using it for over a month and a half.    </li>
            <li> (so, one less plastic bottle).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since it is now the fall of the year here and slightly cooler</li>
            <li> Leaves hair slightly conditioned.</li>
            <li> and I use much less hair styling product.  </li>
            <li> I usually wash my hair at night before going to sleep and just go to bed with it wet.</li>
            <li> Usually I wake up with wavy hair but no real body...</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I am a Caucasian with extremely thick, long hair.</li>
            <li> have long, thick, wavy hair</li>
            <li> The little bar was a surprise</li>
            <li> My hair is a little bit dryer with this soap shampoo as I&#x27;ve also not found a usable conditioner either.</li>
            <li> Sadly, this shampoo left my hair DRY &amp; TANGLED, yet my scalp OILY.</li>
            <li> Before I moved to my current home, I had very hard water.  </li>
            <li> I stumbled on this not long ago after several years of avoiding SLS shampoos and now wanting to avoid bottles and the expensive non SLS products, which are also hard to find.</li>
            <li> I would also lose a few strands through the day.</li>
            <li> I was there for 2 1/2 weeks and washed my hair everyday.  </li>
            <li> I believe I can probably still pack Liggett&#x27;s in my travel kit and use it for a few days while traveling.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy this again - for my hair it leaves a heavy oily feeling</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s harder (at least in my experience) to work the lather through hair than is the case with &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> it has no sulfates, and isn&#x27;t harsh on your hair.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re having trouble getting out the excess shampoo, you can use an apple cider vinegar/water mix.</li>
            <li> I also had trouble with my neckline breaking out</li>
            <li> Could never do that before with any shampoo without getting an itchy scalp, with greasy feeling limp hair.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair everyday</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo a few months ago.</li>
            <li> I would have to commit to a few weeks before I gave up.  </li>
            <li> I used to wash my hair everyday (I know,</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any of these issues, or any trouble learning how to use this at all.</li>
            <li> my hair dried after using this shampoo bar-</li>
            <li> It came in a plain paper wrapper.</li>
            <li> only complaint about this shampoo is that it is not good for washing out hair grease (coconut oil/shea butter mix).</li>
            <li> The bar is small but would last for approximately 2-3 weeks if used for body and hair for one person.</li>
            <li> Over the past few years, something happened to it.</li>
            <li> (I have very thick hair that used to take forever to air dry.</li>
            <li> I style with a very small amount of gel diluted with water, scrunch my slightly damp shoulder length hair and go.</li>
            <li> My hair would look like a grease slick if I didn&#x27;t wash it</li>
            <li> I am anxious to try the peppermint one next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I understand that they vary in size because every piece is cut by hand, but my soap felt really small.</li>
            <li> It is extremely small, about 2 x 2.5 x 1 inches.</li>
            <li> I usually buy an online brand that comes in a 6 oz bar (about 2.5 x 4 x 2 inches), for about 5 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> (I keep it in a small tupperware)</li>
            <li> I know the bar looks small</li>
            <li> The tangles were unbelievable.</li>
            <li> My hair wasn&#x27;t itchy as it usually is.</li>
            <li> Not sure why,</li>
            <li> so I rinsed with some baking soda dissolved in water to take out the gummy feeling soap leaves, then did my usual apple cider vin rinse.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not a pleasant rose but horribly nauseating .</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s definitely less expensive than other options.</li>
            <li> While I have been wanting to try bar shampoo for a long time, I was skeptical about this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Something that is very annoying is how much longer my hair takes to dry when using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> The first week was not too bad, but the second and third weeks of use were awful, my hair was stringy, and sticky.  </li>
            <li> Let me preface this by saying that this does not work with hard water.  </li>
            <li> we have somewhat hard water</li>
            <li> Maybe because of our hard water</li>
            <li> It seems hard to believe that this product works that well and lasts so long-but it does.</li>
            <li> We have hard water</li>
            <li> Try to give this product at least a week to get used to.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t blame all the failure on just the soap.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing about it is that it hurts a lot if you get it in your eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not surprisingly it conditions</li>
            <li> Y husband and both felt our hair looked and felt heavy and weird.  </li>
            <li> , if water is trapped under it the bottom side will turn to useless goo.  </li>
            <li> So I used medicated shampoos for the past 13 years that damaged my hair, smelled bad, and only temporarily relieved my symptoms,not to mention,they were expensive also.&lt;br</li>
            <li> learned that the hard way!).</li>
            <li> Or at least mine does!</li>
            <li> I do have very hard water and noticed that to get it to lather</li>
            <li> The residue is also impossible to get off, I tried to wash it off using other shampoos</li>
            <li> Leaves a somewhat waxy residue behind</li>
            <li> She has been cutting my hair, every 5-6 weeks, for the past 8 years.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s bad), and I stopped using conditioner at least 4 years ago.</li>
            <li> It left a horrible film on my hair.</li>
            <li> it started to leave some sort of weird \\&quot;build-up\\&quot; on my hair.</li>
            <li> (I found it weird that it took a couple of weeks of using it about before I noticed a problem.)  </li>
            <li> it turns into a weird, see-through, viscous gel.</li>
            <li> I was shedding like never before, and I tell you, that was scary.</li>
            <li> Also, the company Nutriticity, accidentally sent 1 wrong bar which they replaced immediately.</li>
            <li> (And I never would have discovered this if I hadn&#x27;t been desperate to find something to get my daughter out of a no-poo phase.)</li>
            <li> i was afraid this shampoo would leave my hair greasy-looking</li>
            <li> and it drove me crazy, which is another reason.  </li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> I HATE conditioner...</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s annoying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been traveling a lot and hate using \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; soaps at hotels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hated it.</li>
            <li> it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Wanted to like it - would have been great for travel. However made my hair too &amp;#34;fly-away&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, produces a lush lather, is healthy for the hair.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this shampoo bar. It feels waxy and funky while still wet but that feeling leaves as my hair dries. I have waist length fine, straight hair and my only complaint is that my hair can be a little static afterward but that&#x27;s easily fixed. This shampoo bar is gentle enough to use daily, although you will probably find you don&#x27;t need to. I only need to wash my hair every third day now instead of every day like I had to with conventional methods.  I have not had to use conditioner or a vinegar rinse at all with this shampoo bar, and my hair has more body than ever and seems to be truer in color. I highly recommend this shampoo bar. Just don&#x27;t ever get it in your eyes!!!</li>
            <li> All natural, use for hair and body. We love this soap!</li>
            <li> I love this product, it&#x27;s so great not to strip my hair of all its natural oils every time I wash it. I have thick, dark hair prone to being oily, and have had issues with a flaky, dry scalp (particularly around winter). My hair would look like a grease slick if I didn&#x27;t wash it every two days.&lt;br /&gt;I still wash it every 2-3 days, but it definitely looks a lot better during that period. I find I still have to use a bit of conditioner on my tips, but that&#x27;ll probably change as my hair starts producing its own oils normally again. It definitely feels like this bar totally strips your hair of all moisture in the shower (it&#x27;ll feel super squeaky and waxy-like), but it certainly isn&#x27;t the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product was shipped out quickly.</li>
            <li> I have been going &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; for a week now and I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the results (I know it probably takes longer than that for my hair/scalp to adjust).  So I happened upon this product, ordered it and after 2 uses, I am in love with it.  I didn&#x27;t expect it to later at all, but it does.  It has a light very pleasant scent and leaves my hair in excellent condition.  Upon first use, of course, no poo for a week, but while rinsing this from my hair, it immediately felt squeaky clean!  Much better than &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; in my opinion.  I am anxious to try the peppermint one next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone trying to quit bottle shampoo.  It&#x27;s all natural, no bottles and it won&#x27;t hurt the environment.</li>
            <li> Made my hair very sticky feely. It felt as if I couldn&#x27;t wash it out completely. I was so disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;We have well water, so I don&#x27;t blame all the failure on just the soap. And I did try this for about a month. I couldn&#x27;t take it any longer than that though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve washed my hair with this shampoo bar twice and I&#x27;m already a big fan. I have fairly normal straight hair, perhaps a bit oily. My hair gets nice and clean but there is still a slight amount of my hair&#x27;s oils which is wonderful, because I think a lot of us strive for this. A balance between a natural body and sheen while still having a clean look and smell. The ingredients read out as a bunch of different natural oils, has a pleasant mild smell. Gets my facial stubble nice and clean before shaving without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> I typically use a more natural shampoo for oily scalp (made by Lush)--I tried this hoping for a less-expensive and even more natural alternative. Unfortunately it really isn&#x27;t working for me. I&#x27;ve tried using it consistently for 2 weeks now (every 2-3 days, as I normally do). It has given me dandruff/build-up on my scalp and my hair is greasy by the morning of day 2. I tried a vinegar rinse but it didn&#x27;t help. Maybe if I washed every day this would work, but I haven&#x27;t in years with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My scalp gets oily very easily, however, hence the use of expensive Lush shampoo--if your don&#x27;t have &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; hair then maybe it&#x27;ll work for you. The scent is light--pleasant and doesn&#x27;t linger. It lathers well, and seems like it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I used to use whatever store bought shampoo and conditioner.  Over the years, I have noticed my hair getting thinner.  I would always shed a half dozen strands of hair after rinsing the shampoo &amp; conditioner.  I would also lose a few strands through the day. So, I changed to Avalon Organics Biotin shampoo and condition.  Reduced my hair dropping by about half. Worked well for a year and it was a bit pricey for both shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then someone mentioned shampoo bars.  I did a bit of research and found that some shampoo bars have only 4-5 ingredients. If I avoid highly processed foods because they aren&#x27;t good for me, why wouldn&#x27;t I apply the same logic for my shampoo?  So I bought a bar of JR Liggetts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;net net.  My stylist can&#x27;t believe that I haven&#x27;t used conditioner in a month! She has been cutting my hair, every 5-6 weeks, for the past 8 years. She says that my hair is much softer and shinier that before.  :)&lt;br /&gt;I have also noticed that I am not shedding a single hair in the shower for several days in a row. My hair looks thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;how long will the bar last? I am on my first 3.5 ounce bar, which is smaller than the standard bath soap bar a 4 ounces. I have been using the shampoo bar twice a day for a whole month and I am about half way thru the bar.  I have one of those plastic soap savers.  so probably will last me shampoo-ing my ~100 times.</li>
            <li> I read some horror stories about switching to bar soap, but I haven&#x27;t experienced any problems after a month of every-other-day use. I follow with a diluted apple cider rinse, and my hair feels great. This is an excellent change to make from bottled shampoos if you&#x27;re trying to waste less plastic, fossil fuels (this is much lighter to ship), and be good to your skin. I wish I could find it locally, but I&#x27;m glad Amazon has it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record: I have mid-back length, very fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li> Hated it. It left a horrible film on my hair.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this.  There are so many positive things about it: all natural, no plastic packaging, great for travel, etc., etc. It worked fine for a couple of weeks and then, like others have mentioned:  it started to leave some sort of weird \\&quot;build-up\\&quot; on my hair. I didn&#x27;t feel clean after using it anymore. The hair felt \\&quot;coated\\&quot; with something after it dried even though I had rinsed it very well. (I found it weird that it took a couple of weeks of using it about before I noticed a problem.)  I have very hard well water but have a water softener, but maybe the softener doesn&#x27;t work very well?  I SO wanted to love this. I have went back to using my old \\&quot;natural\\&quot; liquid shampoo and my hair feels much cleaner with no \\&quot;build-up\\&quot;.  I will use the rest of the bar as a body wash.  If I ever move somewhere where the water is really soft, I will try to use this product again.</li>
            <li> Before I moved to my current home, I had very hard water.  This product seriously didn&#x27;t work well at all back then.  It felt like it just stuck to my hair - leaving a gummy residue that wouldn&#x27;t rinse out.  I was seriously bummed out about it, but I luckily didn&#x27;t toss it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try it again in my new home that has soft water.  When used with soft water - it is wonderful.  It cleans and leaves my hair softer than it&#x27;s ever been with commercial shampoos and conditioners.  I have hair that is fine and somewhat curly.  It doesn&#x27;t leave hair a tangled mess or anything, but I still found it helpful to comb my hair before washing it - especially when my hair was still long.  I wash my hair every other day and one of these bars lasts for around 2 months.</li>
            <li> Obviously, this shampoo bar works for some people since it has recieved some very positive reviews. It made my hair extremely dry and it felt like it had left a lot of residue on my hair inspite of me washing it off multiple times. It made my hair feel very waxy and sticky. Not for me!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is really cool.  Works very well too.  Sometimes, you have to take a minute for it to really lather, but when it does, it is really fabulous.  Why had I never seen something like this before?  I like.</li>
            <li> I really like the whole idea of bar shampoo, but JR Liggett just wasn&#x27;t for me...which is why I&#x27;m now trying out another brand. Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The reason why I wanted bought this shampoo in the first place is because I have very sensitive skin and, as of recently, a bad case of contact dermatitis. I figured that the natural ingredients would help soothe my skin, but nothing really happened...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I bought this shampoo for $5.09 (including tax) at a local whole foods store...so it may be wise to shop around before buying from Amazon. I also saw probably 3 other brands of bar shampoo that I&#x27;m now going to try (I had no idea there was a market for this stuff!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I am a Caucasian with extremely thick, long hair. I don&#x27;t really have an issue with body or volume so I can&#x27;t exactly comment as to how well this shampoo did for those two things. My hair gets oily pretty fast, so I shampoo daily. I HATE conditioner...so I seldom use it. Which is why I I considered buying this shampoo, as it says most people don&#x27;t need conditioner after using it and it helps with static in hair...FYI, my hair got super dry and was really static-y after using. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I also noticed some sort of a build up after a week or so (weird, considering I live in the beautiful Pacific Northwest and our water is some of the softest in the country!) which is why I started bringing a comb in the shower with me. It makes it so much easier to rinse out and evenly distribute the shampoo...and it make brushing my hair afterwards a more pleasurable task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Something that is very annoying is how much longer my hair takes to dry when using this shampoo. I can have a towel wrapped around my head for 30 minutes and then as soon as I take it off, my shirt will be drenched..so I find myself towel drying my hair and then blow drying it every day, because if I leave it be it will take hours to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Even though I take the shampoo out of the shower to air try everyday, it is a huge blob of jelly. -_- I&#x27;ve only used it probably for 3 1/2 weeks also...It&#x27;s probably because of how much hair I have, but still...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take all of my complaints with a grain of salt. I&#x27;m a picky person, but I do think that $5.09 was a reasonable price and I did get my moneys worth. I&#x27;m just going to be trying out some different brands now.&lt;br /&gt;Who knows, I may come back to JR Liggett&#x27;s in the future...but as for now, I&#x27;m okay with trying a few new ones. :)</li>
            <li> Amazing product my hair is clean!! safe use in colored hair, I love it</li>
            <li> as an adult, I would only use this once in while but my husband loved it.  It also works great for kids hair too.  Very gentle and no dertergents and I would probably buy it again.</li>
            <li> I only have two complaints about this soap:    1. As it get&#x27;s near the end of its use it turns into a weird, see-through, viscous gel. This happened after using it for over a month and a half.    2. The size. If they were to double the size it would be great. While it&#x27;s current size is perfect for travel, you can easily fit two of these into those soap dish travel cases. I just would rather have to buy one 7oz bar instead of two 3.5oz bars.      With the negatives aside I have to say this product is perfect for people traveling or for those that no longer want to use shampoo&#x27;s that dry out your hair.    +Travel size  +Smell  +Lathers like a horse at the races in the middle of August.    -Could come in a bigger size for those not traveling  -Weird &#x27;gelification&#x27; process near the products end-life.</li>
            <li> I used this product last year when I went on vacation to England.  It lasted a long time.  I was there for 2 1/2 weeks and washed my hair everyday.  I still had some left over at the end of the trip.  It&#x27;s much lighter to pack than a bottle of shampoo and my hair was really clean.  I had their travel container too, which helped it last longer.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Perfect transaction!  Love the old fashioned bar shampoo!</li>
            <li> i have sensitive skin fron head to toe and have always had dandruff which required me to wash and scrub my scalp every day. i learned about sls in most commercia shampoo&#x27;s and decided to seek out a more natural shampoo. i like the fact that there are very few ingredients which i can actually pronounce in the product. anyways, i started using this shampoo and my dandruff went away....have had a healthy scalp since.</li>
            <li> smells great, feels great</li>
            <li> Works great so far. Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Love it! It lathers so well and leaves my hair feeling clean. Sometimes my hair feels dry, but I fix it with a few drops of conditioner. I understand that they vary in size because every piece is cut by hand, but my soap felt really small.</li>
            <li> JR Liggett&#x27;s bar shampoo is probably one of the best things that ever happened to my hair. For starters, it does not contain the harsh detergent Sodium Laurel Sulfate, which most conventional shampoos have. SLS strips the oils from your hair, leaving your hair damaged, and with an overproduction of oil to compensate. This overproduction makes you need to wash your hair constantly to keep the oil at a reasonable level. This shampoo does not have SLS in it, and I can go quite a while without washing it - usually my skin feels yucky long before my hair starts to feel gross in any way.  Of course, my hair took about a week to get used to the sudden lack of SLS in my shampoo - which caused it to be very, very greasy for a few days to a week. I recommend that if you switch to JR Liggett&#x27;s, you do it at a time that you will not have to go out very much (I did it during summer vacation from school). Do NOT let this adjustment period discourage you from using this fantastic product, though! It&#x27;s SO worth it because it  makes my hair really, really soft and thick, and my curls look nicer than when I used SLS based shampoos!  Besides the SLS factor, JR liggett&#x27;s is more environmentally friendly. It comes wrapped only in a small piece of paper, rather than a large plastic bottle. Also, you don&#x27;t need conditioner because the oils in the shampoo bar do the job of conditioner (so, one less plastic bottle). It saves me a lot of money - even if $6 seems a bit much for a 3.5 ounce bar, you must take in to consideration the fact that you don&#x27;t need to buy conditioner and that the bar lasts to between 6 months and a year! The scent it exudes is a mild herbal scent and in a pinch it can be used as a body soap as well. When I go on my church&#x27;s mission trip each year, I use it as shampoo, and body soap, and shaving soap and it works just fine.  I recommend that when you use it, you put it in your hair right when you get it wet, and leave it in until the very end of your shower (after you&#x27;ve soaped your body, shaved your legs, etc) to get the softest hair possible.   To sum it up, JR Liggett&#x27;s is a fantastic, environmentally responsible product with all-natural and safe ingredients, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once, so far I really liked it. I was a bit nervous after I first washed, my hair felt a little odd, but I turned out beautiful after I air dried and flat ironed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a number of years - at home and on my travels through Europe.    There&#x27;s nothing better or more convenient.    Give it a try.</li>
            <li> There is nothing special about this \\&quot;shampoo\\&quot; bar. It is a bar of plain old soap (oils, lye, and water), the kind you can make in your kitchen with a little knowledge and some standard chemical safety gear. It is extremely small, about 2 x 2.5 x 1 inches. If you don&#x27;t like making your own soap (or if you&#x27;re just too busy, like me), there are more economical bars out there. I usually buy an online brand that comes in a 6 oz bar (about 2.5 x 4 x 2 inches), for about 5 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those people who get a build up from washing their hair with natural soaps in hard water, a couple of table spoons of apple cider vinegar in a generous glass (16 ozs) of hot water makes an excellent rinse. Just don&#x27;t get it in your eyes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only three stars for this since it is so small for the price and claims to be more than what it is - a standard bar of soap.</li>
            <li> Started using this a month ago. It is gentle for my scalp, clean wash. It&#x27;s travel friendly, too. I will continue buying this!!</li>
            <li> I have used this for a month now and my hair is totally different. I have long (nearly waist length) hair and was considering chopping it off since I MUST shampoo my hair daily, and it was a dry mess. There was maybe a week to get used to it, where my hair was end-of-day greasy feeling, but nothing unbearable (like no poo which I couldn&#x27;t do). Now my hair feels clean and is shiny and soft. I have water softener and it lathers up extremely well. I only rub it into my scalp. Also, now my hair gets far less greasy. If I go through the day without showering I could still wear my hair down and go out without thinking about it. A month later the bar is still mostly there (I keep it in a small tupperware) and I guess will last two more months easily. I also don&#x27;t use conditioner anymore so it&#x27;s definitely less expensive than other options.</li>
            <li> good, but I think liquid shampoo is more better than solid soap.</li>
            <li> Let me preface this by saying that this does not work with hard water.  I&#x27;m pretty sure others have mentioned this, but since it&#x27;s the primary reason for this review, I have to say it again.  I gave this shampoo bar 2 weeks.  During that time, my hair was somewhat thicker, but it was also constantly filled with static, and just seemed really dry (which is weird, because I normally have oily hair).  The fact of the matter is that SLS was pretty much created to work well with hard water--and it does.  I pretty much have no choice but to continue to use my regular shampoo.  I&#x27;m sure this shampoo probably works great with soft water, but since I don&#x27;t have soft water, I can&#x27;t really say.  I only know it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I work in a natural foods store, where I ignored this humble bar for years. I&#x27;m so glad I finally decided to try it! The original has a light rosy scent and is quite fun to use. (The scent doesn&#x27;t linger.) So many reviews have nailed this experience already, but here goes. Lots of fluffy lather; rinses cleanly unless the water is super hard; hair feels alarmingly stiff while wet, but no tangles; and then -- it dries and hair looks better than it has in years. Or at least mine does! I have a bit of a wave and this shampoo brings out the natural texture perfectly when I just comb through and air dry. Also, my scalp feels like it can breathe. I love it. (And I never would have discovered this if I hadn&#x27;t been desperate to find something to get my daughter out of a no-poo phase.) You don&#x27;t know how many fancy shampoos this has replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, I had thought my hair was just degenerating into frizz with age. Maybe that wasn&#x27;t the problem!</li>
            <li> Great bar shampoo.  Low odor, easy to use and great results.  Much more convent than liquids and travels well without taking up much space.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo I have ever used. My hair is thick and soft,  not too oily, and doesn&#x27;t require washing every day. Even the most gentle of regular bottle shampoos turn my head into an oil slick after only a day, so this stuff is a lifesaver to my scalp. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I was looking to a good natural alternative to shampoo and this is way better than I could have expected. My hair is thicker than its ever been and I don&#x27;t need a conditioner to make it soft. I will use this stuff forever!</li>
            <li> My wife and I were backpacking in Southeast Asia this summer and wanted to avoid carrying liquids as much as possible.  A travel book recommended bringing a bar of shampoo.  After checking out a local store that sold solid shampoos and being scared off by the price, I came on Amazon and found this product.  3.5 oz turned out to be a smaller bar than I expected but it lasts quite a while.  After three weeks of travel, we still had a lot of shampoo left over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for travel (particularly backpacking). Will gladly continue using and purchase this brand again.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I have the hair I always wanted. Almost no frizz and brilliant wavy model hair with no effort. Yes, your hair/scalp needs to adjust over a week or two, but it&#x27;s worh it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always on the lookout to eliminate liquids in my carry-on luggage when I travel.  With this shampoo bar, there is no need to carry liquid shampoo. I liked this product at first.  I found it best to use a liquid conditioner after rinsing the shampoo. My hair felt clean, and the bar lasts and lasts.  However, after using this shampoo daily at home for about 2 months, I developed intense itching in my scalp.  As soon as I discontinued using the Liggett&#x27;s shampoo bar, my scalp returned to normal.  I believe I can probably still pack Liggett&#x27;s in my travel kit and use it for a few days while traveling.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a trip to India and planned to use it as shampoo, body soap and laundry soap. (I like to pack light!) It was a good idea and worked well for my body and clothes. However, I found that it left a film in my hair, even after I lathered up twice and rinsed VERY well. It made my hair look greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s possible it had something to do with the water in India. I&#x27;d recommend trying this bar out at home before your trip to see how it works for you, and bringing backup shampoo just in case if you&#x27;re planning to take it on a trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, it didn&#x27;t have any sort of strong scent (a bonus if you don&#x27;t want to attract bugs!), and it lathered up fine. The bar is small but would last for approximately 2-3 weeks if used for body and hair for one person.</li>
            <li> I like that your hair does feel extremely clean after you use it, but I do not like how long it takes to lather. It makes my hair washing process longer. Maybe a liquid formula of this same shampoo will better suit me.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product. I&#x27;ve used other shampoo bars before and this is the best so far but I opt to find even better so still on the search for the perfect shampoo bar.  I have curly/wavy/frizzy hair so I need something with alot more moisture, but if you have fine hair or normal hair then this product is A-OK!</li>
            <li> Great for hair that tends to get greasy. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two months and it cleans well without drying out the scalp. Very impressed and will be buying again.</li>
            <li> really like this product. dont see myself going back to &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; shampoo. My hair feels clean and healthy</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.  Bought it because it looked interesting - a bar shampoo??  Just bought one for my daughter. . . she loves it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mom</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this shampoo. I am a woman who loves fashion and was looking for a plastic-free shampoo that wouldn&#x27;t make my hair look like it was greasy, dry or weighed down. This shampoo works! My hair is wavy, long and medium thickness. I will never go back to bottled shampoo. This shampoo lasts about three to five months if two people are using it nearly every day. The great thing is that you don&#x27;t need to wash your hair every single day because the shampoo maintains your natural shine and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy the next day like so many high end (read waste of money) shampoos.</li>
            <li> Ever since I saw the movie Carrie, and she washes the blood out of her hair with a bar of soap - I&#x27;ve always wanted to wash my hair with a bar of soap.  Well, I did, with this bar of soap.  And it&#x27;s true, the first time you use it, it really does do something for your hair.  Yes, your hair is squeaky clean, and as others mentioned, you may think you need to use conditioner - but don&#x27;t - you don&#x27;t need too. The second use, well. . . and the third - oh for the luv of - not so much.  All soap is oil based, and changing from one type to another will make a difference the first couple of uses - then it stops working.  This stopped working sooner than most - it made my hair flat and without any shine.  Needless to say, the novelty of the bar wore off and I won&#x27;t be buying any more.</li>
            <li> These shampoo bars are great. I had previously tried every home made/truly natural option for washing my hair, and these are the only things that work. And they work well! My hair is thoroughly clean, and it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out. Highly recommended for anyone wanting a truly natural, affordable hair washing solution that really works.</li>
            <li> My sister and I have used this shampoo for years and have converted many people to it also. It smooths fly away hair and leaves your hair healthy. Why pay for all that water in a bottle of shampoo?</li>
            <li> I should just buy this in bulk: I&#x27;ve been using it regularly for more than a year now! Love, love, love this.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from dandruff and scalp dermatitis for over 13 years. I&#x27;ve visited numerous doctors,dermatologists,etc, seeking the best treatments available.  All of them told me the same thing \\&quot;scalp dermatitis is not curable, you will live with the condition for the rest of your life and the best we can do is manage your condition\\&quot;. So I used medicated shampoos for the past 13 years that damaged my hair, smelled bad, and only temporarily relieved my symptoms,not to mention,they were expensive also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had heard this shampoo was a miracle in treating dandruff, and having tried everything else, I decided to give it a shot. I bought 2 bars, the original formula, and the jojoba and peppermint formula, and I gotta say, damn I&#x27;m impressed. After 1 week I noticed a noticeable improvement in my scalp, and after a month I&#x27;m 100% dandruff free. I&#x27;m cured! No rashes, no dry itchy skin, no flakes, nothing. My scalp is as clean as it was when I was a child! not to mention, my hair is so soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My doctor can&#x27;t believe it,as a matter of fact, she says that my condition can \\&quot;heal on it&#x27;s own suddenly\\&quot;. Really? I had scalp dermatitis for 13 years and suddenly it stops? I don&#x27;t think so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, I want to really recommend this product to the people that suffer from dandruff, give it a try!.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I have shoulder-length, oily, brunette hair, and it&#x27;s surprising how well my hair responds to this bar shampoo. It looks shinier and is softer, and it does not seem to get naturally oily as fast as it does using bottled shampoos from the store.  I also really like that this is made with all natural ingredients, and that it&#x27;s eco-friendly.  The wrapper is recyclable, and there&#x27;s no waste once you&#x27;ve used the bar up!  It lasts longer than I would expect a small bar of soap to last.  The wrapper says that it lasts as long as a 24 ounce bottle of shampoo would last, but I&#x27;m not quite sure of that - it depends on how much you lather up each time.  I look forward to using this while traveling, since I carry on a lot, and a solid bar of soap is not a worry for the 3-1-1 liquid restrictions.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and it arrived in good condition. Pleasant, faint smell of roses, not overpowering. I wanted to switch to an all natural shampoo without sulfates so I can stop stripping my hair. I&#x27;ve only used this for about a week, but I&#x27;ve seen small improvements. One note: I stopped using conditioner because it doesn&#x27;t seem to be needed with this shampoo and weighed my hair down a lot.</li>
            <li> looking at the ingredients and knowing i have oily skin &amp; hair i was afraid this shampoo would leave my hair greasy-looking but this is not the case! we have somewhat hard water so it took me a minute to figure out the best way to get a lather up on the soap. however after ONE USE of this shampoo (and skipping conditioner!) my hair is softer and cleaner-feeling than it has ever been in my entire life and my husband says it smells nice. DING DING DING WE HAVE A WINNER!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products around.  It seems to last forever, suds up well and can be used for soap and shaving too.  Perfect for flying (not a liquid or gel), especially because it takes up almost no room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first used JR Liggett&#x27;s over 20 years ago on a long bicycle trip, where space and weight are very important.  It is PERFECT for travel.  When preparing for an overseas trip I had to find it again, luckily Amazon had it available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can easily take just the bar, the paper wrapper and a ZipLoc on a trip and have all you need.  I considered the &#x27;travel&#x27; varieties but think you can get just the bar and get along fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really is a great product and it&#x27;s made in USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a bit bigger, especially for the price. I like the lather this soap produced and it made my hair feel soft and very clean with just one wash.</li>
            <li> This is a great natural shampoo. Leaves my hair soft, full of body, and smooth instead of frizzy after blow drying. Much better than conventional shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy this again - for my hair it leaves a heavy oily feeling</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical on how easy this would be to apply to my hair but it is actually really simple. After you rub it on your hair a bit it feels just like regular shampoo and you can easily clean your hair with it in the same way. You can feel that your hair is clean but it doesn&#x27;t feel dry. My hair looks and feels so much more healthy after using this product. Instead of having dry, damaged hair it&#x27;s nourished and silky. It&#x27;s not every day you find natural products for an affordable price. Will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Does clean your hair well and feels light and natural with this product, like the fact it has very few chemicals in this shampoo. My main complaint is the price and the fact that is is used up quickly, Note keep it out of shower and dry or it will dissolve faster.</li>
            <li> I bought these solid shampoos for travel purposes. They are wonderful for that.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance and  lather.  Washes hair clean.  Does leave ends feeling &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; but use organic Argan oil right after shampoo and it is just fine.</li>
            <li> Love this little bar! great for my problem skin, can use without any reactions on my scalp or if any gets on my face. This is all I can use now a days.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, lathers well, smells great and leaves the hair clean, soft and healthy looking. I use the natural original bar and it has a mild pleasant smell.  I don&#x27;t believe that it lasts as long as it states though? I store it in the wooden holder that is available. When I travel I use it for hair and body. Great gift for backpackers!</li>
            <li> Simply the best.  I&#x27;m in the ocean daily and need to shampoo to remove the salt.  This is the only shampoo that works for me--  and leaves my hair feeling soft and thick and healthy.</li>
            <li> If you have dry, brittle hair as a result of thyroid problems, you will find that  this shampoo can work wonders for you. Regular shampoos always left my hair frizzy, fly away and very spongy right after washing. I have been using this shampoo for several months now, and the change in my hair is amazing. Coconut oil is one of  only two oils that can actually penetrate the hair shaft(scientifically proven), sealing moisture in the  hair from the inside, and protecting the hair from protein loss. My hair is stronger, shinier, and not breaking off anymore. I  no longer need to use gel or hair spray to keep my hair in place. I will never use regular shampoo ever again!</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo, I usually just use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s for both body and hair which I also love but Dr. Bronner&#x27;s is a little hard on your hair color  strips it faster, this shampoo isn&#x27;t suppose to.  My hair is short but knots easily but I don&#x27;t use any conditioner, this leaves your hair soft but I&#x27;ve also been able to style with very little product.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Did not work well for my slightly oily long hair. Probably better for men/people with short hair.</li>
            <li> At my parents&#x27; house it works great, because they have soft water.  I like the idea of this product, but it just seems to build up too much in my hair with our hard water.  I&#x27;ve switched to the herbal formula with terrific results.</li>
            <li> I switched to this shampoo bar from using regular shampoo and I will never go back! This is a great combination with Dr. Bronner shakai conditioning rinse.  The shampoo leaves your hair feeling squeaky clean but the rinse removes any waxiness from the shampoo and leaves your hair feeling soft.  For those who have never used natural shampoo/conditioner it does take a period of time for your hair to adjust- and it is a bit of a different process, but the results are totally worth it AND you get to avoid all the nasties.  WIN WIN.  I have long, very fine wavy/frizzy hair. I now wash my hair every three days (I just rinse with water on the off days) and it is much smoother, shinier and less frizzy. Very happy!</li>
            <li> I used it now for about 7 months, I like the brand. Takes some practice though, to not get scared how the hair feel right after shampooed. I do use the conditioner, while some people do not.</li>
            <li> The best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This is olive oil based shampoo with minimal amount of chemicals. Works fine.</li>
            <li> Just didnt work for me really...&lt;br /&gt;Iv been off of any conventional shampoos for about 6 months then i switched to this one... It left my scalp dry but the hair near it was very waxy and felt greasy.. I know my hair was clean but it felt like the residue did not wash out and was from the soap... Maybe because of our hard water</li>
            <li> I stumbled on this not long ago after several years of avoiding SLS shampoos and now wanting to avoid bottles and the expensive non SLS products, which are also hard to find. It seems hard to believe that this product works that well and lasts so long-but it does. My hair feels better and softer, I hardly need to use conditioner-and I have extremely thick, coarse hair. I know the bar looks small and I cannot comment on how long it lasts as I have only had it a month, but after a month of using it 2-3 times a week, it doesn&#x27;t seem to have shrunk. I have a feeling it may last many months. Of course, I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day anymore, which incidentally, most women with longer hair should not do anyway.I love the product and it&#x27;s almost like a brand-new lifestyle after using bottled shampoos every day for years-which only damaged my hair. Anyway, it seems so odd at first to use a bar of soap on your hair, but this really works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not picky when it comes to soap and shampoo. Over the last few years I&#x27;ve been getting more interested in, and purchasing personal care products and cleaners that are less toxic to the environment and made with fewer and simpler ingredients (ones I can read and understand :P).  This product? Feels just like and works like shampoo/soap except my hair feels just a tiny bit softer and less dry. Clean feeling without feeling stripped if that makes sense.  I kind of like just running my hands around in my hair during the day if I&#x27;m spacing out for a minute.</li>
            <li> I just orderd this item and I love it. First of all, it arrived a week before sheduled wich was amazing and a great surprise. I didn&#x27;t try it immediatly but when I did it was amazing. The texture was super soft, it melted easy without melting too much and it washed very well. The smell was not intense unlike what I had thought it might be. After washing, rising with water and Apple Cider Vinegar and blowdrying, my hair felt amazingly soft and it looked shiny and healthy. It was a great buy, I recomend it for sensitive scalps like I have.</li>
            <li> this stuff is really really nice. i initially bought the peppermint bar but when it dissolved i somewhat arbitrarily changed to this one.&lt;br /&gt;i have more-or-less straight, thick, long dirty blonde hair and this keeps it soft and quite nice if i shampoo 3/4 times a week&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;what&#x27;s great&lt;br /&gt;- none of those SLS gross chemicals!&lt;br /&gt;- don&#x27;t need conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;- lasts a decent amount of time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;two things to be cautious of:&lt;br /&gt;- it dissolves very very easily. i&#x27;m in a dorm this year and so have to use a shower caddy. i left the bar in a container (apparently) with water in it, and the bar literally dissolved entirely. so make sure it can dry off.&lt;br /&gt;- it&#x27;s harder (at least in my experience) to work the lather through hair than is the case with &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; shampoo/conditioner, so i have to be particularly careful to make sure i rub it all the way in all over my scalp. otherwise i get gross patches in the back.</li>
            <li> Recently converted my family to SLS free products and we are absolutely smitten with J.R. Liggett&#x27;s Original Shampoo. A few quick passes through your hair is all you need. Lather and rinse as normal. The &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34; formula scent could be described as unisex, clean, and unobtrusive. The immediate difference I noticed with my kiddos hair was the natural shine, manageability, and bounce had sprung back. No conditioner needed. Product definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> This not my first bar of the product, as I&#x27;ve had it from non-Amazonian sources before.  As before, I have been very pleased with the product, and the delivery was just as expected.</li>
            <li> I was using the Peppermint one, but they were out so I got the original formula here.  And while it doesn&#x27;t smell as good, it does work as well.  I still can&#x27;t believe that, looking at the ingredient list, this can clean my hair.  But somehow a bunch of OIL cleans my hair.  It&#x27;s MAGIC I tell you!  Not surprisingly it conditions well.  I also feel really good about sending those suds into our water system (versus commercial shampoos.)</li>
            <li> This is a very good product.  It is very light weight, easy to pack and carry in the field.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel clean, but not stripped of natural oils, which ends up making people with oily hair like me end up producing more oil in the long run.</li>
            <li> great product but it does not last long.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last very long, made hair feel weird, gets all mushy, but it&#x27;s cool because it&#x27;s old school, I wouldn&#x27;t get it again though, regular shampoo is just fine</li>
            <li> Pretty nice, no problems and I think my scalp and hair look/feel better after a weeks worth of use.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my father-in-law that struggles with dandruff.  He LOVES this and said it is the only thing that will help him not have flakes.  He made me buy 12 just in case - so he&#x27;d have a year&#x27;s supply if it wasnt&#x27; on Amazon anymore.</li>
            <li> Very nice, compact and handy as an all-purpose soap.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought it would be. Still, works well. Makes my hair feel soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this shampoo many times and love it. In addition to what others have said I will add another benefit. No plastic packaging! I don&#x27;t know how this ships, but sitting on a store shelf it does not have a plastic wrapper. It has a paper wrapper. So much more environmentally sustainable than plastic bottles.</li>
            <li> A lot easier to use than shampoo and produces the same results.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and arrived very quickly.  It takes very little to get lots of lather and the scent is a wholesome clean natural scent.  I really like it and think the bar of shampoo will last for a long time as it only takes one little swipe across the back of my head to get all the lather necessary to wash my hair.  Great Product.</li>
            <li> works great &amp; saves money too!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great for home, but even better for travel. It&#x27;s not a liquid, so you can take it anywhere, and it adds less weight to your luggage than a full bottle of liquid gel shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s the shampoo itself that&#x27;s the best-- it has no sulfates, and isn&#x27;t harsh on your hair. I have naturally curly hair, and I need shampoos that won&#x27;t take its natural oils out and make it frizzy. Yet it also is strong enough to make it clean. The only bad thing about it is that it hurts a lot if you get it in your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried the JR Liggett&#x27;s Jojoba shampoo, and I think I like this original type better.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and packaged well. Used the bars as both shampoo and soap on a recent hut-to-hut backpacking trip, and they worked well. Didn&#x27;t miss the conditioner.</li>
            <li> If you enjoy &amp; appreciate natural products, you will LOVE this one!  Our family has used this for years.  My husband &amp; my daughter both suffer with flaky scalps.  But after a week of using JR Ligget&#x27;s shampoo-it clears right up.  Lathers up easily, rinses out clean.  We keep ours in 1/2 of a soap dish (there is no need to use the lid) and we stand it up on end, otherwise-it can stick to the dish &amp; is a pain to get out.  Don&#x27;t leave this in the shower (you will come back to a puddle of soapy mess if if fills with water by an unsuspecting family member.)  Awesome product!</li>
            <li> It works just as well as liquid shampoo.</li>
            <li> We are on a mission to eradicate the use of plastic from our lives, so we&#x27;ve been trying lots of alternative shampoo methods, including baking soda (many people swear by this but I didn&#x27;t like it), regular bar soap (worked great when we had a water softener, but not so great in hard water), and bulk shampoo (which is still in plastic, but at least it&#x27;s in large containers, and we take it home in our own glass jars... but the options available to use smell really strong, all day long).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think J.R. Liggett&#x27;s Bar Shampoo is a winner! It came in a plain paper wrapper. It&#x27;s easy to use (just rub it along your hair a few times and then work it in - it behaves a lot like liquid shampoo). And it leaves my hair feeling soft and clean! No excessive build-up so far, no strong odors (I prefer unscented body products, though I believe there are scented options available if that&#x27;s your thing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to find a local supplier so I can get a hold of this without having to wait for it to be an &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34; to some other purchase. We&#x27;ll definitely be using it from here on out, though.</li>
            <li> Good product and service.</li>
            <li> Did not realize it would be so small for so much money.  Heard it was good soap for washing and shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for sometime now. I&#x27;m older and have grey hair and this seems to help prevent my hair from being too &amp;#34;fly-away&amp;#34;. I like this product, and was happy to find it at a reasonable price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It was smaller than I thought it would be, but I like how it leave my hair feeling clean. It does not dry my hair out and it makes my hair feel softer after I wash it.</li>
            <li> I will never use another shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I recently decided to eliminate sodiums and Sulfates from my hair products.  I tried a couple of other shampoos that left my hair feeling heavy with too much product.  Not this one! This shampoo bar lathers well and leaves my hair clean with no product build up.  I don&#x27;t even use conditioner, just a little argan oil after I blow dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have long, thick, wavy hair and my husband has straight-as-a-board fine hair, and we both love this shampoo.  We actually stayed the night with my sister last week and just used her Redkin shampoo to shower. Y husband and both felt our hair looked and felt heavy and weird.  We will only use this shampoo bar in the future.&lt;br /&gt;Also, we&#x27;ve tried a few different formulas of the jr liggets shampoo bars, and the original was our favorite.</li>
            <li> While I have been wanting to try bar shampoo for a long time, I was skeptical about this product. Now I am really glad that I tried it. It leaves my hair soft and clean and I love using it. I have very thick, dry hair almost down to my waist that I wash daily. This bar lathers nicely with the help of coconut oil as opposed to sulfates. The smell was odd to me at first but it isn&#x27;t bad. It&#x27;s kind of what I would expect an \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; soap to smell like. I leave the bar on a ventilated rack when not in use. I would not recommend leaving this in a soap dish as it will get slimy and shrink faster. They sell holders for this soap, so I ordered the plastic case and will review it after it arrives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do use a separate conditioner with this soap on most days (Organix Coconut Milk) as my hair does get tangled even though I wash it carefully. I use a cider vinegar rinse 2x a week and my hair has no tangles after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is perfect for any one going \\&quot;low-poo.\\&quot; I would also recommend this to people who want to be able to bring shampoo with them while traveling but do not want to deal with plastic bottles. It is also great for people trying to get away from sulfates, alcohol, and other damaging chemicals. Some people may go through a transition period when first using this and may experience some waxy, oily buildup on the scalp. Try to give this product at least a week to get used to. I personally only had the buildup for a day or two. I liked this soap so much that I ordered the herbal version and can&#x27;t wait to try that one out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about this shampoo is that it is not good for washing out hair grease (coconut oil/shea butter mix). If you use coconut oil to protect your hair, you may want to have a regular non sulfate shampoo on hand to wash it out.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shampoo!!  He uses it all the time!!!</li>
            <li> Seems to work well. Leaves a somewhat waxy residue behind that&#x27;s annoying. This goes away when I combine with a conditioner bar.</li>
            <li> Terrific! Glad to find this on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I loved the fact that it is made by natural ingredients, but I hated the smell. It smelled like cheap Irish Spring soap. It also left a waxy residue in my hair.  The residue is also impossible to get off, I tried to wash it off using other shampoos but I still feel the stickiness. My naturally straight Asian hair became very wavy after using this shampoo. Although the waves looked good, I did not like the fact that my hair was all stuck together and tangled.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use any other shampoo after I tried these ones several years ago. The best ever made. You can use it every day on your hair or several times a day and your hair will not be over-dry or greasy. Recommend to all. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great product!  Don&#x27;t ever use anything else.  Delivery fast, east and convenient.</li>
            <li> Wow.what a revelation!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny, knowing its natural with no preservatives or fake scents. Does the job and lasts much longer than any bottle of poison I used to use</li>
            <li> Took about a week for my hair to adjust (no more &amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34; feel), and now I love it! Keeps my hair from frizzing in humid weather, and my hair feels clean and hydrated. Bar is excellent for travel (I keep it in an inexpensive soap box and let it air dry after every use - don&#x27;t leave it in the shower unless you want a sticky, gooey mess...learned that the hard way!). I still use regular shampoo one every week or two (or after I&#x27;ve gotten it super dirty), but that&#x27;s just personal preference.</li>
            <li> Love this bar! Repeat buyer</li>
            <li> This is been my only shampoo for years now. No Sodium laurel sulfate (SLS); All-natural ingredients.The solid bar lasts forever. The small size fits Into my toilet kit easily.</li>
            <li> Always loved this product! Glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get this to work well in my adult hair, but it works amazing in my children&#x27;s!  Their hair is SO shiny and flowy.  I am holding out hope I can try it again and have it work :)</li>
            <li> I have long natural silky shiny straight black hair and this shampoo bar disappointed me greatly.  Not only did my hair lost its shine after using this shampoo bar, my hair felt so dry while rinsing (felt like i had glue on my hair).  I had to spray on some leave in conditioner, oils etc so that my hair wont look like coconut husk.  So much for going natural.. I&#x27;ll go back to my unnatural hair products...</li>
            <li> My hair used to be voluminous and very wavy. Extremely healthy and beautiful looking. Over the past few years, something happened to it. It become very flat.  Waves wouldn&#x27;t even stay and I&#x27;ve ALWAYS been wavy. Just wan&#x27;t beautiful anymore. I bought a different bottle shampoo a month ago and it completely, utterly dried my hair out. The tangles were unbelievable. I literally couldn&#x27;t get them all out. So I bought this and two washes later, it&#x27;s already getting the volume and the waves back. I feel Jewish again because my curls and waves are coming back out. I am so happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update later if it doesn&#x27;t work as well as I hoped.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo and really fun to use. It has a light fluffy lather and smells wonderful. However, before purchasing you should know that if you have super hard water, it may be hard for you to use this soap. In addition, it may take a while for your hair to get used to something that doesn&#x27;t have sodium laureth/lauryl  sulfate--the detergent (yes, detergent) that is in most conventional shampoos, which are incidentally really bad for your hair. If you&#x27;re having trouble getting out the excess shampoo, you can use an apple cider vinegar/water mix. If this sounds too high maintenance, keep in mind that it should only take a week to get used to the soap, and after that you can ditch the vinegar or only use it occasionally. After the adjustment period, it will keep your hair MUCH cleaner. I have semi long thick hair and with most shampoos I had to wash every day or my hair would be a big grease ball, not so with this. I wash twice a week, and in between time my hair stays soft and pretty, and I don&#x27;t need to condition.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST SHAMPOO EVER. I have fine, thin hair.... and I do not need a conditioner when I use this shampoo. With any traditional shampoo I have to condition my hair every time or I wouldn&#x27;t even be able to comb it afterwards. It also GREATLY prolongs the life of my haircolor. I buy it in bulk now (4-5 bars at a time) so I never run out. This was an impulse purchase that turned out to be a happy accident. Sulfate free and so gentle on your hair. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even better than I first thought. Want my whole family to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about a quarter way through mine and I&#x27;m liking it.  It does well for my dark curls, removes excess oil (contrary to label?) without leaving your hair feeling stripped.  Be sure to store it somewhere (or on something) that won&#x27;t allow water to be trapped under the bar, if water is trapped under it the bottom side will turn to useless goo.  If you haven&#x27;t tried solid yet you definitely should.  They never try to doctor your hair as much as liquids, plus you&#x27;re not wasting resources moving water around, and wasting your money thinking you&#x27;re getting more shampoo.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a natural way to clean my hair and save money.  I also had trouble with my neckline breaking out and it drove me crazy, which is another reason.  I am very happy with this shampoo bar.  It&#x27;s a space saver, cuts down on plastic bottles, lathers very well, smells good, and leaves my hair clean.  The breakouts are totally clearing up....thank goodness!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do take a few extra steps in order to further condition my hair:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bell jar&lt;br /&gt;2 TB apple cider vinegar&lt;br /&gt;Few drops of essential oils (no more than 3-4 drops of oils like Lavandin, Frankincense, Rosemary, Helichrysum, Palo Santo, Spikenard, or Patchouli)&lt;br /&gt;Fill with water to brim&lt;br /&gt;Cap and shake well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I warm it up first, then pour on my hair, let it sit for a few minutes and rinse.  My hair is so easy to comb after this step and very shiny after it dries.  I also now wash my hair every other day, because it doesn&#x27;t get oily so quickly anymore.  With standard shampoos my hair looked I dipped it in Crisco the next day, so I had to shampoo every single damn day.  I&#x27;ve also had trouble with hair loss due to hypothyroid and wanted to find natural methods to keep my scalp healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never go back to shampoo or conditioner filled with chemicals again!!!  I will ONLY use J. R. Liggett going forward!  Next order will be in bulk, so I never run out.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is amazing and does exactly what it says, washes clean with NO BUILDUP and RESIDUE from repeated washings. My hair feels soft, bouncy and clean. I used to use the Chagrin Valley Shampoo bars but those definitely left a residue which I had to remove with occasional apple cider rinses. With this shampoo bar I&#x27;ve not had to touch my apple cider at all. However this will leave your hair squeaky so I use some Shea Moisture conditioner on the ends of my hair with this.</li>
            <li> This shampoo made my hair feel a little funny at first but I did an Acv rinse and everything was fine after that. My hair wasn&#x27;t itchy as it usually is. I love it. I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched and tried so many shampoos and conditioners due to itchy scalp.  Some shampoos seemed OK, but after using a few times my scalp was irritated.  I didn&#x27;t like all the chemicals in the liquid shampoos and conditioners.  Also read some can contribute to hair loss.  I think that is due to the hair follicles having a waxy buildup and pores can&#x27;t breathe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enters this simple shampoo bar with few ingredients, how simple and effective this shampoo is!! I was amazed when I use the bar directly on my scalp, swiping a couple times, how much it lathered.  After rinsing off, wasn&#x27;t sure if needed conditioner, but once I dried my hair, it was so soft and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I should mention, my hair, the first week (2-3 shampoos), did take adjusting and seemed a little stringy (a little oily).  The natural oils in the scalp was adjusting to just using this bar shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels so wonderful, thicker and shinier.  Will buy more of this.  The bar is small (smaller than I expected), but lasts a good long while (equals a 24 oz. bottle of shampoo from what I read).  I store it away from the humid bathroom in a soap holder that keeps it out of standing water.  It will last longer.  I don&#x27;t use a conditioner, though if I do need to remove shampoo buildup, I would use organic apple cider vinegar and water (2 tbsp. to 1 cup water) as a rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So pleased I finally found what works best for me as I do have sensitive skin (dermatitis) and no more itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> Short haired man here.  Love this soap.  Enough said.</li>
            <li> Just used the bar. Did not need conditioner as it left hair soft and smooth. So far no oily build up like what would occur with shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo product I have ever used.  It really does clean your hair without stripping out the oils.  I&#x27;ve been using it now for closer to a year, exclusively, and have not regretted the decision one bit.  Plus, the cheapest price I&#x27;ve found so far has been on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I switched to \\&quot;no-poo\\&quot; 5 months ago and started using baking soda and ACV. While it worked really well, it didn&#x27;t smell great and there was some effort involved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found one of these bars at a local health foods store and started using it the next day. It didn&#x27;t work like I thought it would, but that&#x27;s because it took me a couple of tries to figure out the method of the madness. You might not get enough lather by just rubbing it between your hands - I did that the first time, but I have shoulder-length hair! I realized that you really need to rub the bar down your hair to get enough on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it since with no problems - no conditioner needed, less tangles than the BS+ACV method, and it leaves my hair feeling and looking good for a couple of days. Can&#x27;t wait to give this bar a go during an upcoming trip!</li>
            <li> First time I tried a shampoo bar. I was surprised by the lather (didn&#x27;t expect it to) and love the way my gray hair feels and behaves. No need for conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing the no poo (no shampoo) thing for about 2 years now, starting with baking soda, then trying out DIY shampoo bars, before settling on JR Liggett. It has a pleasant scent and lathers nicely. This bar strikes the perfect balance of my hair feeling clean but not too dried out. Note that before trying this you should read up on no poo hair care tips, like how you should redistribute the sebum that&#x27;s no longer being stripped from your hair by the SLS in commercial shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, always do a vinegar rinse. A lot of reviews and even in the product descriptions I&#x27;ve read talk about this step like it&#x27;s optional, but not rinsing with vinegar afterward will leave your hair feeling rough and tangled. This is because after washing with the shampoo bar, the scales on your hair will be raised. The acidic vinegar will smooth them down again.</li>
            <li> Have only tried once, a little lather, not much but my hair felt so clean and much much softer afterwards.  If I&#x27;d known that a sulfate free shampoo felt like this, I&#x27;d have tried one much sooner.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shampoo bar. Its all natural, has a mild clean scent and it lasts forever. Though, I suggest an apple cider vinegar rinse. After I get out of the shower I LIGHTLY apply olive oil to my ends then work my way up through my hair. My hair is so much softer and shinier with this method than with chemically laden store bought shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> This shampoo bar makes my hair feel so soft. I can go 2 days with no washing, which I love due to how long it is. The lather is very nice. The smell is interesting, it may put off some, but I love it.</li>
            <li> J R Liggett Old-Fashioned Shampoo Original Formula is a great product if you find that bottled shampoos dry out your hair too much. Without all the extra chemicals that bottled shampoos use, my hair comes out shiny and clean and manageable every time I use it.</li>
            <li> I read a lot about using this kind of shampoo before I bought it, so I knew I&#x27;d have to use it for a while before I could really know how it worked. I really wanted to like it but it left my hair feeling gross and hard to manage; this didn&#x27;t get better over time either, it always felt pretty much exactly the same.</li>
            <li> Am just starting my second bar, having welded the first bar to the second.  I love the literal squeaky clean I can get from my hair.  I also like the fact that in a pinch I can use this as a body soap.  I also tried as a shaving soap, but did not work, but why would I use this instead if my Mitchell Wool Fat or Edwin Jagger specialized shaving soaps anyway?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My observations.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it is now the fall of the year here and slightly cooler and that I do not sweat as much, and feel like I do not need to shampoo everyday because of this shampoo.  Could never do that before with any shampoo without getting an itchy scalp, with greasy feeling limp hair.  May now be able to shampoo every other day, extending the life.  I am still learning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love not having a plastic bottle to throw away.  The paper packaging feels old school to me.  I did get a soap saver for this soap and would recommend doing so while storing this away from water contact.  Here it is http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DZFA66/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My upper neck area under my hairline has what I feel are bumps, which I never noticed before.  But possibly my skin is still adjusting to clean life without SLS causing this?  Perhaps it will go away.  Don&#x27;t care as it is not a bother at all, but will monitor it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Giving it only 4 stars as I wish the bar were bigger, and that the bar would last longer</li>
            <li> great product!  husband and I both use it.  one bar lasts about 6 weeks.  I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair everyday</li>
            <li> I have very wavy hair, sometimes curly. This helps control the friz. My hair is soft and manageable. I shampoo with this bar about 3 times per week. I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair daily and I get good wave/curl definition. I use diluted Apple cider vinegar about once a week to condition after I shampoo. I style with a very small amount of gel diluted with water, scrunch my slightly damp shoulder length hair and go. (I have very thick hair that used to take forever to air dry. I noticed since I started using this product, my hair drys much more quickly. Not sure why, but I like it.) I will definitely repurchase, but not for a while because I think this little bar has a few months of use left.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo a few months ago. At first I wasn&#x27;t sure what I thought. I definitely liked the convenience of it and that it made my hair feel squeaky clean but wasn&#x27;t sure if my hair looked any better than when I used my regular shampoo. Then I switched back to my regular shampoo and did not like the way my hair came out at all. So I went back to Liggett Bar and have been using it ever since. I find with this bar shampoo I don&#x27;t even need to use conditioner and my hair looks great. Great product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product due to the minimal ingredients and packaging.  It doesn&#x27;t foam up like liquid shampoo, and it takes a while to work it in.  I comb it through my hair to distribute it evenly, but it&#x27;s always hard to tell if I&#x27;ve used enough due to its lack of lather.  After rinsing it off, my hair is so squeaky clean that I only need to wash it every other day (bonus!). So I&#x27;ll continue to buy this product; it makes a great travel item. BTW, I have long waist-length straight hair. **update** After using this product for 3 weeks, I&#x27;ve noticed that it leaves my hair stringy-looking, almost as if it&#x27;s oily, but it doesn&#x27;t feel oily.  It&#x27;s probably just product buildup.  I&#x27;ve had to alternate with regular liquid shampoo to bring it back looking normal.  Thus, I&#x27;m reducing my rating from 5 stars to 4.  Oh well...it was too good to be true.</li>
            <li> After reading mixed reviews about the product itself and use with hard water, I knew if I were going to try it I would have to commit to a few weeks before I gave up.  Well I&#x27;m happy to report that this product DOES work with hard water and it works well in general.  The first week was not too bad, but the second and third weeks of use were awful, my hair was stringy, and sticky.  But about week #4 my hair seemed to adjust and is soft and shiny now.  I do have very hard water and noticed that to get it to lather I have to rub it on my actual hair, not just in my hands.  It does wash out differently than a typical shampoo, and so I take an extra minute or so scrub it out in the shower by rubbing it between my hands, then when I get out I take an extra minute to rub it dry with a towel.  It&#x27;s sounds like work, but it&#x27;s not really once you get a routine down, and it&#x27;s a great natural product, that I&#x27;m excited to take on an upcoming trip.</li>
            <li> I read so much about this shampoo and I was super excited to try it. I love the smell and it leathers very nicely, BUT after several uses, I realized that I&#x27;m oozing ton of hair. I was shedding like never before, and I tell you, that was scary. After reading some comments and forums, I thought that increased shedding is normal while switching from liquid shampoo (natural, no sulfates, parabens, silicones,...) to a bar shampoo. However, one day I realized, that I lost so much hair, that my hair is visibly thinner and that the excessive shedding is not going away, so I stopped using it. After using my regular shampoo 2x, the shedding was back to normal levels and didn&#x27;t come back.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what caused it, and I&#x27;m disappointed that I didn&#x27;t have a good experience with this product like many others have. Maybe I&#x27;m allergic to one of the ingredients or something, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> i will order more when i run out.  i&#x27;ve been using another shampoo bar, but i like this the best.  it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair and gives it some body.  i like it because it does a good job of cleaning my hair- i have absolutely no complaints.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair and scalp fresh and squeaky clean without all the harsh chemicals. It&#x27;s a classic.</li>
            <li> Use it once a week on just my scalp. I have super curly hair and use Lisa Rachael Argon Oil Cleansing Conditioner the rest of the time. The combination of these 2 products has my hair looking beautiful, healthy and shiny! Loooove this shampoo bar! You will be amazed at how this lathers! It lasts a long time too!</li>
            <li> Wonderful.  My hair never felt so clean.</li>
            <li> I had to restrain myself from writing a review after my first use because I loved the results so much. So now, after three uses, I&#x27;m positive that my results will always be this fantastic. I have very oily skin, and therefore, oily hair. I used to wash my hair everyday (I know, I know...that&#x27;s bad), and I stopped using conditioner at least 4 years ago. By day two after a wash, my hair was already oily. I&#x27;ve been trying to go the more natural route with my beauty products, so I decided to try this bar shampoo since it&#x27;s free of all the crap that commercial products have in them. I&#x27;m not high maintenance when it comes to my hair (thick-ish &amp; wavy), since it&#x27;s always up in a bun due to work, but I still want it to be looking great as I get older and not full of chemicals/preservatives, fillers. Anyway, I did a TON of research looking for a better alternative, and this bar shampoo had the highest rating. Many reviews I read said that their results were great, but there is a learning curve and it takes a week or so for your hair to adjust to the change, and there&#x27;s a waxy feeling after washing but it goes away after your hair dries. I didn&#x27;t have any of these issues, or any trouble learning how to use this at all. No waxy feeling (although my hair does feel squeaky clean after washing the soap out), I could easily brush it out while still wet with a natural bristle brush, and my hair just feels so clean. I usually wash my hair at night before going to sleep and just go to bed with it wet. Usually I wake up with wavy hair but no real body...when I woke up and saw my hair after trying this, I couldn&#x27;t believe how incredibly wavy it was (even a few little curls), and so much body...and I didn&#x27;t use a conditioner or any vinegar rinse (another suggestion from reviews I read). I was able to go three days without my hair looking/getting oily before another wash. I am so pleased, and it is really easy to use. I just rub the bar on my head and down the rest of my hair, and then lather up, massage into my scalp, and rinse out. I&#x27;m never going back to regular shampoo, this stuff is amazing. I realize that everyone&#x27;s experience is different, but this was mine...and it was great.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> Another product I bought following suggestions from other pilgrims that did the Camino de Santiago. They&#x27;re little, and if you don&#x27;t take good care of them (storing them in a dry metal box, for example), they vanish in few days. So, use it for what it was designed to do, as a shampoo, then dry and store. Smells good and does a good work on washing your hair.</li>
            <li> Great, simple ingredients, and deals with dandruff.  Never had an oily hair transition period and my head isn&#x27;t itchy from my dandruff either! It is smaller than I expected, but a bar will last a long time. Just keep it somewhere to dry everyday so it lasts longer.</li>
            <li> yeah me :) was surprised how quickly it came.. love this soap!! i had brittle, burnt hair and using this soap for 2 months made it baby soft..</li>
            <li> I have tried the Tea Tree Oil bar and the Ultra Balanced bar. This is my favorite one! It lathers so amazingly. Smells so light and clean. Leaves hair slightly conditioned. Works great on all hair types. Everyone in my household uses it. My Dad and even my 83 yr old Grandma now love and use this shampoo bar!! I will never use anything else!! Thank you J.R. Liggett for making such an awesome NATURAL product!!!</li>
            <li> Very good product.  Lathers easily.  I&#x27;ve tried other shampoo bars, and I really like this one.  I have thick, dry, curly hair, and it is working very well for me.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic deal&lt;br /&gt;Deliver the shipment on time&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking forward to cooperate with you again&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been traveling a lot and hate using \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; soaps at hotels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took this with me to Barcelona and it lasted me a week! It felt great. I felt clean. And my hair looked awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely stocking up on this for all my travels :-)</li>
            <li> Years ago I tried a bar shampoo and wasn&#x27;t really pleased with the results.  I decided that I would give the bar shampoo idea another chance and went looking for something to try.  I went for the J.R. Liggett shampoo and I&#x27;m very happy with the results.  It really cleans and rinses wonderfully.  And there&#x27;s just something fun about sudsing up by wiping a bar of shampoo soap all over your head.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo… love how it cleans my hair… love how I&#x27;m not using any plastic… love everything about it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Simple, long lasting, and gentle on my hair. I can use it every day / every other day with no need for conditioner and no dry scalp / dandruff. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not &amp;#34;into&amp;#34; hair but I like it - works for me.</li>
            <li> J.R. Liggetts is a great shampoo bar. I have thick, dark hair that gets oily fast. This bar dried it out nicely without making it too dry and made my hair curl more than it ever has before--a plus, since my hair always used to hang limp and straight. It lasts a long time (I&#x27;ve used it intermittently since June)and lathers on easily. It does not take much to get your hair clean. I use it to supplement my routine of baking soda and vinegar in my hair. It smells great, and I am anxious to try the peppermint and other flavored kinds. If you find it dries your hair out too much, try spritzing your hair moderately thoroughly with a mixture of 75% vinegar and 25% water after you use it. If you wash this out completely, you won&#x27;t smell, and it will help retain your hair&#x27;s natural pH.</li>
            <li> Love how simple it is and how .clean and soft it leaves my hair</li>
            <li> Way over-rated. There&#x27;s better product out there.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel too greasy</li>
            <li> Bought originally for the convenience during a camping trip... ended up loving it so much I doubt I&#x27;ll ever go back to regular shampoo and conditioner.  Smells nice, lathers beautifully, long lasting, leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Used daily during extended travel and continued when we arrived home. My long hair was easily managed without all the extra conditioners, mousse and sprays.</li>
            <li> So far, so good. I have used the shampoo bar about 5 times and it has worked well. Lathers up beautifully too. I plan to use it in my carry-on luggage instead of another liquid to claim.</li>
            <li> This is a great item.  I was looking for something natural since I had been reading about so many women doing the &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; experiment.  I wasn&#x27;t quite ready to go that route so I chose to go with a natural shampoo.  I really like this shampoo.  It doesn&#x27;t strip out my hair, it doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling dry, it doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling like it is brittle.  My hair is easier to control (I have naturally curly hair) and I use much less hair styling product.  I would recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Mild fragrance and lots of lather!  Really cleans my hair squeaky clean but with fine hair it leaves tangles even if I use a apple cider vinegar rinse.  I do need conditioner.  Most commercial shampoos bother my scalp but this is wonderfully mild while being strong enough to remove hair spray easily.  I don&#x27;t use daily as I think it is a bit pricey.  I purchased a soap case but if left in the shower it gets a bit gooey from humidity so I keep it outside of the shower and it&#x27;s just great.  The little bar was a surprise but it really lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Great product, have been 3 months shampoo free now thanks to this bar and my hair looks and feels great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m doing the whole &amp;#34;shampoo free&amp;#34; thing. I&#x27;ve been washing my hair with 1tbsp of baking soda dissolved in 1 c of water, rinsing, then finishing with 1tbs apple cider vinegar in 1c water. It definitely works in terms of removing oil and making hair shiny...however, I like it when my hair has a nice scent...so I saw this soap and decided to try it. It lathers great, and has a really pleasant scent. We have hard water so I rinsed with some baking soda dissolved in water to take out the gummy feeling soap leaves, then did my usual apple cider vin rinse. I like this soap very much and would use it when I need extra refreshment and bounce!</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and my scalp NEVER itches any more. The feel after rinsing takes some getting used to but I don&#x27;t plan on going back to the chemical goo that is shampoo.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers note that this product doesn&#x27;t lather - actually, it lathers beautifully. But, unlike a bottle shampoo, you can&#x27;t put some in your hand and then put it on your hair. Just rub the bar on directly. It will lather up, trust me. Your scalp will never be cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liggetts - apply directly to head.</li>
            <li> Little smaller than I thought, bit works well as advertised. A</li>
            <li> Hair feels super dry and the scent wasn&#x27;t listed but FYI it&#x27;s rose and it&#x27;s not a pleasant rose but horribly nauseating . I wish I would have known there were other types of this bar I would have gotten one for dry hair as this one isn&#x27;t great .</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. The first time I used it my hair was as soft as it&#x27;s ever been. I switched away from normal shampoo 4 months ago and was using a Baking Soda / ACV process on my hair, but my hair never truly felt great. After using baking soda, my hair would feel kind of waxy and weird.. my hair dried after using this shampoo bar- and it was softer than it EVER felt on regular shampoo, baking soda or anything else. I didn&#x27;t even use conditioner. I love this stuff - so easy to use, great results. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I love this bar for my fine hair.  It feels fluffy and full after shampooing.  Also, the company Nutriticity, accidentally sent 1 wrong bar which they replaced immediately.</li>
            <li> Bar soap is always a lot of fun to use. This one happens to lather very easily. Rub it into your hands or straight into your hair. It goes into hair very smoothly. After rinsing off it has different feel than typical shampoos. At first it seems like their is slightly sticky oil in your hair, but it goes away after a minute or so. Also, unlike other shampoos it does not leave your hair feeling dry and rough. After you dry your hair you can feel and see that it retains moisture and has what feels like natural oils in your hair. I don&#x27;t have very naturally oil hair, my hair is typically wavy and dry, so for me it is great. When I use this, I don&#x27;t need conditioner.</li>
            <li> So far so good; I&#x27;ve washed 3x with this and I really like it.  My hair is clean, shiny, with no tangles.</li>
            <li> This soap is great. I like the way it makes my hair feel. 😃</li>
            <li> Best shampoo.  My whole family loves it.  Take the bar and rub it in your hair to get more &amp;#34;bubbles&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> wish I would have found this years ago before spending a fortune on salon products. Lather is rich and I love it!</li>
            <li> I gave this a star because it&#x27;s so ECO FRIENDLY (reduces plastic shampoo bottles going into landfills!) and because of the GREAT PRICE ($1.76 /ounce).  My hair is long, medium thick, dry &amp; color-treated. Sadly, this shampoo left my hair DRY &amp; TANGLED, yet my scalp OILY. I now use Lush solid shampoo ([...]) which is more pricey ($2.80-$6.30 / ounce) but still eco friendly and it works really well. If Liggett&#x27;s formula is changed, I&#x27;d be willing to try it again.</li>
            <li> I have contact dermatitis and have not been able to find a commercial shampoo that doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itch. With the basic ingredients in Liggett&#x27;s this shampoo works for me. My hair is a little bit dryer with this soap shampoo as I&#x27;ve also not found a usable conditioner either. Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this wonderful old-fashioned formula. Don&#x27;t be afraid of the word soap, it is more like a shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo bar, I have been using it for years. My normally oily hair only needs to be washed 2 times per week, and I don&#x27;t even have to use conditioner. The only issue I have with this product, which does not speak to its quality, is that I go through a bar much faster than the manufacturer claims. I probably end up using 8 bars per year, and I have mid length hair.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a year now, and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and fine hair, and I was looking for a natural product that I could use as shampoo and as body wash. I tried other bar shampoos (too drying), Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Baby Mild (too harsh for hair), LUSH soaps (full of chemicals and too much scent), and even tried going without shampoo (no &#x27;poo - didn&#x27;t work for me). I stumbled upon this, and even though I&#x27;d seen it in my local natural food store, hadn&#x27;t tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fit the bill pretty much to a T! It has a very light scent that is barely detectable, but pleasant and natural. (Yes, it has some lye in it, but that&#x27;s an essential part of soapmaking. Some soaps don&#x27;t list that they contain it, because it dissipates during the soapmaking process, but it is an ingredient even in natural soaps.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am able to use it from head to toe without skin irritation, and it leaves my fine hair clean and manageable! In fact, it seems to have more body than it used to. I use a tiny amount of leave-in conditioner in the winter, but from May to October, this is my only product. Bonus is that my summer travels are made simpler since I don&#x27;t have liquids in my carry on.</li>
