    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is a generous size for the price of an excellent, excellent product.</li>
            <li>This souffle-gel is one of the best products I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>I am so happy I found this stuff!!!</li>
            <li>Best product for my curls and it smells divine.</li>
            <li>My curls are still beautiful and it is now Tuesday.</li>
            <li>Thats six days of beautiful wash and go hair.</li>
            <li>so the smell of this product IMO is great.</li>
            <li>I still think it&#x27;s a great product and one others may want to consider.</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m beyond happy.</li>
            <li>Excellent conditions, excellent product, I am very satisfied 5 stars :)</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have any toxic artificials in it, (including fragrance!) smells great, and has a pleasant, silk texture.</li>
            <li>I like this product but it leaves my hair with a &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; feeling, makes me wanna wash my hands all the time after manipulating my hair, good curl definition though</li>
            <li>From my experience, this product is also good for relaxed hair types and/or those who must wash (shampoo and condition)their hair every day</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be looking for miracles, but it is really good at highlighting the parts of your frizzy, curly hair that you love.</li>
            <li>my hair has not seen this kind of curl definition since i was a kid and pre-relaxer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of sticky but it works well for me.</li>
            <li>This product is wonderfully effective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the product on its own</li>
            <li>This product is full of great stuff.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have alcohol in it, and smells nice, too.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the texture.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love Shea Moisture Products.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad.</li>
            <li>I love coconut</li>
            <li>I find them more on the floor than I do in my hair</li>
            <li>I would buy again at a lower price &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>This made the color and everything look so much better and a healthier feel to it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s $2 more, but for me it&#x27;s over my budget for beauty items.</li>
            <li>This product would be a staple if it wasn&#x27;t so sticky and if it was more affordable for my budget.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my favorite product to use</li>
            <li>The Curl Enhancer Smoothie is WAY better.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s probably better for colder months.</li>
            <li>This gel is magic.</li>
            <li>It is not chemical laden (which I love).</li>
            <li>The more that I use this with my wash and go&#x27;s, the more coils show up.</li>
            <li>For my hair type I haven&#x27;t found anything better.</li>
            <li>and Iâ€™m glad that I did.  </li>
            <li>I usually love Shea Moisture&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>Its nice when you first try it on</li>
            <li>This is also a great volumizer, but moderately so, which works well for my hair.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It is not a curl enhancer (if you are looking for one try kinky curly curling custard), but it is a fantastic moisturizer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I smells a bit sweet.</li>
            <li>This is a good product, but if you don&#x27;t use it moderately, it leaves your hair sticky and gives it a build up type feel.</li>
            <li>I live in a very humid and hot climate, so this product is well-tested and holds up in most challenging conditions.</li>
            <li>:) I&#x27;m just surprised that even my ponytail has 360 waves</li>
            <li>I coat her hair in this souffl&amp;eacute;, which is more like a cross between oil and gel--works great on wet hair and seals the curl, protecting the cuticle from frizziness.</li>
            <li>Not only will it moisturize the hair but it acts as a nice finisher to avoid the crunch that stylers and gels often provide.</li>
            <li>I use it daily, loving it</li>
            <li>It actually moisturizers (for me) better than their curl pudding or whatever it is.</li>
            <li>I use Soft Sheen Care Free Curl Gold in the goldish orange bottle.  </li>
            <li>If you have in between hair---not straight but too fine &amp;amp; unruly for braids or natural afros---these products are a MUST!</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to use much at a time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of the shea moisture products and they do absolutely nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m using too much</li>
            <li>Too much of this product will leave my hair sticky.</li>
            <li>The product blended well into my hair and left it pleasantly smooth.</li>
            <li>I was first exposed to this from my new stylist.</li>
            <li>The consistency is similar to Jello before it has had a chance to fully set (this contains flax seed if you&#x27;re familiar with that type of consistency).</li>
            <li>It is extremely moisturizing due to the high glycerin content and it gives me great shine.</li>
            <li>The best part is that her hair is soft and shiny--not sticky or hard like other cheaper products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried ors curl pudding, and I&#x27;ve tried the curls line, and my steady go to was eco styler gel, but nothing has given me hair like this.</li>
            <li>I put some of this product, with water, coconut oil, some glycerin, a few drops of hydrolyzed silk protein, and some of the shea moisture spray product (can&#x27;t remember the name) to make a mixture that is better than any of the ingredients alone.</li>
            <li>It has a sweet coconut fragrance that does not linger long.</li>
            <li>Plus side, this stuff works better than plain flaxseed and aloe vera gel, and I&#x27;ve tried both before as moisturizers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only thing that kind of gets me is the little beads of idk gel?</li>
            <li>I get it at walmart (who now carries a bit more higher end natural hair care products at least where I live).  </li>
            <li>Gel works pretty well, but it leaves my hair sticky and messed up the following day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Shea Moisture products since they first came out (the Curl Enhancing Smoothie and Deep Conditioning Mask are  staple products for my 4a/b hair).</li>
            <li>I usually cowash my hair, apply my leave in and styler then put this on top.</li>
            <li>I use it to define pieces &amp; ringlets in the front and tame frizz and fluff in the back, and it does a great job.</li>
            <li>I have a mixed head of hair: The front is frizzy, dry, and kinky, and the back is more wavy and soft.</li>
            <li>No greasy or hardness of your hair either---it leaves your hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I spray my hair at night before I sleep, and my 4c hair is moisturized the whole next day.</li>
            <li>My hair was still ridiculously soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>My hair is still soft and moisturized with this method.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it also works wonders on my three year old&#x27;s hair as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, the curls are defined, and the frizz is gone.</li>
            <li>When I went natural in 12/11, I looked for products that (a) didn&#x27;t have any sulfates, phosphates, silicones, chemicals, etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I paid no heed to the negative reviews.</li>
            <li>You will be surprised to see that it works just as well as KCCC.</li>
            <li>I like soft touchable curls.</li>
            <li>The only thing I do not like about this product is that it is very oily.</li>
            <li>Finally, it passes the next-day test; My hair has a lot of volume but in a good way; it doesn&#x27;t look sloppy or frizzy.</li>
            <li>My hair is very thirsty, so the alternative is a dry crunchy feeling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have thick curly hair that gets frizzy easily.</li>
            <li>lol, unless you are suppose to smooth them out before applying that can get annoying but other than that it seems to work!</li>
            <li>Once I figured out that it was this product that was making my twists soft, I made it into a spray that I daily mist.</li>
            <li>but once it dries, it barely holds and gets flaky.</li>
            <li>I went natural, I also made a commitment that I was not going to become a product junkie, so I looked for products that met my needs without causing me to use a lot of extra.  </li>
            <li>I mix it in with other products to curl my hair so that I don&#x27;t have to use so much.</li>
            <li>In the past I tried Kinky Curly Curling Custard (which gave me great coily definition and shine but left my strands dry and broken in the end).</li>
            <li>Put to much of it in your hair and you will have a sticky mess.</li>
            <li>Mostly bad than good.</li>

            <li> and/or every other day regardless of if it is in its naturally curly or chemically relaxed state).</li>
            <li> My hair was soft and moisturized, and I took the style down 10 days later.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used similar products before and they left my hair so dry and brittle feeling.</li>
            <li> A few days later my hair was STILL unbelievably soft and</li>
            <li> This product defines my curls perfectly, especially due to the fact that it spreads so easily and isn&#x27;t as thick as the Curl Enhancing Smoothie.</li>
            <li> After six days my hair still looks shiny and defined (just a little fuzz) and Its been easy to style everyday with just minimal spritzing and one reapplication of a little bit of this gel to the edges.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just amazed at how soft, supple, and fluffy my hair is.</li>
            <li> Normally other Shea Moisture products go for 9.99 for the same size jars.</li>
            <li> extremely dry, no defined curl pattern to speak</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed that it does take my hair a bit longer to dry when I use this product.</li>
            <li> when i take the twist down i have springy, shiny, moisturized corkscrew spirals that last for almost a week...</li>
            <li> It does have the weight to give coils with shingling, but my hair ended up frizzy and far less defined once it dried.</li>
            <li> One with a looser curl pattern may find curl definition and hold with this product, but my results were a little different.</li>
            <li> I then use my gel (wetline extreme) and let air dry.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, these results don&#x27;t seem to last as much if you don&#x27;t use quite a bit of gel.</li>
            <li> it also doesn&#x27;t give hair that wet, crinkly look gel sometimes can.</li>
            <li> It works but you have to be careful not to slather it on like a lot of us</li>
            <li> Your hair will stay moist for days, just remoist and fluff in the morning with the activator...if needed.  </li>

            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit of this product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> USE THIS CAREFULLY!</li>
            <li> This is due to increased moisture.</li>
            <li> It also increased my shrinkage (in comparison to other gels).</li>
            <li> In fact, I find it easier to wet my hand and then grab a little out, rub it between my hands and add it to my hair in sections.</li>
            <li> My hair felt sticky, hard, and just gross.</li>
            <li> The only negative I have is the price.</li>

            <li> I use it on my 4 year old daughters very thick, tightly curled hair.</li>
            <li> I walked around with frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> Shea Moisture was one of the few companies</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in a tropical climate and this stuff is wayyy too heavy for me.</li>
            <li> However, it did not make may hair crunchy and hard like other gels.</li>
            <li> and this is soft on my very thin hair.</li>
            <li> and/or every other day at the least</li>
            <li> When I take my hair down, I&#x27;m done for at least a week.  </li>
            <li> usually pay about $10.00, so I will not be buying from Amazon today.</li>
            <li> She used it on my ultra thick coily AA hair.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love the smell and the texture. I have very curly hair and this is soft on my very thin hair.</li>
            <li> I like this product but it leaves my hair with a &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; feeling, makes me wanna wash my hands all the time after manipulating my hair, good curl definition though</li>
            <li> Love, love, love Shea Moisture Products. If you have in between hair---not straight but too fine &amp;amp; unruly for braids or natural afros---these products are a MUST! No greasy or hardness of your hair either---it leaves your hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> i have used this product before and every item that I purchased came tampered with when i received this item it too as open</li>
            <li> I have a mixed head of hair: The front is frizzy, dry, and kinky, and the back is more wavy and soft. It&#x27;s really difficult to style. Gel works pretty well, but it leaves my hair sticky and messed up the following day. I tried this stuff on a whim and I&#x27;m so glad. It doesn&#x27;t have any toxic artificials in it, (including fragrance!) smells great, and has a pleasant, silk texture. I use it to define pieces &amp; ringlets in the front and tame frizz and fluff in the back, and it does a great job. it also doesn&#x27;t give hair that wet, crinkly look gel sometimes can. This is also a great volumizer, but moderately so, which works well for my hair. Finally, it passes the next-day test; My hair has a lot of volume but in a good way; it doesn&#x27;t look sloppy or frizzy. This is a generous size for the price of an excellent, excellent product. Don&#x27;t be looking for miracles, but it is really good at highlighting the parts of your frizzy, curly hair that you love.</li>
            <li> I love coconut so the smell of this product IMO is great. The only thing that kind of gets me is the little beads of idk gel? I find them more on the floor than I do in my hair lol, unless you are suppose to smooth them out before applying that can get annoying but other than that it seems to work! I found this and the smoothie curl enhancer thing in a bogo sale and decided to buy them. I recommend both for reducing the frizz and softening the curls. I would buy again at a lower price &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I paid $13 this at Wal-mart for the same size. My hair is always dry and a lot of other products just dried it out even worst. This made the color and everything look so much better and a healthier feel to it.</li>
            <li> This souffle-gel is one of the best products I have ever tried. It hydrates the curls for several days, which makes easier to style.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic. It actually moisturizers (for me) better than their curl pudding or whatever it is. Once I figured out that it was this product that was making my twists soft, I made it into a spray that I daily mist. I put some of this product, with water, coconut oil, some glycerin, a few drops of hydrolyzed silk protein, and some of the shea moisture spray product (can&#x27;t remember the name) to make a mixture that is better than any of the ingredients alone. I spray my hair at night before I sleep, and my 4c hair is moisturized the whole next day. Thank you, shea moisture.</li>
            <li> I was first exposed to this from my new stylist. She used it on my ultra thick coily AA hair. She taught me to use just a tiny bit to avoid build up. My hair was soft and moisturized, and I took the style down 10 days later. My hair was still ridiculously soft and moisturized. A few days later my hair was STILL unbelievably soft and moisturized!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it myself while twisting. I section hair, use some water, a leave in cream, coconut oil, then a tiny bit of this gel. My hair is still soft and moisturized with this method. I&#x27;m just amazed at how soft, supple, and fluffy my hair is. Unfortunately, these results don&#x27;t seem to last as much if you don&#x27;t use quite a bit of gel. It is a thin line between moisturizing and sticky when using this product. Plus side, this stuff works better than plain flaxseed and aloe vera gel, and I&#x27;ve tried both before as moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I smells a bit sweet. The consistency is thin and runny, just like homemade flaxseed or aloe vera gel. The only negative I have is the price. It&#x27;s 11.99 retail in all brick and mortar stores. Normally other Shea Moisture products go for 9.99 for the same size jars. I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s $2 more, but for me it&#x27;s over my budget for beauty items. This product would be a staple if it wasn&#x27;t so sticky and if it was more affordable for my budget. I still think it&#x27;s a great product and one others may want to consider.</li>
            <li> Some people may think this is to thick but hey everybody hair is different. :) I&#x27;m just surprised that even my ponytail has 360 waves lol.</li>
            <li> This product defines my curls perfectly, especially due to the fact that it spreads so easily and isn&#x27;t as thick as the Curl Enhancing Smoothie. However, what I absolutely HATE about this gel is that it is SOOOOO OILY AND SOOOO STICKY. If you touch your hair, your hands will be sticky. If the product is on your face or neck, those areas will be sticky and oily.&lt;br /&gt;So in a way the Curling SoufflÃ© is a step up from the Smoothie, but it can also be a step down...</li>
            <li> i have thick 4c natural hair. extremely dry, no defined curl pattern to speak of.&lt;br /&gt;i thought it was impossible for my hair to retain moisture until i found this. i wash my hair with the shea moisture co-wash, condition with olive and argan oil, then proceed to twisting my hair with this gel. when i take the twist down i have springy, shiny, moisturized corkscrew spirals that last for almost a week...my hair has not seen this kind of curl definition since i was a kid and pre-relaxer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it also works wonders on my three year old&#x27;s hair as well. and while you can definitely feel the product in your hair if you touch it, somehow there is no build up. its doesn&#x27;t need to be applied every day.  this has been a game changer for my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Shea Moisture products since they first came out (the Curl Enhancing Smoothie and Deep Conditioning Mask are  staple products for my 4a/b hair). Unfortunately this Curling Souffle was terrible! My hair felt sticky, hard, and just gross. Lesson learned!</li>
            <li> USE THIS CAREFULLY! It works but you have to be careful not to slather it on like a lot of us curl girls do with some products. A little goes a long way. In fact, I find it easier to wet my hand and then grab a little out, rub it between my hands and add it to my hair in sections. It&#x27;s kind of sticky but it works well for me. I&#x27;ve used similar products before and they left my hair so dry and brittle feeling. It&#x27;s not my favorite product to use but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, but if you don&#x27;t use it moderately, it leaves your hair sticky and gives it a build up type feel. It&#x27;s also at Target or Walgreens for $10.00 instead of this $20 they are trying to charge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Caucasian and have curly, thick, frizzy, coarse hair. After three decades, I&#x27;ve finally found a product that works! I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have alcohol in it, and smells nice, too. Along with the coconut and hibiscus shampoo and conditioner, it has totally transformed my hair. It&#x27;s soft, the curls are defined, and the frizz is gone. I don&#x27;t need to use much at a time. And it&#x27;s affordable, too!  I am so happy I found this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> The coconut smell is unbearable</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews about this product. Mostly bad than good. Regardless I went ahead and decided to get the product for myself. Its nice when you first try it on but once it dries, it barely holds and gets flaky. The Curl Enhancer Smoothie is WAY better. I even use it as my leave-in after I shampoo. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Although this product is pricier on Amazon than at Target, sometimes it&#x27;s out of stock in the stores, so Amazon is my back-up. This product is wonderfully effective. I use it on my 4 year old daughters very thick, tightly curled hair. I coat her hair in this souffl&amp;eacute;, which is more like a cross between oil and gel--works great on wet hair and seals the curl, protecting the cuticle from frizziness. I live in a very humid and hot climate, so this product is well-tested and holds up in most challenging conditions. The best part is that her hair is soft and shiny--not sticky or hard like other cheaper products.</li>
            <li> This product is the only styling product that I use.  When I went natural in 12/11, I looked for products that (a) didn&#x27;t have any sulfates, phosphates, silicones, chemicals, etc. and (b) were produced by black-owned companies who only made products that met my criteria.  Shea Moisture was one of the few companies that fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I went natural, I also made a commitment that I was not going to become a product junkie, so I looked for products that met my needs without causing me to use a lot of extra.  For styling, the curling souffle is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shingle my hair to work the product through after a was/co-wash, and I twist it or stretch it.  Voila! When I take my hair down, I&#x27;m done for at least a week.  I shower without a shower cap or spritz my hair with water, and my hair stays moist and my coils stay defined.  I am heavy-handed with this product, however.  I actually like the feeling of extra product in my hair.  My hair is very thirsty, so the alternative is a dry crunchy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually pay about $10.00, so I will not be buying from Amazon today.</li>
            <li> I love it! tried it by mistake because i did a trip to the islands and costumes throw all my bottles away and a friend let me tried it.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It is not a curl enhancer (if you are looking for one try kinky curly curling custard), but it is a fantastic moisturizer. I like to use it on wash days. I usually cowash my hair, apply my leave in and styler then put this on top. Not only will it moisturize the hair but it acts as a nice finisher to avoid the crunch that stylers and gels often provide.</li>
            <li> Smell like coconut and works for my hair.</li>
            <li> This product is full of great stuff. And it&#x27;s probably better for colder months. I&#x27;m in a tropical climate and this stuff is wayyy too heavy for me. My scalp can&#x27;t breathe. I used it for a twist out on my 4a hair and it didn&#x27;t hold the curl at all. Perhaps its too humid here. But it didn&#x27;t stand a chance. Not a fan. Also left a caked feeling on my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of the shea moisture products and they do absolutely nothing for my hair. I decided to give it one last try and I&#x27;m very glad I did. This gel is magic. I washed my hair Wednesday put coconut oil on it and topped it with this gel. My curls are still beautiful and it is now Tuesday. Thats six days of beautiful wash and go hair. I&#x27;m truly amazed. I&#x27;m glad I paid no heed to the negative reviews. This stuff is way overpriced on Amazon. I get it at walmart (who now carries a bit more higher end natural hair care products at least where I live).  I&#x27;ve tried ors curl pudding, and I&#x27;ve tried the curls line, and my steady go to was eco styler gel, but nothing has given me hair like this. I&#x27;m hooked and already thinking of stock piling in case it goes away. After six days my hair still looks shiny and defined (just a little fuzz) and Its been easy to style everyday with just minimal spritzing and one reapplication of a little bit of this gel to the edges. I&#x27;m beyond happy. If you are into hair typing I would say I&#x27;m 4a.   ETA: I stand behind this review but there is one thing that annoys me about this stuff. It leaves a nasty residue on your hair. If you touch your hair it will leave your hands nasty. Maybe I&#x27;m using too much but this bugs me a lot so I&#x27;m going to go back to using eco styler.</li>
            <li> Hair type: 4c (natural)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair density: thin-med.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair diameter: fine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**This is based on summer month usage. I&#x27;ve heard the winter months can bring different results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This worked well for me. In the past I tried Kinky Curly Curling Custard (which gave me great coily definition and shine but left my strands dry and broken in the end). This was my next venture. It is extremely moisturizing due to the high glycerin content and it gives me great shine. It is not chemical laden (which I love). It has a sweet coconut fragrance that does not linger long. The consistency is similar to Jello before it has had a chance to fully set (this contains flax seed if you&#x27;re familiar with that type of consistency). Too much of this product will leave my hair sticky. I&#x27;ve also noticed that it does take my hair a bit longer to dry when I use this product. It does give hold but it does not truly define my coils. The more that I use this with my wash and go&#x27;s, the more coils show up. This is due to increased moisture. One with a looser curl pattern may find curl definition and hold with this product, but my results were a little different. It does have the weight to give coils with shingling, but my hair ended up frizzy and far less defined once it dried. It also increased my shrinkage (in comparison to other gels). For my hair type I haven&#x27;t found anything better. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I finally figured out how to get rid of that sticky feeling.  After your cowash. leave in your leave in.  Mix the souffle with your curl activator.  I use Soft Sheen Care Free Curl Gold in the goldish orange bottle.  Mix well.  The two products work well together without  any white residue.  I then use my gel (wetline extreme) and let air dry.  Your hair will stay moist for days, just remoist and fluff in the morning with the activator...if needed.  What you dont use put in another jar, or just put back in the souffle.  You will be surprised to see that it works just as well as KCCC.</li>
            <li> I use it daily, loving it</li>
            <li> Best product for my curls and it smells divine.</li>
            <li> If you use this product add a leave-in or anything else that softens the hair. I&#x27;ve used the product on its own and I hate the texture of my hair after it dries. It&#x27;s tough. It feels rougher. I don&#x27;t like it at all. I like soft touchable curls.</li>
            <li> I use this Shea Moisture Organic Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Curling Souffle (contains Agave Nectar &amp; Flax Seed Oil) as a hair moisturizing agent (combined with the Cr&amp;egrave;me of Nature Argan Oil Styke &amp; Shine Foaming Mousse). I spotted this product at my Walmart job and decided to take a chance with it after noticing the listing that it was for thick curly hair. I planned on relaxing my hair that week and decided to take a chance with purchasing this product and Iâ€™m glad that I did.  I applied The Shea Moisture Organic Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Curling Souffle in my hair after I was done shampooing and conditioning my hair. The product blended well into my hair and left it pleasantly smooth. From my experience, this product is also good for relaxed hair types and/or those who must wash (shampoo and condition)their hair every day and/or every other day at the least (I happen to have hair that must be washed daily and/or every other day regardless of if it is in its naturally curly or chemically relaxed state).</li>
            <li> I usually love Shea Moisture&#x27;s products. This flaxseed gel did not work for me. A little bit of this product goes a long way. Put to much of it in your hair and you will have a sticky mess. It didn&#x27;t define any of my curls. I walked around with frizzy mess. However, it did not make may hair crunchy and hard like other gels.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair that gets frizzy easily. The only thing I do not like about this product is that it is very oily. I mix it in with other products to curl my hair so that I don&#x27;t have to use so much.</li>
            <li> Excellent conditions, excellent product, I am very satisfied 5 stars :)</li>
