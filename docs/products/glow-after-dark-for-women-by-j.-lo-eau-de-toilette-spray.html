            <li>and i love it thanks so much</li>
            <li>I have always loved Glow After Dark.</li>
            <li>I purchased the original Glow by JLo a few months ago and loved it so much I decided to try another one of her perfumes</li>
            <li>Super fast Shipping.  </li>
            <li>I very much recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Based on all of the reviews claiming this product was a knock-off, I was pretty worried...</li>
            <li>I think the JGlo has a much better smell for me and will order that next time.</li>
            <li>My lost for not reading the reviews first.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>First time I wore this scent was when I went to Las Vegas.</li>
            <li>It was shipped fast and came right on time.</li>
            <li>unable to find it i decided to look on Amazon, Boy i was so glad i found it!!!</li>
            <li>Thanks you very much.</li>
            <li>and everyone noteses I get complimented all the time and the bottle lasts a long time: )</li>
            <li>I have always luved this scent and will continue to buy it as long as it&#x27;s available!</li>
            <li>I think that it is very Manly.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend kept talking and talking about this perfume and how much she wanted it.</li>
            <li>and she didn&#x27;t really like it either.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Glow after dark Was one of my favorite perfumes by JLo until I bought it on this site.</li>
            <li>After Dark and absolutely love this as well.</li>
            <li>Not a big fan of this one ,it&#x27;s a little manly scented ,I love the original JO perfume a lot .</li>
            <li>so glad Amazon has it because you cant find it in any other stores!</li>
            <li>The obvious mix of earthy and floral is wonderfully deep, seductive, feminine and sexy scent, without being overpowering or \\&quot;cologne-y\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>This new bottle was the same, except for one part which i don&#x27;t think was relevant, and was different because it&#x27;s a newer bottle.</li>
            <li>I read several reviews stating this perfume was masculine, and read other reviews that love this fragrance by JLo.</li>
            <li>Except for the &amp;#34;glow line&amp;#34; which all have similar notes, but different main notes, all her other perfumes are very unique.</li>
            <li>Purchased this for my wife for Christmas - she loves it and so do I - especially on her - thanks J Lo</li>
            <li>Smells like old lady perfume.</li>
            <li>The old bottle had clear spot on the bottle where u could see into the bottle.</li>
            <li>Such a sweet sexy scent I never get tired of smelling it!</li>
            <li>Im paying same price for the large as I was for the smaller one.</li>
            <li>When J. Lo Glo was discontinued in stores I was crushed :(...then here it was on Amazon..soooo happy!!!</li>
            <li>Never gets old, stays on for several hours and is a great/sultry evening scent.</li>
            <li>Top notes of mandarin, white cherry and passion fruit; a heart of jasmine, peony, rose and orange flower and a base of pink musk, tree moss, blonde woods and patchouli.     </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too strong, yet not too weak.</li>

            <li> Not happy and won&#x27;t purchase any more perfumes through Amazon, I believe they are imitations and not original.</li>
            <li> Key thing about perfumes is lighter perfumes last longest, darker colored perfumes last less.</li>
            <li> I have made it to my 2nd bottle of Glow after Dark and I just cant get enough of it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay long</li>
            <li> I do sometimes wear other scents but always go back to this.</li>
            <li> It stays on all night long!</li>
            <li> It smelled sour  so like the lotion did not want to go through the hassle of sending it back</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend THIS one, Deseo, Forever Glowing (only at kohl&#x27;s unfortunately), and probably Live.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend always tries to cuddle close when I wear it.</li>
            <li> This one is &amp;#34;musky&amp;#34; which I&#x27;m not really into.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would smell like the other glow&#x27; perfumes.</li>
            <li> I live in Canada and it retails over 70$ and is tough to find.</li>
            <li> Not sure what was up with the other reviewers products, but I&#x27;ve been wearing both Glow and Glow After Dark for about 10 years and know I got the actual perfume.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for J.LO Glow After Dark for months.</li>
            <li> I usually switch up my scents regularly but think this will become a commonly repeated scent.</li>
            <li> Would prefer it if it is a little bit stronger</li>
            <li> Yes, the scent did last that long without going bad.</li>
            <li> I bought a couple of bottles just in case you don&#x27;t sell it no more</li>
            <li> Ordered in the past, one of my favs.</li>
            <li> , it was a big disappointment, I passed it on to my mom - (55)</li>
            <li> is shocking as he passed other fibula.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells awful, can&#x27;t describe the scent.</li>

            <li> Me encanta el perfume... En cuanto a la entrega excelente servicio.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of my favorite perfumes. I get SO many compliments when I wear it. It isn&#x27;t too strong, yet not too weak. Gives a nice clean smell and the bottle looks pretty cool. My boyfriend always tries to cuddle close when I wear it. A must buy! A++</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my wife for Christmas - she loves it and so do I - especially on her - thanks J Lo</li>
            <li> I have this perfume &amp; it smells like cologne. For a second I thought maybe I got it mixed up and it was for a man, but then I realized that it wasn&#x27;t. I might give this to my boyfriend to wear.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume it&#x27;s the best and u can&#x27;t get In stores I love it Cuz it&#x27;s that perfume that stays on u all day and everyone noteses I get complimented all the time and the bottle lasts a long time: )</li>
            <li> U will love this perfume. ..it&#x27;s one that I have to keep around,  some perfumes, after you have used them up, You might and might not buy...this one you will....</li>
            <li> Not a big fan of this one ,it&#x27;s a little manly scented ,I love the original JO perfume a lot .</li>
            <li> I really liked this perfume the first time I smelled it. It smells really clean and fresh, not to mention sexy! I think it&#x27;s perfect for a night out on the town, but also can be worn anywhere. It&#x27;s a very nice fragrance and I&#x27;m happy I bought it. When I have it on I get people asking me what I&#x27;m wearing!</li>
            <li> Love this scent. I live in Canada and it retails over 70$ and is tough to find. Great deal!</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this for 7+ years and still get so many compliments! I do sometimes wear other scents but always go back to this. This is my signature scent for sure! I wear it for any occasion! Going out on the town or just hanging out with friends/ family. I do not see it in stores anymore so I always buy it through amazon which has it for a great price! People always want to know what I am wearing! It stays on all night long! Sometimes I respray for a quick refresher but that&#x27;s just me !</li>
            <li> I love this scent. I did not purchase it from Amazon but I will from now on, probably. I get compliments on it daily. I usually switch up my scents regularly but think this will become a commonly repeated scent. If ever I had a signature scent, I think this would be it.     I figured since the website did not give a description of the smell, I would add a description I found on fragrancex.com:   ** Top notes of mandarin, white cherry and passion fruit; a heart of jasmine, peony, rose and orange flower and a base of pink musk, tree moss, blonde woods and patchouli.     The obvious mix of earthy and floral is wonderfully deep, seductive, feminine and sexy scent, without being overpowering or \\&quot;cologne-y\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> When J. Lo Glo was discontinued in stores I was crushed :(...then here it was on Amazon..soooo happy!!! GREAT PRICE, Im paying same price for the large as I was for the smaller one. Happy camper right here;)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually buy cheat perfume but this one is very good I love the smell and it last long. I will recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> I have been looking for J.LO Glow After Dark for months. unable to find it i decided to look on Amazon, Boy i was so glad i found it!!! I use it all the time at work and when ever i go out... totally love it</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this perfume, I had some as a teenager, and when it was gone, I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores. It smells just like I remember!</li>
            <li> This smells very nice and i also love the body shimmer lotion you can buy in this perfume. Love it!!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this scent and I love it on her. She has bought several bottles since it came out. Very nice</li>
            <li> the best perfume ever</li>
            <li> Based on all of the reviews claiming this product was a knock-off, I was pretty worried... I even tried to cancel my order within 5 minutes of placing it (wasn&#x27;t able to).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product I received was NOT a knock-off.  Not sure what was up with the other reviewers products, but I&#x27;ve been wearing both Glow and Glow After Dark for about 10 years and know I got the actual perfume.</li>
            <li> This is the only perfume that I like on myself! I always buy this brand and Im so glad Amazon has it because you cant find it in any other stores!</li>
            <li> this is the best perfume ever everyone men and women absolutely love it I bought a couple of bottles just in case you don&#x27;t sell it no more gotta get it you regret it if you don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I read several reviews stating this perfume was masculine, and read other reviews that love this fragrance by JLo. I think that it is very Manly. Even my husband asked me why I smelt like Cologne. Lol! It smells like a popular  Cologne; Tommy, Polo, or Hugo, etc. ??? I can&#x27;t quite identify which brand, but definitely is a man&#x27;s fragrance.</li>
            <li> Smells like gramma&#x27;s cluttered house</li>
            <li> I just happen to love this fragrance.  It was given to me as a gift last year and I just ran out .  I found the price to be competitive and the product arrived in a most timely fashion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complaints what so ever.  I would recommend</li>
            <li> I have made it to my 2nd bottle of Glow after Dark and I just cant get enough of it. It is great for a night out. I would def. recommend this. It is very sweet but I never fail to get a compliment!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and value.&lt;br /&gt;Totally was received as described.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with purchase.&lt;br /&gt;The Totally Shipping was fast and in excellent condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aroma of this fragrance I love. Lasts longer than 8 hours and is always imbued with your clothing.&lt;br /&gt;Personally I like strong fragrances or aroma is shocking as he passed other fibula.&lt;br /&gt;There will always be someone asking for that fraganacia ..&lt;br /&gt;Excellent Purchase</li>
            <li> Most deliveries I get either smoosh the box and it dose not look like I just bought the item this was better</li>
            <li> Still one of my favorite smells. Never gets old, stays on for several hours and is a great/sultry evening scent. My fiancé loves when I wear it!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend kept talking and talking about this perfume and how much she wanted it. So I ordered it and she already wears it constantly and I don&#x27;t mind being around it.</li>
            <li> The wife likes and it smells good.</li>
            <li> i just wanted to try something different and this is ok, it is not one of my favorites of hers</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance! I was so glad that I found it on Amazon and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I love the &amp;#34;Miami&amp;#34; and original version of this perfume. This one is &amp;#34;musky&amp;#34; which I&#x27;m not really into.</li>
            <li> I love this. It smells like the beach!&lt;br /&gt;Clean...very nice.&lt;br /&gt;One of my favs</li>
            <li> Got it for my mom! She loves it and delivery was quick!</li>
            <li> aun estoy en espera de este producto por favor enviarlo a la nueva dirección de liberty express  MEDLEY FLORIDA 33178-1044**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;mil gracias</li>
            <li> I am taken pleasure by the product acquired in his shop. Thank you for the sending until Friday it was that receipt the product in my hands and I am very satisfied thank you.</li>
            <li> just what I was expecting, very good product. I very much recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely order this product again</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the size/qty of this bottle for the price I paid. I rated it 3 stars only because I&#x27;m not that impressed with the smell. To others it might be a 4-5 star. I think the JGlo has a much better smell for me and will order that next time.</li>
            <li> Glow after dark Was one of my favorite perfumes by JLo until I bought it on this site. It smelled sour  so like the lotion did not want to go through the hassle of sending it back so put it where it belonged,in the garbage</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my purchase, lovely fragrance.</li>
            <li> Favorite smell and getting cheap quality</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this perfume in stores for over a year. I love love love it! Such a sweet sexy scent I never get tired of smelling it!</li>
            <li> Ordered in the past, one of my favs. Always get stopped by strangers to be told I smell amazing. Its like an orgasm to my nose!!!</li>
            <li> I love Jlo perfumes, but this one is very strong! Smells like old lady perfume. Not happy and won&#x27;t purchase any more perfumes through Amazon, I believe they are imitations and not original. The cheap price tells it all. My lost for not reading the reviews first. Save your money... The smell is strong!</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume back in like 2008 or something, and recently finished it. Yes, the scent did last that long without going bad. Key thing about perfumes is lighter perfumes last longest, darker colored perfumes last less. This new bottle was the same, except for one part which i don&#x27;t think was relevant, and was different because it&#x27;s a newer bottle. The old bottle had clear spot on the bottle where u could see into the bottle. The new one i received does not have that little window. And i&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s just because the changes since then.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, love love love JLO perfumes. Except for the &amp;#34;glow line&amp;#34; which all have similar notes, but different main notes, all her other perfumes are very unique. I&#x27;d definitely recommend THIS one, Deseo, Forever Glowing (only at kohl&#x27;s unfortunately), and probably Live.</li>
            <li> Super fast Shipping.  Love this scent...</li>
            <li> Love this perfume and cannot find it in any stores. Love it!! I get compliments all the time when I go out,</li>
            <li> Bought this for my fiance&#x27; for the holidays.  She absolutely loves it! It is a great value for a great cologne.</li>
            <li> cannot find this in any department store.  Very different scent, that stays with you all day or night.  Doesn&#x27;t smell like something else, has it&#x27;s own unique scent.</li>
            <li> This was sent as a gift on Mother&#x27;s day, and the recipient loved it.</li>
            <li> Love it. Smells great! Will definitely but this product again and do recommend for all others to try. Great price too</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay long but I like the fragrance even though it is light. Would prefer it if it is a little bit stronger</li>
            <li> Amazing It doesnt get any better then this yeaa budddy oh by the way u should get more!!!! YEA BUDDY</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scent! First time I wore this scent was when I went to Las Vegas. So every time I wear it now, it reminds me of Vegas :) it is a strong scent but does smell amazing. You will get a lot of compliments, I sure did in Vegas.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would smell like the other glow&#x27; perfumes. I hadn&#x27;t smell it until I received it on the mail, it was a big disappointment, I passed it on to my mom - (55) and she didn&#x27;t really like it either. Smells awful, can&#x27;t describe the scent. But I have to admit that it gave me a headache. Smell it at a department store before you spend your money here. Thanks</li>
            <li> My all time favorite!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this</li>
            <li> excelent product. I will enjoy it a lot. Thanks. On time and it was protteccted. Thanks you very much. ok</li>

            <li> i received soon and i love it thanks so much</li>
            <li> Love this scent! I purchased the original Glow by JLo a few months ago and loved it so much I decided to try another one of her perfumes and I just got Glow After Dark and absolutely love this as well. Definitely recommend this scent to others plus it is a good price compared to stores in my area.</li>
            <li> I have always loved Glow After Dark. It was shipped fast and came right on time. I had received it in about 4 days, from the time I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I look many places to find this battery no one carried it.  so I look it up on the internet and found just  what I needed</li>
            <li> I have always luved this scent and will continue to buy it as long as it&#x27;s available! One of my favorites!</li>
