            <li> overall a good shampoo, leaves my hair a bit dry</li>
            <li> Mom loves this shampoo helps her hair gow and not fall out!</li>
            <li> Does leave hair dry, but the benefits are worth it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help hair loss at all and sometimes my head would itch uncontrollably.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the product one time and just after one use my scalp feels so clean and not irritated or itchy like it does at times. Hair feels soft and moisturized, just looks healthy and looks clean still a day after.  It looks fuller like the horse mane hair shampoo. Great transaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Allacin found naturally in garlic and onion thickens hair and is a proven old remedy for hair health and for some regrowth. It&#x27;s good for collagen production and helps skin look younger, also. If you psoriasis or dry patches near your brows and laugh lines or scalp, give this a try! Definitely good for thinning hair! Look into saw palmetto, zinc (daily allowance only) found in pumpkin seeds (usually handful enough daily) as dht blocker. Cayenne pepper (internally and out) and castor (several youtubers offering proof of regrowth). Some have regrown full head of hair with psoriasis meds. Also take ginko biloba tea and ginseng mango chews helps with circulation and tastes good.</li>
            <li> good g product, promptly shipped</li>
            <li> Ive been using this shampoo in the past &amp; its amazing. Hair grows fast &amp; thick.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. It helps your hair grow! It smells fresh and clean. Love it!</li>
            <li> only had it for a month but my hair is silky and looks great!</li>
            <li> This shampoo gives you a great clean wash.  The shampoo smell is natural and the garlic helps with making you hair grow.  It also cleans the scalp  from any dandruff.</li>
            <li> Made my hair stronger and it grows faster too!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo really helps with dandruff!</li>
            <li> Great prize. Will report back for results in a month or two.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has helped me keep some of my hair. I have also noticed my hair deep black now.</li>
            <li> I love using this product, I bought it because I have been losing my hair on the sides and I have tried everything many products do not seem to work.  After hearing the add on the radio and people giving good reviews I decided to give it a try.  Although I have only been using it a month I have seen a change in my hair, my scalp is not full with hair it almost looks the same but I have noticed little hairs growing in the bald areas.  What I love about the product is it makes your hair feel light, I have thick curly hair and when I use other products my hair feels heavy.  This shampoo and conditioner make it feel light and great.  I love to use it, the best part is that you can wash your hair everyday and it will not dry it, it feels healthy.  I recently straighten my hair and I loved the way it looked the style stayed on my hair the whole day it did not puff in cold weather, one of my sisters thought I went to the salon because my hair looked shiny, nope I told her the shampoo and conditioner have made my hair look the way it looks.  I love this product I will continue to use it, I recommend it to anyone! I have not felt my hair this great in years!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and how soft it makes my hair.</li>
            <li> i cant gave it a fare review as I only used it once so I am monitoring it</li>
            <li> Smells good and works</li>
            <li> My husband has been using it for 2 weeks now and we&#x27;ve noticed a small amount of regrowth so far.  He is excited to continue with it.</li>
            <li> After using the shampoo, I found that for me &amp;#34;normal to dry&amp;#34; works best on the ends of my hair.  I originally purchased both &amp;#34;normal to dry&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; shampoos because I wasn&#x27;t sure which one would work best.  I have a very sensitive scalp that isn&#x27;t that flaky, but was having problems with severe itching and splotches of red after washing my hair (allergic reaction of some sort)...I needed something that would soothe my scalp not inflame it.  So, after doing some research, I came across the Nora Ross brand, and after reading lots of reviews, I decided to give it a try.  The &amp;#34;normal to dry&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t clean my scalp as well as the &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;, but it works nicely on the ends of my hair (the &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; variety dries my hair ends).  Overall, I love the product.</li>
            <li> Great Shampoo, this is actually for my mother in law and she loves it, she has been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Although i have not seen major hair growth. I do notice less hair falling out and hair is less brittle and more healthy.</li>
            <li> Got this for my mom, who loves it.</li>
