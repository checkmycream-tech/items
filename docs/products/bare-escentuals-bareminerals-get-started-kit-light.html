            <li>- Handi Buki Brush  - Maximum Coverage Concealer Brush  - Flawless Application Face Brush  </li>
            <li>My skin looked perfect, evenly toned and</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how great my skin looked!  </li>
            <li>Including two foundations is awesome.    </li>
            <li>The lip glosses are wonderful too!  </li>
            <li>I never believed that you could buy any make-up colors from one company and they would all look great on you, but they do!  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll have wonderful looking skin!</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;light\\&quot; foundation matched my skin tone perfectly and didn&#x27;t leave any \\&quot;masking\\&quot; around my hair or jaw line.  </li>
            <li>My favorites are the foundation, the all-over face color and the moisturizer - but truly, all the products are wonderful.   </li>
            <li>My skin likes it, and my husband likes the way I look, so I am very happy to keep using it!</li>
            <li>I get excellent coverage.  </li>
            <li>There is a learning curve with this product and it takes some mixing to find the perfect match.  </li>
            <li>The all-over face warmth is wonderful.</li>
            <li>This stuff is incredible!  </li>
            <li>it covered it flawlessly</li>
            <li>Ooh, but the warmth is the best bronzer ever...</li>
            <li>And the starter kit is an awesome awesome price.</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin and rosacea all over my cheeks.</li>
            <li>She isn&#x27;t very good with make up though.</li>
            <li>It is wonderful because it looks great and does not feel like you&#x27;re wearing make up.  </li>
            <li>my skin looks incredible.</li>
            <li>but my skin looks bright and smoother - without any makeup even!  </li>
            <li>the blush even looked good!  </li>
            <li>It adds a creamy and radiant glow that makes your skin look like it&#x27;s naturally beautiful.</li>
            <li>This stuff truly makes your face look beautiful without looking cakey.  </li>
            <li>Glee is also a great product, it is a plum shade blush.  </li>
            <li>Both of these products are great</li>
            <li>Mineral veil is a great product that is a great finishing product.  </li>
            <li>and I do agree with her, that it is a great make up for woman.</li>
            <li>Its just great.</li>
            <li>Talk about great customer service... &lt;</li>
            <li>This product is great.</li>
            <li>But the biggest compliment came from my husband, who told me that this pregnancy looks great on me</li>
            <li>Mineral Veil is a great part of the kit-</li>
            <li>commented on how great her skin always looked.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>but basically this is a great product.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin healthy looking!!  </li>
            <li>I ordered the fair kit after some deliberation, and it matched beautifully.  </li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t sticky and the colors are amazing!    </li>
            <li>It is truly amazing!</li>
            <li>It is amazing!</li>
            <li>what you want with that product and the best things is so easy to remove.</li>
            <li>It does not sit on the skin, but blends in easily and flawlessly.  </li>
            <li>I loved it.</li>
            <li>it, you will loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My fellow employees are amazed that I am wearing makeup and it looks so good.</li>
            <li>always gorgeous</li>
            <li>I realize that it might not work for everyone, but for me, it really is as good as they claim.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m &#x27;good to go.&#x27;      </li>
            <li>A good make up</li>
            <li>The mineral veil I found to be quite surprising</li>
            <li>Being fair, my skin tone tends toward blotchiness.     </li>
            <li>I sound like a infomercial, lol!</li>
            <li>And golden gate blush is perfect.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s best to try it out first.</li>
            <li>I JUST LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did!     </li>
            <li>but this makeup is easy to use and provides great coverage.</li>
            <li>- TWO shades of bareMinerals SPF 15 Foundation: Light &amp; Golden Medium (Size: Medium)   - Mineral Veil (Size: Medium)   - Warmth All-Over Face Color (Size: Medium)   - Full Flawless Face Brush   - Flawless Application Face Brush   - Maximum Coverage</li>
            <li>I think the Handi buki brush is the better of the two brushes but both do a good job of applying the make up.  </li>
            <li>It was ASTOUNDING.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just really nice product.  </li>
            <li>But I find that mixing the light and fairly light foundational colors works perfectly for me.  </li>
            <li>The powder is nice powder....</li>
            <li>really nice powder, but still powder...</li>
            <li>Warmth can be a nice eye color.  </li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t that nice, so it&#x27;s really quite wonderful to be able to achieve that look.     </li>
            <li>The thing that is great about the kit is you get to try many of the products without a HUGE investment.  </li>
            <li>I flush very easily</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice to be able to learn hands-on how to apply the makeup.</li>
            <li>This feels really good on the skin, and you don&#x27;t have to use much of the product to get good coverage.  </li>
            <li>I think the video is very important and</li>
            <li>I love mineral make up.  </li>
            <li>I love it on her</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s safe also.</li>
            <li>so I mix a primer with some moisturizer and then BE can work it&#x27;s magic.  </li>
            <li>I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I am SO glad that I tried it; I just love it.</li>
            <li>The coverage lasted most of the day</li>
            <li>I am really glad I got</li>
            <li>Applied over my foundation and the Warmth, it does give a slightly more \\&quot;polished\\&quot; look, but I don&#x27;t think I would notice it if I wasn&#x27;t looking for it.  </li>
            <li>both before and after applying the make-up with the kabuki brush, which is supposed to give you more coverage.  </li>
            <li>Once you buy one thing, you will start buying others, because in this case it makes perfect sense to use the same line to protect your skin.  </li>
            <li>OK-</li>
            <li>Cover Girl liquid power foundation is better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many types of makeup through the years, and had given up on using it.  </li>
            <li>I got samples of eyeshadow and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t worn makeup in many years.</li>
            <li>The vitamin lotion smoothes my skin and makes my pores appear more refined.  </li>
            <li>I love how lightweight the foundation and mineral veil feel.  </li>
            <li>If you use and love powder makeup then this kit is for you.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m so glad.</li>
            <li>I also love the eye cover called well rested.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this make up.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;rever upper\\&quot; is nothing more than a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It make her look so lively and beautiful.</li>
            <li>We looked radiantly beautiful yet very natural.</li>
            <li>foundation is wonderful and, although the price seems high, I think that it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be sold for good - this is my first day using it.     </li>
            <li>Tried this product and it was easy to apply and really did have a very nice texture.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also purchased other BE products, eye shadows and lip gloss mostly, and it&#x27;s all awesome!  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t perfect, but it covers up extremely well- much better than any department store liquid foundation I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>It has a great mineral foundation which is better than the bare minerals foundations and a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li>BE always feels natural, looks great for 8+ hours on me.  </li>
            <li>and I can happily say I will be tossing out all my old foundations.  </li>
            <li>This product just makes you feel more smooth without turning you into a mask.</li>
            <li>This truly is a dream come true!  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s an easy habit to learn.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to put on in the morning before work just to feel polished in 2minutes.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product to any woman who is fed up with promises that do not follow through.</li>
            <li>I never watched the instructional DVD and have done fine with it.</li>
            <li>love that I can either brush it on quickly for light coverage, or spend a little more time with the concealer brush and get flawless full coverage.  </li>
            <li>- Two shades of bareMinerals SPF 15 Foundation (.06 oz/2g) in Light and fairly light  - bareMinerals Mineral Veil(.06 oz/2g)  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more than worth your money.</li>
            <li>Even my sister (somewhat enviously) told me I looked great and asked me if I had a facial.  </li>
            <li>It could not keep me shine free for even 1 hour.</li>
            <li>and instead I needed the light.  </li>
            <li>cheap but does it for me.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you read up on how to apply it right</li>
            <li>This stuff is FANTASTIC, quick, and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>suppose if you already have good skin or perhaps for people with dry skin/very fine pores, this would be ok.  </li>
            <li>I suppose if you already have good skin or perhaps for people with dry skin/very fine pores, this would be ok.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 51, and it even looks light and fresh on me!</li>
            <li>She has a wonderful soft glow about her when she wears the bare essentials .</li>
            <li>I find this makeup to be quick and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I would suggest visiting a beauty store that offers Bare Minerals, trying the samples to see if you like it, and ordering the kit from Amazon for the best deal.  </li>
            <li>I believe that continued use with a good skin care program and bare minerals could be a fantastic union.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to go into the Bare Minerals store to have a professional help you decide which tone is best for your skin.</li>
            <li>Make sure you give them a good day to dry.   </li>
            <li>(This kit is worth it for the brushes alone!  </li>
            <li>With the Bare Minerals Light Starter kit, I mixed the light and fairly light to find my perfect shade.  </li>
            <li>, it looks great all day long and into the night.</li>
            <li>The coverage is far better than I&#x27;ve gotten with most liquid products</li>
            <li>Both shades blended well with my skin, and I can have either a porcelain complexion, or one with slightly more color when I have more natural color in my skin.  </li>
            <li>The Skin Rev-er Upper makes the makeup look even more amazing.  </li>
            <li>The product is very light and really doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re wearing any make up.</li>
            <li>Depending on the time of year I will mix Fair and Fairly Light together to make a slightly darker mixture that matches better.  </li>
            <li>The really differences between the two products: the old kit had a Handi Buki Brush when the new kit has Full Flawless Face Brush.  </li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t do anything that special.      </li>
            <li>Frankly, there are better mineral foundations than bare minerals my favorite is E.L.F. (eyes lips &amp; face).  </li>
            <li>After receiving my Get Started Kit in the mail, I decided to try it for one full week before reviewing, just to see if I had any of the adverse reactions (rash, redness)</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this stuff.   </li>
            <li>When I first got the kit in the mail, I couldn&#x27;t believe that it was a two month&#x27;s supply, or that it would look that natural, and feel that good.  </li>
            <li>Again I think the older kit was better.  </li>
            <li>I had mild acne(Now cleared up by burts bees face</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s quickly corrected with a pat of a tissue or a brush of the mineral veil.      </li>
            <li>Mild soap or face cleanser works.   </li>
            <li>If you ask to try some of their products, you can get a free makeover and decide which products you&#x27;re interested in.</li>
            <li>I tried the Bare Minerals in light and LOVE the results.  </li>
            <li>I did however buy their eye make which come with blush and gloss and for the first time I can actually &#x27;wear&#x27; blush, so it&#x27;s all good.      </li>
            <li>It was also very natural looking - not necessarily sun kissed (which screams tanning bed in the winter months where I&#x27;m from), but a very nice, fresh look.  </li>
            <li>it really, really keeps your skin oil free all day.  </li>
            <li>While the get started eyes is great, the foundation kit is messy and does not cover as well as advertised.</li>
            <li>I think the old one was better.      </li>
            <li>it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>and I have been surprised that after application, you don&#x27;t even feel it is there as you do with most powder based products.</li>
            <li>the Bare Minerals on top of this looks just great and feels SO much less gunky than the products I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li>The only reason it got 4 stars from me was that I have some acne scars and they aren&#x27;t perfectly covered, like other people have claimed.  </li>
            <li>Even after watching the damn DVD and 1 hour of blending, I couldn&#x27;t get the right tone for my skin.</li>
            <li>I felt beautiful, which can be a hard feeling to come by for a psoriasis sufferer.  </li>
            <li>Like almost everyone else, I love the Bare Minerals line of products.  </li>
            <li>After more than 10 years of using Revlon Colorstay liquid makeup, one use of the Bare Minerals powder foundation and I was sold for life.  </li>
            <li>I love Bare Minerals.  </li>
            <li>At nearly 60, I was afraid that sure, it might be good on a 21 year old beautiful model, but what would it to do &#x27;me.&#x27;  </li>
            <li>Also, when I first ordered, I just guessed at what I thought seemed to be the right color; It wasn&#x27;t quite right</li>
            <li>I have greens, purples, yellows and dove grays that all look good on me, even with my oddly colored skin.    </li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about this product and am purchasing a starter kit for my 12 year old.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and natural looking when worn.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mess around with trying to cover things up or shading things, because I get a good look without a lot of fuss and time, and I don&#x27;t want makeup that looks made up.  </li>
            <li>It does do a grand job of cakeing onto them and making them far more noticeable, so if you really want to show your pores, wrinkles, and blemishes to the world, this is definitely the product to use.  </li>
            <li>The first starter kit I purchased had:   </li>
            <li>Glee is my absolute favorite bare minerals product.  </li>
            <li>I like it better because it does not make your pores look bigger.  </li>
            <li>The powder is superfine and soft; it doesn&#x27;t feel like you have any  makeup on</li>
            <li>so I felt that I I looked pretty greasy from the beginning</li>
            <li>After that first  hour</li>
            <li>How exactly this stuff is supposed to be \\&quot;good\\&quot; for your skin</li>
            <li>How exactly this stuff is supposed to be \\&quot;good\\&quot; for your skin</li>
            <li>I am over the age of 50, and this product gives me a younger, more refreshed look.  </li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;d say you should go in to the store and try it first.  </li>
            <li>I have lighter skin and will usually mix more of the fairly light shade than I do the light shade and it blends in with my complexion very well.  </li>
            <li>I first used this product when I went to visit my mother.</li>
            <li>After I showed her a different technique to apply it she looked much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>i have some redness in my face and a few blemishes, but i don&#x27;t think this product would be a good choice for anyone who has a lot of skin problems to cover up.</li>
            <li>I have extremely pale and fair skin.   </li>
            <li>I always wore liquid foundation and have tried several other mineral powders, but this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Overall, I was really impressed with the coverage I received from the Bare Minerals foundation and the way it left my face feeling soft and fresh -</li>
            <li>I also have dark circles under my eyes which aren&#x27;t very flattering--they are covered up beautifully with the Bare Minerals foundation</li>
            <li>It is a NIGHTMARE to find make-up for me because my skin has red (which would be a cool tone) and yellow (which is a warm tone).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d absolutely recommend this product for its light weight and natural look.</li>
            <li>My first experience with bare minerals was easy, fast and well worked.</li>
            <li>At the time i didnt want to spent so much money for makeup (yes its kind of expensive).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A friend recommended this to me, and even as someone who generally didn&#x27;t wear much makeup before, I can&#x27;t believe how easy and flattering this makeup is.      </li>
            <li>You can do pretty much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more reddish around my nose and across my cheeks than the rest of my face, and mildly sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(the amount I paid for it largely factors into that decision).  </li>
            <li>My skin is prone to redness and a little bit of acne, but just a little amount of BareMinerals smoothed out my face flawlessly.</li>
            <li>I was worried that because the foundation is fine powder, it would cling to and accentuate the tiny hairs on my face - but it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>After watching the demos on television, I decided to take a chance of Bare Escentuals and it is truly, very natural and easy to apply with a brush.  </li>
            <li>The cost of the kit was a huge savings compared to if I had bought just the brushes individually.)  </li>
            <li>After I wash my face it doesn&#x27;t stick very well</li>
            <li>In my opinion, it is really important to use a daily moisturizer with this (and</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t really feel the need to reapply at all.  </li>
            <li>, however that might just be me since I like a REALLY matte finish.</li>
            <li>Also since all of the makeup products are powder, it works very well with my oily skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d guess that the mask-folks are using too much product--</li>
            <li>mirror is a recommended, so you really can see what you are doing.</li>
            <li>It feels light and airy going on, especially the finishing Mineral Veil.  </li>
            <li>My skin is much smoother and creamier than it was before I started using it.      </li>
            <li>I really did not like this product.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>and my pores are very noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really get breakouts, just the occaisional pimple.  </li>
            <li>and they really aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to ramble on too much</li>
            <li>You get so much for the money.</li>
            <li>What I do not like about bare minerals is how it sits on top of your pores and makes them look bigger.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely order more Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li>My overall opinion is to buy the starter kit once to get the brushes because mineral make up needs special brushes.  </li>
            <li>Also, I would like to point out that I do not work for Bare Escentuals or any other beauty company, don&#x27;t know anyone who does, and am not receiving any kind of compensation for this review.  </li>
            <li>I am one of those unfortunate women who is not only cursed with ultra fair skin; but, also cursed with rosacea as well as allergies to many skin care and cosmetic products.  </li>
            <li>I feel pretty and natural with this product.</li>
            <li>I would recommend finding a mall near you and getting it applied the first time by a stylist vs. just watching the video.</li>
            <li>As I am over the 40 mark, older skin begins to show it&#x27;s age, with years of sun damage, fine blood vessels, reddening around your nose, occasional adult acne, etc.</li>
            <li>less is better, because you can always &#x27;add.&#x27;  </li>
            <li>feel this product is better for someone with less problem skin.</li>
            <li>less is more with it.  </li>
            <li>After buying the basic kit, I bought Beyond The Basics, and like that equally well, since it&#x27;s more stuff to play around with.  </li>
            <li>I also suggest only using the very tiny amount of the Warmth color, literally just the amount that is on the lid without shaking any more on.  </li>
            <li>Once I have enough money, I plan to go back and buy more of their products.     </li>
            <li>I shoot my blow dryer on low the next morning on them just to make sure.     </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I found the Fairly Light shade to be less yellow for me than the Light shade.</li>
            <li>This means that I have patches of red all over my face that get better and worse with changing temperature, humidity, etc.), very fair skin, acne, dry and oily patches, and some yellow undertones.  </li>
            <li>Bare minerals has changed what you receive in the start kit since I first purchased it.  </li>
            <li>After trying several of the Bare Escentuals shadows and reading favorable reviews, I went ahead and purchased the Get Started Face Kit in Light</li>
            <li>I need gentle products that work well with the topical medications and moisturizers I use on my skin - and finding one that meets those needs and gives great coverage has been really frustrating.  </li>
            <li>I have watched others use the product for various reasons ie; acne, sensitive skin, uneven tones... and they had a good result.</li>
            <li>First, I am in my late 20&#x27;s and have very light, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>three days later, I was out at my local makeup retailer buying more Bare Escentuals products.</li>
            <li>The new kit has:  </li>
            <li>the new kit has a Medium Warmth</li>
            <li>I thought that nothing could really live up to that sort of \\&quot;wonder product\\&quot; talk.  </li>
            <li>I get those dark circles under my eyes and have fine lines around my eyes and deeper lines on my forehead.  </li>
            <li>Bare Minerals completely covers it up and it doesn&#x27;t even look as if there were pimples in the first place.      </li>
            <li>I spent more time trying to apply and reapply to get the a similar result as the liquid foundation.  </li>
            <li>I have tried three other mineral brands, and Bare Minerals is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>and my skin is very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I have a very hard time finding the right color foundation, but the fairly light blended very well and evened out my skin tone.</li>
            <li>And it felt so natural!  </li>
            <li>For me, the foundation gave such complete, even coverage, that my face almost looked washed out or one dimensional without some added color - especially since I am so light complected.  </li>
            <li>but for the most part my acne is confined to just small colorless bumps (except for when I used this product).  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve got sensitive skin save your money!  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve got sensitive skin save your money!  </li>
            <li>I first apply the foundation with the regular brush, and then I cover the moles up with the tinier brush</li>
            <li>People around me have noticed a difference and have commented that my makeup looks very natural and soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed some reviewers saying that they only people who rate this product positively are people who work for the company - which is just untrue.    </li>
            <li>&gt; When I first put the foundation on it didn&#x27;t look bad, but give it about an hour and watch as the makeup magically seeps into every pore and wrinkle on my face!!  </li>
            <li>what little is left, magically disappears.  </li>
            <li>Warmth is a bronzer that gives your skin a natural sun kissed glow.  </li>
            <li>It gives your skin a touch of natural color as if you have been exercising.  </li>
            <li>It is a natural look but still a make up look.    </li>
            <li>It really does make that big a difference.</li>
            <li>, it always covers just enough and not too much.</li>
            <li>I use the basic foundation on my whole face, and then a concealer on problem areas, like under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>For those with Sensitive Skin, I would suggest finding a brand without that ingredient.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and</li>
            <li>This product is creamy feeling and offers coverage that seems to blend and bond with my skin, rather than sit on it.  </li>
            <li>As a teenager, it&#x27;s a given that I will get pimples--sometimes in very embarrassing spots, such as inbetween my eyes.</li>
            <li>Following research online-I discovered that many women suffer this same rash from the Bismuth Oxychloride contained in this product and some other brands like Cover Girl.   </li>
            <li>Right away, my preschool aged daughter said, \\&quot;wow Mom, you look SO pretty\\&quot; and my older son kept asking me what was different about me.  </li>
            <li>it was important to find a foundation that didn&#x27;t over dry my skin, or call attention to spots that were already dry and flaky.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use the Mineral Veil, but I&#x27;m not exactly sure that it makes a huge difference or that I need it.  </li>
            <li>I only wish that I had discovered this product earlier and mirrors have certainly become a lot easier on my eyes, since buying this product.  </li>
            <li>I definitely noticed a huge difference while looking in the mirror, but often what you see in yourself is different from what other people see.  </li>
            <li>I bought the second starter kit because I really like the bare minerals brushes and it is cheaper to buy the kit than the brushes individually.  </li>
            <li>I am truly a Bare Minerals addict!  </li>
            <li>Let me describe my skin first off, I have KP (keratosis pilaris, a genetic condition that makes my hair follicles red, bumpy and dry.  </li>
            <li>Easy to do, i spent less on my makeup than before and the result is beyond my dream.</li>
            <li>Ditto to the other positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>I know a lot of women have complained about the light/fairly light kit--</li>
            <li>but you need to be careful not to use too much.      </li>
            <li>now no problem with bare minerals.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bare Escentuals is now my go-to foundation</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t yet noticed if the Bare Minerals make up</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Bare Minerals for about three weeks now.  </li>
            <li>friend recommend that I try Bare Minerals</li>
            <li>This kit is what got me started with Bare Escentuals.</li>
            <li>I got this kit about a year ago and now I am hooked on Bare Escentuals makeup.  </li>
            <li>Putting on the Bare Minerals makeup takes me 3-5 minutes--this includes foundation, all-over face warmth, mineral veil and mascara</li>
            <li>The Bare Minerals foundation covers every one of them up to perfection, and stays on all day.(Note:</li>
            <li>is exactly improving the condition of my skin, but I figure that if it does down the line, it&#x27;s an added bonus, because the way it makes me feel when I wear</li>
            <li>This is expensive, and a serious investment, but you&#x27;re investing in yourself, and it only makes sense to be the best that you can be and feel.  </li>
            <li>I never watched the DVD because the lady who gave me the makeover showed me exactly how to put the makeup on and also showed me other different tricks.</li>
            <li>With that said, I do think that the Bare Minerals foundation might accentuate dry spots that aren&#x27;t properly moisturized - though I didn&#x27;t experience this particular problem.    </li>
            <li>What really sold me on this kit was the way other people reacted when they saw me wearing it.  </li>
            <li>This is my second bare minerals starter kit.  </li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ll probably go back to a liquid once the Bare Minerals is gone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always wanted to try bare minerals and finally decided to do it</li>
            <li>Well, after two weeks of use of the bare minerals not only is the rash gone</li>
            <li>A little bit does indeed go a long way, and for me, it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>It also worked well with my moisturizer (though I would recommend letting your moisturizer or facial medications dry completely before applying the makeup).  </li>
            <li>Though I really do think that the eye shadows are a little too sheer</li>

            <li> It is truly amazing!</li>
            <li> It is amazing!</li>

            <li> and I&#x27;m &#x27;good to go.&#x27;      </li>
            <li> A good make up</li>
            <li> The mineral veil I found to be quite surprising</li>
            <li> Being fair, my skin tone tends toward blotchiness.     </li>
            <li> I sound like a infomercial, lol!</li>
            <li> And golden gate blush is perfect.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s best to try it out first.</li>
            <li> I JUST LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did!     </li>
            <li> but this makeup is easy to use and provides great coverage.</li>
            <li> - TWO shades of bareMinerals SPF 15 Foundation: Light &amp; Golden Medium (Size: Medium)   - Mineral Veil (Size: Medium)   - Warmth All-Over Face Color (Size: Medium)   - Full Flawless Face Brush   - Flawless Application Face Brush   - Maximum Coverage</li>
            <li> I think the Handi buki brush is the better of the two brushes but both do a good job of applying the make up.  </li>
            <li> It was ASTOUNDING.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just really nice product.  </li>
            <li> But I find that mixing the light and fairly light foundational colors works perfectly for me.  </li>
            <li> The powder is nice powder....</li>
            <li> really nice powder, but still powder...</li>
            <li> Warmth can be a nice eye color.  </li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t that nice, so it&#x27;s really quite wonderful to be able to achieve that look.     </li>
            <li> The thing that is great about the kit is you get to try many of the products without a HUGE investment.  </li>
            <li> I flush very easily</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also nice to be able to learn hands-on how to apply the makeup.</li>
            <li> This feels really good on the skin, and you don&#x27;t have to use much of the product to get good coverage.  </li>
            <li> I think the video is very important and</li>
            <li> I love mineral make up.  </li>
            <li> I love it on her</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s safe also.</li>
            <li> so I mix a primer with some moisturizer and then BE can work it&#x27;s magic.  </li>
            <li> I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I am SO glad that I tried it; I just love it.</li>
            <li> The coverage lasted most of the day</li>
            <li> I am really glad I got</li>
            <li> Applied over my foundation and the Warmth, it does give a slightly more \\&quot;polished\\&quot; look, but I don&#x27;t think I would notice it if I wasn&#x27;t looking for it.  </li>
            <li> both before and after applying the make-up with the kabuki brush, which is supposed to give you more coverage.  </li>
            <li> Once you buy one thing, you will start buying others, because in this case it makes perfect sense to use the same line to protect your skin.  </li>
            <li> OK-</li>
            <li> Cover Girl liquid power foundation is better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many types of makeup through the years, and had given up on using it.  </li>
            <li> I got samples of eyeshadow and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t worn makeup in many years.</li>
            <li> The vitamin lotion smoothes my skin and makes my pores appear more refined.  </li>
            <li> I love how lightweight the foundation and mineral veil feel.  </li>
            <li> If you use and love powder makeup then this kit is for you.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m so glad.</li>
            <li> I also love the eye cover called well rested.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this make up.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;rever upper\\&quot; is nothing more than a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It make her look so lively and beautiful.</li>
            <li> We looked radiantly beautiful yet very natural.</li>
            <li> foundation is wonderful and, although the price seems high, I think that it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be sold for good - this is my first day using it.     </li>
            <li> Tried this product and it was easy to apply and really did have a very nice texture.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also purchased other BE products, eye shadows and lip gloss mostly, and it&#x27;s all awesome!  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t perfect, but it covers up extremely well- much better than any department store liquid foundation I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> It has a great mineral foundation which is better than the bare minerals foundations and a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li> BE always feels natural, looks great for 8+ hours on me.  </li>
            <li> and I can happily say I will be tossing out all my old foundations.  </li>
            <li> This product just makes you feel more smooth without turning you into a mask.</li>
            <li> This truly is a dream come true!  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s an easy habit to learn.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to put on in the morning before work just to feel polished in 2minutes.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this product to any woman who is fed up with promises that do not follow through.</li>
            <li> I never watched the instructional DVD and have done fine with it.</li>
            <li> love that I can either brush it on quickly for light coverage, or spend a little more time with the concealer brush and get flawless full coverage.  </li>
            <li> - Two shades of bareMinerals SPF 15 Foundation (.06 oz/2g) in Light and fairly light  - bareMinerals Mineral Veil(.06 oz/2g)  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more than worth your money.</li>
            <li> Even my sister (somewhat enviously) told me I looked great and asked me if I had a facial.  </li>
            <li> It could not keep me shine free for even 1 hour.</li>
            <li> and instead I needed the light.  </li>
            <li> cheap but does it for me.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you read up on how to apply it right</li>
            <li> This stuff is FANTASTIC, quick, and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> suppose if you already have good skin or perhaps for people with dry skin/very fine pores, this would be ok.  </li>
            <li> I suppose if you already have good skin or perhaps for people with dry skin/very fine pores, this would be ok.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 51, and it even looks light and fresh on me!</li>
            <li> She has a wonderful soft glow about her when she wears the bare essentials .</li>
            <li> I find this makeup to be quick and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I would suggest visiting a beauty store that offers Bare Minerals, trying the samples to see if you like it, and ordering the kit from Amazon for the best deal.  </li>
            <li> I believe that continued use with a good skin care program and bare minerals could be a fantastic union.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to go into the Bare Minerals store to have a professional help you decide which tone is best for your skin.</li>
            <li> Make sure you give them a good day to dry.   </li>
            <li> (This kit is worth it for the brushes alone!  </li>
            <li> With the Bare Minerals Light Starter kit, I mixed the light and fairly light to find my perfect shade.  </li>
            <li> , it looks great all day long and into the night.</li>
            <li> The coverage is far better than I&#x27;ve gotten with most liquid products</li>
            <li> Both shades blended well with my skin, and I can have either a porcelain complexion, or one with slightly more color when I have more natural color in my skin.  </li>
            <li> The Skin Rev-er Upper makes the makeup look even more amazing.  </li>
            <li> The product is very light and really doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re wearing any make up.</li>
            <li> Depending on the time of year I will mix Fair and Fairly Light together to make a slightly darker mixture that matches better.  </li>
            <li> The really differences between the two products: the old kit had a Handi Buki Brush when the new kit has Full Flawless Face Brush.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t do anything that special.      </li>
            <li> Frankly, there are better mineral foundations than bare minerals my favorite is E.L.F. (eyes lips &amp; face).  </li>
            <li> After receiving my Get Started Kit in the mail, I decided to try it for one full week before reviewing, just to see if I had any of the adverse reactions (rash, redness)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this stuff.   </li>
            <li> When I first got the kit in the mail, I couldn&#x27;t believe that it was a two month&#x27;s supply, or that it would look that natural, and feel that good.  </li>
            <li> Again I think the older kit was better.  </li>
            <li> I had mild acne(Now cleared up by burts bees face</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s quickly corrected with a pat of a tissue or a brush of the mineral veil.      </li>
            <li> Mild soap or face cleanser works.   </li>
            <li> If you ask to try some of their products, you can get a free makeover and decide which products you&#x27;re interested in.</li>
            <li> I tried the Bare Minerals in light and LOVE the results.  </li>
            <li> I did however buy their eye make which come with blush and gloss and for the first time I can actually &#x27;wear&#x27; blush, so it&#x27;s all good.      </li>
            <li> It was also very natural looking - not necessarily sun kissed (which screams tanning bed in the winter months where I&#x27;m from), but a very nice, fresh look.  </li>
            <li> it really, really keeps your skin oil free all day.  </li>
            <li> While the get started eyes is great, the foundation kit is messy and does not cover as well as advertised.</li>
            <li> I think the old one was better.      </li>
            <li> it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> and I have been surprised that after application, you don&#x27;t even feel it is there as you do with most powder based products.</li>
            <li> the Bare Minerals on top of this looks just great and feels SO much less gunky than the products I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li> The only reason it got 4 stars from me was that I have some acne scars and they aren&#x27;t perfectly covered, like other people have claimed.  </li>
            <li> Even after watching the damn DVD and 1 hour of blending, I couldn&#x27;t get the right tone for my skin.</li>
            <li> I felt beautiful, which can be a hard feeling to come by for a psoriasis sufferer.  </li>
            <li> Like almost everyone else, I love the Bare Minerals line of products.  </li>
            <li> After more than 10 years of using Revlon Colorstay liquid makeup, one use of the Bare Minerals powder foundation and I was sold for life.  </li>
            <li> I love Bare Minerals.  </li>
            <li> At nearly 60, I was afraid that sure, it might be good on a 21 year old beautiful model, but what would it to do &#x27;me.&#x27;  </li>
            <li> Also, when I first ordered, I just guessed at what I thought seemed to be the right color; It wasn&#x27;t quite right</li>
            <li> I have greens, purples, yellows and dove grays that all look good on me, even with my oddly colored skin.    </li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this product and am purchasing a starter kit for my 12 year old.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and natural looking when worn.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mess around with trying to cover things up or shading things, because I get a good look without a lot of fuss and time, and I don&#x27;t want makeup that looks made up.  </li>
            <li> It does do a grand job of cakeing onto them and making them far more noticeable, so if you really want to show your pores, wrinkles, and blemishes to the world, this is definitely the product to use.  </li>
            <li> The first starter kit I purchased had:   </li>
            <li> Glee is my absolute favorite bare minerals product.  </li>
            <li> I like it better because it does not make your pores look bigger.  </li>
            <li> The powder is superfine and soft; it doesn&#x27;t feel like you have any  makeup on</li>
            <li> so I felt that I I looked pretty greasy from the beginning</li>
            <li> After that first  hour</li>
            <li> How exactly this stuff is supposed to be \\&quot;good\\&quot; for your skin</li>
            <li> How exactly this stuff is supposed to be \\&quot;good\\&quot; for your skin</li>
            <li> I am over the age of 50, and this product gives me a younger, more refreshed look.  </li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;d say you should go in to the store and try it first.  </li>
            <li> I have lighter skin and will usually mix more of the fairly light shade than I do the light shade and it blends in with my complexion very well.  </li>
            <li> I first used this product when I went to visit my mother.</li>
            <li> After I showed her a different technique to apply it she looked much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> i have some redness in my face and a few blemishes, but i don&#x27;t think this product would be a good choice for anyone who has a lot of skin problems to cover up.</li>
            <li> I have extremely pale and fair skin.   </li>
            <li> I always wore liquid foundation and have tried several other mineral powders, but this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Overall, I was really impressed with the coverage I received from the Bare Minerals foundation and the way it left my face feeling soft and fresh -</li>
            <li> I also have dark circles under my eyes which aren&#x27;t very flattering--they are covered up beautifully with the Bare Minerals foundation</li>
            <li> It is a NIGHTMARE to find make-up for me because my skin has red (which would be a cool tone) and yellow (which is a warm tone).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d absolutely recommend this product for its light weight and natural look.</li>
            <li> My first experience with bare minerals was easy, fast and well worked.</li>
            <li> At the time i didnt want to spent so much money for makeup (yes its kind of expensive).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this to me, and even as someone who generally didn&#x27;t wear much makeup before, I can&#x27;t believe how easy and flattering this makeup is.      </li>
            <li> You can do pretty much</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more reddish around my nose and across my cheeks than the rest of my face, and mildly sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (the amount I paid for it largely factors into that decision).  </li>
            <li> My skin is prone to redness and a little bit of acne, but just a little amount of BareMinerals smoothed out my face flawlessly.</li>
            <li> I was worried that because the foundation is fine powder, it would cling to and accentuate the tiny hairs on my face - but it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> After watching the demos on television, I decided to take a chance of Bare Escentuals and it is truly, very natural and easy to apply with a brush.  </li>
            <li> The cost of the kit was a huge savings compared to if I had bought just the brushes individually.)  </li>
            <li> After I wash my face it doesn&#x27;t stick very well</li>
            <li> In my opinion, it is really important to use a daily moisturizer with this (and</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t really feel the need to reapply at all.  </li>
            <li> , however that might just be me since I like a REALLY matte finish.</li>
            <li> Also since all of the makeup products are powder, it works very well with my oily skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d guess that the mask-folks are using too much product--</li>
            <li> mirror is a recommended, so you really can see what you are doing.</li>
            <li> It feels light and airy going on, especially the finishing Mineral Veil.  </li>
            <li> My skin is much smoother and creamier than it was before I started using it.      </li>
            <li> I really did not like this product.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> and my pores are very noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really get breakouts, just the occaisional pimple.  </li>
            <li> and they really aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to ramble on too much</li>
            <li> You get so much for the money.</li>
            <li> What I do not like about bare minerals is how it sits on top of your pores and makes them look bigger.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely order more Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li> My overall opinion is to buy the starter kit once to get the brushes because mineral make up needs special brushes.  </li>
            <li> Also, I would like to point out that I do not work for Bare Escentuals or any other beauty company, don&#x27;t know anyone who does, and am not receiving any kind of compensation for this review.  </li>
            <li> I am one of those unfortunate women who is not only cursed with ultra fair skin; but, also cursed with rosacea as well as allergies to many skin care and cosmetic products.  </li>
            <li> I feel pretty and natural with this product.</li>
            <li> I would recommend finding a mall near you and getting it applied the first time by a stylist vs. just watching the video.</li>
            <li> As I am over the 40 mark, older skin begins to show it&#x27;s age, with years of sun damage, fine blood vessels, reddening around your nose, occasional adult acne, etc.</li>
            <li> less is better, because you can always &#x27;add.&#x27;  </li>
            <li> feel this product is better for someone with less problem skin.</li>
            <li> less is more with it.  </li>
            <li> After buying the basic kit, I bought Beyond The Basics, and like that equally well, since it&#x27;s more stuff to play around with.  </li>
            <li> I also suggest only using the very tiny amount of the Warmth color, literally just the amount that is on the lid without shaking any more on.  </li>
            <li> Once I have enough money, I plan to go back and buy more of their products.     </li>
            <li> I shoot my blow dryer on low the next morning on them just to make sure.     </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I found the Fairly Light shade to be less yellow for me than the Light shade.</li>
            <li> This means that I have patches of red all over my face that get better and worse with changing temperature, humidity, etc.), very fair skin, acne, dry and oily patches, and some yellow undertones.  </li>
            <li> Bare minerals has changed what you receive in the start kit since I first purchased it.  </li>
            <li> After trying several of the Bare Escentuals shadows and reading favorable reviews, I went ahead and purchased the Get Started Face Kit in Light</li>
            <li> I need gentle products that work well with the topical medications and moisturizers I use on my skin - and finding one that meets those needs and gives great coverage has been really frustrating.  </li>
            <li> I have watched others use the product for various reasons ie; acne, sensitive skin, uneven tones... and they had a good result.</li>
            <li> First, I am in my late 20&#x27;s and have very light, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> three days later, I was out at my local makeup retailer buying more Bare Escentuals products.</li>
            <li> The new kit has:  </li>
            <li> the new kit has a Medium Warmth</li>
            <li> I thought that nothing could really live up to that sort of \\&quot;wonder product\\&quot; talk.  </li>
            <li> I get those dark circles under my eyes and have fine lines around my eyes and deeper lines on my forehead.  </li>
            <li> Bare Minerals completely covers it up and it doesn&#x27;t even look as if there were pimples in the first place.      </li>
            <li> I spent more time trying to apply and reapply to get the a similar result as the liquid foundation.  </li>
            <li> I have tried three other mineral brands, and Bare Minerals is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> and my skin is very sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I have a very hard time finding the right color foundation, but the fairly light blended very well and evened out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> And it felt so natural!  </li>
            <li> For me, the foundation gave such complete, even coverage, that my face almost looked washed out or one dimensional without some added color - especially since I am so light complected.  </li>
            <li> but for the most part my acne is confined to just small colorless bumps (except for when I used this product).  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got sensitive skin save your money!  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got sensitive skin save your money!  </li>
            <li> I first apply the foundation with the regular brush, and then I cover the moles up with the tinier brush</li>
            <li> People around me have noticed a difference and have commented that my makeup looks very natural and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed some reviewers saying that they only people who rate this product positively are people who work for the company - which is just untrue.    </li>
            <li> &gt; When I first put the foundation on it didn&#x27;t look bad, but give it about an hour and watch as the makeup magically seeps into every pore and wrinkle on my face!!  </li>
            <li> what little is left, magically disappears.  </li>
            <li> Warmth is a bronzer that gives your skin a natural sun kissed glow.  </li>
            <li> It gives your skin a touch of natural color as if you have been exercising.  </li>
            <li> It is a natural look but still a make up look.    </li>
            <li> It really does make that big a difference.</li>
            <li> , it always covers just enough and not too much.</li>
            <li> I use the basic foundation on my whole face, and then a concealer on problem areas, like under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> For those with Sensitive Skin, I would suggest finding a brand without that ingredient.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and</li>
            <li> This product is creamy feeling and offers coverage that seems to blend and bond with my skin, rather than sit on it.  </li>
            <li> As a teenager, it&#x27;s a given that I will get pimples--sometimes in very embarrassing spots, such as inbetween my eyes.</li>
            <li> Following research online-I discovered that many women suffer this same rash from the Bismuth Oxychloride contained in this product and some other brands like Cover Girl.   </li>
            <li> Right away, my preschool aged daughter said, \\&quot;wow Mom, you look SO pretty\\&quot; and my older son kept asking me what was different about me.  </li>
            <li> it was important to find a foundation that didn&#x27;t over dry my skin, or call attention to spots that were already dry and flaky.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use the Mineral Veil, but I&#x27;m not exactly sure that it makes a huge difference or that I need it.  </li>
            <li> I only wish that I had discovered this product earlier and mirrors have certainly become a lot easier on my eyes, since buying this product.  </li>
            <li> I definitely noticed a huge difference while looking in the mirror, but often what you see in yourself is different from what other people see.  </li>
            <li> I bought the second starter kit because I really like the bare minerals brushes and it is cheaper to buy the kit than the brushes individually.  </li>
            <li> I am truly a Bare Minerals addict!  </li>
            <li> Let me describe my skin first off, I have KP (keratosis pilaris, a genetic condition that makes my hair follicles red, bumpy and dry.  </li>
            <li> Easy to do, i spent less on my makeup than before and the result is beyond my dream.</li>
            <li> Ditto to the other positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> I know a lot of women have complained about the light/fairly light kit--</li>
            <li> but you need to be careful not to use too much.      </li>
            <li> now no problem with bare minerals.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bare Escentuals is now my go-to foundation</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t yet noticed if the Bare Minerals make up</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Bare Minerals for about three weeks now.  </li>
            <li> friend recommend that I try Bare Minerals</li>
            <li> This kit is what got me started with Bare Escentuals.</li>
            <li> I got this kit about a year ago and now I am hooked on Bare Escentuals makeup.  </li>
            <li> Putting on the Bare Minerals makeup takes me 3-5 minutes--this includes foundation, all-over face warmth, mineral veil and mascara</li>
            <li> The Bare Minerals foundation covers every one of them up to perfection, and stays on all day.(Note:</li>
            <li> is exactly improving the condition of my skin, but I figure that if it does down the line, it&#x27;s an added bonus, because the way it makes me feel when I wear</li>
            <li> This is expensive, and a serious investment, but you&#x27;re investing in yourself, and it only makes sense to be the best that you can be and feel.  </li>
            <li> I never watched the DVD because the lady who gave me the makeover showed me exactly how to put the makeup on and also showed me other different tricks.</li>
            <li> With that said, I do think that the Bare Minerals foundation might accentuate dry spots that aren&#x27;t properly moisturized - though I didn&#x27;t experience this particular problem.    </li>
            <li> What really sold me on this kit was the way other people reacted when they saw me wearing it.  </li>
            <li> This is my second bare minerals starter kit.  </li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ll probably go back to a liquid once the Bare Minerals is gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to try bare minerals and finally decided to do it</li>
            <li> Well, after two weeks of use of the bare minerals not only is the rash gone</li>
            <li> A little bit does indeed go a long way, and for me, it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> It also worked well with my moisturizer (though I would recommend letting your moisturizer or facial medications dry completely before applying the makeup).  </li>
            <li> Though I really do think that the eye shadows are a little too sheer</li>
            <li> Just a tiny bit (no larger than my pinky nail) did the trick, and gave me a very pretty and subtle wash of color.  </li>
            <li> If you are pale, you really can&#x27;t pull off an all over tan can you?  </li>
            <li> This is the only reason why I rated 4 stars instead of 5; when my skin is dry, Bare Minerals makes my skin look flaky.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use Bare Minerals exclusively, because my skin gets terribly dry in the winter even with tons of moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I have medium/large pores on my nose and part of my cheeks, and a few fine lines, some small pimples here and there</li>
            <li> It gives you a natural sun-kissed glow that other makeups often can&#x27;t achieve.</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical that I only needed to use such a tiny amount of product and that such a fine powder could cover my face...</li>
            <li> First off let me tell you I have been using liquid foundations since I was 17 and each year of my life,they have been less and less satisfactory and an hour later</li>
            <li> The second major differences the old kit had small Warmth</li>
            <li> I was skeptic about buying this product because the price is much higher than the common drug-store makeup.</li>
            <li> I just got the liner shadow and the flat liner brush.  </li>
            <li> The minerals last a long time too, since you don&#x27;t need to use tons at one time.</li>
            <li> The fact that there aren&#x27;t a bunch of awful chemicals in it is great too because I have sensitive skin too</li>
            <li> As a person with chronically dry skin (and occasional psoriasis patches onmy forehead and along my hairline)</li>
            <li> any) make up product - it is one of the only ways to combat dryness and irritation associated with dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I gives my skin a natural look and my skin appears less oily.  </li>
            <li> From the very first application, I noticed complete and even coverage on all my trouble spots, decreased overall redness, and a brighter, fresher complexion - without having to use a ton of product.  </li>
            <li> I have heard a number of valid reviews, both positive and negative-</li>
            <li> I just never good get enough coverage that worked for me to really use this product regularly.</li>
            <li> I am getting older (looking 40 down the barrel) and my dry dry dry skin has lost some of its glow and has gained some imperfections.  </li>
            <li> Personally without Glee my face ends up looking pale, my face really needs a little bit of color beyond the foundation, warmth and mineral veil.</li>
            <li> The product made my face itch like crazy, though I was told that this would subside, I couldn&#x27;t take more than a week of it.  </li>
            <li> Never had terrible skin problems, but I&#x27;m definitely the more problematic side of normal and have sensitive skin as well.</li>
            <li> They immediately sent me a different shade at absolutely no charge, not even shipping.</li>
            <li> and I decided to give it a shot since my long time standby</li>
            <li> I should have done this a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when I first tried this product, but it really does work.  </li>
            <li> Now, to the effects of the makeup: I have several tiny moles scattered about my face, and I could never completely cover them up with a regular concealer because the concealer usually didn&#x27;t match my skin-tone and it would come off within a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> It does have a light feel to it as advertised, but I&#x27;m not getting the coverage I expected, and I do not get the dramatic results other women have reported when using this product.  </li>
            <li> One trick I have learn to minimizing the appearance of pores under mineral make up is to use a acne moisturizing and let it dry before applying the make up.</li>
            <li> With Revlon, my makeup looked heavy and pale and it didn&#x27;t really match my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> I used to spent time to remove my makeup before going bed and my skin was dry...</li>
            <li> I previously tried Cover Girl Mineral makeup and had the same reaction, but did not realize the connection until now.</li>
            <li> I have gone back to my Black Opal;</li>
            <li> The difference between drug-store makeup and Bare Minerals makeup is firstly, Bare Minerals doesn&#x27;t make you look like you have a mask on; secondly, it feels completely natural instead of thick and uncomfortable; thirdly, it definitely improves your skin tone.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want her to have to experiment and learn the hard way how to take care of her sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I discovered this product on TV two years ago when i spent one year in USA.</li>
            <li> In fact, I looked like I had aged 10 years in the under eye area the day I tried it.    </li>
            <li> A few weeks later, and the rosacea was gone along with the rashes!</li>
            <li> However, after a few months of wavering back and forth between the decision, I went ahead and bought it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but in the long run it&#x27;s worth it because a little goes a long way with this makeup!</li>
            <li> I did use a Loreal QuickStick as a base under the Bare Minerals because I knew I needed a little more coverage than just a powder would offer.</li>
            <li> it made my face raw and red and breaking out everywhere</li>
            <li> it made my face raw and red and breaking out everywhere</li>
            <li> I need coverage for my KP and powder for the other parts of my face that need oil control.  </li>
            <li> some other reviewers mentioned.  </li>
            <li> and I won&#x27;t use one without the other.  </li>
            <li> I can now count my pores without getting even remotely close to a mirror!  </li>
            <li> I have since been told that it&#x27;s the bismuth that makes a lot of people itch and that other mineral based foundations don&#x27;t have that ingredient in them.  </li>
            <li> No more red bloches on my face.  </li>
            <li> Putting on makeup usually took me about ten or fifteen minutes--</li>
            <li> I was attempting to use this as an alternate means of covering acne scars and uneven skin tones but the end result was yuck!</li>
            <li> I will never use any other foundation again.</li>
            <li> I also became tired of the caked-on feeling of regular foundations and wanted to try something different.  </li>
            <li> (Note: Only apply a VERY little bit--this stuff goes a long way on a small amount).     </li>
            <li> It was definitely NOT worth the money for me.  </li>
            <li> It was definitely NOT worth the money for me.  </li>
            <li> (duh, why take it out to put it back in.)  </li>
            <li> (Note: Use the tinier brush for covering up dark circles--if you have any).</li>
            <li> I will never buy any other foundation again!</li>
            <li> I have an acne and slight scaring problem, and when I use the concealer brush</li>
            <li> If you use one already that you like for less, stick with it.   </li>
            <li> If the face brushes are even slightly damp, they won&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little iffy on.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little practice to use it-</li>
            <li> a little goes a loooong way.  </li>
            <li> Err on the side of applying too little.  </li>
            <li> The warmth is very dark, I recommend glee instead.</li>
            <li> I have a few noticable sun spots on my face</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m a school teacher), my makeup was gross and looked tired.  </li>
            <li> I follow the steps in the DVD, but the spots are still plainly visable.  </li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s extremely lightweight and subtle.  </li>
            <li> I have suffered from psoriasis all my life and it can be difficult for me to find face makeup that not only covers well, but doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin with harsh chemicals or fragrances.  </li>
            <li> A few years ago I had a bad reaction to my normal liquid foundation/concealer and had to stop wearing makeup for awhile.</li>
            <li> I walked around the mall for a while with it on and every time I walked past a mirror</li>
            <li> And yes, I have tried using the small brush to cover them...</li>
            <li> (hate how it feels and looks) and find that conventional powder makes my already dry skin drier and that it sits in my aforementioned wrinkles...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been fighting dull, tired looking skin for a few years, tried all sorts of products that claimed they would brighten, rejuvanate, etc., all a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> My skin is so delicate that I can&#x27;t even wear Clinique without triggering a rash!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> some have said the colors are just off and others have complained that it looks like a mask.  </li>
            <li> After using Bare Minerals for a Saturday morning and a Sunday morning application I have a horrible sunburn-like dry itchy raw face for 3 days.</li>
            <li> Most blush looks awful on me because of my weird skin.  </li>
            <li> and I expected the brushes to be crap based on other reviews....</li>
            <li> It had always looked fake, heavy, and unnatural.  </li>
            <li> Matching my skin tone seemed like it would be extremely difficult since in the past</li>
            <li> The company this was ordered from was very slow with delivery.</li>
            <li> Also, my makeup does not look cakey and tired at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> I can reapply without the fear that I will make myself look worse.  </li>
            <li> (my skin is just plain difficult!).    </li>
            <li> sometimes (I like dramatic colors sometimes).  </li>
            <li> I was wary about spening money yet again on a product that claimed to do it all.</li>
            <li> I found it very complicated to use.</li>
            <li> itched so bad.  </li>
            <li> My experience with this product was so bad that I won&#x27;t even consider trying another mineral make</li>
            <li> The experience was so bad that I tossed everything out.  </li>
            <li> The experience was so bad that I tossed everything out.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love mineral make up.  It is wonderful because it looks great and does not feel like you&#x27;re wearing make up.  This is my second bare minerals starter kit.  I bought the second starter kit because I really like the bare minerals brushes and it is cheaper to buy the kit than the brushes individually.  Bare minerals has changed what you receive in the start kit since I first purchased it.  I think the old one was better.      The first starter kit I purchased had:   - Two shades of bareMinerals SPF 15 Foundation (.06 oz/2g) in Light and fairly light  - bareMinerals Mineral Veil(.06 oz/2g)  - bareMinerals Warmth All-Over Face Color (.02 oz/.57g)  - bareMinerals Glee All-Over Face Color (.02 oz/.57g)  - Handi Buki Brush  - Maximum Coverage Concealer Brush  - Flawless Application Face Brush  - How-to DVD.    The new kit has:  - TWO shades of bareMinerals SPF 15 Foundation: Light &amp; Golden Medium (Size: Medium)   - Mineral Veil (Size: Medium)   - Warmth All-Over Face Color (Size: Medium)   - Full Flawless Face Brush   - Flawless Application Face Brush   - Maximum Coverage Concealer Brush   - How-to DVD.      The really differences between the two products: the old kit had a Handi Buki Brush when the new kit has Full Flawless Face Brush.  I think the Handi buki brush is the better of the two brushes but both do a good job of applying the make up.  The second major differences the old kit had small Warmth All-Over Face Color and Glee All-Over Face Color the new kit has a Medium Warmth All-Over Face Color.  Again I think the older kit was better.  Warmth is a bronzer that gives your skin a natural sun kissed glow.  Glee is also a great product, it is a plum shade blush.  It gives your skin a touch of natural color as if you have been exercising.  Both of these products are great but you need to be careful not to use too much.      Personally without Glee my face ends up looking pale, my face really needs a little bit of color beyond the foundation, warmth and mineral veil.Glee is my absolute favorite bare minerals product.  Mineral veil is a great product that is a great finishing product.  It gives your face an airbrushed look.      What I do not like about bare minerals is how it sits on top of your pores and makes them look bigger.  Unlike the commercials claim you do not look like you are not wearing make up in fact your look like you are wearing tons.   It is a natural look but still a make up look.    Frankly, there are better mineral foundations than bare minerals my favorite is E.L.F. (eyes lips &amp; face).  It has a great mineral foundation which is better than the bare minerals foundations and a fraction of the price.  I like it better because it does not make your pores look bigger.  E.L.F. also makes a product called mineral booster which is like mineral veil.      My overall opinion is to buy the starter kit once to get the brushes because mineral make up needs special brushes.  Use what come with it and switch to a different foundation and continue using Glee and Warmth.    Mineral make up last longer if you apply a moisturizing before the make up.  One trick I have learn to minimizing the appearance of pores under mineral make up is to use a acne moisturizing and let it dry before applying the make up.</li>
            <li> It make her look so lively and beautiful. She has a wonderful soft glow about her when she wears the bare essentials . I love it on her and I do agree with her, that it is a great make up for woman. It&#x27;s safe also. It doesn&#x27;t have toxins in it.</li>
            <li> I loved it. I discovered this product on TV two years ago when i spent one year in USA. At the time i didnt want to spent so much money for makeup (yes its kind of expensive).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two months ago i discovered in my body shop \\&quot;Sephora\\&quot; in France that they sell this product. I didnt think twice and i bought it. Since that time i have no complain to make. Its just great. Easy to do, i spent less on my makeup than before and the result is beyond my dream. You can do pretty much what you want with that product and the best things is so easy to remove. I used to spent time to remove my makeup before going bed and my skin was dry... now no problem with bare minerals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it, you will loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laets from France</li>
            <li> After watching the demos on television, I decided to take a chance of Bare Escentuals and it is truly, very natural and easy to apply with a brush.  The minerals give a glow to your skin and it does last all day.  This is one product I do not want to be without!</li>
            <li> I consider myself to be somewhat inept when it comes to makeup application but this makeup is easy to use and provides great coverage. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Let me describe my skin first off, I have KP (keratosis pilaris, a genetic condition that makes my hair follicles red, bumpy and dry.  This means that I have patches of red all over my face that get better and worse with changing temperature, humidity, etc.), very fair skin, acne, dry and oily patches, and some yellow undertones.  It is a NIGHTMARE to find make-up for me because my skin has red (which would be a cool tone) and yellow (which is a warm tone).  I need coverage for my KP and powder for the other parts of my face that need oil control.  I&#x27;ve tried every drugstore brand out there, Covergirl, Loreal, Maybelline, Physician&#x27;s Formula, Rimmel, everything.  On a whim I went to a Macy&#x27;s make up counter and got my make-up done with BE.  It was ASTOUNDING.  My skin looked perfect, evenly toned and the blush even looked good!  Most blush looks awful on me because of my weird skin.  And it felt so natural!  I walked around the mall for a while with it on and every time I walked past a mirror I couldn&#x27;t believe how great my skin looked!  I had to go back and buy it!    One thing I will totally recommend to people is to use a primer with this make-up!  After I wash my face it doesn&#x27;t stick very well so I mix a primer with some moisturizer and then BE can work it&#x27;s magic.  Depending on the time of year I will mix Fair and Fairly Light together to make a slightly darker mixture that matches better.  Including two foundations is awesome.    BE always feels natural, looks great for 8+ hours on me.  I thought it was all hype from the ads on TV and home shopping channels I thought that nothing could really live up to that sort of \\&quot;wonder product\\&quot; talk.  But for me, BE does!  The fact that there aren&#x27;t a bunch of awful chemicals in it is great too because I have sensitive skin too (my skin is just plain difficult!).    I&#x27;ve also purchased other BE products, eye shadows and lip gloss mostly, and it&#x27;s all awesome!  Though I really do think that the eye shadows are a little too sheer sometimes (I like dramatic colors sometimes).  The lip glosses are wonderful too!  They aren&#x27;t sticky and the colors are amazing!    I never believed that you could buy any make-up colors from one company and they would all look great on you, but they do!  No matter what shadow I buy or what lip gloss they are all made for all skin tones.  I have greens, purples, yellows and dove grays that all look good on me, even with my oddly colored skin.    I&#x27;d recommend BE to anyone with picky skin.  Just make sure you read up on how to apply it right and you&#x27;ll have wonderful looking skin!</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical that I only needed to use such a tiny amount of product and that such a fine powder could cover my face... IT WILL! My skin is prone to redness and a little bit of acne, but just a little amount of BareMinerals smoothed out my face flawlessly. The brushes are luxurious and the product itself is a pleasure to put on. The powder is superfine and soft; it doesn&#x27;t feel like you have any  makeup on and it doesn&#x27;t clog your pores. Don&#x27;t doubt those before-and-after photos! It really does make that big a difference. I received this starter kit for Christmas and three days later, I was out at my local makeup retailer buying more Bare Escentuals products. I will never use products from the grocery store again. It&#x27;s more than worth your money.</li>
            <li> I find this makeup to be quick and easy to apply. It takes me no time at all to do my makeup anymore - just sweep it on and it&#x27;s done.  &lt;br /&gt;Plus, it always covers just enough and not too much. It feels like I&#x27;m not wearing any makeup at all. I have been carded numerous times since I started wearing it and I haven&#x27;t been carded in almost TEN years. It is truly amazing! I really love this stuff. &lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I cannot wear the Mineral veil because I am allergic to it, but there is a money back guarantee and THEY pay for return shipping - no questions asked. Also, when I first ordered, I just guessed at what I thought seemed to be the right color; It wasn&#x27;t quite right so I contacted them. They immediately sent me a different shade at absolutely no charge, not even shipping. Talk about great customer service... &lt;br /&gt;Their foundation is wonderful and, although the price seems high, I think that it is well worth it. I am SO glad that I tried it; I just love it.</li>
            <li> This product is great. I have very fair skin and rosacea all over my cheeks. This product covers soo well, my rosacea disappears. My fellow employees are amazed that I am wearing makeup and it looks so good.</li>
            <li> After trying several of the Bare Escentuals shadows and reading favorable reviews, I went ahead and purchased the Get Started Face Kit in Light and I could not be happier that I did.  Bare Escentuals is now my go-to foundation and I can happily say I will be tossing out all my old foundations.  Also, I would like to point out that I do not work for Bare Escentuals or any other beauty company, don&#x27;t know anyone who does, and am not receiving any kind of compensation for this review.  I&#x27;ve noticed some reviewers saying that they only people who rate this product positively are people who work for the company - which is just untrue.    First, I am in my late 20&#x27;s and have very light, sensitive skin. I have suffered from psoriasis all my life and it can be difficult for me to find face makeup that not only covers well, but doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin with harsh chemicals or fragrances.  I need gentle products that work well with the topical medications and moisturizers I use on my skin - and finding one that meets those needs and gives great coverage has been really frustrating.  After receiving my Get Started Kit in the mail, I decided to try it for one full week before reviewing, just to see if I had any of the adverse reactions (rash, redness) some other reviewers mentioned.  Here&#x27;s what I thought:    From the very first application, I noticed complete and even coverage on all my trouble spots, decreased overall redness, and a brighter, fresher complexion - without having to use a ton of product.  The \\&quot;light\\&quot; foundation matched my skin tone perfectly and didn&#x27;t leave any \\&quot;masking\\&quot; around my hair or jaw line.  I was worried that because the foundation is fine powder, it would cling to and accentuate the tiny hairs on my face - but it didn&#x27;t.  It also worked well with my moisturizer (though I would recommend letting your moisturizer or facial medications dry completely before applying the makeup).  As a person with chronically dry skin (and occasional psoriasis patches onmy forehead and along my hairline) it was important to find a foundation that didn&#x27;t over dry my skin, or call attention to spots that were already dry and flaky.  In my opinion, it is really important to use a daily moisturizer with this (and any) make up product - it is one of the only ways to combat dryness and irritation associated with dry skin.  Do not expect your foundation to do a moisturizers job!  With that said, I do think that the Bare Minerals foundation might accentuate dry spots that aren&#x27;t properly moisturized - though I didn&#x27;t experience this particular problem.    Overall, I was really impressed with the coverage I received from the Bare Minerals foundation and the way it left my face feeling soft and fresh - as if I wasn&#x27;t wearing any makeup at all.  The coverage lasted most of the day and I didn&#x27;t really feel the need to reapply at all.  I am really glad I got the Get Started Kit because of the different products it came with, like the Warmth face color and Mineral Veil.  (This kit is worth it for the brushes alone!  The cost of the kit was a huge savings compared to if I had bought just the brushes individually.)  For me, the foundation gave such complete, even coverage, that my face almost looked washed out or one dimensional without some added color - especially since I am so light complected.  For me, the Warmth all over color is essential.  Just a tiny bit (no larger than my pinky nail) did the trick, and gave me a very pretty and subtle wash of color.  It was also very natural looking - not necessarily sun kissed (which screams tanning bed in the winter months where I&#x27;m from), but a very nice, fresh look.  For me, the foundation and the Warmth go hand in hand and I won&#x27;t use one without the other.  The Mineral Veil I&#x27;m a little iffy on.  Applied over my foundation and the Warmth, it does give a slightly more \\&quot;polished\\&quot; look, but I don&#x27;t think I would notice it if I wasn&#x27;t looking for it.  It did decrease some shine over my nose, but again,maybe only because I know it supposed to.  I will continue to use the Mineral Veil, but I&#x27;m not exactly sure that it makes a huge difference or that I need it.  We&#x27;ll see what happens as I keep using it.    What really sold me on this kit was the way other people reacted when they saw me wearing it.  I definitely noticed a huge difference while looking in the mirror, but often what you see in yourself is different from what other people see.  Right away, my preschool aged daughter said, \\&quot;wow Mom, you look SO pretty\\&quot; and my older son kept asking me what was different about me.  Even my sister (somewhat enviously) told me I looked great and asked me if I had a facial.  But the biggest compliment came from my husband, who told me that this pregnancy looks great on me (I&#x27;m about 5months along).  He said, \\&quot;You&#x27;re always gorgeous but now I can see the glow everyone talks about\\&quot;.  I felt beautiful, which can be a hard feeling to come by for a psoriasis sufferer.  I haven&#x27;t yet noticed if the Bare Minerals make up is exactly improving the condition of my skin, but I figure that if it does down the line, it&#x27;s an added bonus, because the way it makes me feel when I wear it is worth it.  This product works for me, I will be a die-hard and devoted user from here on out.  I realize that it might not work for everyone, but for me, it really is as good as they claim.  Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Just to give you some background in case you have a similar skin type.... I have medium/large pores on my nose and part of my cheeks, and a few fine lines, some small pimples here and there but for the most part my acne is confined to just small colorless bumps (except for when I used this product).  My skin is pretty oily, usually shiny in the t-zone by the end of the work-day no matter what I wear. It&#x27;s a little more reddish around my nose and across my cheeks than the rest of my face, and mildly sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When I first put the foundation on it didn&#x27;t look bad, but give it about an hour and watch as the makeup magically seeps into every pore and wrinkle on my face!!  I can now count my pores without getting even remotely close to a mirror!  The mineral veil doesn&#x27;t matte my skin enough so I felt that I I looked pretty greasy from the beginning, however that might just be me since I like a REALLY matte finish. After that first  hour once everything has slid around I looked like I hadn&#x27;t washed my face in days.  It doesn&#x27;t absorb oil at all.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of regular foundation/powder combinations over the years and I have to say that this one allowed me to get oily faster than any I can ever remember using.  It could not keep me shine free for even 1 hour. The product made my face itch like crazy, though I was told that this would subside, I couldn&#x27;t take more than a week of it.  I wanted to tear my skin off it itched so bad.  I have since been told that it&#x27;s the bismuth that makes a lot of people itch and that other mineral based foundations don&#x27;t have that ingredient in them.  My experience with this product was so bad that I won&#x27;t even consider trying another mineral make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foundation evened my skin tone out a bit, but it doesn&#x27;t cover blemishes at all.  It does do a grand job of cakeing onto them and making them far more noticeable, so if you really want to show your pores, wrinkles, and blemishes to the world, this is definitely the product to use.  I don&#x27;t what sort of airbrushing/video techniques they used on the infomercial [...].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose if you already have good skin or perhaps for people with dry skin/very fine pores, this would be ok.  If you&#x27;ve got sensitive skin save your money!  It was definitely NOT worth the money for me.  I&#x27;ll never buy this torture kit again.  How exactly this stuff is supposed to be \\&quot;good\\&quot; for your skin it made my face raw and red and breaking out everywhere I have no idea.  The experience was so bad that I tossed everything out.

I don&#x27;t what sort of airbrushing/video techniques they used on the infomercial [...].    I suppose if you already have good skin or perhaps for people with dry skin/very fine pores, this would be ok.   If you&#x27;ve got sensitive skin save your money!  It was definitely NOT worth the money for me.  I&#x27;ll never buy this torture kit again.  How exactly this stuff is supposed to be \\&quot;good\\&quot; for your skin it made my face raw and red and breaking out everywhere I have no idea.  The experience was so bad that I tossed everything out.  I wouldn&#x27;t even give it away --- I don&#x27;t dislike anyone enough to put them through what I went through the week I used this stuff, and then the following 2 weeks that it took me to get rid of the redness and acne flareup that it caused.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Bare Minerals for about three weeks now.  It does have a light feel to it as advertised, but I&#x27;m not getting the coverage I expected, and I do not get the dramatic results other women have reported when using this product.  I have a few noticable sun spots on my face (I&#x27;m only 36; I refuse to call them age spots) and from what I&#x27;d seen in the infomercial, I expected the spots to be completely covered.  I follow the steps in the DVD, but the spots are still plainly visable.  And yes, I have tried using the small brush to cover them...both before and after applying the make-up with the kabuki brush, which is supposed to give you more coverage.  Also, I did not find the make up to be &#x27;creamy enough to use in the under eye area&#x27; as touted in the DVD.  In fact, I looked like I had aged 10 years in the under eye area the day I tried it.    Aside from the ultra-sheer coverage, which I don&#x27;t like, I like the product enough to use it all (the amount I paid for it largely factors into that decision).  However, I&#x27;ll probably go back to a liquid once the Bare Minerals is gone.</li>
            <li> Like almost everyone else, I love the Bare Minerals line of products.  I use the basic foundation on my whole face, and then a concealer on problem areas, like under my eyes.  For me, the regular foundation is not quite enough!  I don&#x27;t use Bare Minerals exclusively, because my skin gets terribly dry in the winter even with tons of moisturizer.  This is the only reason why I rated 4 stars instead of 5; when my skin is dry, Bare Minerals makes my skin look flaky.  But, in the humid months, this is the answer to my prayers!  Mineral Veil is a great part of the kit- it really, really keeps your skin oil free all day.  You can reapply, but I almost never find this neessary unless I&#x27;ve been out in the heat all day.</li>
            <li> I am one of those unfortunate women who is not only cursed with ultra fair skin; but, also cursed with rosacea as well as allergies to many skin care and cosmetic products.  My skin is so delicate that I can&#x27;t even wear Clinique without triggering a rash!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend recommend that I try Bare Minerals and I decided to give it a shot since my long time standby, Lancome had begun to cause a reaction in my skin. A few weeks later, and the rosacea was gone along with the rashes! The coverage is far better than I&#x27;ve gotten with most liquid products and I have been surprised that after application, you don&#x27;t even feel it is there as you do with most powder based products. I cannot say enough good things about this product and am purchasing a starter kit for my 12 year old. I don&#x27;t want her to have to experiment and learn the hard way how to take care of her sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> After more than 10 years of using Revlon Colorstay liquid makeup, one use of the Bare Minerals powder foundation and I was sold for life.  With Revlon, my makeup looked heavy and pale and it didn&#x27;t really match my skin tone.  With the Bare Minerals Light Starter kit, I mixed the light and fairly light to find my perfect shade.  People around me have noticed a difference and have commented that my makeup looks very natural and soft. I should have done this a long time ago.  The only problem I have now is that I can&#x27;t stop looking in the mirror!  Powder foundation is the way to go!!</li>
            <li> This kit is what got me started with Bare Escentuals. A few years ago I had a bad reaction to my normal liquid foundation/concealer and had to stop wearing makeup for awhile. When I started wearing makeup again (3 years ago) this is what I started with and I have never looked back. Please note that I do not use the Skin Rev-er Upper (I didn&#x27;t like using it). It is easy to use and natural looking when worn. I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> After using Bare Minerals for a Saturday morning and a Sunday morning application I have a horrible sunburn-like dry itchy raw face for 3 days. I previously tried Cover Girl Mineral makeup and had the same reaction, but did not realize the connection until now. I have never had a reaction like this otherwise. Following research online-I discovered that many women suffer this same rash from the Bismuth Oxychloride contained in this product and some other brands like Cover Girl.   For those with Sensitive Skin, I would suggest finding a brand without that ingredient. There are several brands that do not contain it.</li>
            <li> I got this kit about a year ago and now I am hooked on Bare Escentuals makeup.  The thing that is great about the kit is you get to try many of the products without a HUGE investment.  My favorites are the foundation, the all-over face color and the moisturizer - but truly, all the products are wonderful.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I love that I can either brush it on quickly for light coverage, or spend a little more time with the concealer brush and get flawless full coverage.  Also since all of the makeup products are powder, it works very well with my oily skin.</li>
            <li> I finally gave in and tried this product after seeing parts of the infomercial for years.  I have extremely sensitive skin and almost everything else makes my skin break out in bumps and blotches.  This feels really good on the skin, and you don&#x27;t have to use much of the product to get good coverage.  When I first got the kit in the mail, I couldn&#x27;t believe that it was a two month&#x27;s supply, or that it would look that natural, and feel that good.  Matching my skin tone seemed like it would be extremely difficult since in the past, even the lightest foundation looked like a mask on my skin.  I ordered the fair kit after some deliberation, and it matched beautifully.  Both shades blended well with my skin, and I can have either a porcelain complexion, or one with slightly more color when I have more natural color in my skin.  I am over the age of 50, and this product gives me a younger, more refreshed look.  It does not sit on the skin, but blends in easily and flawlessly.  After buying the basic kit, I bought Beyond The Basics, and like that equally well, since it&#x27;s more stuff to play around with.  I just got the liner shadow and the flat liner brush.  This line is seriously addictive.  Once you buy one thing, you will start buying others, because in this case it makes perfect sense to use the same line to protect your skin.  A little bit does indeed go a long way, and for me, it&#x27;s worth it.  I don&#x27;t mess around with trying to cover things up or shading things, because I get a good look without a lot of fuss and time, and I don&#x27;t want makeup that looks made up.  This is expensive, and a serious investment, but you&#x27;re investing in yourself, and it only makes sense to be the best that you can be and feel.  I feel pretty and natural with this product. My skin likes it, and my husband likes the way I look, so I am very happy to keep using it!</li>
            <li> OK- I do recommend this product whole-heartedly, but I&#x27;m not going to hop on the almost cultish frenzied band wagon and say that it will change your life or anything.  It&#x27;s just really nice product.  I like that it&#x27;s extremely lightweight and subtle.  I am getting older (looking 40 down the barrel) and my dry dry dry skin has lost some of its glow and has gained some imperfections.  I get those dark circles under my eyes and have fine lines around my eyes and deeper lines on my forehead.  I refuse to wear liquid foundation (hate how it feels and looks) and find that conventional powder makes my already dry skin drier and that it sits in my aforementioned wrinkles... ugly!  This product is creamy feeling and offers coverage that seems to blend and bond with my skin, rather than sit on it.  It takes a little practice to use it- but it&#x27;s an easy habit to learn.  I know a lot of women have complained about the light/fairly light kit-- some have said the colors are just off and others have complained that it looks like a mask.  I&#x27;d guess that the mask-folks are using too much product-- a little goes a loooong way.  Err on the side of applying too little.  The ones who complain about the color?  Well- I guess I&#x27;d say you should go in to the store and try it first.  But I find that mixing the light and fairly light foundational colors works perfectly for me.  I&#x27;d absolutely recommend this product for its light weight and natural look.</li>
            <li> While the get started eyes is great, the foundation kit is messy and does not cover as well as advertised. Cover Girl liquid power foundation is better. The company this was ordered from was very slow with delivery.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and could never find a foundation that matched my skin tone.  In pictures I&#x27;d always come out looking like I had a white mask on.  I tried the Bare Minerals in light and LOVE the results.  No more red bloches on my face.  I do suggest going to Sephora&#x27;s or where ever else this product is sold, because I would have chosen the medium collection and instead I needed the light.  So it&#x27;s best to try it out first.</li>
            <li> This truly is a dream come true!  I&#x27;ve tried many types of makeup through the years, and had given up on using it.  It had always looked fake, heavy, and unnatural.  This stuff is FANTASTIC, quick, and easy to use.  I&#x27;m 51, and it even looks light and fresh on me! It makes my skin healthy looking!!  I JUST LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I only wish that I had discovered this product earlier and mirrors have certainly become a lot easier on my eyes, since buying this product.  At nearly 60, I was afraid that sure, it might be good on a 21 year old beautiful model, but what would it to do &#x27;me.&#x27;  First off let me tell you I have been using liquid foundations since I was 17 and each year of my life,they have been less and less satisfactory and an hour later, I have to reapply.  Now, I don&#x27;t carry make up in my purse at all. I don&#x27;t need to.  I apply it in the morning, it looks great all day long and into the night. All I need carry is lip gloss and I&#x27;m &#x27;good to go.&#x27;      I think the video is very important and less is better, because you can always &#x27;add.&#x27;  A good make up mirror is a recommended, so you really can see what you are doing. Before using this product, my skin was turning sort of red and splotchy and now even that is dissipating and what little is left, magically disappears.  One word, if you do have a lot of red in your face, you might want to forget the &#x27;warmth&#x27; color in the kit. (duh, why take it out to put it back in.)  I did however buy their eye make which come with blush and gloss and for the first time I can actually &#x27;wear&#x27; blush, so it&#x27;s all good.      I&#x27;ll never use anything else.</li>
            <li> I love Bare Minerals.  I also became tired of the caked-on feeling of regular foundations and wanted to try something different.  I have tried three other mineral brands, and Bare Minerals is by far my favorite.  It feels light and airy going on, especially the finishing Mineral Veil.  I have an acne and slight scaring problem, and when I use the concealer brush I get excellent coverage.  It isn&#x27;t perfect, but it covers up extremely well- much better than any department store liquid foundation I&#x27;ve used.  I have lighter skin and will usually mix more of the fairly light shade than I do the light shade and it blends in with my complexion very well.  There is a learning curve with this product and it takes some mixing to find the perfect match.  I also suggest only using the very tiny amount of the Warmth color, literally just the amount that is on the lid without shaking any more on.  I also suggest purchasing one of the colors, like Glee, to give extra glow.  I would suggest visiting a beauty store that offers Bare Minerals, trying the samples to see if you like it, and ordering the kit from Amazon for the best deal.  I have heard a number of valid reviews, both positive and negative- so try before you buy.  As for me, I will never go back!</li>
            <li> My first experience with bare minerals was easy, fast and well worked. I have watched others use the product for various reasons ie; acne, sensitive skin, uneven tones... and they had a good result. As I am over the 40 mark, older skin begins to show it&#x27;s age, with years of sun damage, fine blood vessels, reddening around your nose, occasional adult acne, etc. I was wary about spening money yet again on a product that claimed to do it all. But, I have used this lighter than air product. I feel it on my face, but when I look the complexion is even. I believe that continued use with a good skin care program and bare minerals could be a fantastic union.</li>
            <li> I was skeptic about buying this product because the price is much higher than the common drug-store makeup. However, after a few months of wavering back and forth between the decision, I went ahead and bought it. I am so glad I did!     Putting on makeup usually took me about ten or fifteen minutes--this included foundation, concealer, powder, two types of blush, and mascara. Putting on the Bare Minerals makeup takes me 3-5 minutes--this includes foundation, all-over face warmth, mineral veil and mascara (it would only take me about 2 1/2 minutes to put the makeup on if it weren&#x27;t for the mascara). The difference between drug-store makeup and Bare Minerals makeup is firstly, Bare Minerals doesn&#x27;t make you look like you have a mask on; secondly, it feels completely natural instead of thick and uncomfortable; thirdly, it definitely improves your skin tone. My skin is much smoother and creamier than it was before I started using it.      Now, to the effects of the makeup: I have several tiny moles scattered about my face, and I could never completely cover them up with a regular concealer because the concealer usually didn&#x27;t match my skin-tone and it would come off within a couple of hours. The Bare Minerals foundation covers every one of them up to perfection, and stays on all day.(Note: I first apply the foundation with the regular brush, and then I cover the moles up with the tinier brush--the tinier brush is used for applying concealer [the foundation can also be used as concealer] and eye-makeup). I also have dark circles under my eyes which aren&#x27;t very flattering--they are covered up beautifully with the Bare Minerals foundation (Note: Use the tinier brush for covering up dark circles--if you have any). As a teenager, it&#x27;s a given that I will get pimples--sometimes in very embarrassing spots, such as inbetween my eyes. Bare Minerals completely covers it up and it doesn&#x27;t even look as if there were pimples in the first place.      The all-over face warmth is wonderful. I don&#x27;t even need blush anymore (although I would still like some). It gives you a natural sun-kissed glow that other makeups often can&#x27;t achieve. (Note: Only apply a VERY little bit--this stuff goes a long way on a small amount).     The mineral veil I found to be quite surprising--it made my skin look like a celebrity&#x27;s. It adds a creamy and radiant glow that makes your skin look like it&#x27;s naturally beautiful. My skin isn&#x27;t that nice, so it&#x27;s really quite wonderful to be able to achieve that look.     I would recommend to go into the Bare Minerals store to have a professional help you decide which tone is best for your skin. If you ask to try some of their products, you can get a free makeover and decide which products you&#x27;re interested in. It&#x27;s also nice to be able to learn hands-on how to apply the makeup. I never watched the DVD because the lady who gave me the makeover showed me exactly how to put the makeup on and also showed me other different tricks. I got samples of eyeshadow and absolutely love it. Once I have enough money, I plan to go back and buy more of their products.     I highly recommend this product. It&#x27;s expensive, but in the long run it&#x27;s worth it because a little goes a long way with this makeup!</li>
            <li> I first used this product when I went to visit my mother. One use and I was convinced that I needed it. I never watched the instructional DVD and have done fine with it. However my mom did and she looked like a clown. She isn&#x27;t very good with make up though. After I showed her a different technique to apply it she looked much better. The warmth is very dark, I recommend glee instead. The product is very light and really doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re wearing any make up. I have a very hard time finding the right color foundation, but the fairly light blended very well and evened out my skin tone. I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I really did not like this product. I went from being a liquid foundation wearer to this and was very disappointed in the lack of coverage. I was attempting to use this as an alternate means of covering acne scars and uneven skin tones but the end result was yuck! I spent more time trying to apply and reapply to get the a similar result as the liquid foundation.  &lt;br /&gt;I feel this product is better for someone with less problem skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff truly makes your face look beautiful without looking cakey.  The Skin Rev-er Upper makes the makeup look even more amazing.  The only reason it got 4 stars from me was that I have some acne scars and they aren&#x27;t perfectly covered, like other people have claimed.  But they do have the Bisque concealer which does the trick.  I am truly a Bare Minerals addict!  The minerals last a long time too, since you don&#x27;t need to use tons at one time.</li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t break me out I&#x27;ll be sold for good - this is my first day using it.     I am accustomed to a Clinique liquid foundation base and then some drugstore-bought concealers. Never had terrible skin problems, but I&#x27;m definitely the more problematic side of normal and have sensitive skin as well. Being fair, my skin tone tends toward blotchiness.     I did use a Loreal QuickStick as a base under the Bare Minerals because I knew I needed a little more coverage than just a powder would offer. *However*, the Bare Minerals on top of this looks just great and feels SO much less gunky than the products I&#x27;ve been using. I have my hopes up that I can stick with these products!    I found the Fairly Light shade to be less yellow for me than the Light shade.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t worn makeup in many years. I wanted to try this product and it was offered at a discounted rate. It is amazing! I would recommend this product to anyone that hates the cream based foundations.</li>
            <li> Tried this product and it was easy to apply and really did have a very nice texture.  Received numerous complements</li>
            <li> Ditto to the other positive reviews.  A friend recommended this to me, and even as someone who generally didn&#x27;t wear much makeup before, I can&#x27;t believe how easy and flattering this makeup is.      I would recommend finding a mall near you and getting it applied the first time by a stylist vs. just watching the video.</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible!  Before I tell you about BareMinerals, let me tell you about my skin.  I have very oily skin and my pores are very noticeable.  I don&#x27;t really get breakouts, just the occaisional pimple.  Before I tried this product, I tried every oil control product out there.  Nothing worked.  By the end of the work day (I&#x27;m a school teacher), my makeup was gross and looked tired.  Liquid foundations never controled my oil and powders just caked on and made me look gross.  I was a little skeptical when I first tried this product, but it really does work.  I gives my skin a natural look and my skin appears less oily.  The vitamin lotion smoothes my skin and makes my pores appear more refined.  I love how lightweight the foundation and mineral veil feel.  Also, my makeup does not look cakey and tired at the end of the day.  I can reapply without the fear that I will make myself look worse.  The foundation colour is almost translucent, so there are no foundation lines and the mineral veil is feather-light.  I strongly recommend this product to any woman who is fed up with promises that do not follow through.</li>
            <li> This product just makes you feel more smooth without turning you into a mask.It&#x27;s so easy to put on in the morning before work just to feel polished in 2minutes.</li>
            <li> If you use and love powder makeup then this kit is for you. I just never good get enough coverage that worked for me to really use this product regularly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to try bare minerals and finally decided to do it and i&#x27;m so glad. i have some redness in my face and a few blemishes, but i don&#x27;t think this product would be a good choice for anyone who has a lot of skin problems to cover up. if you&#x27;ve been thinking about trying this, try it!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product at the urging of my bestfriend (she swares by it)when  commented on how great her skin always looked. I had mild acne(Now cleared up by burts bees face care)and it covered it flawlessly my skin looks incredible. In the pics from my bf wedding we both look perfect,not a spot on our faces. We looked radiantly beautiful yet very natural. I have since also turned 2 co-workers and my sister on to B.M. who now sware by it also.I will never use any other foundation again. I also love the eye cover called well rested. It helps to cover the purple under my eyes. And golden gate blush is perfect.</li>
            <li> I found it very complicated to use. Plus I needed to watch a DVD for that? Please. Even after watching the damn DVD and 1 hour of blending, I couldn&#x27;t get the right tone for my skin. I have gone back to my Black Opal; cheap but does it for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powder. not foundation...so if you want foundation, you&#x27;ll need to use foundation...then use their powder in addition.    The powder is nice powder....really nice powder, but still powder...and they market it as foundation when it&#x27;s not.    Ooh, but the warmth is the best bronzer ever...and I expected the brushes to be crap based on other reviews....and they really aren&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t regret buying it.</li>
            <li> I have extremely pale and fair skin.   I flush very easily and my skin is very sensitive.  I absolutely LOVE this make up. I would never go back to liquid make up again.      A few points, this make up really does let your skin show through.   So if you have freckles, you&#x27;re going to see them.   This isn&#x27;t a masky matte look you might be use to getting with liquid or cream foundation.  This does not cake.  Yes occasionally you might feel some shine but it&#x27;s quickly corrected with a pat of a tissue or a brush of the mineral veil.      The \\&quot;rever upper\\&quot; is nothing more than a moisturizer.  If you use one already that you like for less, stick with it.   This doesn&#x27;t do anything that special.      The brushes need to be cleaned!  Mild soap or face cleanser works.   Make sure you give them a good day to dry.   If the face brushes are even slightly damp, they won&#x27;t work.  I shoot my blow dryer on low the next morning on them just to make sure.     Warmth can be a nice eye color.  less is more with it.  If you are pale, you really can&#x27;t pull off an all over tan can you?  So don&#x27;t use it all over.  As a blush or eye color it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I got this product on the recommendation of a co-worker after a loreal product gave me a nasty rash on my face.  Well, after two weeks of use of the bare minerals not only is the rash gone but my skin looks bright and smoother - without any makeup even!  I&#x27;ve been fighting dull, tired looking skin for a few years, tried all sorts of products that claimed they would brighten, rejuvanate, etc., all a waste of money.  This makeup has actually done it!  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this stuff.   I sound like a infomercial, lol!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to ramble on too much cause i could but basically this is a great product. I recommend it to anyone that wears make-up. And the starter kit is an awesome awesome price. You get so much for the money. I will definitely order more Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li> I will never buy any other foundation again! I always wore liquid foundation and have tried several other mineral powders, but this is by far the best. It doesn&#x27;t break my face out and looks like I&#x27;m not even wearing makeup!</li>
