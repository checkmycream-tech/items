    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>with perfect hair I wld say satisfactory still on it</li>
            <li>I have been trying to find a replacement product to Perfect Image Solutions that was pulled from the market by the FDA...because it worked too well.</li>
            <li>It is Very good!</li>
            <li>it makes my head ITCH incredibly</li>
            <li>good luck!</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S GREAT.</li>
            <li>Nothing great on this product.</li>
            <li>It is a great product would buy again soon</li>
            <li>its a good product</li>
            <li>but it didnt solve my problem, i need anothers thing to solve it, but if u are looking for minoxidil its a good choice.</li>
            <li>I love this product If you use it as instructed it will give u great results.</li>
            <li>Just ordered more!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS COMPANY!</li>
            <li>But my opinions are honest.</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t seem as effective as others of its type.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However without Azelaic also, it is a good product for many.</li>
            <li>It has a soothe feeling and nice aroma.  </li>
            <li>it smells great nice n minty and rhats exactly how it feels on ir scalp love itt</li>
            <li>About smell its actually ok</li>
            <li>I can confidently style my hair as I require.</li>
            <li>I dont pluck any more</li>
            <li>Love love love this product been using it for a yr already</li>
            <li>Like it and will order more when finsih.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is better than Minoxidil alone.</li>
            <li>I say More?</li>
            <li>It helps my hair growth is okay</li>
            <li>Product says it takes two months to see results and do not use more than twice a day.</li>
            <li>IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY ADDS A BIT MORE TO THE &amp;#34;REGULAR&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>However, my fine hair is becoming thicker.</li>
            <li>But not as strong as Minoxidil + Azelaic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for over a month and have noticed baby fine hair filling in the edges.</li>
            <li>Liked it just fine - I feel like I&#x27;m using the real stuff instead of just some water in a bottle.</li>
            <li>Works so far so good, it&#x27;s been a couple months</li>
            <li>If your hair is really thinning, you&#x27;ll be able to see your scalp easily.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with results so far</li>
            <li>My hair loss was due to a build up of DHT on my scalp and this works beautifully for this type of hair loss.</li>
            <li>PRODUCT WHICH MAKES IT REALLY SPECIAL.</li>
            <li>; that is full again.</li>
            <li>It smells funny and strong.</li>
            <li>I was lucky to get this product during promotion.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a worthy sacrifice.</li>
            <li>I even cut it a few more times just to keep it healthy but this product does work I love it</li>
            <li>I just wish the new growth wasn&#x27;t white/grey makes me feel ancient:-)</li>
            <li>and when I first started using it, it made my over tweezed brows thicker than I believe they ever would have grown back in on there own.</li>
            <li>GIVEN THEIR ABILITY (MORE LIKELY WILLINGNESS) TO MAKE DELIVERIES QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY.</li>
            <li>You are not to use on any patchy hair loss (alopecia) which aside from general thinning would be why most women would purchase it</li>
            <li>My hair is really thick and beautiful.</li>
            <li>The hair feels good and maybe even a little thicker, not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>I had very scanty hair on the front side which was easily visible whenever i parted my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle has a dropper which makes it very easy to use and apply without creating a mess.</li>
            <li>Only apply to crown (top of head) which is exactly where my hair is thinning.</li>
            <li>But the odor needs to be eliminated first.</li>
            <li>I have used this product and the major drawback is the strong odor.</li>
            <li>it works as long as you are using the product after that the hair falls came back, the combination of biotin and healthy diet helped my hair loss better.</li>
            <li>all in all seems like it is worth the investment to such and important issue.</li>
            <li>I am not sure how good it works, but it is because I cannot use it unless my husband is out of town.</li>
            <li>Second, it&#x27;s really easy to keep it from dripping on your face or making your hair greasy.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for the past year and I must say I am very very pleased with the results, really helped regrow hair where it was thinning!</li>
            <li>I have seen a great improvement in the length of my hair, previously from my ears and presently now pass my shoulders.</li>
            <li>have a high hairline and with advancing age noticing my hair thinning, and hairline getting even higher,</li>
            <li>my hubby and growth was much faster for him, within 2 months.</li>
            <li>I started using it on the crown of my head and it started to grow fast.</li>
            <li>Had it month didn&#x27;t she much of a change</li>
            <li>but I still had a very itchy scalp and had to discontinue use.</li>
            <li>just a little results, need to use more to really decide .</li>
            <li>but I can already notice new growth!</li>
            <li>The main problem I have with this product is the fact that any/all regrowth is temporary.  </li>
            <li>The smell is not terrible, a little goes a long way and overall I&#x27;m sure it works</li>
            <li>and WOW this really works.</li>
            <li>safe to use everyday and the working time varied from person to person.</li>
            <li>but gradually i noticed new baby hairs on the front scalp.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the new formula smells as if peppermint has been added to it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seeing new growth around hairline.</li>
            <li>My hairline started thinning years ago I came across this and read the reviews and thought let me try it well after using it for 30 days now I SEE NEW HAIRS</li>
            <li>and I see new hair growing</li>
            <li>and she is sprouting new hairs on the areas where this product was applied.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using for a couple months I noticed new baby hairs coming in, a year later there is a significant improvement in regrowth and hair volume (I only used it around the face, hairline area.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When this happens, pat around your face/hairline with a small towel or wash rag to make sure it doesn&#x27;t get on your face.</li>
            <li>This is the first regrowth product that actually work.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the exact same ingredients that is in Rogaine for women, save your money.</li>
            <li>It does have a mint smell, but the natural oils/essential oils that I use in my  hair absorbs it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this for one month and can really tell the difference.</li>
            <li>this product made my hair grow back fast</li>
            <li>The additional ingredients of Minoxidil, Azelaic Acid, Emu oil, copper peptide makes this a fantastic all round addition to my hair care regimen.</li>
            <li>It is now frizzy and completely damaged as well and just has to grow out.</li>
            <li>BUT the downside of it far outweighs the upside.</li>
            <li>- I highly recommend some supplements I take that have actually turned around a baling spot.  </li>
            <li>I think my scalp is a little more itchy because there is an alcohol base in this product, but drinking a lot of water, and  massaging my scalp helps a great deal.</li>
            <li>and I have to say that I had a area that was bulding that has completely grown back this product works</li>
            <li>LOTS of new growth all over and its getting really long.</li>
            <li>Hair on my crown is full and thick and I had an area &amp;#34;cow lick&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Back to &amp;#34;dabbing&amp;#34; - you barely need to squeeze the dropper, just enough to get one bit of a drop at a time and then dab dab dab where there&#x27;s no hair.</li>

            <li> I had to cut my hair really short due to damage n</li>
            <li> I would not use any other topical</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s smells like dry</li>
            <li> The only draw back is the dropper because it runs down my face so for my next supply I have a small spray bottle.</li>
            <li> IN LESS THAN TWO WEEKS OF USING, ONLY THING</li>
            <li> Total waste did nothing for my hair never will buy this again</li>
            <li> I have no real comments on the product.  </li>
            <li> I started using it a few years back when thick eyebrows came back in style.</li>
            <li> So I am modifying the review and changing it to 5 star because product has other ingredients to help reducing hair</li>
            <li> Bougth it for a relative, not sure if it is working for her.</li>
            <li> I use daily just not sure if working.  </li>
            <li> I no longer have the cow lick</li>
            <li> It says use .5 to 1 ml and apply directly to scalp and all it takes is a thin coating.</li>
            <li> Seems to give some result, if slow, and occasionally irritates.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s coming back slowly.  </li>
            <li> I notice less hair falling out and some baby hair start to grow..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month and a half now</li>
            <li> Not sure if will order an additional bottle once this one is empty.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to address a few things I&#x27;ve seen in the previous reviews regarding (1) smell and (2) application issues.</li>
            <li> But it took a little longer for me to see the difference</li>
            <li> my hair started to fall out in little</li>
            <li> First, the &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34; smell is very faint.</li>
            <li> Will post again in a few months to update on any results.</li>
            <li> I had been using this product for a few months plus biotin</li>
            <li> it takes a few months to see results but works .</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I bought this serum a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I will give it another few weeks and see.</li>
            <li> IT FEEL STIFF ON MY HEAD,,OTHER</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if there will be regrowth</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 6 months</li>
            <li> ORDERED FROM THEM IN THE PAST</li>
            <li> , IT HARDLY MATTERS</li>
            <li> It works just as well as the expensive &#x27;name brands&#x27; at half the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> In fact it is growing like crazy.  </li>
            <li> Went bad after a month</li>
            <li> and I had a bad reaction to it.</li>
            <li> And, it has an annoying mint aroma.  </li>
            <li> very disappointed.</li>

            <li> No improvement and it makes my head ITCH incredibly</li>
            <li> I bought this Item while back and it seems to work. I notice less hair falling out and some baby hair start to grow.. About smell its actually ok, it&#x27;s smells like dry orange.&lt;br /&gt;Natalie, TX</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a year now and I think it works well. I have dreads, and noticed that my locks were getting thinner around my hairline in the front and the crown of my head. I took pictures before, three months in and now. What a difference!! I can even see that the diameter of my once thinning dreads having become thicker. It does have a mint smell, but the natural oils/essential oils that I use in my  hair absorbs it. I think my scalp is a little more itchy because there is an alcohol base in this product, but drinking a lot of water, and  massaging my scalp helps a great deal. Ordering now!!</li>
            <li> I will continue to order this item.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for quite some time and WOW this really works. I had very scanty hair on the front side which was easily visible whenever i parted my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle has a dropper which makes it very easy to use and apply without creating a mess. Its a non greasy liquid so no issue there either.&lt;br /&gt;Only the affected area needs to be taken care of with this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Its safe to use everyday and the working time varied from person to person. I had purchased the one for men&#x27;s for my hubby and growth was much faster for him, within 2 months. But it took a little longer for me to see the difference but gradually i noticed new baby hairs on the front scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Finally days of non parting the hair are gone. I can confidently style my hair as I require. I was lucky to get this product during promotion. But my opinions are honest.</li>
            <li> This product does work. I actually dont use it for my scalp. I started using it a few years back when thick eyebrows came back in style. I dont pluck any more but I often groom my brows with a brow razor and change up the shape sometimes for a different look. This product makes the hair grow in faster and when I first started using it, it made my over tweezed brows thicker than I believe they ever would have grown back in on there own. This is the third time Ive bought it but the reason I&#x27;m giving 4 stars instead of 5 is it used to have no scent and the new formula smells as if peppermint has been added to it. It also tingles now too. Still, I will buy it again when I run out.</li>
            <li> The reason I&#x27;m only giving 3 stars is because I just started using it. I just wanted to address a few things I&#x27;ve seen in the previous reviews regarding (1) smell and (2) application issues. First, the &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34; smell is very faint. You can smell it when you open the bottle - that&#x27;s it. It doesn&#x27;t follow you through the day or anything. Second, it&#x27;s really easy to keep it from dripping on your face or making your hair greasy. It says use .5 to 1 ml and apply directly to scalp and all it takes is a thin coating. Fill the dropper to about the .75 ml mark. Then &amp;#34;dab&amp;#34; it on your scalp. If your hair is really thinning, you&#x27;ll be able to see your scalp easily. If you can&#x27;t, then congratulations! You don&#x27;t need this. Back to &amp;#34;dabbing&amp;#34; - you barely need to squeeze the dropper, just enough to get one bit of a drop at a time and then dab dab dab where there&#x27;s no hair. Only apply to crown (top of head) which is exactly where my hair is thinning. When you apply towards front of crown (towards your face) it does have a tendency to drip towards your face (it&#x27;s liquid and your head is probably tilted so you can see it in the mirror). You can feel when it begins to drip. When this happens, pat around your face/hairline with a small towel or wash rag to make sure it doesn&#x27;t get on your face. Massage it into your scalp with your fingertips. Wash your hands! Will post again in a few months to update on any results. Also, it fully states that you need to keep using it to get results and maintain results (avoid going back to losing hair), so be prepared for that if you decide to go for it.</li>
            <li> Total waste did nothing for my hair never will buy this again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for one month and can really tell the difference. I no longer have the cow lick I had in back of my head. I&#x27;m seeing new growth around hairline. Just ordered more!</li>
            <li> Seems to give some result, if slow, and occasionally irritates.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t seem as effective as others of its type.  And, it has an annoying mint aroma.  Making it odorless would be a plus.</li>
            <li> with perfect hair I wld say satisfactory still on it so llets see how it goes say nxt 3 months</li>
            <li> Liked it just fine - I feel like I&#x27;m using the real stuff instead of just some water in a bottle.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how good it works, but it is because I cannot use it unless my husband is out of town. It smells funny and strong.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product been using it for a yr already n I had to cut my hair really short due to damage n this product made my hair grow back fast I even cut it a few more times just to keep it healthy but this product does work I love it n it smells great nice n minty and rhats exactly how it feels on ir scalp love itt</li>
            <li> My hairline started thinning years ago I came across this and read the reviews and thought let me try it well after using it for 30 days now I SEE NEW HAIRS I am now ordering my second bottle I use it twice a day before bed and in the morning I message it into my front hairline. I recommend this product but you have to have patience. The only draw back is the dropper because it runs down my face so for my next supply I have a small spray bottle.</li>
            <li> It has worked for me. I saw growth around my edges within a week. I started using it on the crown of my head and it started to grow fast.</li>
            <li> I have used this product and the major drawback is the strong odor. I do not know if it works yet. But the odor needs to be eliminated first.</li>
            <li> Bought the product about a month ago and have noticed difference already. Also like the smell, mint smell. Does not make my hair sticky or greasy. Like it and will order more when finsih.</li>
            <li> I gave earlier one star because product image included Azelaic acid and I received without Azelaic. If the product does not have Azeliac acid not, the image should be changed to reflect it correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However without Azelaic also, it is a good product for many. So I am modifying the review and changing it to 5 star because product has other ingredients to help reducing hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is better than Minoxidil alone. But not as strong as Minoxidil + Azelaic.</li>
            <li> Went bad after a month</li>
            <li> I like the way this product goes on your hair. The hair feels good and maybe even a little thicker, not greasy at all. I&#x27;m not sure if there will be regrowth yet so I couldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Anything with Minoxidil in it helps with thinning hair.  I&#x27;ve heard the FDA is thinking of upping it to 4%, which would help.  I use this for the thinning hair on my crown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT - I highly recommend some supplements I take that have actually turned around a baling spot.  SeaNuHair from IVL.  Plus I take biotin and thyroid supplements.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for about three weeks so I don&#x27;t see any difference yet. I think it takes about three months to start seeing short hairs coming in.  I will update in a couple of months to let you know if anything happens.</li>
            <li> I had been using this product for a few months plus biotin 5000 mcg and I see new hair growing it takes a few months to see results but works .</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a difference since I purchased it.</li>
            <li> It works!  It works!  It works!  Need I say More?</li>
            <li> Had it month didn&#x27;t she much of a change</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my hair. very disappointed. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Bougth it for a relative, not sure if it is working for her.</li>
            <li> I have frontal baldness along the edges that runs in my family. I&#x27;ve used this product for over a month and have noticed baby fine hair filling in the edges. Although I use this product all over my hair, I only notice the edges because I already have long hair. However, my fine hair is becoming thicker. Was looking to order a 5% solution but I guess that&#x27;s not offered in this product line.</li>
            <li> just a little results, need to use more to really decide . all in all seems like it is worth the investment to such and important issue. good luck!</li>
            <li> It helps my hair growth is okay</li>
            <li> Used this last year it worked wonders but after having my son lost my edges again. Started again 2 months ago and it&#x27;s coming back slowly.  I just wish the new growth wasn&#x27;t white/grey makes me feel ancient:-) that&#x27;s one of the effects of this treatment but it&#x27;s a worthy sacrifice.</li>
            <li> I wish I could put my pictures here ...&lt;br /&gt;From bald to have my hair back !!!!&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful !!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too soon to tell if the product works you have to use it for a minimum of 8 weeks to see results so for now i give it 3 stars.  I thing to note is that it does turn your relaxed her back faster.</li>
            <li> I am placing my third order because it works. My hair loss was due to a build up of DHT on my scalp and this works beautifully for this type of hair loss. The additional ingredients of Minoxidil, Azelaic Acid, Emu oil, copper peptide makes this a fantastic all round addition to my hair care regimen. Hair on my crown is full and thick and I had an area &amp;#34;cow lick&amp;#34; that is full again. My hair is really thick and beautiful. I would not use any other topical this one has everything!</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS SHOWING SOME RESULTS. I WILL KEEP YOU GUYS UPDATED.</li>
            <li> I bought this serum a few weeks ago. I haven&#x27;t seen any big difference yet. I will give it another few weeks and see.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that with the extra ingredients that this wouldn&#x27;t cause my scalp to itch but I still had a very itchy scalp and had to discontinue use.</li>
            <li> YES , i DO SEE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN MY HAIR GROWTH. IN LESS THAN TWO WEEKS OF USING, ONLY THING IT FEEL STIFF ON MY HEAD,,OTHER THAN THAT IT&#x27;S GREAT.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any result yet</li>
            <li> This is the first regrowth product that actually work. My hair stylist and I have seen a great improvement in the length of my hair, previously from my ears and presently now pass my shoulders. I also use the Hair Loss/Regrowth Shampoo. This is a winner.</li>
            <li> Works so far so good, it&#x27;s been a couple months and she is sprouting new hairs on the areas where this product was applied.</li>
            <li> it works as long as you are using the product after that the hair falls came back, the combination of biotin and healthy diet helped my hair loss better.</li>
            <li> I have no real comments on the product.  I use daily just not sure if working.  I&#x27;m still trying it.  Not sure if will order an additional bottle once this one is empty.</li>
            <li> It seems to be working as I see some improvement on my hair loss.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a short period of time,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the product to anyone having hair loss problems.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the exact same ingredients that is in Rogaine for women, save your money. You can even buy generic rogaine</li>
            <li> Everyone may not get the same results; however, for me...after over 2 months of use...my hair started to fall out in little clumps.&lt;br /&gt;I dreaded washing my hair. It is now frizzy and completely damaged as well and just has to grow out. I regret using it every day.  I have been trying to find a replacement product to Perfect Image Solutions that was pulled from the market by the FDA...because it worked too well.</li>
            <li> The main problem I have with this product is the fact that any/all regrowth is temporary.  You are not to use on any patchy hair loss (alopecia) which aside from general thinning would be why most women would purchase it (no mention of this in the description of course).  The smell is not terrible, a little goes a long way and overall I&#x27;m sure it works BUT the downside of it far outweighs the upside. Sorry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often leave reviews but I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 6 months and I have to say that I had a area that was bulding that has completely grown back this product works</li>
            <li> This did not work for me and I had a bad reaction to it. I would not use this again.</li>
            <li> I love this product If you use it as instructed it will give u great results. It is Very good!</li>
            <li> its a good product but it didnt solve my problem, i need anothers thing to solve it, but if u are looking for minoxidil its a good choice.</li>
            <li> I apply daily and await hair growth.  It has a soothe feeling and nice aroma.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any growth as yet for I need time.  I don&#x27;t expect miracles so, I simply follow directions and wait patiently.</li>
            <li> This stuff has been working wonders for me.  I use it along with premium organic argon shampoo and condition, plus mega hair dht blocker supplement and my hair is no longer falling out in the bunches.  In fact it is growing like crazy.  LOTS of new growth all over and its getting really long.</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell.  Product says it takes two months to see results and do not use more than twice a day.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with results so far</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the past year and I must say I am very very pleased with the results, really helped regrow hair where it was thinning! It works just as well as the expensive &#x27;name brands&#x27; at half the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a high hairline and with advancing age noticing my hair thinning, and hairline getting even higher, especially it was noticeable on one side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using for a couple months I noticed new baby hairs coming in, a year later there is a significant improvement in regrowth and hair volume (I only used it around the face, hairline area.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Nothing great on this product.</li>
            <li> Not working but I ordered it so i will use it</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS COMPANY! I&#x27;VE ORDERED FROM THEM IN THE PAST AND, WHILE THEY&#x27;RE NOT PART OF AMAZON PRIME, IT HARDLY MATTERS GIVEN THEIR ABILITY (MORE LIKELY WILLINGNESS) TO MAKE DELIVERIES QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY ADDS A BIT MORE TO THE &amp;#34;REGULAR&amp;#34; PRODUCT WHICH MAKES IT REALLY SPECIAL. I&#x27;M HOOKED ON THE PRODUCT AND THE COMPANY!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month and a half now and I can already tell a difference!  I&#x27;ve read it takes about 4 months to work but I can already notice new growth!</li>
            <li> This product has help my hair grow back around the edges!! It is a great product would buy again soon</li>
