            <li>I love controlling the pressure &amp; water temperature.  </li>
            <li>The WaterPik pulses the water, so it impacts my teeth and gum line with more force than even the highest setting on the ShowerFloss.</li>

            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>Has been in use for about a month and is working fine.</li>
            <li>I prefer this to countertops models because you can get much more powerful water stream if you can tolerate it.</li>
            <li>This is a simple and very effective way to keep your teeth clean.  </li>
            <li>Sure its easy to hook up, but within a couple uses the straight rounded stream becomes a fanned out pattern that feels like its slicing your gums.</li>
            <li>No awkward string!</li>
            <li>Thank you for offering this fast and easy way to take care of oral hygiene!</li>
            <li>The water pressure is more than adequate, but it&#x27;s a steady flow.</li>
            <li>It came in the mail quickly.  </li>
            <li>Overall I could not be more satisfied with this one.</li>
            <li>The very first time I used it, I felt like I just came out of a dentist office.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t easy to install a women couldn&#x27;t really do it&lt;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not quite as good as I expected.</li>
            <li>Good idea but design problems - restricts shower flow and other issues</li>
            <li>other wise</li>
            <li>it is somewhat of a challenge getting it balanced just right and hooked up correctly.</li>
            <li>sure to start out soft and work up to the higher setting or you&#x27;ll hurt your gums.  </li>
            <li>Initially caused significant tickling, but that is handled easily by varying the technique.</li>
            <li>Still the ShowerFloss costs much less and will probably do a good job.</li>
            <li>(the directions say to use it, but I tried it without first.)</li>
            <li>and that is the reason that the first shower floss died).</li>
            <li>Bought this for my grand-daughter, and now my son wants one!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I was okay with that because I let it hang to drain all the water and prevent bacteria from growing if it had water left in the hose.  </li>
            <li>Replaced 10 year old unit with new one which has been improved and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>After continuously skipping the daily irrigation using other products made for the purpose, because of the inconvenience of the set-up and take-down to use them, I have found the ShowerFloss a great addition to my shower routine.   </li>
            <li>Flossing my teeth is such an easy thing to do now.</li>
            <li>One nozzle doesnt work very well.</li>
            <li>It is very convenient though.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve got something stuck, you still need real</li>
            <li>I really like shower flossers</li>
            <li>much writing</li>
            <li>I broke my original one when moving last year.  </li>
            <li>but the stream malformed so fast, because its too soft of plastic!!</li>
            <li>There is no way to regulate the flow and it is not as nice as our old one of the same brand; ( and the hose is too short)</li>
            <li>Installation was simple and quick.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend</li>
            <li>Easy and efficient, all the mess washes away in the shower.</li>
            <li>no more mess works great</li>
            <li>Works great and no more mess on my bathroom mirror.</li>
            <li>Since it is entirely plastic, I don&#x27;t know how long it will last, and I wish it pulsed more like a normal waterpik, but I do use it every morning when I shower.</li>
            <li>May buy another for 19 year old daughter who loves it.</li>
            <li>Water strength is controlled by a wheel at the valve near the shower head.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It got here early and works as promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect it to completely take the place of floss though.  </li>
            <li>I hate flossing, this is almost a perfect solution.</li>
            <li>Our dentist recommended this for an easy way for the lazy people who are not faithful with flossing.  </li>
            <li>no mess all over mirrors.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also not limited to a little container of some magical blue or green fluid that runs out so quickly.</li>
            <li>My other issue is that I shower either the first thing in the morning or before dinner, so I still use my countertop WaterPik after meals?</li>
            <li>The first one lasted about five years with daily use, and cost about half of what I paid for this new one, shipping included.</li>
            <li>It has a much stronger stream then I ever expected.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s so much more convenient than filling and emptying the Water Pik chamber, not to mention a lot less messy since you don&#x27;t have to worry about spraying the walls.</li>
            <li>Easier than using dental floss and less expensive in the long run, not to mention the great checkups at the dentist.</li>
            <li>It takes only half a minute to clean your gums and the mess stays in the shower.</li>

            <li> Easy and efficient, all the mess washes away in the shower.</li>
            <li> no more mess works great</li>
            <li> Works great and no more mess on my bathroom mirror.</li>
            <li> Since it is entirely plastic, I don&#x27;t know how long it will last, and I wish it pulsed more like a normal waterpik, but I do use it every morning when I shower.</li>
            <li> May buy another for 19 year old daughter who loves it.</li>
            <li> Water strength is controlled by a wheel at the valve near the shower head.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It got here early and works as promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect it to completely take the place of floss though.  </li>
            <li> I hate flossing, this is almost a perfect solution.</li>
            <li> Our dentist recommended this for an easy way for the lazy people who are not faithful with flossing.  </li>
            <li> no mess all over mirrors.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also not limited to a little container of some magical blue or green fluid that runs out so quickly.</li>
            <li> My other issue is that I shower either the first thing in the morning or before dinner, so I still use my countertop WaterPik after meals?</li>
            <li> The first one lasted about five years with daily use, and cost about half of what I paid for this new one, shipping included.</li>
            <li> It has a much stronger stream then I ever expected.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s so much more convenient than filling and emptying the Water Pik chamber, not to mention a lot less messy since you don&#x27;t have to worry about spraying the walls.</li>
            <li> Easier than using dental floss and less expensive in the long run, not to mention the great checkups at the dentist.</li>
            <li> It takes only half a minute to clean your gums and the mess stays in the shower.</li>
            <li> Having enough trouble getting myself to wake up with a cup of coffee and then throwing myself into the shower, this gadget creates enough of an invigorating feeling that no self-respecting plaque can hide between your teeth.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with regulating pressure but otherwise nice.</li>
            <li> The entire unit probably costs less than $3.00 to make.</li>
            <li> I wanted something that did not make a mess around my bathroom sink or run out of water in the middle of using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the water pik and it makes such a mess</li>
            <li> I got this for my 14 year old son who has braces and has a hard time getting his teeth cleaned well.  </li>
            <li> picks did the same thing within a few uses.  </li>
            <li> far as the mounting, my shower is very tiny, so when we put it behind the shower head, my shower head didn&#x27;t work for me as I couldn&#x27;t adjust it to spray down on me - it went out at the wall.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought it for two other people since.</li>
            <li> I came across the Showerfloss after searching on the internet to see what other alternatives to a Waterpik was out there.</li>
            <li> Because we have a heavy shower head with a long flexible metal hose on it, we connected a metal T-valve, so the plastic of the shower floss was not stressed.  </li>
            <li> I cant adjust the water pressure unless I turn down the faucet.  </li>
            <li> Before getting the Showerfloss, my gums used to bleed everytime I brushed and flossed, now there is no more bleeding!</li>
            <li> Yes, it does the job it&#x27;s supposed to, without the water mess in the sink.  </li>
            <li> and I like the mess in the</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the one that attached to the faucet, but it didn&#x27;t work well at all and made a mess and eventually broke.</li>
            <li> I down graded this purchase due to the over &amp;#34;high price&amp;#34; for the unit, and the unbelievable &amp;#34;cost of shipping&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to but works well.</li>
            <li> I dont use it - so it was a waste</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I got this for my 14 year old son who has braces and has a hard time getting his teeth cleaned well.  It was easy to install once we got the plummers tape. (the directions say to use it, but I tried it without first.) I was skeptical, but the dentist recommended it.  Both my kids are using it and they say it works well.</li>
            <li> I thought I purchased a &amp;#34;showerpik&amp;#34; brand, I have one of those, This unit has a plastic connection with a plastic turn valve, seems cheapy, My shower pik is metal and nice lever on &amp; off.  I&#x27;ll try it and see how it does</li>
            <li> After continuously skipping the daily irrigation using other products made for the purpose, because of the inconvenience of the set-up and take-down to use them, I have found the ShowerFloss a great addition to my shower routine.   So easy to use, no muss and no fuss.</li>
            <li> Arrived as advertised.  Easy to set up.  A little tough to regulate the intensity of the flow. Somewhat hard to get used to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d pay four times what I paid for this.  You can use it for at least five other things than flossing and  I lost no water pressure at all.  I&#x27;ve bought it for two other people since.</li>
            <li> Easy and efficient, all the mess washes away in the shower. No awkward string! love it! I think my gums are  loving it too.</li>
            <li> I hate flossing, this is almost a perfect solution. Wish the stream was more laminar though.</li>
            <li> works awesome save counter space.</li>
            <li> Love the shower floss.  Cake within days, install was easy</li>
            <li> So easy to use and install. I love controlling the pressure &amp; water temperature.  It does a great job fast &amp; easy.  Flossing my teeth is such an easy thing to do now.</li>
            <li> Easy installation, easy operation.  Since it is entirely plastic, I don&#x27;t know how long it will last, and I wish it pulsed more like a normal waterpik, but I do use it every morning when I shower.</li>
            <li> The water pressure is more than adequate, but it&#x27;s a steady flow. The WaterPik pulses the water, so it impacts my teeth and gum line with more force than even the highest setting on the ShowerFloss. That&#x27;s probably why the ShowerPik has a battery and costs so much more. Still the ShowerFloss costs much less and will probably do a good job. My other issue is that I shower either the first thing in the morning or before dinner, so I still use my countertop WaterPik after meals?</li>
            <li> Does the job without taking any space on the bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> Garbage, leaks like crazy.</li>
            <li> works great. Feels goood on my gums. I dont like the tubing hanging in shower- unattractive, but not in ythe way.</li>
            <li> Good idea but design problems - restricts shower flow and other issues</li>
            <li> A bit clunky to turn on/off; would be better with a flow-powered pulser.</li>
            <li> I purchased my SECOND shower floss recently. The first one lasted about five years with daily use, and cost about half of what I paid for this new one, shipping included. The product works well in removing food particles from hard to reach places between my teeth. (I have very hard water and that is the reason that the first shower floss died). The entire unit probably costs less than $3.00 to make. I down graded this purchase due to the over &amp;#34;high price&amp;#34; for the unit, and the unbelievable &amp;#34;cost of shipping&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite as good as I expected. One nozzle doesnt work very well. It is very convenient though.</li>
            <li> My wife and I love this product! It is well designed and constructed. It is easy to install and use in the shower. It does a great job flossing and is a real bargain! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Easy to install and easier to use than floss. May buy another for 19 year old daughter who loves it.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with regulating pressure but otherwise nice.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my grand-daughter, and now my son wants one!</li>
            <li> Replaced 10 year old unit with new one which has been improved and absolutely love it. Easy to install and use.</li>
            <li> Excellent product that was recommended by my dentist.  I have used it daily since it arrived in the mail.  I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Our third shower floss system. We love it.</li>
            <li> My dentist loves this!!</li>
            <li> Better value than the others. I coupled this with a Chrome Delta Faucet U4922-PK Shower Arm Diverter so as to not wear out the plastic valve on the shower floss. Awesome setup!</li>
            <li> Easy to instal! So easy to use!</li>
            <li> Works fine. Still getting used to a solid stream vs the pulse of a traditional water pick.</li>
            <li> There is no way to regulate the flow and it is not as nice as our old one of the same brand; ( and the hose is too short)</li>
            <li> I read all  the reviews on all the shower flosses and purchased the ShowerFloss. Easy to install and works great.</li>
            <li> Easy to install. I use it more often as it is handy in the shower. My dental hygenist should be happy as she is always on me to floss or waterpik.</li>
            <li> Fantastic wonderful product but if you have a shower massager unit you will probably want to go back to a standard shower head other wise it is somewhat of a challenge getting it balanced just right and hooked up correctly.</li>
            <li> Although convenient, I find it difficult to adjust the pressure. Sometimes too hard and sometimes too soft.&lt;br /&gt;Installation was easy.</li>
            <li> I use it every time I shower.</li>
            <li> Great product...easy &amp;#34;neat&amp;#34; way to floss your teeth.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does the job it&#x27;s supposed to, without the water mess in the sink.  Love it, and I installed it myself in minutes.</li>
            <li> Easy and convenient way to waterpik in shower. Takes only a minute to assemble and screw between shower head and pipe. Use a bit of thread tape to ensure no leaks. Comes with a stick-on holder to hold the extra tip plus 2 toothbrushes. Water strength is controlled by a wheel at the valve near the shower head. My water pressure is not very strong, so I do not get the power generated by my kid&#x27;s ordinary Water Pik. But it&#x27;s so much more convenient than filling and emptying the Water Pik chamber, not to mention a lot less messy since you don&#x27;t have to worry about spraying the walls. And the convenience of using in the shower makes sure you irrigate more often.</li>
            <li> Our dentist recommended this for an easy way for the lazy people who are not faithful with flossing.  (not me, one of the kids)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It got here early and works as promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with the product and the company.</li>
            <li> My second one in 15 years.  Dental cleanings eliminated.  My dentist says I have great teeth and gums he doesn&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s because of this.  He&#x27;s wrong it wasn&#x27;t always that way.</li>
            <li> This works great!  It is very easy to use!  This was recommended  by my dentist.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> If you use the &amp;#34;Modona diverter valve&amp;#34;With it, the shower floss Is powerful and cleans great.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE SECOND ONE I HAVE ORDERED. MY DENTIST RECOMMENDED THE SHOWERFLOSS AND IT IS TERRIFIC.&lt;br /&gt;IT HAS HELPED MY GUMS ALONG WITH GETTING ALL THE PARTICLE&#x27;S OUT OF MY TEETH. JUST LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my husband. He has been using it every day and I can see a difference already in his gum health. It was so easy to attach and is very easy to use (if it wasn&#x27;t, I don&#x27;t think my husband would use it). Thank you for offering this fast and easy way to take care of oral hygiene! My husband&#x27;s teeth and gums thank you also!! :)</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of them and today in the mail I only got one of them.  My girlfriend raves about this product but today I&#x27;m not that happy</li>
            <li> Having enough trouble getting myself to wake up with a cup of coffee and then throwing myself into the shower, this gadget creates enough of an invigorating feeling that no self-respecting plaque can hide between your teeth. You can use it in your sower for one of those forever relaxing, end-of-day soaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also not limited to a little container of some magical blue or green fluid that runs out so quickly. This is it! You can stand in the shower and use good dental care in the process. It has a good control so that the pressure doesn&#x27;t bore a hole in your gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually have TWO of these items: one at the sink in the bathroom and the second in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FINALLY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something that actually does what it promises! &lt;huzzah!&gt;</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t easy to install a women couldn&#x27;t really do it&lt;br /&gt;It is a great concept but I can&#x27;t regulate the water flow</li>
            <li> I came across the Showerfloss after searching on the internet to see what other alternatives to a Waterpik was out there. I wanted something that did not make a mess around my bathroom sink or run out of water in the middle of using it. I found the Showerfloss online and ordered it. Installation was simple and quick. The very first time I used it, I felt like I just came out of a dentist office. It reaches in places floss can&#x27;t and the water pressure coming out gets all the debris out from between my teeth. Before getting the Showerfloss, my gums used to bleed everytime I brushed and flossed, now there is no more bleeding! I wish I had found this sooner!</li>
            <li> no more mess works great</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Very easy installation. Works great. I got it for my daughter who has gum problems and hates to floss.  She uses this every day and I see an improvement after only 2 weeks. I bought this after a very strong recommendation from a dentist. I&#x27;m very happy I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought this. This product is different. It&#x27;s way way way better than philips sonicare Airfloss &amp; Waterpik flosser.</li>
            <li> I can not say yet if my cleanings at the dental office will be better, but this tool seems to do what was proclaimed. It takes a little getting used to but works well. Initially caused significant tickling, but that is handled easily by varying the technique.</li>
            <li> BEEN USING THIS SINCE 1982.  I DON&#x27;T FLOSS AND JUST USE THIS IN THE SHOWER.  I AM A RETIRED DENTIST AND BOUGHT THIS ONE FOR MY SON IN LAW WHO ID GETTING PERIO POCKETS(GUM DISEASE)</li>
            <li> no mess all over mirrors.  I prefer this to countertops models because you can get much more powerful water stream if you can tolerate it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Shower Floss for 15 years.  I broke my original one when moving last year.  This is a simple and very effective way to keep your teeth clean.  Just take 30 seconds during your shower and your teeth and gums are fully cleaned and refreshed.  Easier than using dental floss and less expensive in the long run, not to mention the great checkups at the dentist.</li>
            <li> Works great and no more mess on my bathroom mirror.</li>
            <li> Awesome, no more flossing Teeth Feel Great!</li>
            <li> This is easy to install and fairly priced.  Works great!  It takes only half a minute to clean your gums and the mess stays in the shower.</li>
            <li> Sure its easy to hook up, but within a couple uses the straight rounded stream becomes a fanned out pattern that feels like its slicing your gums. It also becomes a wider hole so the pressure drops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both picks did the same thing within a few uses.  I am not biting the tip, I am not dragging it on my teeth... but the stream malformed so fast, because its too soft of plastic!!</li>
            <li> I love this easy to use shower flosser.  It gives great results, clean teeth and healthier gums all while showering!</li>
            <li> This product does what it should do, which is rinse away \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; from under your gums and between them, to an extent.  Don&#x27;t expect it to completely take the place of floss though.  If you&#x27;ve got something stuck, you still need real floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to start out soft and work up to the higher setting or you&#x27;ll hurt your gums.  The powerful spray can damage delicate tissues so be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the mounting, my shower is very tiny, so when we put it behind the shower head, my shower head didn&#x27;t work for me as I couldn&#x27;t adjust it to spray down on me - it went out at the wall.  So, we had to get another piece from the hardware store to make it work better, not perfect, but better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I like what the product does and it works for my purposes so I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> Product is as advertised.  It was shipped promptly by the supplier.  Has been in use for about a month and is working fine.</li>
            <li> So easy that I&#x27;m using it every day.  gums have never felt healthier!  Because we have a heavy shower head with a long flexible metal hose on it, we connected a metal T-valve, so the plastic of the shower floss was not stressed.  We just turn the T-valve to divert the water to the shower floss.  Wonderful.</li>
            <li> I really like shower flossers but this one was hard for me to thread and eventually the plastic attachment was unusable.</li>
            <li> I look forward to using this every day. It was recommended by my dental hygienist. It really makes your mouth and gums feel good and it will dislodge food bits that brushing and string flossing miss.</li>
            <li> One of the best products out there.  If you don&#x27;t have one, buy one.</li>
            <li> Easy to install, excellent product recommended by our dentist.  Very healthy for your gums and also cleans your teeth. Would highly recommend</li>
            <li> Headline&lt;br /&gt;  Works well and I like the mess in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;The fitting does leak water but I haven&#x27;t investigated&lt;br /&gt;To much writing</li>
            <li> this is one of the best things I&#x27;ve bought in a long time.  I&#x27;ve tried the water pik and it makes such a mess the Shower Floss is the best.</li>
            <li> It came in the mail quickly.  Easy to hook up and use.</li>
            <li> I cant adjust the water pressure unless I turn down the faucet.  I dont use it - so it was a waste</li>
            <li> Water pressure cleaning keeps gums healthiest.  So easy to use every time you shower.</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome.  It has a much stronger stream then I ever expected.  I was very happy with it.  It is very easy to install, although the sticky pad for the holder did not work well.  I was okay with that because I let it hang to drain all the water and prevent bacteria from growing if it had water left in the hose.  Overall I could not be more satisfied with this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the one that attached to the faucet, but it didn&#x27;t work well at all and made a mess and eventually broke. So when I saw this product I had to give it a try. It is easy to install (took me 2 minutes), easy to use and the so much more efficient.</li>
