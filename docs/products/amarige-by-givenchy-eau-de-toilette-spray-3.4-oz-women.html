            <li> My husband bought it for me as an anniversary present and, as it turned out, I adore it and now wear it nearly every day in preference to my other recent favourites.  </li>
            <li> It was delivered to me on its expected arrival date.  </li>
            <li> anyway I&#x27;ve bought it a few times since for my girlfriends and it never disappoints</li>
            <li> but this website has been disappointing so far</li>
            <li> The red box looks expensive and the bottle with the frosted-look cap is understated and elegant.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it smells a little weak</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Lovely and great seller</li>
            <li> This perfume is no longer at department store but I know I can always purchase it here at Amazon. I Love this perfume my all-time favorite.  It was delivered to me on its expected arrival date.  2 thumbs up!!</li>
            <li> As described...  quick shipping too!  Thanks</li>
            <li> I buy Amarige perfume for my daughter.  She just loves the scent.  It is a tradition that she gets a bottle&lt;br /&gt;each year for her birthday.</li>
            <li> This is not it! Not even worth my money</li>
            <li> This item did not meet my expectations, though it is good but I will reordered it again or recommend it to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I had a girlfriend that used to wear this and it was the most incredible smell ever!! anyway I&#x27;ve bought it a few times since for my girlfriends and it never disappoints</li>
            <li> I LOVE  PERFUME, AND THE PRICE I PAID FOR IT.&lt;br /&gt;THOSE AROUND ME WHEN I WEAR IT  ,ALL ASK WHAT I AM&lt;br /&gt;USING AND HOW MUCH DOES IT COST. IT COMES RIGHT TO MY HOME&lt;br /&gt;AND I DO NOT HAVE TO GO TO THE MALL TO BUY IT</li>
            <li> It is a perfum classic with much personality. I like it very much. I want to buy more in other oportunity.</li>
            <li> Love it. I&#x27;ll be ordering some in the future.</li>
            <li> Just love this get alot good complements  Alot of strangers ask me what I&#x27;m wearing I smile and tell them my favorite amarage</li>
            <li> Very pleased with product and delivery of same</li>
            <li> is it the original toilette spray.  it smells a little weak</li>
            <li> i loved this product...i will order more once i will finished this first one...i will share this to my friends...</li>
            <li> I have worn only Amarige for about 20 years, never another fragrance but this website has been disappointing so far</li>
            <li> This was an inspired purchase as neither I nor my OH had ever sniffed this perfume before.  My husband bought it for me as an anniversary present and, as it turned out, I adore it and now wear it nearly every day in preference to my other recent favourites.  The red box looks expensive and the bottle with the frosted-look cap is understated and elegant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is rose-based and flower-heavy, made in the classic style (meaning, it smells nice instead of strange).  It seems to go really well with my skin chemistry and I like both the immediate and the long-term effect.  As a bonus, although it is an Eau de Toilette, it is fairly strong stuff and has good staying power, which means that a little goes a long way.  Oh, best of all, my husband thinks it smells good on me, too!</li>
            <li> There was not anything that even resembled a problem.Delivery was perfect as well as the product.</li>
            <li> Myvfave of all times.  Every time I wear,xsomeone willvaskvwhatci am wearing.  Smells pleasant, sensuous, but not over powering.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> I got the perfume quickly as promised and the product was brand new as described.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This is the way to buy your favorite perfume!!</li>
            <li> Loved it!  Everytime I wear it I get compliments.</li>
            <li> I have used this perfume for years. I love it. Now I can only buy it on line. Thanks for carrying it.</li>
            <li> The product was shipped as indicated very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> Beautiful fragrance &amp; price.</li>
