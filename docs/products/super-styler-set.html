            <li>It&#x27;s really easy -</li>
            <li>Fairly easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have used it several times now, and Make sure to keep it nice stored in its own container.  </li>
            <li>The curler as well as the straightening iron heats up so quickly!  </li>

            <li>Highly recommend this super set, at an amazing price!</li>
            <li>Super Excited!  </li>
            <li>We ordered last minute and we got it on Christmas Eve, it was great.</li>
            <li>She had my hair straight in no time at all and showed me some awesome curls that will last for a couple days.</li>
            <li>I have thick hair and this works perfectly for me because it gets a lil hotter that most.</li>
            <li>So far good.</li>
            <li>The smaller wand size makes a gorgeous fro, the largest size creates fantastic voluminous waves!</li>
            <li>The flat iron is the perfect width and the temp controls work really well.</li>
            <li>I filled out the guarantee online,hopefully they are original.</li>
            <li>The straightener works great on my full french bangs.</li>
            <li>I received both of them in the original packaging</li>
            <li>Well worth every penny!</li>
            <li>This is exactly the same and a great savings for my&lt;</li>
            <li>The straightener get super hot and straightens my hair very quickly.</li>
            <li>Other then that it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>waves it produced and how quickly they fell out.</li>
            <li>I recieved the package fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>The 500 degree heat creates curls quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will be sticking to my HotTools, as no other product has worked so effectively on my hair and kept a curl for days.</li>
            <li>Apparently, she had seen one at a friend&#x27;s house and really liked how well it worked on her hair</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with my entire transaction with Amazon when I ordered my Herstyler straightener and curling rod.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t attest to how long the curls will last, but for being so quick my hair looks almost perfect.</li>
            <li>I have been a Chi fan and user for over 10 years and this set had me sold from the first straightened strand!</li>
            <li>Makes my hair super straight and silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Perfect for hard to style hair..  much cheaper than the mall.</li>
            <li>My hair is already straight, but I use that to smooth flyways.</li>
            <li>This one has 3 different barrels and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>totally worth every peny</li>
            <li>I went to do my own and the next barrel up</li>
            <li>The wands a pretty cool.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not coordinated enough to use the clipless curlers on my own hair</li>
            <li>and i have kinky mixed hair, came sooner than expected, very happy with my order</li>
            <li>She did use the same model that a friend of hers owned &amp; liked it; that&#x27;s why she bought this one because her friends was cracked</li>
            <li>so many styles I can do nod it leaves my hair shiny, soft and</li>
            <li>Works like my first generation chi did and certainly better than their new ones.</li>
            <li>I will do it because I loved the flat iron so much.</li>
            <li>This thing heats up in about literally 5 seconds (putting those \\&quot;heats up in 60 seconds!\\&quot; types to shame) and is SUPER hot.</li>
            <li>This product gets super hot to the point you probably shouldn&#x27;t ever use it in the hottest setting.</li>
            <li>The iron is supper hot, like 500 degrees hot!  </li>
            <li>It get hot pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>We got this for our 13yr old daughter and she loved it and loves it daily.</li>
            <li>Both heat up very fast.</li>
            <li>The Straightener is very fast and doesnt tangle.</li>
            <li>After doing some research on the product I verified that this set is the exact thing my friend bought at a mall stand for almost $200.</li>
            <li>The curling wand works pretty well.</li>
            <li>It makes my life much easier when we are going out !</li>
            <li>and it was exactly like the $200 one.  </li>
            <li>When she first plugged in the hairstyler set, it did not work.  </li>
            <li>I made the mistake of buying my first one&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>most so be careful until you have become accustomed to it.</li>
            <li>if I were actually trying to make it look fit for going out in the daytime</li>
            <li>This product works really well</li>
            <li>and it heated fast</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s much easier to switch out the wands.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t expiremented with it much yet</li>
            <li>the salesperson showed me because you can safely use it on wet hair as he demonstrated with mine.</li>
            <li>I bought it to replace my $60 straightener that had died out after 2 years, and I really wanted a curling wand.</li>
            <li>You can do so much.</li>
            <li>And the curls hold very well.</li>
            <li>I have never had such a fantastic straightener.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much they try to sell this for at the mall.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I wonder whether this purchase is authentic or not due to the fact that it was so cheap and the logo of HerStyler on the straightener smeared a little.</li>
            <li>I recommend due to the product really working, but like I said I cannot really say whether its authentic.</li>
            <li>This styling set has held up better than any other we have owned.  </li>
            <li>I hate gushing and over the top reviews but for real guys this thing was great.</li>
            <li>I have gotten rid of all my old irons and hot rollers.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to find not only the flat iron but the wands for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to teens as well as older women.</li>
            <li>Both the straightener and the wand have worked really well thus far!</li>
            <li>then you think you should, but because it is so hot, your hair should really not be on it for much longer then 10-30 seconds, or it might really burn your hair.  </li>
            <li>I watched about 2 minutes of youtube for tips on how to use clipless curlers, decided I had to play with my new toy even though it&#x27;s just about bedtime, and basically within 10 minutes I was done.</li>
            <li>The product itself looked new, which is why I kept it.</li>
            <li>The curling wand has 3 sizes and the curls look so bouncy and last long, and the flat iron is the kind that doesn&#x27;t catch your hair and break it.</li>
            <li>Keeps hair very soft and doesn&#x27;t burn it.</li>
            <li>(so add maybe 3-5 extra minutes to do the hair serum/spray bit), but seriously my hair still looks pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>I did do a lot of on-line research to ensure I am receiving the same exact product as the mall.</li>
            <li>Very durable reasonably priced considering just the flat iron is over $100 in the mall.</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact, since she received it, she uses it much more often than her straightener, which is a reverse of what she usually did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to get this fixed for 2mths now.</li>
            <li>Straightens my hair with one pass and leaves it soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I can straighten all of my hair in 5 minutes and it last all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both heat up in seconds and are ready to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Box comes with glove too</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a curler that makes natural looking curls.</li>
            <li>WOW and used it immediately.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m no longer locked into this forever straight style that i&amp;#34;ve sentenced myself to with the Japanese straightening.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diffentenly worth the money I spent</li>
            <li>I usually spend 30 minutes blow drying and 45 minutes straightening, not to mention all the times ive attempted hot rollers for pretty curls.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical, but upon reading so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I have very fine but thick and long hair.</li>
            <li>Same thing happened to my old one...</li>
            <li>The curling method took a few tries to get used to without the clamp, but ultimately, when you start at the root, you get a better style.</li>
            <li>The two different attachable curler rod sizes are easy to change out, from small spirals, medium curls/waves, and big volumes waves.</li>
            <li>When I received the package it was torn up as if it was already used and not new, and let me start off by saying the flat iron did heat up really well.</li>
            <li>but this does EXACTLY what it says it will in so little time.  </li>
            <li>I have thick curly/wavy coarse hair and the straightener really gets it straight.</li>
            <li>The straightener was able to straighten my thick, curly/wavy hair faster than any other straightener I&#x27;ve had before</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m black with really curly/wavy hair.</li>
            <li>but my daughter loves getting her straight hair curled into tight &amp;#34;princess&amp;#34; curls.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve finally been able to produce those big loose curls that everyone is sporting lately!  </li>

            <li> I have thick hair and this works perfectly for me because it gets a lil hotter that most.</li>
            <li> So far good.</li>
            <li> The smaller wand size makes a gorgeous fro, the largest size creates fantastic voluminous waves!</li>
            <li> The flat iron is the perfect width and the temp controls work really well.</li>
            <li> I filled out the guarantee online,hopefully they are original.</li>
            <li> The straightener works great on my full french bangs.</li>
            <li> I received both of them in the original packaging</li>
            <li> Well worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This is exactly the same and a great savings for my&lt;</li>
            <li> The straightener get super hot and straightens my hair very quickly.</li>
            <li> Other then that it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> waves it produced and how quickly they fell out.</li>
            <li> I recieved the package fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> The 500 degree heat creates curls quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will be sticking to my HotTools, as no other product has worked so effectively on my hair and kept a curl for days.</li>
            <li> Apparently, she had seen one at a friend&#x27;s house and really liked how well it worked on her hair</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with my entire transaction with Amazon when I ordered my Herstyler straightener and curling rod.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t attest to how long the curls will last, but for being so quick my hair looks almost perfect.</li>
            <li> I have been a Chi fan and user for over 10 years and this set had me sold from the first straightened strand!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair super straight and silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Perfect for hard to style hair..  much cheaper than the mall.</li>
            <li> My hair is already straight, but I use that to smooth flyways.</li>
            <li> This one has 3 different barrels and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> totally worth every peny</li>
            <li> I went to do my own and the next barrel up</li>
            <li> The wands a pretty cool.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not coordinated enough to use the clipless curlers on my own hair</li>
            <li> and i have kinky mixed hair, came sooner than expected, very happy with my order</li>
            <li> She did use the same model that a friend of hers owned &amp; liked it; that&#x27;s why she bought this one because her friends was cracked</li>
            <li> so many styles I can do nod it leaves my hair shiny, soft and</li>
            <li> Works like my first generation chi did and certainly better than their new ones.</li>
            <li> I will do it because I loved the flat iron so much.</li>
            <li> This thing heats up in about literally 5 seconds (putting those \\&quot;heats up in 60 seconds!\\&quot; types to shame) and is SUPER hot.</li>
            <li> This product gets super hot to the point you probably shouldn&#x27;t ever use it in the hottest setting.</li>
            <li> The iron is supper hot, like 500 degrees hot!  </li>
            <li> It get hot pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> We got this for our 13yr old daughter and she loved it and loves it daily.</li>
            <li> Both heat up very fast.</li>
            <li> The Straightener is very fast and doesnt tangle.</li>
            <li> After doing some research on the product I verified that this set is the exact thing my friend bought at a mall stand for almost $200.</li>
            <li> The curling wand works pretty well.</li>
            <li> It makes my life much easier when we are going out !</li>
            <li> and it was exactly like the $200 one.  </li>
            <li> When she first plugged in the hairstyler set, it did not work.  </li>
            <li> I made the mistake of buying my first one&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> most so be careful until you have become accustomed to it.</li>
            <li> if I were actually trying to make it look fit for going out in the daytime</li>
            <li> This product works really well</li>
            <li> and it heated fast</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s much easier to switch out the wands.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t expiremented with it much yet</li>
            <li> the salesperson showed me because you can safely use it on wet hair as he demonstrated with mine.</li>
            <li> I bought it to replace my $60 straightener that had died out after 2 years, and I really wanted a curling wand.</li>
            <li> You can do so much.</li>
            <li> And the curls hold very well.</li>
            <li> I have never had such a fantastic straightener.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much they try to sell this for at the mall.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I wonder whether this purchase is authentic or not due to the fact that it was so cheap and the logo of HerStyler on the straightener smeared a little.</li>
            <li> I recommend due to the product really working, but like I said I cannot really say whether its authentic.</li>
            <li> This styling set has held up better than any other we have owned.  </li>
            <li> I hate gushing and over the top reviews but for real guys this thing was great.</li>
            <li> I have gotten rid of all my old irons and hot rollers.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to find not only the flat iron but the wands for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to teens as well as older women.</li>
            <li> Both the straightener and the wand have worked really well thus far!</li>
            <li> then you think you should, but because it is so hot, your hair should really not be on it for much longer then 10-30 seconds, or it might really burn your hair.  </li>
            <li> I watched about 2 minutes of youtube for tips on how to use clipless curlers, decided I had to play with my new toy even though it&#x27;s just about bedtime, and basically within 10 minutes I was done.</li>
            <li> The product itself looked new, which is why I kept it.</li>
            <li> The curling wand has 3 sizes and the curls look so bouncy and last long, and the flat iron is the kind that doesn&#x27;t catch your hair and break it.</li>
            <li> Keeps hair very soft and doesn&#x27;t burn it.</li>
            <li> (so add maybe 3-5 extra minutes to do the hair serum/spray bit), but seriously my hair still looks pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> I did do a lot of on-line research to ensure I am receiving the same exact product as the mall.</li>
            <li> Very durable reasonably priced considering just the flat iron is over $100 in the mall.</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, since she received it, she uses it much more often than her straightener, which is a reverse of what she usually did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to get this fixed for 2mths now.</li>
            <li> Straightens my hair with one pass and leaves it soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I can straighten all of my hair in 5 minutes and it last all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both heat up in seconds and are ready to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Box comes with glove too</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a curler that makes natural looking curls.</li>
            <li> WOW and used it immediately.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m no longer locked into this forever straight style that i&amp;#34;ve sentenced myself to with the Japanese straightening.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diffentenly worth the money I spent</li>
            <li> I usually spend 30 minutes blow drying and 45 minutes straightening, not to mention all the times ive attempted hot rollers for pretty curls.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but upon reading so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I have very fine but thick and long hair.</li>
            <li> Same thing happened to my old one...</li>
            <li> The curling method took a few tries to get used to without the clamp, but ultimately, when you start at the root, you get a better style.</li>
            <li> The two different attachable curler rod sizes are easy to change out, from small spirals, medium curls/waves, and big volumes waves.</li>
            <li> When I received the package it was torn up as if it was already used and not new, and let me start off by saying the flat iron did heat up really well.</li>
            <li> but this does EXACTLY what it says it will in so little time.  </li>
            <li> I have thick curly/wavy coarse hair and the straightener really gets it straight.</li>
            <li> The straightener was able to straighten my thick, curly/wavy hair faster than any other straightener I&#x27;ve had before</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m black with really curly/wavy hair.</li>
            <li> but my daughter loves getting her straight hair curled into tight &amp;#34;princess&amp;#34; curls.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve finally been able to produce those big loose curls that everyone is sporting lately!  </li>
            <li> This thing curls my entire head of super thick long hair in under 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I was in need of a new flat iron and saw this kit and decided to give it a shot based on other reviews.</li>
            <li> The other thing that I have a slight issue with is not knowing the exact sizes of the barrels as it&#x27;s not listed anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have thin baby fine hair, and this does not fry, damage, or dry it out.</li>
            <li> The curls last a long time without using alot of styling products!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having a minor problem with the flat iron as it seems to be pulling strands of my hair.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that I have to return it because one of the plates got loose and stopped heating up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a million different products to curl my hair from gels, sprays, mousse, flat irons, curlers with clips, wet curlers, heat curlers..</li>
            <li> The problem was when it came to the curling wands and the amount of disappointment i faced after falling in love.</li>
            <li> My daughter has long hair that she likes to style every day.</li>
            <li> This was what I have been looking for for so long.  </li>
            <li> My hair is so dry from dying it</li>
            <li> I have super thick half curly half wavy hair.</li>
            <li> To start, I have long, thick, naturally wavy hair.</li>
            <li> For how expensive this product was when I originally purchased it (which I believe has gone down in price)</li>
            <li> I use it everyday several times.</li>
            <li> I would have had to easily spent 200$</li>
            <li> hair is thin and oily, so with regular curling irons my curls usually falls within a few hours and got super frizzy(even after a ton of prep and hairspray).</li>
            <li> Be careful!</li>
            <li> just hold it downwards, wrap your hair around it, and be careful with the tips of your fingers!</li>
            <li> I have Japanese straightened, Long down past my waist hair!  </li>
            <li> I used the flat iron but my hair started to burn from the ends, not sure if I was supposed to used a protector?</li>
            <li> I have really long hair (past my bra)</li>
            <li> I have thick coarse hair</li>
            <li> method: Using the curler upside down, wrapping it downward.</li>
            <li> So I just took my curler out of the box less than 20 minutes ago and already I&#x27;m done curling ALL my hair.</li>
            <li> My wife and daughter both use it and in less than 5 min they are set to go.</li>
            <li> Since they aren&#x27;t willing to respond I can only assume they know it is advertised wrong and even labeled wrong on the box.</li>
            <li> was missing all the components from the inside.</li>
            <li> I had bought a straightener from the mall for $200 so getting this complete set for $70, I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> She hasn&#x27;t complained but since she&#x27;s not a whiner it may have problems I&#x27;m not aware of.</li>
            <li> For something that costs so much, you would expect it to work when you plug it in. :(</li>
            <li> She saw this at other stores and it was expensive.  </li>
            <li> Now, I have VERY thick hair</li>
            <li> I did get this for under $70 from Small Bill, but the box was ripped, dirty, opened and didn&#x27;t include a packing slip.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t burn myself or make any weird hair kinks or anything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just sad</li>
            <li> I was so sad and had to return it.</li>
            <li> I just twisted it around my fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Im sick of hiding my un-tameable hair in ponytails.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the curls/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very unhappy</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This styling set has held up better than any other we have owned.  It can straighten or curl in seconds and the style holds.  It gets hotter than most so be careful until you have become accustomed to it.</li>
            <li> It did a great job straightening my hair and gets really HOT! Be careful! The only problem is that I have to return it because one of the plates got loose and stopped heating up. Herstyler does offer a one year warranty from date of purchase, but you have to register on their website and pay $15 fee. I will do it because I loved the flat iron so much. I must have gotten a defective one.</li>
            <li> I tried this set at the mall with my daughter and two of my nieces, I wanted it but the $300 price tag was way out of my budget. Amazon to the rescue! Same great quality and way cheaper!</li>
            <li> I was searching for a better price for a her styler flatiron than the mall kiosk. I was pleased to find not only the flat iron but the wands for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I think I have maken a good decision to purchase this combination: it is worth.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Perfect for hard to style hair..  much cheaper than the mall. I love my hair now!!!! The curls last a long time without using alot of styling products!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this a two star rating because it advertises a straightener with 1.5&amp;#34; plates. This is the second one I&#x27;ve ordered and both of them had 1&amp;#34; plates on the straightener. I received both of them in the original packaging so I assume they came from the manufacturer that way.  I have tried to contact the manufacturer to find out what&#x27;s going on, I never received a response from them. Since they aren&#x27;t willing to respond I can only assume they know it is advertised wrong and even labeled wrong on the box. One might ask how I know they have 1&amp;#34; plates on them. I have been a pipe fabricator for almost 20yrs. I measure things for a living. for those of you who don&#x27;t know  &amp;#34;  means inch. example 1.5 inches is 1.5&amp;#34;  I ordered this for my fianc&amp;eacute; knowing she wanted a straightener with 1.5&amp;#34; plates. I&#x27;ve been trying to get this fixed for 2mths now. I&#x27;m very unhappy</li>
            <li> So I just took my curler out of the box less than 20 minutes ago and already I&#x27;m done curling ALL my hair. I watched about 2 minutes of youtube for tips on how to use clipless curlers, decided I had to play with my new toy even though it&#x27;s just about bedtime, and basically within 10 minutes I was done. It probably isn&#x27;t as good a job as I&#x27;d do if I were actually trying to make it look fit for going out in the daytime (so add maybe 3-5 extra minutes to do the hair serum/spray bit), but seriously my hair still looks pretty amazing. This thing heats up in about literally 5 seconds (putting those \\&quot;heats up in 60 seconds!\\&quot; types to shame) and is SUPER hot. It&#x27;s really easy - just hold it downwards, wrap your hair around it, and be careful with the tips of your fingers! I&#x27;ve never used a clipless curler before and I didn&#x27;t burn myself or make any weird hair kinks or anything. I&#x27;m just sad I haven&#x27;t bought a clipless before now. I can&#x27;t attest to how long the curls will last, but for being so quick my hair looks almost perfect. I&#x27;m in awe. I hate gushing and over the top reviews but for real guys this thing was great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a million different products to curl my hair from gels, sprays, mousse, flat irons, curlers with clips, wet curlers, heat curlers.. but nothing held like this wand.  I don&#x27;t know why but it works great!  I have very fine but thick and long hair.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t even heat up so I sent it back for a refund. For something that costs so much, you would expect it to work when you plug it in. :(</li>
            <li> This product works really well and it comes with a protective glove. I would recommend it to teens as well as older women.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday several times. I love it and will never get rid of it. I use all the addons and with the hair treatment my hair is back to what it is supposed to be</li>
            <li> After doing some research on the product I verified that this set is the exact thing my friend bought at a mall stand for almost $200. I just received it in the mail and it is great. The curling wand has 3 sizes and the curls look so bouncy and last long, and the flat iron is the kind that doesn&#x27;t catch your hair and break it. Both heat up very fast. Highly recommend this super set, at an amazing price!</li>
            <li> Both the straightener and the wand have worked really well thus far! The straightener was able to straighten my thick, curly/wavy hair faster than any other straightener I&#x27;ve had before</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used and great price</li>
            <li> Best flat iron I have ever purchased!</li>
            <li> This thing died after 5 uses. Same thing happened to my old one...just means the coils/wiring is still faulty. Manufacturer still needs to fix this</li>
            <li> Just got this yesterday after having to return my cortex 4 in 1 because it had an error message.  I curled two girls hair with the smallest wand and it heated fast and the results were adorable.  The attachments only have two prongs instead of four like cortex so it&#x27;s much easier to switch out the wands.  I can&#x27;t wait to use on myself.  This has both the straightener and the curling iron with three change out sizes for the curling so it&#x27;s actually four things for the price.  I&#x27;ll keep you posted after I try it for a week or so.</li>
            <li> I was just at the mall and let the girls from the Herstyler kiosk present this item to me. I was amazed! I have super thick half curly half wavy hair. I usually spend 30 minutes blow drying and 45 minutes straightening, not to mention all the times ive attempted hot rollers for pretty curls. She had my hair straight in no time at all and showed me some awesome curls that will last for a couple days. She gave me her best price at $238 for the kit and I almost bought it. Im so glad I found it here for $68. I havent received it yet but I know this is going to be a life changer! Im sick of hiding my un-tameable hair in ponytails. Super Excited!  I did do a lot of on-line research to ensure I am receiving the same exact product as the mall.</li>
            <li> I used each style of wand a couple of times. To start, I have long, thick, naturally wavy hair. For how expensive this product was when I originally purchased it (which I believe has gone down in price) I was disappointed in the curls/waves it produced and how quickly they fell out. Within hours, the curls unraveled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be sticking to my HotTools, as no other product has worked so effectively on my hair and kept a curl for days.</li>
            <li> Amazing works great and gets the job done I love it great buy totally worth every peny&lt;br /&gt;All I gotta say is it works great</li>
            <li> When I received the package it was torn up as if it was already used and not new, and let me start off by saying the flat iron did heat up really well. The problem was when it came to the curling wands and the amount of disappointment i faced after falling in love. I did my daughters hair with the smallest barrel and it was so cute. I went to do my own and the next barrel up was missing all the components from the inside. I was so sad and had to return it.</li>
            <li> I was in need of a new flat iron and saw this kit and decided to give it a shot based on other reviews. I am glad I did! The flat iron works great! Straightens my hair with one pass and leaves it soft and shiny. Doesn&#x27;t pull on my hair either. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use the curling wands because my hair is only chin length...but looks like they will be great once my hair is longer.</li>
            <li> The wands work great, the flat iron is not as good as a Chi. The glove is too big for my wifes hand but fits mine. Over all, good value for the price.</li>
            <li> The cones interchange perfectly. The flat iron is the perfect width and the temp controls work really well. Some products just go form warm to warmer! This product gets super hot to the point you probably shouldn&#x27;t ever use it in the hottest setting. Very durable reasonably priced considering just the flat iron is over $100 in the mall.</li>
            <li> I bought this set and absolutely love it. I&#x27;m having a minor problem with the flat iron as it seems to be pulling strands of my hair. I don&#x27;t know if my hair is getting snagged or what, but hey!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I purchased a heat resistant glove that was advertised an extra addition for an additional $9.99. I paid for the glove which is by HSI and not Herstyler. The issue is that a heat resistant glove is included with the set, which was not specified in the despcription of the product. I actually found out once I received the product. The other thing that I have a slight issue with is not knowing the exact sizes of the barrels as it&#x27;s not listed anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summarily, I like this product and the price is a steal. The RP was listed on the back as $550 and on Herstyler&#x27;s website the product is listed as $386. The wands a pretty cool. Maybe for my hair type I have to use spray as the curls fell too soon.</li>
            <li> The Straightener is very fast and doesnt tangle. the curling Iron is fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;Will recommend this as a gift or for yourself</li>
            <li> I have thick curly/wavy coarse hair and the straightener really gets it straight. The curling wand works pretty well. I haven&#x27;t expiremented with it much yet so I&#x27;m still learning how to use it. Other then that it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Works great!! Curls stay in forever! You have to wash them out. Fairly easy to use. My husband does the curls for me b/c I can&#x27;t get the back of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Straightener works great. I can straighten all of my hair in 5 minutes and it last all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both heat up in seconds and are ready to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Box comes with glove too so no need to buy one separately.</li>
            <li> I have been a Chi fan and user for over 10 years and this set had me sold from the first straightened strand! This was a great deal considering the mall vendors sell it for about triple the price. I do believe you don&#x27;t get the lifetime warranty if you purchase online, but I&#x27;ve noticed most of the mall vendors have gone out of business so you wouldn&#x27;t get that warranty with them anyways. I&#x27;m not coordinated enough to use the clipless curlers on my own hair but my daughter loves getting her straight hair curled into tight &amp;#34;princess&amp;#34; curls.</li>
            <li> My daughter has long hair that she likes to style every day. I bought this for her and she loves it. Apparently, she had seen one at a friend&#x27;s house and really liked how well it worked on her hair so she was excited to have her own. As a matter of fact, since she received it, she uses it much more often than her straightener, which is a reverse of what she usually did.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I wonder whether this purchase is authentic or not due to the fact that it was so cheap and the logo of HerStyler on the straightener smeared a little. Then I&#x27;m comforted by the fact that when I turn on the wand or straightener it works so amazing and gets super hot! I have thick hair and this works perfectly for me because it gets a lil hotter that most. I recommend due to the product really working, but like I said I cannot really say whether its authentic. Comes in a nice looking box too.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas present and it it great! My wife and daughter both use it and in less than 5 min they are set to go. It makes my life much easier when we are going out !</li>
            <li> Tried it reluctantly at the mall and found it here at a fraction of the price. I do hope it&#x27;s the 100% ceramic the salesperson showed me because you can safely use it on wet hair as he demonstrated with mine. I have really long hair (past my bra) and I&#x27;m black with really curly/wavy hair. My hair is so dry from dying it and I have a keritan treatment. This brings the luster back to my hair and straightens it in 2 swipes over a section. Keeps hair very soft and doesn&#x27;t burn it. Love the curling wand, works very quickly :). Works like my first generation chi did and certainly better than their new ones. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I love these irons! I have never had an iron curl my hair without the curls falling out within an hour. I can curl all my hair and it will still be curly the next day...without ANY hairspray! The curling method took a few tries to get used to without the clamp, but ultimately, when you start at the root, you get a better style. The straightening iron is awesome, too. My hair is already straight, but I use that to smooth flyways. I have gotten rid of all my old irons and hot rollers. No need for them any more!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter.She had been using them for a couple weeks.So far good.I filled out the guarantee online,hopefully they are original.</li>
            <li> Well worth every penny! The product, the presentation, the performance, and design are all impeccable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I was skeptical, but upon reading so many positive reviews. I had to try it. I ordered it,  received it fast, in best condition.  Everything still wrapped in plastic, twist ties, and all. I have zero regrets!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have thin baby fine hair, and this does not fry, damage, or dry it out. The straightener and curler both heat up within 1 to 2 seconds. And the handle + outside of the wand don&#x27;t burn you, and the glove is a plus! I don&#x27;t know what I would have done without this combination, I had been searching for a straightener for my bangs, and a curler for the rest of my hair, for awhile now. I would have had to easily spent 200$ + on them otherwise. The two different attachable curler rod sizes are easy to change out, from small spirals, medium curls/waves, and big volumes waves. I am beyond satisfied!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My method: Using the curler upside down, wrapping it downward. The straightener works great on my full french bangs.</li>
            <li> I love this styler set. Bought it off my friend for bout $150 at beauty school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thin and oily, so with regular curling irons my curls usually falls within a few hours and got super frizzy(even after a ton of prep and hairspray). But with the wand my curls lasted until the next day and to re-curl my hair I just twisted it around my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The straightener is awesome. I love the fact that I can straighten  my hair or curl it. The only problem I had was that the logo wore off from rubbing against my hair(lucky none got into my hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diffentenly worth the money I spent</li>
            <li> works amazing on my hair and i have kinky mixed hair, came sooner than expected, very happy with my order</li>
            <li> Only one barel worked and the flatiron sucked</li>
            <li> I recieved the package fairly quickly. I bought it to replace my $60 straightener that had died out after 2 years, and I really wanted a curling wand. This one has 3 different barrels and it&#x27;s amazing. The straightener get super hot and straightens my hair very quickly. About 10 minutes to straighten my hair versus the 30 minutes it used to take. Now, I have VERY thick hair and it NEVER used to hold a curl, but now it takes me about 20 muinutes to curl my hair with this wand and it stays curled all day! And I&#x27;ve finally been able to produce those big loose curls that everyone is sporting lately!  Definately a great buy!</li>
            <li> We got this for our 13yr old daughter and she loved it and loves it daily. We ordered last minute and we got it on Christmas Eve, it was great. You can do so much. Our daughter loves the different sizes.... different sizes &#x3D; different styles. And the curls hold very well. I want it for myself! I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a curler that makes natural looking curls. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love this Herstyler. Cheaper than the mall&#x27;s price of over $200.  Amazon&#x27;s price was just $79 and it was exactly like the $200 one.  Plus we received a straightener with it. Would suggest this product if you are wanting a great curling wand that won&#x27;t damage your hair and keep the curl until you wash your hair. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I did get this for under $70 from Small Bill, but the box was ripped, dirty, opened and didn&#x27;t include a packing slip.  When I used the product, it worked well--just not gift quality looking box.  The product itself looked new, which is why I kept it.</li>
            <li> I used the flat iron but my hair started to burn from the ends, not sure if I was supposed to used a protector? The wands I&#x27;m having difficulty using but the glove does come in handy, won&#x27;t burn my hand. It a good set for the price.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s happy with it. She hasn&#x27;t complained but since she&#x27;s not a whiner it may have problems I&#x27;m not aware of. She did use the same model that a friend of hers owned &amp; liked it; that&#x27;s why she bought this one because her friends was cracked &amp; she said it was ceramic through &amp; through &amp; not just coated like so many others.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I found this great deal for a straightener and 3 part curler that works great! I would definitely buy her styler products again.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this!!  She saw this at other stores and it was expensive.  When she first plugged in the hairstyler set, it did not work.  After a couple of try&#x27;s it worked.  It get hot pretty quickly.  She loves it!!</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic! The smaller wand size makes a gorgeous fro, the largest size creates fantastic voluminous waves! The 500 degree heat creates curls quickly. I have never had such a fantastic straightener.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with my entire transaction with Amazon when I ordered my Herstyler straightener and curling rod. I had bought a straightener from the mall for $200 so getting this complete set for $70, I was skeptical. I used the set as soon as I got the package and it works wonders on my hair, so many styles I can do nod it leaves my hair shiny, soft and the curls last ll day with no hairspray! I was very happy to receive the real deal and not some knock off Herstyler, I recommend this to anyone with doubts and are looking to save some money as I was. You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This is my second one. I made the mistake of buying my first one&lt;br /&gt;In the mall.  This is exactly the same and a great savings for my&lt;br /&gt;teenagers. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy one here.</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous! Makes my hair super straight and silky smooth. Whenever I style my hair with the straightener it looks terrific. I would suggest getting a heat proof bag or styling table so that the product does not burn your counter. I got a piece of marble to lay the iron on while it heats up an I got a heat resistant bag to put the iron in after I am done.</li>
            <li> I love this set! It has every styling tool I need. The three curling iron sizes are perfect and ofcourse the straightener is used the most. The price was unmatchable!! Its just the best in everyway you see it!</li>
            <li> This was what I have been looking for for so long.  I got it within a day. WOW and used it immediately.  I have thick coarse hair but this does EXACTLY what it says it will in so little time.  i ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Great product, the wand is great and the straighter works great to.</li>
            <li> I waited 4 uses to post this review as I wanted to try all of the set atleast twice before I reviewed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never had much faith in products like this, but man is this thing amazing!  I can&#x27;t believe how much they try to sell this for at the mall.  But I have to say... IT is WORTH every penny!!! The curler as well as the straightening iron heats up so quickly!  And it locks in a curl like nothing I have ever experience before!  Mind you I have Japanese straightened, Long down past my waist hair!  These things give me curles to last days!!!!  So I&#x27;m no longer locked into this forever straight style that i&amp;#34;ve sentenced myself to with the Japanese straightening.  And I have to say, I get so many compliments when I do the curls in my hair.  I have used it several times now, and Make sure to keep it nice stored in its own container.  If you are looking for a combo set.  Look no further!  You will NOT be disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do want to add.... I almost thought to take away one star for not having a curler clip, but I think its good that this doesn&#x27;t have one.  The iron is supper hot, like 500 degrees hot!  It forces you to remove your hair earlier then you think you should, but because it is so hot, your hair should really not be on it for much longer then 10-30 seconds, or it might really burn your hair.  So the reason they don&#x27;t have a clip is probably not an expense issue, but a safety and also its not necessary.  This thing curls my entire head of super thick long hair in under 20 minutes.  Amazing product!</li>
            <li> only curling iron that keeps my hair curled.</li>
