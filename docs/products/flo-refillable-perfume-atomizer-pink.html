            <li>Using this atomizer, I&#x27;m able to dispense a nice stream and it has lasted awhile.</li>
            <li>It was really easy to fill, you don&#x27;t have to take the top off of your perfume bottle, just spray it into the bottom of the atomizer and you are good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very fine mist</li>
            <li>This atomizer is actually easy to fill and use!</li>
            <li>Great product, exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>I was able to take my favorite perfume with me and it was very easy to fill.</li>
            <li>Sprays nice, even mist that works fine with cologne and after shave.</li>
            <li>I was able to get the stains out immediately, but I can no longer recommend this product.</li>

            <li>I love this atomizer.  </li>
            <li>Love this item.  </li>
            <li>Compact, attractive, doesn&#x27;t leak, and atomizes the perfume very well.</li>

            <li>Perfect for traveling without having to take the chance of losing my entire bottle of perfume</li>
            <li>and I LOVE this atomizer.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure this would fill from a spray bottle--but there was no problem at all.  </li>
            <li>This works very well and is great for traveling.</li>
            <li>The color is lovely.</li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>I have owned one of these for a couple of years and enjoyed having it.</li>
            <li>It provides a way for me to take my favorite perfume when I travel.</li>
            <li>Travalo is better</li>
            <li>Was able to spray perfume in from my bottle without losing any or dripping.</li>
            <li>love the color.</li>
            <li>overall i am very very happy with this.</li>
            <li>A fill lasted more than a week with sparing cologne, and three, four days with liberal after shave.</li>
            <li>I love the product, and would recommend it to everyone.  </li>
            <li>so it sure does not hold much.&lt;br /&gt;BUT</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t able to salvage any of my perfume.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this so that I could carry my favorite perfume to work.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leak like many others.</li>
            <li>No leaks, cool design, handy to take anywhere.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to fill with your favorite perfume for travel.</li>
            <li>Filled this with my favorite (and discontinued perfume).</li>
            <li>I filled it with my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>The original scent genie works much better.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how easy it was to fill it from a spray perfume bottle.</li>
            <li>After seeing the size and how easy it was to fill I bought one for myself.</li>
            <li>Soooooo easy to fill</li>
            <li>Was easy to fill and has not leaked.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leak, easy to use.</li>
            <li>It was easy to use and allows me to carry my perfume with me without worrying about leaks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to fill.</li>
            <li>Also, the button came off too easily.</li>
            <li>Fills easily, neatly.</li>
            <li>Easy to carry in your purse and dispurse.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to fill and fits in any purse or clutch.  </li>
            <li>easy to fill.</li>
            <li>Easy to fill and easy to use.</li>
            <li>easy to fill up.</li>
            <li>Easy to fill...just spray into the bottom of the atomizer.  </li>
            <li>It feels pretty sturdy and watertight, and the finish is really nice.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to fill up with my favorite perfume, does not leak and does not spray out too much perfume when I use it.</li>
            <li>They are beautiful in pink (my favorite color).</li>
            <li>and it give an even fine spray.  </li>
            <li>so I could enjoy it after I exercise in the mornings, and this little atomizer is perfect.</li>
            <li>and I really enjoy having my perfume with me.  </li>
            <li>I liked it so much that I bought one for my husband as well.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something cute to hold your favorite perfume and not take the whole bottle with</li>
            <li>However, I have carried it in my purse and so far, so good.  </li>
            <li>The aluminum case is light weight and protects the inner glass liner very effectively.  </li>
            <li>It fits perfectly into into my small purse makeup bag.</li>
            <li>There is a new way that I can put my perfume in those kind of atomizer.</li>
            <li>Perfect for traveling with perfume without having to take your full, heavy bottle!</li>
            <li>So I use these for any splash samples that don&#x27;t have sprayers.&lt;br /&gt;Advice: do not fill with one fragrance and try to clean it out and replace another fragrance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to fill and a super convenient size.</li>
            <li>However, with all the restrictions on liquids, I found myself checking a bag with the airlines more often than I would have liked simply because I had full sized liquid toiletries and cosmetics.  </li>
            <li>Aside from looking like a &amp;#34;Marital Aid&amp;#34; ;) This is the perfect solution for someone that wants to carry a little perfume in their clutch or take it on a trip without worrying if your bottle will fit in your Quart-sized ziplock. :)</li>
            <li>But cool once I figured it out</li>
            <li>This is the first atomizer I&#x27;ve bought that doesn&#x27;t leak and is fairly easy to fill.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased this for my mom for christmas, it came really quickly and product is as shown.</li>
            <li>Its not only cute and stylish</li>
            <li>I have tried even super glue to fix the problem but to no avail.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased that I could fill the atomizer from my &#x27;big&#x27; perfume bottles.  </li>
            <li>But it is very pretty.</li>
            <li>I filled it right away and am ready to go!</li>
            <li>it is easy to fill, very lightweight, and fun to have.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing, it works with my standard bottle of prrfume.</li>
            <li>Bought this product a few weeks ago, and it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>Took just a couple minutes to have this filled up and ready to go.</li>
            <li>Hope my mom will find this useful.</li>
            <li>Just unscrew the bottom of the Flo Atomizer and spray your favorite perfume directly into the reservoir.  </li>
            <li>This would be useful for samples because they can be poured into the atomizer.  </li>
            <li>Saw this advertised in a magazine and well worth $10.  </li>
            <li>The wife would of liked it to be bigger.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Travalo Rollerball and am much happier with ease of filling, very small size (great for pockets), and no leaking!</li>
            <li>It arrived very fast, as always with Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li>I bought the silver one first and loved it so much I bought the pink ones for all the bridesmaids in my wedding!</li>
            <li>Screw the bottom back on, make sure it&#x27;s tight, and you are good to go.  </li>
            <li>It is great to have a small spray bottle of cologne when you are out of the house instead of lugging around a large bottle.</li>
            <li>This discrepancy should be your first warning.</li>
            <li>I used on my trip and had more that enough sprays for my 13 day vacation.</li>
            <li>really helps!   </li>
            <li>This atomizer was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>Will purchase more for all of my different perfumes.</li>
            <li>but it really leaks!</li>
            <li>Just used this for the first time on a trip to Scotland.</li>
            <li>This atomizer is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>this was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It works really well!</li>
            <li>A waste--and a waste of good perfume.</li>
            <li>Easy to fill up and the metal casing is sturdy enough that I&#x27;m not afraid of this cracking or breaking in my luggage.</li>
            <li>It does look cute, but it isn&#x27;t worth a single cent.</li>
            <li>It is easy to find travel sizes of your toiletries, but it can get pretty pricey to buy small sample sizes of all your favorite fragrances.  </li>
            <li>My sister, whom received it as a stocking stuffer loved the color and its small size.</li>
            <li>This atomizer worked fine at first, but after traveling with it for a short amount of time, it leaked.</li>
            <li>It is easy to fill following the directions.  </li>
            <li>I had droplets of rust colored cologne all over my fine white blouse.  </li>
            <li>The container is the perfect size to carry in the bag, even if you use a tiny bag, obviously is for little touch ups on the go.</li>
            <li>The spray works really well.</li>
            <li>My whole family uses it and</li>
            <li>The container is very sturdy.</li>
            <li>MUST HAVE for perfume fenatics and when you don&#x27;t want to risk carrying the whole perfume bottle.</li>
            <li>The silver atomizer works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Any way highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Well, much to my surprise</li>
            <li>, you don&#x27;t spill perfume at all - it&#x27;s soooo lightweight, you can take it anywhere - and its soooo cute in pink!  </li>
            <li>This cute little baby does exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive this refillable atomizer before I left for vacation!  </li>
            <li>I originally was very critical of this product because I couldn&#x27;t get it to work.</li>
            <li>but I left one star out since I can&#x27;t really tell when it is completely full.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple to clean also--</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really nice when you have samples of fragrances that come in small vial bottles.</li>
            <li>It works mainly for spray fragrances because you have to spray it into this atomizer, and it does not come with a funnel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It can be challenging to actually open, especially post shower when everything is damp</li>
            <li>highly recommended</li>
            <li>I love this little travel atomizer.  </li>
            <li>Too bad because it is the perfect size.</li>
            <li>I normally use it for samples of perfume that don&#x27;t come with a sprayer.  </li>
            <li>Love the sleek design and purchased a black one and a silver one for myself too!</li>
            <li>I wanted to take my new perfume with me to the office</li>
            <li>The top comes straight off if you pull hard.</li>
            <li>Clearly, you are not going to fit much perfume in this--the paperwork in the box estimates that this little atomizer holds 77 sprays.</li>
            <li>It took long to be delivered but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>so will the second perfume smell like the first one?</li>
            <li>I was looking for a small (and cute) atomizer for my daughter (who is 7).  </li>
            <li>I have read about people&#x27;s problems with it leaking, but I haven&#x27;t so far!</li>
            <li>This product made a mess when I filled it.</li>
            <li>saves me from having to worry about packing a large bottle or buying a smaller size.</li>
            <li>It was black but saw it came in pink on Amazon and was so excited!!</li>
            <li>Not sure what other reviewers were talking about when they say there was waste when filling this, it works perfect and no waste whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>So far there is no leaks</li>
            <li>The real test comes next week, when it will go traveling with me.  </li>
            <li>That was about two months ago and now it has almost completely evaporated.</li>
            <li>I travel fairly frequently and often times</li>
            <li>Thus far, they haven&#x27;t leaked.  </li>
            <li>once I did, much easier second time.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve refilled it 4 times so far)</li>
            <li>I filled it in a few minutes without spilling any perfume.</li>
            <li>so I only spritz as much as I think I&#x27;ll need for my trip.  </li>
            <li>I like the ability to use spray bottles or pour directly into the unit.  </li>
            <li>I wasted money on it and wasted my good perfume as well.</li>
            <li>I packed it in a ziplock with my other liquids, because by the time I got to Scotland, the bottle was empty and all my liquids smelled lovely.</li>
            <li>I had such high expectations - which were not met.  </li>
            <li>It is light, small and portable.</li>
            <li>I needed something to decant a small amount of perfume into, and this fit the bill.</li>
            <li>pretty pink color and doesnt seem to leak.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However this pink atomizer was leaking from the first day itself.</li>
            <li>It was pretty, I got the pink one.</li>
            <li>A little hard to see how close to full you&#x27;re getting, but these things hold more than enough for a two-week vacation.</li>
            <li>however the only down side to this one is that you cannot tell if it is full.  </li>
            <li>Let me start by saying I almost spent a ton of money to buy a perfume roller just to get a purse sized tube of my favorite perfume and its not cheap!  </li>
            <li>I am not sure if it is because it didn&#x27;t close properly or the materials are just cheap but there is no comparison.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought 2 so far for different scents.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I&#x27;m going to invest in a spray bottle (the fancy kind) next time - this one leaked for me.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that it is a little larger than I had hoped - those quart-size zip bags get full very fast with my assorted liquids and gels - but size is less of an issue than leakage!!  </li>
            <li>now I can take my favorite perfume anywhere, and I can use up some of those stupid samples that i have a drawer full of.</li>
            <li>small enough to fit into the closed palm of your hands.</li>
            <li>I fill mine with essential oils, no spill, no fuss, I just dilute a little with rubbing alcohol so its not to much oil at one time.</li>

            <li> The flo filled very easily and I a take it anywhere!</li>
            <li> I LOVE TO MAKE MY OWN LIP GLOSS, AND</li>
            <li> Using this atomizer, I&#x27;m able to dispense a nice stream and it has lasted awhile.</li>
            <li> It was really easy to fill, you don&#x27;t have to take the top off of your perfume bottle, just spray it into the bottom of the atomizer and you are good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very fine mist</li>
            <li> This atomizer is actually easy to fill and use!</li>
            <li> Great product, exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> I was able to take my favorite perfume with me and it was very easy to fill.</li>
            <li> Sprays nice, even mist that works fine with cologne and after shave.</li>
            <li> I was able to get the stains out immediately, but I can no longer recommend this product.</li>
            <li> but i feel the travalo might be better</li>
            <li> I love this atomizer.  </li>
            <li> Love this item.  </li>
            <li> Compact, attractive, doesn&#x27;t leak, and atomizes the perfume very well.</li>
            <li> most of my friends(they got it from me</li>
            <li> Leaks out the top while adding in perfume.</li>
            <li> Perfect for traveling without having to take the chance of losing my entire bottle of perfume</li>
            <li> and I LOVE this atomizer.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure this would fill from a spray bottle--but there was no problem at all.  </li>
            <li> This works very well and is great for traveling.</li>
            <li> The color is lovely.</li>
            <li> Glad</li>
            <li> I have owned one of these for a couple of years and enjoyed having it.</li>
            <li> It provides a way for me to take my favorite perfume when I travel.</li>
            <li> Travalo is better</li>
            <li> Was able to spray perfume in from my bottle without losing any or dripping.</li>
            <li> love the color.</li>
            <li> overall i am very very happy with this.</li>
            <li> A fill lasted more than a week with sparing cologne, and three, four days with liberal after shave.</li>
            <li> I love the product, and would recommend it to everyone.  </li>
            <li> so it sure does not hold much.&lt;br /&gt;BUT</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t able to salvage any of my perfume.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this so that I could carry my favorite perfume to work.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leak like many others.</li>
            <li> No leaks, cool design, handy to take anywhere.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to fill with your favorite perfume for travel.</li>
            <li> Filled this with my favorite (and discontinued perfume).</li>
            <li> I filled it with my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> The original scent genie works much better.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how easy it was to fill it from a spray perfume bottle.</li>
            <li> After seeing the size and how easy it was to fill I bought one for myself.</li>
            <li> Soooooo easy to fill</li>
            <li> Was easy to fill and has not leaked.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leak, easy to use.</li>
            <li> It was easy to use and allows me to carry my perfume with me without worrying about leaks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to fill.</li>
            <li> Also, the button came off too easily.</li>
            <li> Fills easily, neatly.</li>
            <li> Easy to carry in your purse and dispurse.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to fill and fits in any purse or clutch.  </li>
            <li> easy to fill.</li>
            <li> Easy to fill and easy to use.</li>
            <li> easy to fill up.</li>
            <li> Easy to fill...just spray into the bottom of the atomizer.  </li>
            <li> It feels pretty sturdy and watertight, and the finish is really nice.</li>
            <li> It was very easy to fill up with my favorite perfume, does not leak and does not spray out too much perfume when I use it.</li>
            <li> They are beautiful in pink (my favorite color).</li>
            <li> and it give an even fine spray.  </li>
            <li> so I could enjoy it after I exercise in the mornings, and this little atomizer is perfect.</li>
            <li> and I really enjoy having my perfume with me.  </li>
            <li> I liked it so much that I bought one for my husband as well.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something cute to hold your favorite perfume and not take the whole bottle with</li>
            <li> However, I have carried it in my purse and so far, so good.  </li>
            <li> The aluminum case is light weight and protects the inner glass liner very effectively.  </li>
            <li> It fits perfectly into into my small purse makeup bag.</li>
            <li> There is a new way that I can put my perfume in those kind of atomizer.</li>
            <li> Perfect for traveling with perfume without having to take your full, heavy bottle!</li>
            <li> So I use these for any splash samples that don&#x27;t have sprayers.&lt;br /&gt;Advice: do not fill with one fragrance and try to clean it out and replace another fragrance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to fill and a super convenient size.</li>
            <li> However, with all the restrictions on liquids, I found myself checking a bag with the airlines more often than I would have liked simply because I had full sized liquid toiletries and cosmetics.  </li>
            <li> Aside from looking like a &amp;#34;Marital Aid&amp;#34; ;) This is the perfect solution for someone that wants to carry a little perfume in their clutch or take it on a trip without worrying if your bottle will fit in your Quart-sized ziplock. :)</li>
            <li> But cool once I figured it out</li>
            <li> This is the first atomizer I&#x27;ve bought that doesn&#x27;t leak and is fairly easy to fill.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased this for my mom for christmas, it came really quickly and product is as shown.</li>
            <li> Its not only cute and stylish</li>
            <li> I have tried even super glue to fix the problem but to no avail.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased that I could fill the atomizer from my &#x27;big&#x27; perfume bottles.  </li>
            <li> But it is very pretty.</li>
            <li> I filled it right away and am ready to go!</li>
            <li> it is easy to fill, very lightweight, and fun to have.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing, it works with my standard bottle of prrfume.</li>
            <li> Bought this product a few weeks ago, and it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li> Took just a couple minutes to have this filled up and ready to go.</li>
            <li> Hope my mom will find this useful.</li>
            <li> Just unscrew the bottom of the Flo Atomizer and spray your favorite perfume directly into the reservoir.  </li>
            <li> This would be useful for samples because they can be poured into the atomizer.  </li>
            <li> Saw this advertised in a magazine and well worth $10.  </li>
            <li> The wife would of liked it to be bigger.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Travalo Rollerball and am much happier with ease of filling, very small size (great for pockets), and no leaking!</li>
            <li> It arrived very fast, as always with Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> I bought the silver one first and loved it so much I bought the pink ones for all the bridesmaids in my wedding!</li>
            <li> Screw the bottom back on, make sure it&#x27;s tight, and you are good to go.  </li>
            <li> It is great to have a small spray bottle of cologne when you are out of the house instead of lugging around a large bottle.</li>
            <li> This discrepancy should be your first warning.</li>
            <li> I used on my trip and had more that enough sprays for my 13 day vacation.</li>
            <li> really helps!   </li>
            <li> This atomizer was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> Will purchase more for all of my different perfumes.</li>
            <li> but it really leaks!</li>
            <li> Just used this for the first time on a trip to Scotland.</li>
            <li> This atomizer is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> this was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It works really well!</li>
            <li> A waste--and a waste of good perfume.</li>
            <li> Easy to fill up and the metal casing is sturdy enough that I&#x27;m not afraid of this cracking or breaking in my luggage.</li>
            <li> It does look cute, but it isn&#x27;t worth a single cent.</li>
            <li> It is easy to find travel sizes of your toiletries, but it can get pretty pricey to buy small sample sizes of all your favorite fragrances.  </li>
            <li> My sister, whom received it as a stocking stuffer loved the color and its small size.</li>
            <li> This atomizer worked fine at first, but after traveling with it for a short amount of time, it leaked.</li>
            <li> It is easy to fill following the directions.  </li>
            <li> I had droplets of rust colored cologne all over my fine white blouse.  </li>
            <li> The container is the perfect size to carry in the bag, even if you use a tiny bag, obviously is for little touch ups on the go.</li>
            <li> The spray works really well.</li>
            <li> My whole family uses it and</li>
            <li> The container is very sturdy.</li>
            <li> MUST HAVE for perfume fenatics and when you don&#x27;t want to risk carrying the whole perfume bottle.</li>
            <li> The silver atomizer works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Any way highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Well, much to my surprise</li>
            <li> , you don&#x27;t spill perfume at all - it&#x27;s soooo lightweight, you can take it anywhere - and its soooo cute in pink!  </li>
            <li> This cute little baby does exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this refillable atomizer before I left for vacation!  </li>
            <li> I originally was very critical of this product because I couldn&#x27;t get it to work.</li>
            <li> but I left one star out since I can&#x27;t really tell when it is completely full.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple to clean also--</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice when you have samples of fragrances that come in small vial bottles.</li>
            <li> It works mainly for spray fragrances because you have to spray it into this atomizer, and it does not come with a funnel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It can be challenging to actually open, especially post shower when everything is damp</li>
            <li> highly recommended</li>
            <li> I love this little travel atomizer.  </li>
            <li> Too bad because it is the perfect size.</li>
            <li> I normally use it for samples of perfume that don&#x27;t come with a sprayer.  </li>
            <li> Love the sleek design and purchased a black one and a silver one for myself too!</li>
            <li> I wanted to take my new perfume with me to the office</li>
            <li> The top comes straight off if you pull hard.</li>
            <li> Clearly, you are not going to fit much perfume in this--the paperwork in the box estimates that this little atomizer holds 77 sprays.</li>
            <li> It took long to be delivered but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> so will the second perfume smell like the first one?</li>
            <li> I was looking for a small (and cute) atomizer for my daughter (who is 7).  </li>
            <li> I have read about people&#x27;s problems with it leaking, but I haven&#x27;t so far!</li>
            <li> This product made a mess when I filled it.</li>
            <li> saves me from having to worry about packing a large bottle or buying a smaller size.</li>
            <li> It was black but saw it came in pink on Amazon and was so excited!!</li>
            <li> Not sure what other reviewers were talking about when they say there was waste when filling this, it works perfect and no waste whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> So far there is no leaks</li>
            <li> The real test comes next week, when it will go traveling with me.  </li>
            <li> That was about two months ago and now it has almost completely evaporated.</li>
            <li> I travel fairly frequently and often times</li>
            <li> Thus far, they haven&#x27;t leaked.  </li>
            <li> once I did, much easier second time.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve refilled it 4 times so far)</li>
            <li> I filled it in a few minutes without spilling any perfume.</li>
            <li> so I only spritz as much as I think I&#x27;ll need for my trip.  </li>
            <li> I like the ability to use spray bottles or pour directly into the unit.  </li>
            <li> I wasted money on it and wasted my good perfume as well.</li>
            <li> I packed it in a ziplock with my other liquids, because by the time I got to Scotland, the bottle was empty and all my liquids smelled lovely.</li>
            <li> I had such high expectations - which were not met.  </li>
            <li> It is light, small and portable.</li>
            <li> I needed something to decant a small amount of perfume into, and this fit the bill.</li>
            <li> pretty pink color and doesnt seem to leak.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However this pink atomizer was leaking from the first day itself.</li>
            <li> It was pretty, I got the pink one.</li>
            <li> A little hard to see how close to full you&#x27;re getting, but these things hold more than enough for a two-week vacation.</li>
            <li> however the only down side to this one is that you cannot tell if it is full.  </li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I almost spent a ton of money to buy a perfume roller just to get a purse sized tube of my favorite perfume and its not cheap!  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is because it didn&#x27;t close properly or the materials are just cheap but there is no comparison.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought 2 so far for different scents.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I&#x27;m going to invest in a spray bottle (the fancy kind) next time - this one leaked for me.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that it is a little larger than I had hoped - those quart-size zip bags get full very fast with my assorted liquids and gels - but size is less of an issue than leakage!!  </li>
            <li> now I can take my favorite perfume anywhere, and I can use up some of those stupid samples that i have a drawer full of.</li>
            <li> small enough to fit into the closed palm of your hands.</li>
            <li> I fill mine with essential oils, no spill, no fuss, I just dilute a little with rubbing alcohol so its not to much oil at one time.</li>
            <li> It works alright, but beware of leaving anything in here for too long as it is not a perfectly tight seal and fragrance will evaporate out if left inside for a long time.</li>
            <li> You are supposed to pour the perfume into the vial; there is no little funnel anything to assist in pouring - just a little tiny hole.  </li>
            <li> Because the inner container is glass, it is possible to switch out fragrances without having one contaminate the other just by cleaning it with alcohol.  </li>
            <li> So I just slowly poured my perfume from my large bottle into the atomizer.  </li>
            <li> Do not depend on it for long term storage.</li>
            <li> And when I sprayed the perfume on me, I feel like the fragrance would not stay on me for that long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for travel and just to stick into my purse for a long day</li>
            <li> Directions not complete</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it for long time storage</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking for some word to express my feelings about this product, but I can&#x27;t find the right ones since this idea is so unbelievable!!</li>
            <li> I was very annoyed because I had filled it with costly perfume and couldn&#x27;t get it to spray.</li>
            <li> The package box is so different from the picture, but the atomizer is the same.&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing is that the glass inside the atomizer is so fragile that it brooke right away the atomizer fell.</li>
            <li> Still does a decent job, but wastes too much perfume to be using it with expensive perfumes.</li>
            <li> the only reason for 3 stars... is because it can be messy to refill.</li>
            <li> Trying to spray it from a traditional bottle resulted in too much wasted perfume all over my hands.</li>
            <li> so I literally spent 10 dollars on this s</li>
            <li> I had ordered 2 Flo Atomizers - 1 in pink and 1 in silver.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of annoying, because the bottom, where you input the perfume, screws off.</li>
            <li> other than that... goes in my dop-kit and always with me...</li>
            <li> It did not work with one of my perfume bottles, but I got it to work well with my other one.  </li>
            <li> Plus, I just had an inquiry to their customer service since I&#x27;m visiting a foreign country and wanted to buy one of their products as a gift and have it sent here.</li>
            <li> A total wasted of money!</li>
            <li> but my brand doesn&#x27;t come in a small container and didn&#x27;t want to cart the big bottle.  </li>
            <li> Other containers have leaked or just not performed so tried this one.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I have a large bottle of perfume that is glass and difficult to transport.</li>
            <li> and unlike other atomizers, this one doesn&#x27;t leak!  </li>
            <li> I purchased this item based on previous reviews.  </li>
            <li> To fill the atomizer you spray into it which is a bit of a mess.  </li>
            <li> I had a bunch of small non-spray bottle Dior perfumes that I never really used bc</li>
            <li> It keeps tight and nothing spills into my purse either.  </li>
            <li> I like this little atomizer.</li>
            <li> but it might be helpful to save the little sheet that comes in the box.</li>
            <li> Sadly my little spray bottle leaks.  </li>
            <li> Just read the directions to spray your perfume into the FLO, and you&#x27;ll have little waste.</li>
            <li> Crazy fast.</li>
            <li> few months ago I discovered that there is a part inside that seems to rust.  </li>
            <li> The actual capacity as stated in the included product literature and measured by me is 6 mL or approximately 0.2 ounces.</li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> It can be quite messy.</li>
            <li> Took a few minutes and a daughter to help me figure out how to fill it, but</li>
            <li> the lid was very hard to remove and it is just not what I had hoped for, the quality was less then expected</li>
            <li> because they dont make small sizes of the stuff i like.</li>
            <li> Someone suggested an atomizer and I looked to Amazon for one as usual</li>
            <li> In the past I bought a Travalo too and it leaked.  </li>
            <li> not sure how often it requires refill or how it will handle a change in perfume...</li>
            <li> not sure yet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what I needed for a small amount of perfume which came in a bottle</li>
            <li> buy perfume samples since they are less expensive and don&#x27;t go bad like large bottles.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to get a grip on it.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time filling it.  </li>
            <li> This is the third item now that I have been unhappy with.</li>
            <li> How inconvenient to travel with big glass bottles!  </li>
            <li> No leaks like with other atomizers including prefilled expensive perfumes which leaked.  </li>
            <li> I put my very expensive perfume in it and not only did it not work, but it leaked all over!!!!!!</li>
            <li> ESSENTIAL OILS AND THIS LITTLE BOTTLES ARE NOT FOR WHAT I DO.THEY LEAK VERY BAD</li>
            <li> and it went through some tough flights (Air France)</li>
            <li> I was tired of carrying around my perfume bottles.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any leaks like others I have purchased.</li>
            <li> What a waste of expensive perfume!</li>
            <li> tried to put some water into it to try it before putting any expensive perfume</li>
            <li> It leaked after a while :(</li>
            <li> However it leaked horribly</li>
            <li> This thing is absolutely horrible.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Love! Use it on the daily!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this for my mom for christmas, it came really quickly and product is as shown. Hope my mom will find this useful.</li>
            <li> The atomizer works as advertised.  It is very easy to fill just by spraying your cologne using the attachment.  I purchased mine the summer of 2013.  That Christmas I gave one to all the ladies on my list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few months ago I discovered that there is a part inside that seems to rust.  I was traveling and dressed to go out when I used the atomizer.  I had droplets of rust colored cologne all over my fine white blouse.  I was able to get the stains out immediately, but I can no longer recommend this product.</li>
            <li> To fill the atomizer you spray into it which is a bit of a mess.  pretty pink color and doesnt seem to leak. I bought it so i could bring it on the plane but i feel the travalo might be better</li>
            <li> This product made a mess when I filled it. It did not work with the sprayer I had on my Coco Madamoiselle bottle. I lost quite a bit of perfume. The atomizer itself does have a nice sprayer, though. I just wished my perfume bottle was compatible.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get is to work.</li>
            <li> This is the second Flo frangrance atomizer I have bought.  The design is great and it is very useful. Wanted to have all the colors for my different perfumes.  Once again will say that is is a great product, so cute and easy to use. Perfect for every day use and for travel.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift and the stated capacity at this time on Amazon is either 1.1 ounces (33 mL) or 2 ounces (59 mL), depending on whether you believe the title or the bullet-point item description. This discrepancy should be your first warning. The actual capacity as stated in the included product literature and measured by me is 6 mL or approximately 0.2 ounces. This is either 18% or 10% of the advertised size. Clearly, you are not going to fit much perfume in this--the paperwork in the box estimates that this little atomizer holds 77 sprays.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, on the go accessory.  Great for taking your favorite scent on the road and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I like the concept of the perfume on the go however the only down side to this one is that you cannot tell if it is full.  It works wonderful but I left one star out since I can&#x27;t really tell when it is completely full.  I like the size and I really enjoy having my perfume with me.  I would still recommend it friends, family and you because it does what it is supposed too...</li>
            <li> I love this atomizer.  I normally use it for samples of perfume that don&#x27;t come with a sprayer.  It&#x27;s simple to clean also--I just run some rubbing alcohol through and haven&#x27;t ever had issues of scents getting mixed together.  I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Best feature - this atomizer does not leak!!!  A problem when flying!  It is easy to fill following the directions.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that it is a little larger than I had hoped - those quart-size zip bags get full very fast with my assorted liquids and gels - but size is less of an issue than leakage!!  I&#x27;ve purchased another one to fill with a different fragrance.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and it is as described. It&#x27;s very easy to fill. The instructions looked like I was supposed to spray the perfume into the atomizer, but I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to do that without perfume leaking out.  So I just slowly poured my perfume from my large bottle into the atomizer.  Because of the funnel shaped opening, the perfume just poured in with no spills or difficulty. The spray works really well. It&#x27;s a very fine mist so you can control whether you want a concentrated spray (by spraying close to the skin) or do the \\&quot;mist and walk under\\&quot; method.  Great product, exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> The container is the perfect size to carry in the bag, even if you use a tiny bag, obviously is for little touch ups on the go. So far there is no leaks and it is very easy to fill.</li>
            <li> This product is good if you&#x27;re just using it to portion your perfume. However, if you&#x27;re using it to travel, specifically flying, it leaks. What a waste of expensive perfume!</li>
            <li> This was a perfect Christmas stocking stuffer. It arrived very fast, as always with Amazon Prime. I was amazed at how easy it was to fill it from a spray perfume bottle. My sister, whom received it as a stocking stuffer loved the color and its small size. After seeing the size and how easy it was to fill I bought one for myself.</li>
            <li> I bought the silver one first and loved it so much I bought the pink ones for all the bridesmaids in my wedding! It is THE BEST! Soooooo easy to fill, you don&#x27;t spill perfume at all - it&#x27;s soooo lightweight, you can take it anywhere - and its soooo cute in pink!  Anyone who travels NEEDS one of these!  Best gift EVER!</li>
            <li> I travel weekly. saves me from having to worry about packing a large bottle or buying a smaller size. because they dont make small sizes of the stuff i like. the only reason for 3 stars... is because it can be messy to refill. other than that... goes in my dop-kit and always with me...</li>
            <li> The real test comes next week, when it will go traveling with me.  Was easy to fill and has not leaked.</li>
            <li> I travel a lot and all the time I haveproblems with carring my perfume with me after the security check...now after I bought this product my problem has been solved. It&#x27;s amazing, it works with my standard bottle of prrfume. It was the best investement of the year (-:</li>
            <li> Works great. A little hard to see how close to full you&#x27;re getting, but these things hold more than enough for a two-week vacation. Works on any kind of perfume bottle.</li>
            <li> Why buy a refillable perfume atomizer when:  1) following the instructions, much perfume was spilled and wasted  2) once i tried to use this there was virtually no perfume transferred.  A waste--and a waste of good perfume.</li>
            <li> Love this item.  I used to bring a full-sized bottle of Estee Lauder Beautiful when I travel and was always worried about it breaking in transport thus wasting perfume and drenching/staining my suitcase.  The item is about the length of my finger so it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space in my toiletries bag.  The instructions say it holds enough perfume for 60+ sprays.  It was simple to fill;  Just unscrew the bottom of the Flo Atomizer and spray your favorite perfume directly into the reservoir.  Screw the bottom back on, make sure it&#x27;s tight, and you are good to go.  No spills or leaks.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item based on previous reviews.  I was very pleased that I could fill the atomizer from my &#x27;big&#x27; perfume bottles.  It did not work with one of my perfume bottles, but I got it to work well with my other one.  I used on my trip and had more that enough sprays for my 13 day vacation.</li>
            <li> It leaked after a while :(</li>
            <li> So glad I bought this! really helps!   and unlike other atomizers, this one doesn&#x27;t leak!  Amazing service! highly recommended</li>
            <li> This atomizer was exactly what I was looking for.  It was very easy to fill up with my favorite perfume, does not leak and does not spray out too much perfume when I use it.</li>
            <li> I put my very expensive perfume in it and not only did it not work, but it leaked all over!!!!!! now I can&#x27;t return it.  This is the third item now that I have been unhappy with.</li>
            <li> Compact, attractive, doesn&#x27;t leak, and atomizes the perfume very well. Pleased! GF loves to freshen up on the go, and this product gives her the ability.</li>
            <li> I dont need to carry my big bottle of EDT for travelling anymore. I just need this Flo atomizer for travelling. It is light, small and portable.</li>
            <li> I LOVE TO MAKE MY OWN LIP GLOSS, AND ESSENTIAL OILS AND THIS LITTLE BOTTLES ARE NOT FOR WHAT I DO.THEY LEAK VERY BAD</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this item</li>
            <li> I wanted this to carry a smaller amount of my perfume. The instructions are simple. I tried following the instructions for awhile while making adjustments thinking I wasn&#x27;t doing it correctly, but it kept leaking perfume from the sides of the nozzle. This would be useful for samples because they can be poured into the atomizer.  Trying to spray it from a traditional bottle resulted in too much wasted perfume all over my hands.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leak, easy to use. This is eactly what I wanted for my perfume something  that fits in my hand and looks good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking for some word to express my feelings about this product, but I can&#x27;t find the right ones since this idea is so unbelievable!! My whole family uses it and most of my friends(they got it from me ;-), it&#x27;s a great gift and and so easy to carry around and use! Plus, I just had an inquiry to their customer service since I&#x27;m visiting a foreign country and wanted to buy one of their products as a gift and have it sent here. I got a reply in 5 minutes which solved all my problems....</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. It was easy to use and allows me to carry my perfume with me without worrying about leaks.</li>
            <li> Leaks out the top while adding in perfume. A total wasted of money!</li>
            <li> Works well, doesn&#x27;t leak.  Good buy.</li>
            <li> Good size and very easy to fill no matter what method you uae for filling it. It works alright, but beware of leaving anything in here for too long as it is not a perfectly tight seal and fragrance will evaporate out if left inside for a long time. I put some perfume in this atomizer for a trip and did not use it up all the way so I just left it in there and put it away in a drawer. That was about two months ago and now it has almost completely evaporated. So, if you use this, add only the amount of perfume you will use in a couple weeks or so and try to use up what you put in it. Do not depend on it for long term storage. The container is very sturdy. I think there is no chance of the bottle cracking if dropped.</li>
            <li> Perfect for traveling without having to take the chance of losing my entire bottle of perfume</li>
            <li> I like this little atomizer. It&#x27;s really nice when you have samples of fragrances that come in small vial bottles. This way you can spray it on instead of dab it on. Much more effective!</li>
            <li> I am constantly traveling for work and I LOVE this atomizer. Easy to fill up and the metal casing is sturdy enough that I&#x27;m not afraid of this cracking or breaking in my luggage. It took long to be delivered but it was worth the wait. Will purchase more for all of my different perfumes.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure this would fill from a spray bottle--but there was no problem at all.  It keeps tight and nothing spills into my purse either.  It&#x27;s solved my problem when I want to take cologne to travel or just as a touch up.</li>
            <li> This works very well and is great for traveling. It&#x27;s easy to fill. However, once it came time to travel again and refill this, I forgot how.  I found helpful links online but it might be helpful to save the little sheet that comes in the box.</li>
            <li> MUST HAVE for perfume fenatics and when you don&#x27;t want to risk carrying the whole perfume bottle. It&#x27;s super easy to fill and a super convenient size. I found this at a local cosmetic store and lost it. It was black but saw it came in pink on Amazon and was so excited!! Super great find.</li>
            <li> Works great! I was able to take my favorite perfume with me and it was very easy to fill.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for a traveling item.&lt;br /&gt;The size, color. The package box is so different from the picture, but the atomizer is the same.&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing is that the glass inside the atomizer is so fragile that it brooke right away the atomizer fell.</li>
            <li> the lid was very hard to remove and it is just not what I had hoped for, the quality was less then expected</li>
            <li> I keep it in my purse and it hasn&#x27;t leaked at all.  I purchased a miniature size perfume (non-spray, which I prefer) to test out the fragrance.  Using this atomizer, I&#x27;m able to dispense a nice stream and it has lasted awhile.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for traveling of just keeping in your purse.  You never know when you may need to freshen up.</li>
            <li> I travel fairly frequently and often times it is only an overnight trip.  However, with all the restrictions on liquids, I found myself checking a bag with the airlines more often than I would have liked simply because I had full sized liquid toiletries and cosmetics.  It is easy to find travel sizes of your toiletries, but it can get pretty pricey to buy small sample sizes of all your favorite fragrances.  This atomizer eliminates that issue.  It is very easy to fill without any leaking or spilling.  Because the inner container is glass, it is possible to switch out fragrances without having one contaminate the other just by cleaning it with alcohol.  (Instructions are provided for this)  The aluminum case is light weight and protects the inner glass liner very effectively.  I liked it so much that I bought one for my husband as well.</li>
            <li> Had to YouTube the instructions geez!!! But cool once I figured it out</li>
            <li> Stopped working after 2 months.  The bottle started leaking all over my purse in my car.</li>
            <li> The color is lovely. BUT! It doesn&#x27;t work! I put my fav perfume in it, and it just doesn&#x27;t work at all! so I literally spent 10 dollars on this s*** which doesn&#x27;t work at all! DO NOT BUY THIS!</li>
            <li> Luv the idea but it really leaks!</li>
            <li> There is a new way that I can put my perfume in those kind of atomizer. And I can wash it if I change the perfume!!!&lt;br /&gt;Perfect</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT! I had a bunch of small non-spray bottle Dior perfumes that I never really used bc it didn&#x27;t have a mister. The flo filled very easily and I a take it anywhere! I want 100 more!</li>
            <li> Great product, love it for my purse.  It works mainly for spray fragrances because you have to spray it into this atomizer, and it does not come with a funnel.</li>
            <li> I have a large bottle of perfume that is glass and difficult to transport. This makes taking perfume on the go perfect. I keep one in my purse and it is perfect for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I almost spent a ton of money to buy a perfume roller just to get a purse sized tube of my favorite perfume and its not cheap!  Someone suggested an atomizer and I looked to Amazon for one as usual I found what I needed. This cute little baby does exactly what I wanted. Its not only cute and stylish but it holds the perfect amount of scent. I had doubts about how it would work with a spray bottle, but no worries, its simple to use and fill. If you are looking for something cute to hold your favorite perfume and not take the whole bottle with you get this!!! And the shipping? Crazy fast. I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Just used this for the first time on a trip to Scotland. Filled this with my favorite (and discontinued perfume). Glad I packed it in a ziplock with my other liquids, because by the time I got to Scotland, the bottle was empty and all my liquids smelled lovely. Won&#x27;t be recommending heinous product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I filled it with my favorite perfume. I used it once and went to use it again about two weeks later and the perfume had evaporated. The original scent genie works much better.</li>
            <li> It made my perfume smell like isopropyl alcohol upon spraying. Also, the button came off too easily. I do not recommend. I ended up throwing it away.</li>
            <li> I had ordered 2 Flo Atomizers - 1 in pink and 1 in silver. The silver atomizer works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However this pink atomizer was leaking from the first day itself. The leak is from the area where the glass and the metal meet. I have tried even super glue to fix the problem but to no avail.</li>
            <li> thatÂ´s ok, a good piece, grand seller</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to having this to use but that was a mistake.  You are supposed to pour the perfume into the vial; there is no little funnel anything to assist in pouring - just a little tiny hole.  What a waste.</li>
            <li> I have owned one of these for a couple of years and enjoyed having it. Finally I found them again and I purchased several to give for Christmas this year.</li>
            <li> I bought two.  They don&#x27;t hold alot of liquids- just enough to travel with.  Thus far, they haven&#x27;t leaked.  They are beautiful in pink (my favorite color).</li>
            <li> This works great. I travel every week. It provides a way for me to take my favorite perfume when I travel.</li>
            <li> I liked the concept of the product a lot. It was pretty, I got the pink one. But when I was traveling, some of it leaked. And when I sprayed the perfume on me, I feel like the fragrance would not stay on me for that long. I wish it worked out for me.</li>
            <li> Have always wanted to take my perfume along on trips but my brand doesn&#x27;t come in a small container and didn&#x27;t want to cart the big bottle.  Other containers have leaked or just not performed so tried this one.  Worked great.  Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because it wasn&#x27;t the easiest to fill.  Other than that, it&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
            <li> Leaks! Travalo is better</li>
            <li> Worked well, didn&#x27;t leak. Was able to spray perfume in from my bottle without losing any or dripping.</li>
            <li> This atomizer is exactly what I was looking for. I needed something to decant a small amount of perfume into, and this fit the bill. I&#x27;ve used it for travel and just to stick into my purse for a long day and I&#x27;ve never had any problems with it leaking (although I haven&#x27;t taken it on an airplane yet). It feels pretty sturdy and watertight, and the finish is really nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m experimenting with making my own men and women fragrances and I bought 3 of these to use as samplers. Works great at what I need to do and the portability and durability is what I like best about this product.</li>
            <li> Bought this product a few weeks ago, and it&#x27;s great.  No leaks, cool design, handy to take anywhere.  In the past I bought a Travalo too and it leaked.  I am not sure if it is because it didn&#x27;t close properly or the materials are just cheap but there is no comparison. Any way highly recommended!</li>
            <li> small enough to fit into the closed palm of your hands. perfect for traveling and updating your perfume during the day. love the color. it&#x27;s perfect for me. not sure how often it requires refill or how it will handle a change in perfume... so will the second perfume smell like the first one? not sure yet. tried to put some water into it to try it before putting any expensive perfume but i didn&#x27;t manage to put any water which i would think would help me &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; it between perfumes. but that&#x27;s detail. overall i am very very happy with this. hopefully it lasts!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get this to fill with perfume, even when I looked on the internet. It just sits here, waiting for me to try to fill it again. Sigh. But it is very pretty.</li>
            <li> Sprays nice, even mist that works fine with cologne and after shave. A fill lasted more than a week with sparing cologne, and three, four days with liberal after shave. Nifty compact size. Fills easily, neatly. Didn&#x27;t leak on me; don&#x27;t know why others had problem.</li>
            <li> Aside from looking like a &amp;#34;Marital Aid&amp;#34; ;) This is the perfect solution for someone that wants to carry a little perfume in their clutch or take it on a trip without worrying if your bottle will fit in your Quart-sized ziplock. :)</li>
            <li> I used this while traveling and it went through some tough flights (Air France) and it doesn&#x27;t spill and holds a TON of perfume.</li>
            <li> it is easy to fill, very lightweight, and fun to have. had some friends wanting one too. i would consider buying another.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a small (and cute) atomizer for my daughter (who is 7).  Needless to say, I&#x27;m going to invest in a spray bottle (the fancy kind) next time - this one leaked for me.  I had such high expectations - which were not met.  Oh well.</li>
            <li> no leaks, no problems filling it.  now I can take my favorite perfume anywhere, and I can use up some of those stupid samples that i have a drawer full of.</li>
            <li> I use it as-is, but I was dissappointed when I got it to find out that you have to SPRAY PERFUME IN TO IT!!! It can be quite messy. I was under the assumption that this was like the ones I saw at a store once (and should have bought then!) where you pump the perfume in to it by taking the spray nozzle off the perfume bottle. Still does a decent job, but wastes too much perfume to be using it with expensive perfumes.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for air travel which I haven&#x27;t done since my purchase.  However, I have carried it in my purse and so far, so good.  No leaks like with other atomizers including prefilled expensive perfumes which leaked.  Great service and on time delivery from this company.</li>
            <li> Easy to carry in your purse and dispurse.  Took a few minutes and a daughter to help me figure out how to fill it, but once I did, much easier second time.  I just take out and throw in bin when I go through airport security.  No problems.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and it was great.  It is easy to fill and fits in any purse or clutch.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for almost a year now and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it. I flew from NJ to AZ with it no problem. I now carry it around in my purse and it hasn&#x27;t leaked once in the entire time I&#x27;ve owned it. I&#x27;m a bit paranoid, so when I refill it (I&#x27;ve refilled it 4 times so far) I wrap it in a paper towel and stick in a plastic baggy in my purse for a day or two just in case it was going to leak. I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering another one to give to my mom so she&#x27;ll stop buying overpriced tiny bottles of the perfume she likes to carry in her purse.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this refillable atomizer before I left for vacation!  How inconvenient to travel with big glass bottles!  I filled it right away and am ready to go!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what I needed for a small amount of perfume which came in a bottle and I wanted to atomize.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for over a year now and it&#x27;s one of the best things ever. It&#x27;s a great size and I carry it with me all the time! I have read about people&#x27;s problems with it leaking, but I haven&#x27;t so far! No leakages whatsoever!</li>
            <li> Saw this advertised in a magazine and well worth $10.  Very easy to fill and use.  Great product for travel.</li>
            <li> Happy to have an atomizer that works so well.  Bigger styles would be a plus as well for use with cologne that does not have a spray.</li>
            <li> I fill mine with essential oils, no spill, no fuss, I just dilute a little with rubbing alcohol so its not to much oil at one time.</li>
            <li> This is the first atomizer I&#x27;ve bought that doesn&#x27;t leak and is fairly easy to fill.  It would make a nice stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li> This atomizer is actually easy to fill and use! I filled it in a few minutes without spilling any perfume.</li>
            <li> Took just a couple minutes to have this filled up and ready to go. It fits perfectly into into my small purse makeup bag. It&#x27;s just the ticket!</li>
            <li> Sadly my little spray bottle leaks.  My purse smells like my perfume.  Too bad because it is the perfect size.</li>
            <li> No clue how to get the cologne in the atomizer. Directions not complete</li>
            <li> easy to fill. this was exactly what I was looking for. I was tired of carrying around my perfume bottles.</li>
            <li> I took this all the way to Hawaii and it never leaked once.  It was very nice to have my fragrance with me on my travels.  Easy to fill and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Leaked. My search continues.</li>
            <li> This was a great buy.  I love the product, and would recommend it to everyone.  It was a great price too.</li>
            <li> Perfect for traveling with perfume without having to take your full, heavy bottle! Just read the directions to spray your perfume into the FLO, and you&#x27;ll have little waste.</li>
            <li> Was great for our trip!! Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a month. It works really well! easy to fill up. looks cute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i haven&#x27;t tried using a different perfume. i&#x27;d imagine that wouldn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> Easy to fill...just spray into the bottom of the atomizer.  I don&#x27;t use it for long time storage so I only spritz as much as I think I&#x27;ll need for my trip.  I&#x27;ve bought 2 so far for different scents.</li>
            <li> Leaked and won&#x27;t spray evenly.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This has been great in my gym bag. I wanted to take my new perfume with me to the office so I could enjoy it after I exercise in the mornings, and this little atomizer is perfect. It was really easy to fill, you don&#x27;t have to take the top off of your perfume bottle, just spray it into the bottom of the atomizer and you are good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be challenging to actually open, especially post shower when everything is damp and it&#x27;s hard to get a grip on it. The top comes straight off if you pull hard. It&#x27;s kind of annoying, because the bottom, where you input the perfume, screws off. I&#x27; don&#x27;t know why both sides aren&#x27;t the same because it is a lot easier to unscrew than it is to pull off the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had any problems with leaking.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time filling it.  I am using an eye dropper!!! For some reason I thoght it would be bigger-so it sure does not hold much.&lt;br /&gt;BUT I am making the best of it  Thanks I would not buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Kathy Blois</li>
            <li> I have 3 of these and think they are the best atomizers around. I have not experienced any leaks like others I have purchased. That&#x27;s why I give it 4 stars - I don&#x27;t travel with them.&lt;br /&gt;I buy perfume samples since they are less expensive and don&#x27;t go bad like large bottles. So I use these for any splash samples that don&#x27;t have sprayers.&lt;br /&gt;Advice: do not fill with one fragrance and try to clean it out and replace another fragrance. The smell will always stay in the container.</li>
            <li> I love this little travel atomizer.  It doesn&#x27;t leak at all and it give an even fine spray.  Perfect to keep in your purse!</li>
            <li> The wife would of liked it to be bigger.</li>
            <li> This atomizer worked fine at first, but after traveling with it for a short amount of time, it leaked. I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is great to have a small spray bottle of cologne when you are out of the house instead of lugging around a large bottle.</li>
            <li> Neat idea, a bit oversized.  I like the ability to use spray bottles or pour directly into the unit.  However it leaked horribly and I wasn&#x27;t able to salvage any of my perfume.  I purchased the Travalo Rollerball and am much happier with ease of filling, very small size (great for pockets), and no leaking!</li>
            <li> I originally was very critical of this product because I couldn&#x27;t get it to work. I was very annoyed because I had filled it with costly perfume and couldn&#x27;t get it to spray. I threw it into my travel cosmetics bag and figured I could use it via the filler area.  Well, much to my surprise when I tried to use in later it worked.</li>
            <li> I purchased this so that I could carry my favorite perfume to work. I have had it for over a year and I just purchased a second one. I took them on a recent cruise and they work just like they say.</li>
            <li> Bought several for the perfumes that came in a non-spray bottle. There were no spills when transferring from the bottle to the atomizer. They are awesome!</li>
            <li> This thing is absolutely horrible. It leaked perfume all over my purse. I had to throw it away only 2 days after buying it. I wasted money on it and wasted my good perfume as well. It does look cute, but it isn&#x27;t worth a single cent. Pass on this one and find a better one!</li>
            <li> This item is awesome. It is easy to fill with your favorite perfume for travel. It doesn&#x27;t leak like many others. I am very happy with this purchase and the sellers&#x27; quick delivery.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this as she uses it for when we travel on the airlines.  Not sure what other reviewers were talking about when they say there was waste when filling this, it works perfect and no waste whatsoever.  Love the sleek design and purchased a black one and a silver one for myself too!</li>
