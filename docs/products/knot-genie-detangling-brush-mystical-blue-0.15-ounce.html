    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s &amp;#34;knot&amp;#34; as great as I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li>This brush is great.  </li>
            <li>Life is good until we have to brush through post swimming workouts which leave my daughter&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li>I suppose I can use it because I have more tolerance for the feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>It helps kids comb their hair more.</li>
            <li>My daughter doesn&#x27;t complain and asks for her &amp;#34;Knot Genie&amp;#34; as soon as she is out of the bath :)</li>
            <li>so I am going to say what I love about it:&lt;br</li>
            <li>We love it and will buy more.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m already in love.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I grabbed it.</li>
            <li>I love this brush and will be buying another couple to keep on hand.</li>
            <li>This brush is fantastic for going through those tangles easily with out any kind of spray on leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and light and easy to toss into a tote bag, too.</li>
            <li>It works best on wet hair, when you start brushing at the bottom and work your way up to the roots.  </li>
            <li>Getting to school in the morning and not looking like they went through a wind tunnel is easy now and they also don&#x27;t leap out of the car and run to get away from me out of fear that I might brush their hair again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My daughter has fine hair, but tons and tons of it.</li>
            <li>Now we can move on to more important things - like fighting about the pants she wants to wear. :)</li>
            <li>Also the brush seems like it is cheaply made.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels a bit cheap and like a dog brush when you&#x27;re using it, but I don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made.</li>
            <li>She also thinks it looks really cool and is easy to hold.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>But they are worth it!</li>
            <li>It works OKAY on my straight hair but still not what was advertised!</li>
            <li>My four year old has a lot of very fine hair that tangles easily.  </li>
            <li>It seems to work well, but it really doesn&#x27;t get through many layers of hair well.</li>
            <li>She carries it around with her everywhere and now brushes it for fun.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>now I know I made the right decision.</li>
            <li>and it went right through.</li>
            <li>WHat I did was hold my hand on the underside of my hair and the brush went right through.</li>
            <li>It slides right through.</li>
            <li>The Knot &amp;#34;Genie&amp;#34; really lives up to its name, it is my sister&#x27;s wish come true.</li>
            <li>A lot better than the regular comb.</li>
            <li>My child has curly hair and this brush did absolutely nothing for his hair!</li>
            <li>considering some other detangling brushes, I found this one to sound the most promising and</li>
            <li>I bought this brush for my daughter who has curly, fine hair that constantly gets tangled.</li>
            <li>is a great solution for little guys and big girls.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>This brush is absolutely wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>From my 8-year-old daughter: It worked very well in tangly, think hair.</li>
            <li>you will have to really take your time and section off to get the layers underneath</li>
            <li>Use a detangling spray, start at the ends and loosen the tangles up gently then brush from the root to end.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wavy and gets very snarly.</li>
            <li>and I would recommend it to use with kids with long hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, so my hair gets tangled when I wash it, after a little activity, when a breeze blows, etc.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t just rip into the hair and expect a magic fairy to wiz down and remove the tangles.  </li>
            <li>Okay first of all, I don&#x27;t like to be a negative Nancy</li>
            <li>figured at $12.95 from a local hair salon that the Knot Genie would be worth a try</li>
            <li>So I will try out the new one (I went with purple this time just to switch it up) and see if it happens again and then update this review.</li>
            <li>a note to potential buyers, although this brush works magic, you can&#x27;t be too rough with it.</li>
            <li>If you are combing thin hair then it will probably perform exceptional for you.</li>
            <li>and then it took a really long time to get the right one</li>
            <li>If you have small kids who you want to use this on their own, I would recommend getting the smaller sized Knot Genie.</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair is fine, but really thick and straight.  </li>
            <li>Brush your hair starting from the ends and working up towards the scalp to remove knots efficiently without putting too much stress on the genie or the teeth will start to bend.</li>
            <li>When we get ready for preschool now he doesn&#x27;t balk at all when it is time to get hair brushed.</li>
            <li>I have 4 kids with VERY curly hair of different texture.</li>
            <li>: the blue top comes apart from the black bristle part constantly</li>
            <li>This brush has significantly cut down on the regular tears that would ensue when brushing out my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>I ordered a new one because despite that one flaw the rest of it is a big fat jar of Awesomesauce.  </li>
            <li>It does still pull a bit on tangles and isn&#x27;t \\&quot;pain free\\&quot;, but it glides through her hair like no other brush I&#x27;ve ever used, even without spray-on detangler.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend even for long hair.  </li>
            <li>is like people with regular-sized hands palming a basketball; I can barely hold onto it</li>
            <li>but with this brush it goes right through without my son crying.  </li>
            <li>the Knot Genie, even the curliest, most knotted up hair practically slips through the unique bristle configuration gently and painlessly.&amp;#34; this is entirely false!!!!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have long hair that is thin and fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a super expensive Mason Pearson brush because it&#x27;s the only thing that has sort of worked thus far.</li>
            <li> My children are biracial and they run the range of thick and tight afros to lose fine tangled curls and everything in-between.</li>
            <li> and it was a bit long for the brush.</li>
            <li> They all have long hair too.  </li>
            <li> On dry hair, it doesn&#x27;t get tangles that are underneath.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really blame it on heavy use because it did it the 4th time I ever used it and it has done it everyday since.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work at all on her really wet hair after swimming or a bath.</li>
            <li> My 12 year old daughter has thick hair half way down her back</li>
            <li> My hair goes about half way down my back</li>
            <li> She never wants to brush it because she says any other brush hurts, but she LOVES this one.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that it is a little difficult to clean the hairs tangled between the teeth.</li>
            <li> my only complaint</li>
            <li> It typically takes me about 10-15 minutes to brush my hair out after a wash.</li>
            <li> My son has really tight curly hair and this made a world of difference.  </li>
            <li> Gave it a four because it does brush scalp a little.</li>
            <li> My son hair is a little below his neck line in length.</li>
            <li> It was worse than using a basic comb!</li>
            <li> I got this as a Christmas gift for my sister, who has very thick and wavy long hair.</li>
            <li> I guarantee no more &amp;#34;ouches&amp;#34; or tears when combing the hair of your children or grandchildren.</li>
            <li> There is no more screaming when it&#x27;s time to comb out the tangles.</li>
            <li> It works and no more fighting with my daughter when it&#x27;s time to brush her hair.</li>
            <li> It works very nicely my only issue was being sent the wrong one</li>
            <li> I would give this 5 stars, but I have small hands and this brush (no handle)</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because I have very long knotty hair.</li>
            <li> Plus, the design of the brush makes it hard to hold onto.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair like me , I would recommend you not buy this  brush</li>
            <li> Seriously, if you head my kids during hair brushings you would call 911.  </li>
            <li> Awkward to hold in your hand.</li>
            <li> This brush can even get hair untangled from a shellacking of hairspray, which I thought was impossible without a ton of pain.</li>
            <li> saying that it&#x27;s a bad product.  </li>
            <li> and it bugs the crap out of me.</li>
            <li> This is horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have extensions and this brush works fantastically. It doesn&#x27;t pull on the roots. I&#x27;ve also bought them for friends with curly hair and it works wonders.</li>
            <li> I guarantee no more &amp;#34;ouches&amp;#34; or tears when combing the hair of your children or grandchildren. Irreplaceable use every day.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Only complaint is that it is a little difficult to clean the hairs tangled between the teeth. A lot better than the regular comb.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s &amp;#34;knot&amp;#34; as great as I thought it would be.  We still have tears trying to get the tangles out of my daughter&#x27;s hair.  My daughter&#x27;s hair is fine, but really thick and straight.  It doesn&#x27;t work at all on her really wet hair after swimming or a bath. On dry hair, it doesn&#x27;t get tangles that are underneath.</li>
            <li> The Knot &amp;#34;Genie&amp;#34; really lives up to its name, it is my sister&#x27;s wish come true. I got this as a Christmas gift for my sister, who has very thick and wavy long hair. She never wants to brush it because she says any other brush hurts, but she LOVES this one. She carries it around with her everywhere and now brushes it for fun. She also thinks it looks really cool and is easy to hold.&lt;br /&gt;After considering some other detangling brushes, I found this one to sound the most promising and now I know I made the right decision. This brush is absolutely wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Just a note to potential buyers, although this brush works magic, you can&#x27;t be too rough with it. Brush your hair starting from the ends and working up towards the scalp to remove knots efficiently without putting too much stress on the genie or the teeth will start to bend. But overall, even if this does wear out, I would by it again as a gift for a friend/family member... or myself!</li>
            <li> Life is good until we have to brush through post swimming workouts which leave my daughter&#x27;s hair a MESS.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great solution for little guys and big girls. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought the comb for my daughter but ended up using it for myself.  It seems to work well detangling my hair but I cannot use it for my daughter because the comb is pointy and it was hurting her head (or she claims it does) when I try it on her.  I suppose I can use it because I have more tolerance for the feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not saying that it&#x27;s a bad product.  I&#x27;m just cautioning parents that your kids might feel the same way.</li>
            <li> From my 8-year-old daughter: It worked very well in tangly, think hair. There is no more screaming when it&#x27;s time to comb out the tangles. It helps kids comb their hair more.</li>
            <li> Wish I had ordered this sooner. It works and no more fighting with my daughter when it&#x27;s time to brush her hair. Now we can move on to more important things - like fighting about the pants she wants to wear. :)</li>
            <li> This brush has significantly cut down on the regular tears that would ensue when brushing out my daughter&#x27;s hair. Definitely not a replacement for a regular brush, as using it alone leaves the hair a bit frizzy.  But it does work as advertised and I would recommend it to use with kids with long hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li> This definitely saves a lot of tears in the morning!  My four year old has a lot of very fine hair that tangles easily.  When we get ready for preschool now he doesn&#x27;t balk at all when it is time to get hair brushed.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because I have very long knotty hair. But this brush went through my knots like butter! Gave it a four because it does brush scalp a little.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for help with tangles and I have finally found it. I actually bought this for me not a child. I have long hair that is thin and fine. It typically takes me about 10-15 minutes to brush my hair out after a wash. I got this brush in the mail today and washed my hair and it went right through. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it did take a minute to get it through the entire length of my hair. My hair goes about half way down my back and it was a bit long for the brush. I found that the brush needs to be pressed against something (like your scalp) WHat I did was hold my hand on the underside of my hair and the brush went right through. If you or your kids  need help with tangles this is your brush!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. It truly works to get out knots. Though if you have lots of knots every day they only last a couple of months. But they are worth it!</li>
            <li> This brush is great.  It works best on wet hair, when you start brushing at the bottom and work your way up to the roots.  My daughter doesn&#x27;t complain and asks for her &amp;#34;Knot Genie&amp;#34; as soon as she is out of the bath :)</li>
            <li> Works well,  probably adding a handle would make it easier to handle</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my daughter who has curly, fine hair that constantly gets tangled. It seems to work well, but it really doesn&#x27;t get through many layers of hair well. Also the brush seems like it is cheaply made. If you are combing thin hair then it will probably perform exceptional for you. Thicker hair you will have to really take your time and section off to get the layers underneath combed well.</li>
            <li> Okay first of all, I don&#x27;t like to be a negative Nancy so I am going to say what I love about it:&lt;br /&gt;My kids don&#x27;t scream like they are being abused anymore.  My fears of someone calling CPS on me for brushing my kids hair are over. Seriously, if you head my kids during hair brushings you would call 911.  I have used a gazillion products and and all have been kinda meh... the Knot Genie has totally stolen the detangling show. I have 4 kids with VERY curly hair of different texture. My children are biracial and they run the range of thick and tight afros to lose fine tangled curls and everything in-between. It works on all of them. They all have long hair too.  Getting to school in the morning and not looking like they went through a wind tunnel is easy now and they also don&#x27;t leap out of the car and run to get away from me out of fear that I might brush their hair again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That all being said, you need to use it properly. You can&#x27;t just rip into the hair and expect a magic fairy to wiz down and remove the tangles.  Use a detangling spray, start at the ends and loosen the tangles up gently then brush from the root to end. It slides right through. Also like any brush, brush in sections. It gets through each section in a quarter of the time as a regular brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t brush their hair with anything else now. It works that well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now my only complaint: the blue top comes apart from the black bristle part constantly and it bugs the crap out of me. I can&#x27;t really blame it on heavy use because it did it the 4th time I ever used it and it has done it everyday since. Maybe I just got one that was defective. I ordered a new one because despite that one flaw the rest of it is a big fat jar of Awesomesauce.  So I will try out the new one (I went with purple this time just to switch it up) and see if it happens again and then update this review.</li>
            <li> It works very nicely my only issue was being sent the wrong one and then it took a really long time to get the right one</li>
            <li> I would give this 5 stars, but I have small hands and this brush (no handle) is like people with regular-sized hands palming a basketball; I can barely hold onto it and I should have gotten the tiny version. If you have small kids who you want to use this on their own, I would recommend getting the smaller sized Knot Genie. It can get out any tangles and without pain. I have very fine hair, so my hair gets tangled when I wash it, after a little activity, when a breeze blows, etc. And I&#x27;ve always been tender-headed.This brush can even get hair untangled from a shellacking of hairspray, which I thought was impossible without a ton of pain.</li>
            <li> My son has really tight curly hair and this made a world of difference.  He used to cry and cringe when I had to untangle his hair but with this brush it goes right through without my son crying.  Well worth the money.  Highly recommend even for long hair.  My son hair is a little below his neck line in length.</li>
            <li> My 12 year old daughter has thick hair half way down her back and we of course have troubles with knots in her hair. This brush is fantastic for going through those tangles easily with out any kind of spray on leave in conditioner. We love it and will buy more.</li>
            <li> Although this brush does detangle my hair , it does not work well when it comes to big knots . If you have thick hair like me , I would recommend you not buy this  brush</li>
            <li> I just purchased this brush yesterday and I&#x27;m already in love. My daughter has fine hair, but tons and tons of it. It&#x27;s wavy and gets very snarly. I&#x27;ve been using a super expensive Mason Pearson brush because it&#x27;s the only thing that has sort of worked thus far. It leaves her hair frizzy, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured at $12.95 from a local hair salon that the Knot Genie would be worth a try and I&#x27;m so glad I grabbed it. It does still pull a bit on tangles and isn&#x27;t \\&quot;pain free\\&quot;, but it glides through her hair like no other brush I&#x27;ve ever used, even without spray-on detangler. Also, it leaves her hair silky! No frizz!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels a bit cheap and like a dog brush when you&#x27;re using it, but I don&#x27;t care. It works! I love this brush and will be buying another couple to keep on hand. It&#x27;s nice and light and easy to toss into a tote bag, too.</li>
            <li> This is horrible. It did not work at all! It was spikey and hurt my daughters scalp. Awkward to hold in your hand. Cheaply made. We threw it out!</li>
            <li> In the discription is says &amp;#34;With the Knot Genie, even the curliest, most knotted up hair practically slips through the unique bristle configuration gently and painlessly.&amp;#34; this is entirely false!!!! My child has curly hair and this brush did absolutely nothing for his hair! It was worse than using a basic comb! Plus, the design of the brush makes it hard to hold onto. It works OKAY on my straight hair but still not what was advertised! Save your money!</li>
