            <li> Horrible... used everyday for 10 days straight, no change in skin color or lightness</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this daily for over a month.  No change.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> The best!  Timely delivery - very fast!  The best skin softening, exfoliating body soap. And lightening the skin evenly. Its a gradual process looking more natural.</li>
            <li> Bought this and used two bars and it did absolutely nothing! And I&#x27;m an almond shade. This was a complete waste of my money! Such a rip off!</li>
            <li> Day 5 haven&#x27;t really notice a big difference.</li>
            <li> i refuse to believe  this product  work.....scammm cause the picture  clearly  shows you  lights are affecting  the photos.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once I like it tho it didn&#x27;t dry my skin like the other ones and it seems to work emediatley and I like my tone now</li>
            <li> False advertisement. From the ingredients listed this soap is more beneficial as a moisturizer scrub than a skin-whitener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also contains a hydro ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rated 1 for false advertisement claim/inaccuracy.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really c a result</li>
            <li> Speeds up exfoliation.Overall is a mild and effective soap,slight tingle if you leave it on for few minutes before rinse.Use sparingly and test first if on face area.</li>
            <li> Really really it&#x27;s amazing soft,whitting&amp;look nicely</li>
            <li> The smell is so good and it leaves your skin feeling soft and smelly. *-*</li>
            <li> The first time I bought it worked well.  I noticed my skin lightening but it came with seven bars. The second time I ordered it, it only came with two and I did not notice a difference.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t done any skin lightening unfortunately. :( not even a little bit.</li>
            <li> I loved this soap! Within just a few uses I seen a difference .</li>
            <li> I just want to know if this soap really works. I was about to buy but noticed the product&#x27;s feature image. The skin gets lighter and lighter however the background does too. I was thinking the photo&#x27;s brightness was just adjusted altogether. Thanks</li>
            <li> The before and after photos were taken with light and without light.  As you an see, the darker arm has darker background (towel), which means the photo was taken with minimal light exposure. The lighter arm has lighter background (towel), which means the photo was taken with bright light, The lightest arm has lightest background which means the photo was taken with more bright light.  I am a photographer, so I know what lights can do with pictures.</li>
            <li> If you look at the pictures posted, They achieved whitening on the arm and the background too.  Nice try.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t work , I waste my money</li>
            <li> I really like the way it feels and smell&lt;br /&gt;The bars dont last.</li>
            <li> I guess I have to use this  soap from now on its so soft to the skin and also brightening up my skin .</li>
            <li> How effective is it in African American skin?</li>
