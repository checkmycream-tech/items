            <li>Sonicare toothbrushes are the best, and these compact brush heads are just right for the Philips Sonicare ProResults FlexCare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>My wife prefers the compact style brush head, we have used Philips Sonicare for over an year with great satisfaction and Amazon always offers the best price around.</li>
            <li>Love the size of this brush!  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted, in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>and I was glad to make my decision to switch to Philips Sonicare!</li>
            <li>I love them!</li>
            <li>More affordable then the sonicare website!</li>
            <li>Love these!  </li>
            <li>These are much better!</li>
            <li>This company offers very good after service and great products for customer.</li>
            <li>The brush they fit on is great and has made me one of the star patients of my dentist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li>Best price I&#x27;ve found also and delivered fast.</li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>Basically, I think compact is a good choice, which is able to accomplish every \\&quot;task\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m talking perfect checkups and not too much plaque to remove.  </li>
            <li>Me and my family really liked this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Nice product, timely delivered.</li>
            <li>This is an awesome toothbrush that came highly recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li>I Love my Sonicare and am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I can say is that this toothbrush is awesome and the heads are great, as well -- easy to put on and take off (for regular cleaning) and long-lasting.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Seller has the best price so far.</li>
            <li>Best for sensitive gums and teeth.</li>
            <li>so it is so easy to change your toothbrush every 3 months!</li>
            <li>Sonicare is a great product and combined with Amazon&#x27;s pricing and quick shipment really makes for a good purchase.</li>
            <li>Consistently satisfied by this product.</li>
            <li>Great price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I love that I was able to get them here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I am glad I kept looking.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>I love this one better because it has smaller brush heads for my teeth to focus on cleaning :D</li>
            <li>Love the compact size.</li>
            <li>I love this brush system, tho not</li>
            <li>Nothing can be more convenient than receiving the number of brush heads you need at your door step throughout the year.  </li>
            <li>We have noticed better reports each time we go in for cleaning.</li>
            <li>I love these compact brush heads SO much better than the regular-sized ones for my electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Love being able to order</li>
            <li>I wish there was better clarification between types/sizes.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The longevity of the handle and bristles keeps getting better and better.</li>
            <li>Trips to the dentist are a breeze (after many cavities).  </li>
            <li>So glad you have this size</li>
            <li>You have to replace the heads to get the most out of this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My favorite feature of the heads is the wear stripe which indicates the need to change; it is genius, with nothing to track unlike the sticker system which was a pain to manage.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are super clean and look great.</li>
            <li>Cheaper is not always better.</li>
            <li>Glad I can get it on line.</li>
            <li>These are the standard replacement heads for the Philips Sonicare at the best price I&#x27;ve seen!</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>so I was pleased to see them on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Our kids use the Sonicare, too, and just love them.</li>
            <li>Love using my Phillips Sonicare with these brushes.  </li>
            <li>I do not have much more to say about it than that.</li>
            <li>I love this product mostly because Amazon has it</li>
            <li>worked well and better than buying in the store.</li>
            <li>I purchased these through Amazon, and I am not convinced these are authentic Phillips Sonicare brush heads.</li>
            <li>However, I can not be satisfied with this item.</li>
            <li>This was the most convenient and cheapest method of purchase.</li>
            <li>I really love my Sonicare&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>It satisfied my need.</li>
            <li>They are pricier but are authentic Sonicare.</li>
            <li>It gets into the nooks &amp; crannys better.</li>
            <li>the price at $30 is pretty high for 3 tooth brushes, but they work good , and my teeth and gums are happy.</li>
            <li>And, with Prime Membership (which I love, love, love), the two-day shipping is free.</li>
            <li>The compact fit smaller mouths best.</li>
            <li>In any case, these are much better and seem to clean better than the full-sized heads.</li>
            <li>Love the free shipping.</li>
            <li>It is a good product despite the product is very pricy.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and good packaging.</li>
            <li>I love the smaller size, they clean so good!</li>
            <li>My favorite size to get it  and get things clean.</li>
            <li>The brushes are well designed and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I would suggest a softer plastic with easy access to the brushes.</li>
            <li>Oral hygiene is easy as pie with the toothbrush and brush heads.  </li>
            <li>Not always easy to find the COMPACT type</li>
            <li>Very quick service.  </li>
            <li>The product arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Much better for getting to all the angles needed to thoroughly clean your teeth.  </li>
            <li>I have had this for over 2 years already and its still going strong.</li>
            <li>I get much better results with the compact brush than with the full size brush head.</li>
            <li>These work much better for me than the full sized replacements.</li>
            <li>Expensive but do a great job and get to all the nooks and crannies in my mouth for excellent cleaning and great overall oral health.</li>
            <li>The others were fine.  </li>
            <li>Great tooth brush system, and these heads are good at getting into the small crevices.</li>
            <li>but they work fine.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what to say except that they work just fine.</li>
            <li>I had these items on auto-ship, which was super convenient because this is one of those items you&#x27;re going to be buying over and over again for many years.  </li>
            <li>These little brush heads are just perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>were so huge</li>
            <li>so they fit great in my smaller mouth.</li>
            <li>The compact brush does a great job and makes a big difference.</li>
            <li>These fit my Flexcare+.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have insurance so oral hygiene is important to prevent cavities and etc.</li>
            <li>These replacement heads are fantastic.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this</li>
            <li>Having a 3pk makes always having a brush head available easier.    </li>
            <li>The ones I bought were cheap because I bought them when they were on sale.</li>
            <li>I was happy to find the smaller sized toothbrush head on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous toothbrush heads....used them for years.  </li>
            <li>This is our 2nd, great product.</li>
            <li>i have a medium-sized mouth (according to those dental trays), and this is great to go around on the tongue-side of the arch and back to the molars.</li>
            <li>and I was hopeful what I ordered would fit my toothbrush</li>
            <li>Great for people who feel like not enough room for brush.</li>
            <li>Good replacement for my old Sonicare.</li>
            <li>fast shipping, fair price, easy transaction, my thanks!</li>
            <li>These won&#x27;t fit my toothbrush, despite my efforts to try to make sure I got the right heads.</li>
            <li>I purchased these to replace my old worn out brush head and they are as good as the original one that came with Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>, after months of using a regular tooth brush because we were recovering from a flood, I once again experienced the smoothly clean teeth.</li>
            <li>These toothbrush heads are not cheap generally, which is a pain because the Sonicare toothbrush is just brilliant at keeping the dentist happy.  </li>
            <li>They just don&#x27;t fit as snug as the original brushes that came with the toothbrush</li>
            <li>Absolutely everything was great about my order--compact size fits better in most mouths, free shipping from Amazon, a discount for subscribing to get new brush heads every 6 months, and of course, a high quality product.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t own the Phillips Sonicare system, I highly recommend it, then you can buy the brush head replacements</li>
            <li>I like the compact heads the best as I have a small mouth</li>
            <li>I do not see any significant difference between them, except for the size.   </li>
            <li>Save yourself the headache and just buy the original heads.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li>This size brush is perfect for people with a small mouth and enables you to thoroughly reach all parts of your mouth and teeth .Most</li>
            <li>I also like that this is the original Sonicare toothbrush head.</li>
            <li>a worn-out brush&lt;br /&gt;To keep my molars clean</li>
            <li>I can clean areas that the full size seem to miss.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These compact heads fit my mouth better and seem to do a better job of cleaning the gum line than the standard size heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They fit better than the big ones and you do a better job at reaching all your teeth when brushing.</li>
            <li>I like the smaller brush heads because they can reach my molars better and generally fit better in my mouth.</li>
            <li>I get good results I have used the various modes</li>
            <li>Last about 3 months soare a good buy.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try the difference between the compact head and the full head.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get 3 months out of one and when I switch to a new one it is very easy to tell the difference.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 years and have never felt my tooth so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had Sonicares for years now, in my opinion they are the best toothbrush out there and these, obviously, are an essential purchase.</li>
            <li>With the smaller head brush I&#x27;m able get into the areas where my dental hygienist spends more time on my cleaning.s</li>
            <li>This size, however, is super because it gets in and around my teefers like a pig finding truffles</li>
            <li>On Amazon, they are reasonably priced and easy to order.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more!</li>
            <li>I often check out the prices at otter stores to find the best deal and so far Amazon has it for less.</li>
            <li>sure makes it easy as it comes on a regular basis that you choose.</li>
            <li>I also have a strong gag reflex and find the the larger a toothbrush head is, the more I have issues with that.  </li>
            <li>You can also change these preferences as well.&lt;br /&gt;These in my opinion are great little toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>so afterwards I&#x27;m fresh, clean and smiling pretty.</li>
            <li>The regular brush heads are too large and do not do as good a job as the compact one does.</li>
            <li>I feel certain that when I go back for my six month exam I will get a good report.</li>
            <li>These compact brush heads are good to clean individual teeth, but I prefer to have the bigger brush heads to clean my whole mouth including all the teeth better than with compact brush heads.</li>
            <li>Amazon wins again.</li>
            <li>These brush heads do the job and are well worth it.</li>
            <li>and they are well worth it.</li>
            <li>and often then it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I love these because they are compact and fit in smaller mouths.</li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t use this ourselves, but our 1.5 year old seems to love to brush her teeth with this</li>
            <li>It cleans even better than my old unit.</li>
            <li>I like the these or the larger brushes better because they, and the Sonicare itself of course, both leave my teeth squeaky clean</li>
            <li>To my surprise, my dentist told me that my teeth and gum were good after I switched my other electric tooth brush to Philips Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li>He was so right.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>The compact brush head is just right.</li>
            <li>Really gets around teeth to clean like a trip to the Dentist.  </li>
            <li>The compact heads are pretty durable and really nice for cleaning low clearance areas.</li>
            <li>We really like these compact brush heads as they make it easier to keep our teeth clean</li>
            <li>Sent them back and went to Costco-fit perfectly and less $$</li>
            <li>My son and I have small mouths and these work great.</li>
            <li>Works great and gets into small areas.</li>
            <li>If your mouth is small, these compact brush heads are great.</li>
            <li>The smaller brush heads CLEAN TEETH  better than the large heads.</li>
            <li>you ask me, the brush is perfect, not too hard, not too soft, brushes well between the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The 3 head pack is very reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>This is a luxury item that will be among the first</li>
            <li>That was the first time A Dentist ever told me that</li>
            <li>exactly where I want them to be.  </li>
            <li>my first brush lasted 2 days.    </li>
            <li>Just what they had said in the product description, works exactly what they said.</li>
            <li>and I can reach around so much better with these tiny brushes!</li>
            <li>Cleans teeth and reaches deeper areas better with the smaller brush heads.</li>
            <li>Compact design works better for me than the regular head.</li>
            <li>I&amp;#34;ve found that the smaller toothbrushes work better for me.</li>
            <li>I thought I wouldn&#x27;t like this when it arrived because the heads are smaller, but it turns out this is a better product.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m satisfied since I knew I would eventually need the ProResults brush heads too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just to note, these brush heads will NOT last more than two months if you brush longer than 5 minutes every day.</li>
            <li>I reluctantly bought more ProResults brush heads at Costco last month.  </li>
            <li>I found that the Costco brushheads are much higher quality.  </li>
            <li>I like these better than the DiamondClean Standard replacement brush heads they sell at Costco because the price is cheaper</li>
            <li>I love my Sonicare toothbrush and change my brushes regularly!  </li>
            <li>Thanks for carrying this item!</li>
            <li>This product was exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>Like compact heads much better than larger heads.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money to buy the real thing, not a knock-off</li>
            <li>I like the new better than the old (newer model toothbrush unit)..   </li>
            <li>I must not order the right stuff very often because I didn&#x27;t know about subscription service (which I signed up for this time).  </li>
            <li>Wow exactly what I needed to get in and around those wisdom teeth, and to clean along gum line for all my gold caps.</li>
            <li>The brush is smaller to reach around in smaller mouth&#x27;s, and can get into the back spaces easier.....very nice!!</li>
            <li>They allow me to reach in the back areas of my teeth much more easily so that I can get my pearly whites truly pearly white.  </li>
            <li>I prefer these more than those and will only use these from now on since they get deeper in to the back teeth easy.  </li>
            <li>My dentist tells me that you can get better cleaning from a manual toothbrush and the key is really in the technique.</li>
            <li>I even took it on a two-month cruise and vacation with me, because the results for my gums (affirmed by my dentist) were so positive.</li>
            <li>I love my Sonicare, and try to buy multiple brushes (to save money) since my dentsist really insists I keep the brushes fresh and new.</li>
            <li>The smaller brush is able to reach all the way to the back teeth comfortably.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that the replacement heads are expensive, but the rest of the unit is well-made, and the ultraviolet sterilization light continues to function perfectly.</li>
            <li>would like - somewhere around a month and a half or two before the blue indicator color starts disappearing and the clean isn&#x27;t as good -</li>
            <li>really can&#x27;t think but that the manufacturer, Phillips, who makes the sonicare rig, makes a pretty penny on the follow up needs of their customers.</li>
            <li>Far superior to any other on the market.</li>
            <li>I bought these based on the more recent reviews thinking I was safe and that the other people who said these were knock offs were just out of their minds</li>
            <li>brushes are very good, however because of the fast brushing, and when using it together with the UV-bacteria killing bulb, the blue lines on the brush fade quite fast (blue hairs that become white are an indicator of changing the brush).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What I love about the compact version, is that I can get into places that I would normally gag on with the standard tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>The compact brush does the back of the front teeth easily.</li>
            <li>The brush head easily pulls apart when you change heads (which we do do as me and my wife use the same charger).</li>
            <li>The logo rubbed off very quickly and the current head i am using is already showing the color for replacement.</li>
            <li>I have tried both the regular and compact sizes, but these win hands down.</li>
            <li>They fit the base perfectly and are exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Fine enough.</li>
            <li>For those of us with smaller mouths, the compact head brush makes a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>However, these brushes should cost 1/2 as much.</li>
            <li>Finding them on Amazon for a really competitive price was a real bonus.  </li>
            <li>but you can choose where you buy them and for how much.</li>
            <li>The smaller Compact brush is comfortable and easier to use.</li>
            <li>When it cam time fro replacements, I ordered these and am much happier with the results.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Philips, for making these.</li>
            <li>purchase arrived sooner than I expected which, of course, pleased me immensley.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend these brush heads!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a cavity thanks to Sonicare.</li>
            <li>Also not so much scraping on my teeth to get the plaque off when I have my teeth cleaned every six months.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, and the product was as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Amazon scores again with another product priced MUCH lower than anywhere else.  </li>
            <li>I really like the size of these brushes.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The package came with three toothbrush heads for a very reasonible price.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I tried gluing it on, but then it won&#x27;t fit the charger properly.</li>
            <li>MUCH easier to brush without roughing-up my gums.</li>
            <li>The product cleans very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It really helps me to avoid</li>
            <li>What can I really say about these....</li>
            <li>They really reach and get to places</li>
            <li>I find these really helpful for this.</li>
            <li>I really like my phillips sonicare</li>
            <li>purchased these last year and struggled to get the head to fit the brush, I should of guessed at that point that they were not the real-deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These teeth bush spares work very well on my Phillips sonic tooth brush device.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really decide weather</li>
            <li>I find it much, much easier to clean in the back and on the insides</li>
            <li>At first I thought I had erred &amp; ordered the incorrect brushhead; but after comparing them to my old one I found that they were knock offs!</li>
            <li>These are the original Sonicare heads, don&#x27;t even bother with the generic ones.</li>
            <li>However, these ones are smaller than what were on the toothbrush originally.</li>
            <li>These are the original type of toothbrushes that come with the Sonicare (same size, and brushtype).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I normally replace every 3 months!</li>
            <li>After reading some other folks reviews I ordered the Philips brand and was really glad I did.</li>
            <li>do as much shopping as possible on Amazon because of the competitive prices and this is true of these brush heads.  </li>
            <li>We tried the normal length and the compact length replacements, and the whole family agrees that the compact brushes are easier to manipulate inside the mouth, and allow for better coverage especially towards the back.</li>
            <li>Our dental hygienist recommended that we use the compact brush heads on our Sonicare FlexCare Toothbrush because she feels that the smaller head can reach more places (that is certainly personal choice</li>
            <li>I love my Sonicare toothbrush and there are several different brush heads for it.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Sonicare for years and these smaller heads do a better job of cleaning my teeth than the larger ones.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to reach further and get into the smaller crevices.</li>
            <li>The compact size is perfect for people like me--i am a small person with a small mouth.</li>
            <li>As we get older, it&#x27;s easier for gums to pull away from the teeth, causing problems.</li>
            <li>These compact brush heads were purchased for my Sonicare Pro because I have a small dental arch and so brushing is more comfortable with the smaller size heads.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not adequately clear from the product page is that the products we received are not Philips original.</li>
            <li>This smaller head is great for getting the back of my molars and for angling down to get my lower bicuspids without splashing toothpaste everywhere.</li>
            <li>The wife and I love the compact brush heads to get in the tight spots.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I recommend them highly.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the most steady hand, I have a little bit of a problem balancing the toothpaste on the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>But it does fit well in the mouth to clean those hard to get to spaces.</li>
            <li>and I am Old!!</li>
            <li>Love these little brush heads.  </li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied do not clean like original diamond brushes, tried to return, not allowed;( will not purchase again, found original head at same price</li>
            <li>Expensive, but very effective in cleaning.</li>
            <li>These are the tiny ones - good for people with small mouths and jaws - or when you want to concetrate action onto each tooth by-itself.</li>
            <li>I switch on a new one every 3 months.  </li>
            <li>This is a new and improved version of the Sonic Care way of keeping your teeth in those gums that might be fading in terms of their youth and vigor.</li>
            <li>but this was a new vendor</li>
            <li>and I really can&#x27;t live without these</li>
            <li>I stocked up on brush heads back in January, and just got around to using one of these brush heads only to find out it didn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>It really reaches everywhere, front, back and around, and is much easier to manuever.</li>
            <li>I just find it confusing to find the right size brush to fit my toothbrush......</li>
            <li>Love my sonicare and have to have a compact head because I have a small mouth.  </li>
            <li>My dentist noticed the difference after I started using this one and my teeth in general feel much cleaner post-brushing.</li>
            <li>I love the Compact size, small and efficient.</li>
            <li>These are noticeably better than the no-name product, although more expensive!</li>
            <li>Compact heads are less available in stores, if they stock them at all.</li>
            <li>product was good, i bought two versions the small brush head and the big brush head, the small head works better for the way i have some extra periodontal wires in my mouth</li>
            <li>As long as I can get a better cleaning, I can deal with other nuances.  </li>
            <li>They do wear pretty quickly and it&#x27;s hard to tell if they are worn until you compare them with new heads.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To fit my little jaw&lt;</li>
            <li>I just felt that using the compact brush head took too long to clean my teeth as thoroughly as the standard brush head.</li>
            <li>Do not buy these unless you want a brush that&#x27;s half the size of the original equipment.</li>
            <li>Easy to order, no tax, no shipping, won&#x27;t buy it any other way in the future</li>
            <li>The compact head brushes are my favorite, but often hard to find at the retail drug stores near me.  </li>
            <li>However, why does Philips find it necessary to charge so much for these pint size toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Sonicare and the ProResults Compact Brush Heads complete the work of my dentist.</li>
            <li>The compact head fits in the mouth easier and does a much better job of cleaning the teeth - at least in my opinion.</li>
            <li>None of the local stores carry the compact size, only the regular heads are available.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast and there is an option to get them on a regular automatic basis.</li>
            <li>if you have the flexcare, you don&#x27;t really have a choice but to purchase this one or the standard.</li>
            <li>of all the sizes of toothbrushes sonicare offers (including those for children)...</li>
            <li>Replacement of heads are necessary and this is the place to get them much cheaper than any place else I have found them.</li>
            <li>Recomended by my dentist but not sold at stores I frequent.  </li>
            <li>The bristles were soft after a month.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is expensive but good deal if you can keep your teeth.</li>
            <li>I like putting a new brush head on my toothbrush because you really get such a smooth, slick feeling.</li>
            <li>and they sent my order right out and charged me the expected amount - professionally done.  </li>
            <li>other than that, they fit the toothbrush and work like a regular brush should.</li>
            <li>I was unable to find a better price anywhere and the shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>I love this smaller brush head since my mouth is small.  </li>
            <li>I bought these compact brush heads to go with my recently newer model Sonicare which I got to replace an older one.</li>
            <li>The compact brush is described as being small to get in between your teeth better than the standard brush head</li>
            <li>I love the smaller head as I have a small mouth.</li>
            <li>the smaller heads are better for getting into the small spaces in my mouth.</li>
            <li>I have a small mouth and they work much better than the regular size.</li>
            <li>My mouth is so small the standards don&#x27;t fit.    </li>
            <li>The oscillation of the brush head is a strange sensation on your teeth and gums, but once you get used to it the system works very well.</li>
            <li>These brushes are exactly what I wanted and expected.</li>
            <li>Glad to find Phillips compact brush heads on Amazon because they are hard to find locally.  </li>
            <li>They fit very well around and behind my teeth.     </li>
            <li>What sucks is that this smaller toothbrush requires more work on my part.  </li>
            <li>(Amazon had the cheapest prices I could find anywhere for these replacement heads) and the small head size is great for reaching the backs of my molars, which was hard to do with the bigger brush head.  </li>
            <li>the brush is smaller than my original one, which take me a little time to adjust.</li>
            <li>I tried to find the right heads for my toothbrush - a Philips Sonic care that I have had for 2 years and that desperately needs more heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a small adult mouth, so get the best cleaning from the compact brush, Initially, there were difficult to find locally.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t clean the back teeth with the standard head because there isn&#x27;t enough room in my mouth to get the standard head around the back side of the back teeth.</li>
            <li>Tooth brusheads arrived when expected and were very well packed.</li>
            <li>These brush heads get all the way to the back and right down to the roots.  </li>
            <li>Because of my not good care, it stopped recharging on the 10 month of usage but sonic customer service quickly send me new charger.</li>
            <li>This uneven one was more affordable, but will try the round next time.</li>
            <li>The compact brush heads do a better job of getting behind my back teeth than the standard heads do.  </li>
            <li>, I was very uncomfortable using them, and I didn&#x27;t feel they were doing a good job...</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s recommended to change it every 3 months, but you really don&#x27;t have a choice because they do visibly wear down after that.</li>
            <li>Think about how small most dental tools are, like that little polisher they use.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, despite ordering on Black Friday.  </li>
            <li>Makes it easy to get behind the front teeth, and in all the nooks and crannys that a full-size brush will miss.</li>
            <li>The system takes a little getting used to, but works very well.</li>

            <li> We are very pleased with the product and the delivery.</li>
            <li> So happy to be able to buy on line.  </li>
            <li> Sonicare toothbrushes are the best, and these compact brush heads are just right for the Philips Sonicare ProResults FlexCare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> My wife prefers the compact style brush head, we have used Philips Sonicare for over an year with great satisfaction and Amazon always offers the best price around.</li>
            <li> Love the size of this brush!  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted, in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> and I was glad to make my decision to switch to Philips Sonicare!</li>
            <li> I love them!</li>
            <li> More affordable then the sonicare website!</li>
            <li> Love these!  </li>
            <li> These are much better!</li>
            <li> This company offers very good after service and great products for customer.</li>
            <li> The brush they fit on is great and has made me one of the star patients of my dentist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li> Best price I&#x27;ve found also and delivered fast.</li>
            <li> Nice.</li>
            <li> Basically, I think compact is a good choice, which is able to accomplish every \\&quot;task\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m talking perfect checkups and not too much plaque to remove.  </li>
            <li> Me and my family really liked this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Nice product, timely delivered.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome toothbrush that came highly recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li> I Love my Sonicare and am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I can say is that this toothbrush is awesome and the heads are great, as well -- easy to put on and take off (for regular cleaning) and long-lasting.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Seller has the best price so far.</li>
            <li> Best for sensitive gums and teeth.</li>
            <li> so it is so easy to change your toothbrush every 3 months!</li>
            <li> Sonicare is a great product and combined with Amazon&#x27;s pricing and quick shipment really makes for a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Consistently satisfied by this product.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I love that I was able to get them here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I am glad I kept looking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> I love this one better because it has smaller brush heads for my teeth to focus on cleaning :D</li>
            <li> Love the compact size.</li>
            <li> I love this brush system, tho not</li>
            <li> Nothing can be more convenient than receiving the number of brush heads you need at your door step throughout the year.  </li>
            <li> We have noticed better reports each time we go in for cleaning.</li>
            <li> I love these compact brush heads SO much better than the regular-sized ones for my electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Love being able to order</li>
            <li> I wish there was better clarification between types/sizes.  </li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The longevity of the handle and bristles keeps getting better and better.</li>
            <li> Trips to the dentist are a breeze (after many cavities).  </li>
            <li> So glad you have this size</li>
            <li> You have to replace the heads to get the most out of this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My favorite feature of the heads is the wear stripe which indicates the need to change; it is genius, with nothing to track unlike the sticker system which was a pain to manage.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are super clean and look great.</li>
            <li> Cheaper is not always better.</li>
            <li> Glad I can get it on line.</li>
            <li> These are the standard replacement heads for the Philips Sonicare at the best price I&#x27;ve seen!</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> so I was pleased to see them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Our kids use the Sonicare, too, and just love them.</li>
            <li> Love using my Phillips Sonicare with these brushes.  </li>
            <li> I do not have much more to say about it than that.</li>
            <li> I love this product mostly because Amazon has it</li>
            <li> worked well and better than buying in the store.</li>
            <li> I purchased these through Amazon, and I am not convinced these are authentic Phillips Sonicare brush heads.</li>
            <li> However, I can not be satisfied with this item.</li>
            <li> This was the most convenient and cheapest method of purchase.</li>
            <li> I really love my Sonicare&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> It satisfied my need.</li>
            <li> They are pricier but are authentic Sonicare.</li>
            <li> It gets into the nooks &amp; crannys better.</li>
            <li> the price at $30 is pretty high for 3 tooth brushes, but they work good , and my teeth and gums are happy.</li>
            <li> And, with Prime Membership (which I love, love, love), the two-day shipping is free.</li>
            <li> The compact fit smaller mouths best.</li>
            <li> In any case, these are much better and seem to clean better than the full-sized heads.</li>
            <li> Love the free shipping.</li>
            <li> It is a good product despite the product is very pricy.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and good packaging.</li>
            <li> I love the smaller size, they clean so good!</li>
            <li> My favorite size to get it  and get things clean.</li>
            <li> The brushes are well designed and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest a softer plastic with easy access to the brushes.</li>
            <li> Oral hygiene is easy as pie with the toothbrush and brush heads.  </li>
            <li> Not always easy to find the COMPACT type</li>
            <li> Very quick service.  </li>
            <li> The product arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Much better for getting to all the angles needed to thoroughly clean your teeth.  </li>
            <li> I have had this for over 2 years already and its still going strong.</li>
            <li> I get much better results with the compact brush than with the full size brush head.</li>
            <li> These work much better for me than the full sized replacements.</li>
            <li> Expensive but do a great job and get to all the nooks and crannies in my mouth for excellent cleaning and great overall oral health.</li>
            <li> The others were fine.  </li>
            <li> Great tooth brush system, and these heads are good at getting into the small crevices.</li>
            <li> but they work fine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what to say except that they work just fine.</li>
            <li> I had these items on auto-ship, which was super convenient because this is one of those items you&#x27;re going to be buying over and over again for many years.  </li>
            <li> These little brush heads are just perfect for me.  </li>
            <li> were so huge</li>
            <li> so they fit great in my smaller mouth.</li>
            <li> The compact brush does a great job and makes a big difference.</li>
            <li> These fit my Flexcare+.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have insurance so oral hygiene is important to prevent cavities and etc.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are fantastic.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this</li>
            <li> Having a 3pk makes always having a brush head available easier.    </li>
            <li> The ones I bought were cheap because I bought them when they were on sale.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find the smaller sized toothbrush head on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Fabulous toothbrush heads....used them for years.  </li>
            <li> This is our 2nd, great product.</li>
            <li> i have a medium-sized mouth (according to those dental trays), and this is great to go around on the tongue-side of the arch and back to the molars.</li>
            <li> and I was hopeful what I ordered would fit my toothbrush</li>
            <li> Great for people who feel like not enough room for brush.</li>
            <li> Good replacement for my old Sonicare.</li>
            <li> fast shipping, fair price, easy transaction, my thanks!</li>
            <li> These won&#x27;t fit my toothbrush, despite my efforts to try to make sure I got the right heads.</li>
            <li> I purchased these to replace my old worn out brush head and they are as good as the original one that came with Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> , after months of using a regular tooth brush because we were recovering from a flood, I once again experienced the smoothly clean teeth.</li>
            <li> These toothbrush heads are not cheap generally, which is a pain because the Sonicare toothbrush is just brilliant at keeping the dentist happy.  </li>
            <li> They just don&#x27;t fit as snug as the original brushes that came with the toothbrush</li>
            <li> Absolutely everything was great about my order--compact size fits better in most mouths, free shipping from Amazon, a discount for subscribing to get new brush heads every 6 months, and of course, a high quality product.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t own the Phillips Sonicare system, I highly recommend it, then you can buy the brush head replacements</li>
            <li> I like the compact heads the best as I have a small mouth</li>
            <li> I do not see any significant difference between them, except for the size.   </li>
            <li> Save yourself the headache and just buy the original heads.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li> This size brush is perfect for people with a small mouth and enables you to thoroughly reach all parts of your mouth and teeth .Most</li>
            <li> I also like that this is the original Sonicare toothbrush head.</li>
            <li> a worn-out brush&lt;br /&gt;To keep my molars clean</li>
            <li> I can clean areas that the full size seem to miss.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These compact heads fit my mouth better and seem to do a better job of cleaning the gum line than the standard size heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They fit better than the big ones and you do a better job at reaching all your teeth when brushing.</li>
            <li> I like the smaller brush heads because they can reach my molars better and generally fit better in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I get good results I have used the various modes</li>
            <li> Last about 3 months soare a good buy.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try the difference between the compact head and the full head.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get 3 months out of one and when I switch to a new one it is very easy to tell the difference.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 years and have never felt my tooth so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Sonicares for years now, in my opinion they are the best toothbrush out there and these, obviously, are an essential purchase.</li>
            <li> With the smaller head brush I&#x27;m able get into the areas where my dental hygienist spends more time on my cleaning.s</li>
            <li> This size, however, is super because it gets in and around my teefers like a pig finding truffles</li>
            <li> On Amazon, they are reasonably priced and easy to order.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more!</li>
            <li> I often check out the prices at otter stores to find the best deal and so far Amazon has it for less.</li>
            <li> sure makes it easy as it comes on a regular basis that you choose.</li>
            <li> I also have a strong gag reflex and find the the larger a toothbrush head is, the more I have issues with that.  </li>
            <li> You can also change these preferences as well.&lt;br /&gt;These in my opinion are great little toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> so afterwards I&#x27;m fresh, clean and smiling pretty.</li>
            <li> The regular brush heads are too large and do not do as good a job as the compact one does.</li>
            <li> I feel certain that when I go back for my six month exam I will get a good report.</li>
            <li> These compact brush heads are good to clean individual teeth, but I prefer to have the bigger brush heads to clean my whole mouth including all the teeth better than with compact brush heads.</li>
            <li> Amazon wins again.</li>
            <li> These brush heads do the job and are well worth it.</li>
            <li> and they are well worth it.</li>
            <li> and often then it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I love these because they are compact and fit in smaller mouths.</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t use this ourselves, but our 1.5 year old seems to love to brush her teeth with this</li>
            <li> It cleans even better than my old unit.</li>
            <li> I like the these or the larger brushes better because they, and the Sonicare itself of course, both leave my teeth squeaky clean</li>
            <li> To my surprise, my dentist told me that my teeth and gum were good after I switched my other electric tooth brush to Philips Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li> He was so right.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> The compact brush head is just right.</li>
            <li> Really gets around teeth to clean like a trip to the Dentist.  </li>
            <li> The compact heads are pretty durable and really nice for cleaning low clearance areas.</li>
            <li> We really like these compact brush heads as they make it easier to keep our teeth clean</li>
            <li> Sent them back and went to Costco-fit perfectly and less $$</li>
            <li> My son and I have small mouths and these work great.</li>
            <li> Works great and gets into small areas.</li>
            <li> If your mouth is small, these compact brush heads are great.</li>
            <li> The smaller brush heads CLEAN TEETH  better than the large heads.</li>
            <li> you ask me, the brush is perfect, not too hard, not too soft, brushes well between the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The 3 head pack is very reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> This is a luxury item that will be among the first</li>
            <li> That was the first time A Dentist ever told me that</li>
            <li> exactly where I want them to be.  </li>
            <li> my first brush lasted 2 days.    </li>
            <li> Just what they had said in the product description, works exactly what they said.</li>
            <li> and I can reach around so much better with these tiny brushes!</li>
            <li> Cleans teeth and reaches deeper areas better with the smaller brush heads.</li>
            <li> Compact design works better for me than the regular head.</li>
            <li> I&amp;#34;ve found that the smaller toothbrushes work better for me.</li>
            <li> I thought I wouldn&#x27;t like this when it arrived because the heads are smaller, but it turns out this is a better product.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m satisfied since I knew I would eventually need the ProResults brush heads too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just to note, these brush heads will NOT last more than two months if you brush longer than 5 minutes every day.</li>
            <li> I reluctantly bought more ProResults brush heads at Costco last month.  </li>
            <li> I found that the Costco brushheads are much higher quality.  </li>
            <li> I like these better than the DiamondClean Standard replacement brush heads they sell at Costco because the price is cheaper</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare toothbrush and change my brushes regularly!  </li>
            <li> Thanks for carrying this item!</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> Like compact heads much better than larger heads.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money to buy the real thing, not a knock-off</li>
            <li> I like the new better than the old (newer model toothbrush unit)..   </li>
            <li> I must not order the right stuff very often because I didn&#x27;t know about subscription service (which I signed up for this time).  </li>
            <li> Wow exactly what I needed to get in and around those wisdom teeth, and to clean along gum line for all my gold caps.</li>
            <li> The brush is smaller to reach around in smaller mouth&#x27;s, and can get into the back spaces easier.....very nice!!</li>
            <li> They allow me to reach in the back areas of my teeth much more easily so that I can get my pearly whites truly pearly white.  </li>
            <li> I prefer these more than those and will only use these from now on since they get deeper in to the back teeth easy.  </li>
            <li> My dentist tells me that you can get better cleaning from a manual toothbrush and the key is really in the technique.</li>
            <li> I even took it on a two-month cruise and vacation with me, because the results for my gums (affirmed by my dentist) were so positive.</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare, and try to buy multiple brushes (to save money) since my dentsist really insists I keep the brushes fresh and new.</li>
            <li> The smaller brush is able to reach all the way to the back teeth comfortably.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that the replacement heads are expensive, but the rest of the unit is well-made, and the ultraviolet sterilization light continues to function perfectly.</li>
            <li> would like - somewhere around a month and a half or two before the blue indicator color starts disappearing and the clean isn&#x27;t as good -</li>
            <li> really can&#x27;t think but that the manufacturer, Phillips, who makes the sonicare rig, makes a pretty penny on the follow up needs of their customers.</li>
            <li> Far superior to any other on the market.</li>
            <li> I bought these based on the more recent reviews thinking I was safe and that the other people who said these were knock offs were just out of their minds</li>
            <li> brushes are very good, however because of the fast brushing, and when using it together with the UV-bacteria killing bulb, the blue lines on the brush fade quite fast (blue hairs that become white are an indicator of changing the brush).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What I love about the compact version, is that I can get into places that I would normally gag on with the standard tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> The compact brush does the back of the front teeth easily.</li>
            <li> The brush head easily pulls apart when you change heads (which we do do as me and my wife use the same charger).</li>
            <li> The logo rubbed off very quickly and the current head i am using is already showing the color for replacement.</li>
            <li> I have tried both the regular and compact sizes, but these win hands down.</li>
            <li> They fit the base perfectly and are exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Fine enough.</li>
            <li> For those of us with smaller mouths, the compact head brush makes a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> However, these brushes should cost 1/2 as much.</li>
            <li> Finding them on Amazon for a really competitive price was a real bonus.  </li>
            <li> but you can choose where you buy them and for how much.</li>
            <li> The smaller Compact brush is comfortable and easier to use.</li>
            <li> When it cam time fro replacements, I ordered these and am much happier with the results.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Philips, for making these.</li>
            <li> purchase arrived sooner than I expected which, of course, pleased me immensley.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend these brush heads!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a cavity thanks to Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Also not so much scraping on my teeth to get the plaque off when I have my teeth cleaned every six months.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, and the product was as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Amazon scores again with another product priced MUCH lower than anywhere else.  </li>
            <li> I really like the size of these brushes.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> The package came with three toothbrush heads for a very reasonible price.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I tried gluing it on, but then it won&#x27;t fit the charger properly.</li>
            <li> MUCH easier to brush without roughing-up my gums.</li>
            <li> The product cleans very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It really helps me to avoid</li>
            <li> What can I really say about these....</li>
            <li> They really reach and get to places</li>
            <li> I find these really helpful for this.</li>
            <li> I really like my phillips sonicare</li>
            <li> purchased these last year and struggled to get the head to fit the brush, I should of guessed at that point that they were not the real-deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These teeth bush spares work very well on my Phillips sonic tooth brush device.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really decide weather</li>
            <li> I find it much, much easier to clean in the back and on the insides</li>
            <li> At first I thought I had erred &amp; ordered the incorrect brushhead; but after comparing them to my old one I found that they were knock offs!</li>
            <li> These are the original Sonicare heads, don&#x27;t even bother with the generic ones.</li>
            <li> However, these ones are smaller than what were on the toothbrush originally.</li>
            <li> These are the original type of toothbrushes that come with the Sonicare (same size, and brushtype).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I normally replace every 3 months!</li>
            <li> After reading some other folks reviews I ordered the Philips brand and was really glad I did.</li>
            <li> do as much shopping as possible on Amazon because of the competitive prices and this is true of these brush heads.  </li>
            <li> We tried the normal length and the compact length replacements, and the whole family agrees that the compact brushes are easier to manipulate inside the mouth, and allow for better coverage especially towards the back.</li>
            <li> Our dental hygienist recommended that we use the compact brush heads on our Sonicare FlexCare Toothbrush because she feels that the smaller head can reach more places (that is certainly personal choice</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare toothbrush and there are several different brush heads for it.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Sonicare for years and these smaller heads do a better job of cleaning my teeth than the larger ones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to reach further and get into the smaller crevices.</li>
            <li> The compact size is perfect for people like me--i am a small person with a small mouth.</li>
            <li> As we get older, it&#x27;s easier for gums to pull away from the teeth, causing problems.</li>
            <li> These compact brush heads were purchased for my Sonicare Pro because I have a small dental arch and so brushing is more comfortable with the smaller size heads.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not adequately clear from the product page is that the products we received are not Philips original.</li>
            <li> This smaller head is great for getting the back of my molars and for angling down to get my lower bicuspids without splashing toothpaste everywhere.</li>
            <li> The wife and I love the compact brush heads to get in the tight spots.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I recommend them highly.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the most steady hand, I have a little bit of a problem balancing the toothpaste on the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> But it does fit well in the mouth to clean those hard to get to spaces.</li>
            <li> and I am Old!!</li>
            <li> Love these little brush heads.  </li>
            <li> Very dissatisfied do not clean like original diamond brushes, tried to return, not allowed;( will not purchase again, found original head at same price</li>
            <li> Expensive, but very effective in cleaning.</li>
            <li> These are the tiny ones - good for people with small mouths and jaws - or when you want to concetrate action onto each tooth by-itself.</li>
            <li> I switch on a new one every 3 months.  </li>
            <li> This is a new and improved version of the Sonic Care way of keeping your teeth in those gums that might be fading in terms of their youth and vigor.</li>
            <li> but this was a new vendor</li>
            <li> and I really can&#x27;t live without these</li>
            <li> I stocked up on brush heads back in January, and just got around to using one of these brush heads only to find out it didn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> It really reaches everywhere, front, back and around, and is much easier to manuever.</li>
            <li> I just find it confusing to find the right size brush to fit my toothbrush......</li>
            <li> Love my sonicare and have to have a compact head because I have a small mouth.  </li>
            <li> My dentist noticed the difference after I started using this one and my teeth in general feel much cleaner post-brushing.</li>
            <li> I love the Compact size, small and efficient.</li>
            <li> These are noticeably better than the no-name product, although more expensive!</li>
            <li> Compact heads are less available in stores, if they stock them at all.</li>
            <li> product was good, i bought two versions the small brush head and the big brush head, the small head works better for the way i have some extra periodontal wires in my mouth</li>
            <li> As long as I can get a better cleaning, I can deal with other nuances.  </li>
            <li> They do wear pretty quickly and it&#x27;s hard to tell if they are worn until you compare them with new heads.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To fit my little jaw&lt;</li>
            <li> I just felt that using the compact brush head took too long to clean my teeth as thoroughly as the standard brush head.</li>
            <li> Do not buy these unless you want a brush that&#x27;s half the size of the original equipment.</li>
            <li> Easy to order, no tax, no shipping, won&#x27;t buy it any other way in the future</li>
            <li> The compact head brushes are my favorite, but often hard to find at the retail drug stores near me.  </li>
            <li> However, why does Philips find it necessary to charge so much for these pint size toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Sonicare and the ProResults Compact Brush Heads complete the work of my dentist.</li>
            <li> The compact head fits in the mouth easier and does a much better job of cleaning the teeth - at least in my opinion.</li>
            <li> None of the local stores carry the compact size, only the regular heads are available.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast and there is an option to get them on a regular automatic basis.</li>
            <li> if you have the flexcare, you don&#x27;t really have a choice but to purchase this one or the standard.</li>
            <li> of all the sizes of toothbrushes sonicare offers (including those for children)...</li>
            <li> Replacement of heads are necessary and this is the place to get them much cheaper than any place else I have found them.</li>
            <li> Recomended by my dentist but not sold at stores I frequent.  </li>
            <li> The bristles were soft after a month.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is expensive but good deal if you can keep your teeth.</li>
            <li> I like putting a new brush head on my toothbrush because you really get such a smooth, slick feeling.</li>
            <li> and they sent my order right out and charged me the expected amount - professionally done.  </li>
            <li> other than that, they fit the toothbrush and work like a regular brush should.</li>
            <li> I was unable to find a better price anywhere and the shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> I love this smaller brush head since my mouth is small.  </li>
            <li> I bought these compact brush heads to go with my recently newer model Sonicare which I got to replace an older one.</li>
            <li> The compact brush is described as being small to get in between your teeth better than the standard brush head</li>
            <li> I love the smaller head as I have a small mouth.</li>
            <li> the smaller heads are better for getting into the small spaces in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth and they work much better than the regular size.</li>
            <li> My mouth is so small the standards don&#x27;t fit.    </li>
            <li> The oscillation of the brush head is a strange sensation on your teeth and gums, but once you get used to it the system works very well.</li>
            <li> These brushes are exactly what I wanted and expected.</li>
            <li> Glad to find Phillips compact brush heads on Amazon because they are hard to find locally.  </li>
            <li> They fit very well around and behind my teeth.     </li>
            <li> What sucks is that this smaller toothbrush requires more work on my part.  </li>
            <li> (Amazon had the cheapest prices I could find anywhere for these replacement heads) and the small head size is great for reaching the backs of my molars, which was hard to do with the bigger brush head.  </li>
            <li> the brush is smaller than my original one, which take me a little time to adjust.</li>
            <li> I tried to find the right heads for my toothbrush - a Philips Sonic care that I have had for 2 years and that desperately needs more heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a small adult mouth, so get the best cleaning from the compact brush, Initially, there were difficult to find locally.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t clean the back teeth with the standard head because there isn&#x27;t enough room in my mouth to get the standard head around the back side of the back teeth.</li>
            <li> Tooth brusheads arrived when expected and were very well packed.</li>
            <li> These brush heads get all the way to the back and right down to the roots.  </li>
            <li> Because of my not good care, it stopped recharging on the 10 month of usage but sonic customer service quickly send me new charger.</li>
            <li> This uneven one was more affordable, but will try the round next time.</li>
            <li> The compact brush heads do a better job of getting behind my back teeth than the standard heads do.  </li>
            <li> , I was very uncomfortable using them, and I didn&#x27;t feel they were doing a good job...</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s recommended to change it every 3 months, but you really don&#x27;t have a choice because they do visibly wear down after that.</li>
            <li> Think about how small most dental tools are, like that little polisher they use.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, despite ordering on Black Friday.  </li>
            <li> Makes it easy to get behind the front teeth, and in all the nooks and crannys that a full-size brush will miss.</li>
            <li> The system takes a little getting used to, but works very well.</li>
            <li> Love the smaller/compact heads, they make it easier on my childs small mouth as well as easier for me to reach the hard to reach teeth in the back of my mouth.</li>
            <li> These little compact brush heads fit in my small mouth without a problem.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to the clean feel of my mouth.</li>
            <li> while you still have all the packaging and paperwork, test each of them on your handle for a few minutes to see if any come loose and fall off, which a certain percentage do.</li>
            <li> My only gripe is that they don&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I mention this is that these heads are expensive and need to be replaced pretty frequently so if there are budgetary concerns I would definitely recommend sticking with a regular toothbrush.    </li>
            <li> These last a long time</li>
            <li> Will try a smaller, round, soft bristle head next time.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as they think it should.  </li>
            <li> These (and all brush heads for this toothbrush) don&#x27;t last as long as</li>
            <li> New Sonicare came with long elongated heads, rather difficult in certain portions of the mouth to get a proper brushing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably a little too early to tell at this point.  </li>
            <li> i am just a little surprised they say they need to be replaced already.</li>
            <li> really, these should be less than half the cost that they are.</li>
            <li> They make it much easier to reach the tough places, like the upper and lower back teeth.</li>
            <li> However, the standard 3-pack size is less expensive and covers more surface, I&#x27;ll go back to the other</li>
            <li> It took me a long time to find the Philips Sonicare HX6023</li>
            <li> They work just as I expected them too for people with smaller mouths.</li>
            <li> thought it rather strange</li>
            <li> I was long overdue to replace my toothbrush heads but never again.</li>
            <li> So I ordered a new unit it came with the small extended heads.</li>
            <li> but I actually needed the other type of brush head (whatever it is called).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now tried several generics to save money, and ended up with heads that were so loose they vibrated off the toothbrush or so sharp they cut my gums.</li>
            <li> I find it very difficult to use the brush on my front teeth without getting more than just the brush on my teeth</li>
            <li> My teeth are cleaner and I actually brush longer than with my previous electric tooth brush.</li>
            <li> My husband went from 60% gum loss to less than 10% in only 6 months!  </li>
            <li> Only 1 of them work properly like usual.</li>
            <li> The brushes on these are a little smaller than what I imagined</li>
            <li> It is hard enouth to scrub teeth, but soft for gums to keep them not irritated.</li>
            <li> Been using a Sonicare for several years due to slight periodontal disease and it has done the job well.  </li>
            <li> the standard brush just did not fit the shape of my jaw.</li>
            <li> I felt I was missing areas that needed to be brushed.</li>
            <li> Expensive but well worth it.</li>
            <li> Because my jaw is narrow, the regular sized heads don&#x27;t brush well on the inside of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I spent 20 min.</li>
            <li> Bristles are uneven and bristle head was too big.  </li>
            <li> I prefer them because my dentist was always telling me that I was destroying my gums with the larger heads.  </li>
            <li> Not much to say about the heads without mentioning that the Sonicare is like heaven for your mouth.  </li>
            <li> These must be knock offs because they did not fit the wand properly.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say.</li>
            <li> The brush heads last quite a few months.</li>
            <li> only do they not fit the holder &amp; need to be finessed onto the brush</li>
            <li> Just as expected.</li>
            <li> Although I am an adult, I have a very small mouth.</li>
            <li> Less wasted bristles, my mouth feels cleaner, and I&#x27;m using the entire brush rather than parts of it.</li>
            <li> I know I am supposed to brush for a long time but my arms get very tired so this really helps.</li>
            <li> Although I had thought it was silly to use an electric toothbrush, my teeth are so much cleaner!  </li>
            <li> These are the standard compact brush heads packaged in the retail package---perfect for small mouths and teeth.</li>
            <li> and I usually buy the standard ones and not the compact ones.</li>
            <li> I have a small oral cavity and the bigger brush that came with my Sonicare purchase</li>
            <li> I also prefer the small brush head shape because it fits easily in all the hard to reach areas like behind the bottom front teeth and around that corner.</li>
            <li> With the compact head I can reach way back into the back molars and it makes for brushing behind the teeth a lot easier.</li>
            <li> Terrible, to small and soft to be effective</li>
            <li> Paid less here than any other store I checked.</li>
            <li> The standard size brush heads are hard on my gums, and the dental hygienist recommended this size.</li>
            <li> Just like printer ink cartridges, it does not cost that much to make but they sell it way too expensive.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed and it is well worth the expense of the initial purchase.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m not thrilled with this product for the cost.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However at the rate that brushes need to be replaced, and considering their size, they should sell them for half the price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason I am only giving a 2 review is the vibrations and the fact that I have to use a regular toothbrush to brush my front couple of teeth without feeling the uncomfortable vibrations.</li>
            <li> They were $24.99 on Amazon and they arrived quickly, no tax or shipping.</li>
            <li> The Amazon price is a little less than Walmart.  </li>
            <li> Previously used an Oral B with round heads.</li>
            <li> Odd contour and bristles were too hard and rough.  </li>
            <li> I have a very hard time finding these compact heads in any local stores.  </li>
            <li> I have a narrow bit.  </li>
            <li> It does NOT fit the Sonicare Elite version.  </li>
            <li> The small size does mean it takes a bit longer to brush, but that&#x27;s a minor issue.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t give stars for something I can&#x27;t use, and I feel it is unnecessarily complicated to try to find the right heads - not to mention expensive to make a mistake.</li>
            <li> Works out well if you have a small mouth.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say my my  mouth is small but</li>
            <li> these are small and I can \\&quot;aim\\&quot; them</li>
            <li> (they recommend every three months, but you can usually get 4 months out of it).</li>
            <li> My mouth is so small</li>
            <li> but I feel like it is too small for me.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize these were quite a small as they are.  </li>
            <li> I like the small size and the indicator of usage</li>
            <li> if you have a small mouth and a sonic toothbrush, this is for you.</li>
            <li> I like the small size too.</li>
            <li> I prefer the compact brush heads for my Sonicare since I have a small mouth.  </li>
            <li> mouth must be too small</li>
            <li> Well, no, not really, it made things very difficult and it didn&#x27;t quite reach around back molars.  </li>
            <li> trying to open the hard, sharp plastic they were packed in without cutting my hands.  </li>
            <li> The compact brush head does allow for easier access for those hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> They are hard to find in retail stores, Amazon always delivers.</li>
            <li> These were hard to find.</li>
            <li> The package is also hard to get into.</li>
            <li> where it&#x27;s hard to reach&lt;</li>
            <li> They can be hard to find in stores, though.  </li>
            <li> Not what I expected for anything this expensive.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t purchase these,  at least from Amazon fulfillment</li>
            <li> I have been using them for at least 2 yrs and intend to continue doing so.</li>
            <li> In stores they sell for at least $31.</li>
            <li> I have a very small mouth and gag reflex.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they barely last three months, which makes them a bit expensive.  </li>
            <li> no gas to the store and less expensive.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to find anywhere else!</li>
            <li> These are difficult to find in retail stores, which usually just sell the standard-size brush heads.</li>
            <li> The bristles on these brush heads are very hard.</li>
            <li> Never understood why these brush heads are quite expensive but at least it was cheaper to buy it from Amazon than at a drugstore.</li>
            <li> When they&#x27;re not available, I get frustrated.</li>
            <li> Purchased wrong product</li>
            <li> Watch out for questionable quality and hope you don&#x27;t have to deal with Sonicare&#x27;s tentative customer service.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems I failed.</li>
            <li> These are expensive but we use the Amazon subscribe and save service.  </li>
            <li> Difficult to find.  </li>
            <li> Boy, were we wrong.  </li>
            <li> I needed some brush heads but these brush heads are expensive to be changing out every 3 months.</li>
            <li> Without the replacement heads, one&#x27;s Sonicare is useless; the price has gone up over $5 for the compact 3-pack.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to find this product</li>
            <li> but man they are so expensive.</li>
            <li> Fake brand and mimic the Phillips brand.</li>
            <li> expensive, but they work well</li>
            <li> and I get vibrations that I find very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I want to exchange 2 of them, but I think that&#x27;s impossible..</li>
            <li> Guess it&#x27;s my bad.</li>
            <li> I was actually shocked.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed with these.</li>
            <li> Snaps onto the base with no problem.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because on the chart it says that it fits the diamondclean base.  </li>
            <li> The heads detach from the stem when taking them off of the base.</li>
            <li> These reviews can get annoying.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in these.  </li>
            <li> They make terrible noise and can not brush my teeth well.</li>
            <li> These heads are terrible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Consistently satisfied by this product. Works out well if you have a small mouth.</li>
            <li> Love my sonicare and have to have a compact head because I have a small mouth.  I can&#x27;t clean the back teeth with the standard head because there isn&#x27;t enough room in my mouth to get the standard head around the back side of the back teeth.</li>
            <li> I like the compact heads the best as I have a small mouth and it&#x27;s easier to get to those pesky back teeth. I&#x27;ve had Sonicares for years now, in my opinion they are the best toothbrush out there and these, obviously, are an essential purchase. Best price I&#x27;ve found also and delivered fast.</li>
            <li> I stocked up on brush heads back in January, and just got around to using one of these brush heads only to find out it didn&#x27;t fit. At first I thought I had erred &amp; ordered the incorrect brushhead; but after comparing them to my old one I found that they were knock offs! Who the heck knocks off toothbrush heads? Really? I bought these based on the more recent reviews thinking I was safe and that the other people who said these were knock offs were just out of their minds but now I wished I would&#x27;ve listened.</li>
            <li> the brush is smaller than my original one, which take me a little time to adjust. besides that, its a good product</li>
            <li> This is an awesome toothbrush that came highly recommended by my dentist. Great price and fast delivery. This is the best toothbrush I have ever used. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this smaller brush head since my mouth is small.  Really gets around teeth to clean like a trip to the Dentist.  My teeth are even whiter since I have been using the sonic toothbrush.  I am addicted to the clean feel of my mouth.</li>
            <li> My favorite size to get it  and get things clean. To back they are pricy</li>
            <li> What can I say. My son and I have small mouths and these work great. However, why does Philips find it necessary to charge so much for these pint size toothbrushes. Do I like Sonicare - yes, after months of using a regular tooth brush because we were recovering from a flood, I once again experienced the smoothly clean teeth. However, these brushes should cost 1/2 as much. This is a luxury item at this price. After all these years, hasn&#x27;t Phillips made enough off us? This is a luxury item that will be among the first I leave if money gets any tighter.</li>
            <li> Although I am an adult, I have a very small mouth. The regular brush heads are too large and do not do as good a job as the compact one does. Sonicare and the ProResults Compact Brush Heads complete the work of my dentist.</li>
            <li> My fiance and I got a Sonicare for Easter last year from my mother. It had enough of the compact heads to last me a year. Then I went to the stores around town and NONE of them had any. They had the Standard like my fiance uses but none of the compact. My mouth is so small the standards don&#x27;t fit.    I love that I was able to get them here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It took me a long time to find the Philips Sonicare HX6023 ProResults Compact Brush Heads, 3pk.  I am glad I kept looking. I won&#x27;t say my my  mouth is small but the standard brush just did not fit the shape of my jaw. I felt I was missing areas that needed to be brushed. My Dentist even commented, the last time I saw him, that my gums looked inflamed.That was the first time A Dentist ever told me that and I am Old!! The compact brush does a great job and makes a big difference. I feel certain that when I go back for my six month exam I will get a good report.</li>
            <li> These toothbrush heads are not cheap generally, which is a pain because the Sonicare toothbrush is just brilliant at keeping the dentist happy.  Finding them on Amazon for a really competitive price was a real bonus.  Good delivery too.</li>
            <li> The compact head fits in the mouth easier and does a much better job of cleaning the teeth - at least in my opinion. I have tried both the regular and compact sizes, but these win hands down. None of the local stores carry the compact size, only the regular heads are available. Amazon wins again.</li>
            <li> Terrible, to small and soft to be effective</li>
            <li> My wife uses the sonicare at our dentist&#x27;s recommendation.  At retail the brush heads are not only more expensive but the price has risen dramatically in the last year.  Until I found them here on-line, she was going to go back to a regular toothbrush.  The brush heads last longer than the 3 months stated by Philips.</li>
            <li> We are very pleased with the Brushheads..Can&#x27;t find them at any store in Redding,Ca.so I found them on line..They got here in just a couple of days...Will be ordering them again soon...Rowdy</li>
            <li> It is a good product despite the product is very pricy. I woudld give five stars rating if itn&#x27;t so pricy.  It shouldn&#x27;t cost 3x as much as a regular brush.  Just like printer ink cartridges, it does not cost that much to make but they sell it way too expensive.  Seller delivered as promised in good condition when received.  This Seller has the best price so far.</li>
            <li> I bought these compact brush heads to go with my recently newer model Sonicare which I got to replace an older one. The Sonicare came with a regular sized brush head. I&#x27;ve always preferred the compact brush heads so I got this although I&#x27;m currently alternating with the regular brush. Never understood why these brush heads are quite expensive but at least it was cheaper to buy it from Amazon than at a drugstore.</li>
            <li> The brush heads on the Sonicare brush I just bought were so huge, I was very uncomfortable using them, and I didn&#x27;t feel they were doing a good job... these are small and I can \\&quot;aim\\&quot; them exactly where I want them to be.  I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> I agree with the reviewer who said \\&quot;What can you say about a toothbrush head?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I can say is that this toothbrush is awesome and the heads are great, as well -- easy to put on and take off (for regular cleaning) and long-lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These compact heads fit my mouth better and seem to do a better job of cleaning the gum line than the standard size heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do as much shopping as possible on Amazon because of the competitive prices and this is true of these brush heads.  I couldnt find them anywhere else, either on the internet or in brick-and-mortar stores, for this good a price.  And, with Prime Membership (which I love, love, love), the two-day shipping is free.</li>
            <li> I purchased the compact version of this product as a replacement brush for my [[ASIN:B002CVTVVY Philips Sonicare FlexCare Plus HX6972/10, Rechargeable Toothbrush]] toothbrush.  I don&#x27;t have the most steady hand, I have a little bit of a problem balancing the toothpaste on the toothbrush. It makes me wonder if I&#x27;m using enough.  Maybe I am.  What I love about the compact version, is that I can get into places that I would normally gag on with the standard tooth brush.  What sucks is that this smaller toothbrush requires more work on my part.  All-in-all, this is just something I will have to get use to.  It&#x27;s no problem.  As long as I can get a better cleaning, I can deal with other nuances.  It&#x27;s probably a little too early to tell at this point.  Shipping was fast, despite ordering on Black Friday.  I was actually shocked.</li>
            <li> We tried the normal length and the compact length replacements, and the whole family agrees that the compact brushes are easier to manipulate inside the mouth, and allow for better coverage especially towards the back. Children find the compact ones easier as well. This will be our regular subscription.</li>
            <li> The bristles on the brushes are not durable...my first brush lasted 2 days.    But it does fit well in the mouth to clean those hard to get to spaces.</li>
            <li> The compact brush head makes it easier to brush without hitting your teeth; great when you just start out using your Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I love this one better because it has smaller brush heads for my teeth to focus on cleaning :D Very effective and very comfortable!</li>
            <li> Nice brushes, my dentist has been happy.</li>
            <li> Love the compact size.Subscribe and save sure makes it easy as it comes on a regular basis that you choose. You can also change these preferences as well.&lt;br /&gt;These in my opinion are great little toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Just what they had said in the product description, works exactly what they said. I can recommend this to anyone that in need of this.</li>
            <li> Love the size of this brush!  Makes it easy to get behind the front teeth, and in all the nooks and crannys that a full-size brush will miss. The small size does mean it takes a bit longer to brush, but that&#x27;s a minor issue.  Wish it had the same feature as the Braun system where the bristles turn color when it wears out. The Sonicare set comes with a set of labels so you can mark them as to when it&#x27;s time to toss (they recommend every three months, but you can usually get 4 months out of it).</li>
            <li> The brush is smaller to reach around in smaller mouth&#x27;s, and can get into the back spaces easier.....very nice!!</li>
            <li> This is the best way to buy this size for a Sonicare electric toothbrush. Compact heads are less available in stores, if they stock them at all. Delivery was fast and there is an option to get them on a regular automatic basis.</li>
            <li> My mouth is so small and I can reach around so much better with these tiny brushes! Also, these are the cheapest online!</li>
            <li> It does a great job of cleaning your teeth.  I switch on a new one every 3 months.  Combined with flossing and mouthwash, this is a great addition to good dental health.</li>
            <li> The compact brush is described as being small to get in between your teeth better than the standard brush head but I feel like it is too small for me. If you have ever been told by a dentist that you have a big mouth (physically, not figuratively) you may feel the same. I just felt that using the compact brush head took too long to clean my teeth as thoroughly as the standard brush head.</li>
            <li> Purchased wrong product</li>
            <li> These little brush heads are just perfect for me.  They allow me to reach in the back areas of my teeth much more easily so that I can get my pearly whites truly pearly white.  Very good product.  I recommend them highly.</li>
            <li> Package arrived in good order and timely. These fit my Flexcare+. It&#x27;s the best toothbrush available. The compact brush head does allow for easier access for those hard to reach places. I will buy these again.</li>
            <li> Works well. Is just as advertised. Cleans teeth and reaches deeper areas better with the smaller brush heads. I don&#x27;t have insurance so oral hygiene is important to prevent cavities and etc.</li>
            <li> the greatest toothbrush I ever owned! My teeth are cleaner and I actually brush longer than with my previous electric tooth brush. My teeth feel cleaner and I was complimented by my dental hygenist on a cleaner mouth before she knew that I had switched to the Sonic. Replacement heads are pricey at 10.00 apiece, but should pay for themselves in the money I will save by having healthier teeth and gums!</li>
            <li> I save about ten dollars on this item ordering on line, versus going to a local store that has them in stock.</li>
            <li> if you have the flexcare, you don&#x27;t really have a choice but to purchase this one or the standard. and it&#x27;s recommended to change it every 3 months, but you really don&#x27;t have a choice because they do visibly wear down after that. so yo have no choice but to buy these replacement heads. but you can choose where you buy them and for how much. i was shopping around for replacement heads for awhile and amazon had the lowest price.</li>
            <li> I was unable to find a better price anywhere and the shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> This product is an advance over the earlier Sonicare model.  The smaller Compact brush is comfortable and easier to use.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are fantastic. The Amazon price is a little less than Walmart.  These last a long time and you will know when its time to change the heads when the blue bristles fade.</li>
            <li> Bought these refill brushes for my sonicare they were cheaper on Amazon than Target so hey! I often check out the prices at otter stores to find the best deal and so far Amazon has it for less. Nice.</li>
            <li> I love this brush system, tho not the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this as a subscription, and when I hit the back button to check something it defaulted to the compact size... no one in my house would use them, so I returned them and got back 9 or the $19 they cost me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to share this in case it will help someone avoid the same mistake.</li>
            <li> Expensive but well worth it. Compact design works better for me than the regular head. Would purchase again. Great value for the money.</li>
            <li> I&amp;#34;ve found that the smaller toothbrushes work better for me. They are hard to find in retail stores, Amazon always delivers.</li>
            <li> I ordered these replacement brush heads for my sonicare toothbrush.  One of the three brush heads would continuously fall off of my electric toothbrush after about 30 seconds of use.  The others were fine.  I contacted Sonicare about the issue they were hesitant about replacing my one defective brush head, asking me to return it to the store since it is not under warranty.  It had been months since I bought this pack because I replace my brush head once in three months, so returning it was not an option.  After giving me the runaround (saying they cannot help, then asking me for serial numbers, model numbers, etc) they finally agreed to send me a replacement.  Watch out for questionable quality and hope you don&#x27;t have to deal with Sonicare&#x27;s tentative customer service.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize these were quite a small as they are.  I wish I had got the regular size.  Guess it&#x27;s my bad.</li>
            <li> This is just what I was looking for, works great! Seller was Great!</li>
            <li> We order these brush heads through Subscribe &amp; Save.  Nothing can be more convenient than receiving the number of brush heads you need at your door step throughout the year.  In addition, no one can beat Amazon&#x27;s prices on these.      Our dental hygienist recommended that we use the compact brush heads on our Sonicare FlexCare Toothbrush because she feels that the smaller head can reach more places (that is certainly personal choice but we went with her recommendation).  These brush heads do the job and are well worth it.</li>
            <li> of all the sizes of toothbrushes sonicare offers (including those for children)...these are my favorites.  feels like they reach everywhere in my mouth.</li>
            <li> This is a new and improved version of the Sonic Care way of keeping your teeth in those gums that might be fading in terms of their youth and vigor. I enjoy this and I believe having these brushes to sanitize is terrific.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these compact brush heads instead of the regular ones that came with my Sonicare. I find it much, much easier to clean in the back and on the insides and they are well worth it. They do wear pretty quickly and it&#x27;s hard to tell if they are worn until you compare them with new heads. I don&#x27;t get 3 months out of one and when I switch to a new one it is very easy to tell the difference.    My dentist tells me that you can get better cleaning from a manual toothbrush and the key is really in the technique. But he does agree that if this is what it takes to motivate you to brush well and often then it&#x27;s worth it. The only reason I mention this is that these heads are expensive and need to be replaced pretty frequently so if there are budgetary concerns I would definitely recommend sticking with a regular toothbrush.    In any case, these are much better and seem to clean better than the full-sized heads.</li>
            <li> I purchased these to replace my old worn out brush head and they are as good as the original one that came with Sonicare.  Fast shipping and good packaging.</li>
            <li> We purchased the Sonic Care brush system at the advice of our dental hygienist.  It arrived in time and was in good shape, just as advertised. Packaging was good and I am quite happy with the purchase. The system takes a little getting used to, but works very well. The oscillation of the brush head is a strange sensation on your teeth and gums, but once you get used to it the system works very well. We have noticed better reports each time we go in for cleaning.</li>
            <li> While I purchased the body of the toothbrush at Costco, they no longer sell the compact brush heads.  Amazon came through with the product that I wanted.  Arrived as scheduled and as promised.</li>
            <li> I bought the compact brush heads, instead of the standard ones.   I do not see any significant difference between them, except for the size.   Basically, I think compact is a good choice, which is able to accomplish every \\&quot;task\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> while you still have all the packaging and paperwork, test each of them on your handle for a few minutes to see if any come loose and fall off, which a certain percentage do. Then, with all your info, including the model number and serial number (date code) from the bottom of the handle, contact Philips for replacements. They are already costly enough: you shouldn&#x27;t have to do what some purchasers here report, and just throw away the defective ones. Philips needs to know about these defects. They are not acceptable!</li>
            <li> These brush heads are great.  This is the only head I will buy, just like the ones they sold the toothbrush with.</li>
            <li> Previously used an Oral B with round heads. New Sonicare came with long elongated heads, rather difficult in certain portions of the mouth to get a proper brushing. When it cam time fro replacements, I ordered these and am much happier with the results.</li>
            <li> I love these compact brush heads SO much better than the regular-sized ones for my electric toothbrush.  Because my jaw is narrow, the regular sized heads don&#x27;t brush well on the inside of my teeth.  Thanks, Philips, for making these. When they&#x27;re not available, I get frustrated.</li>
            <li> Love being able to order</li>
            <li> Great tooth brush system, and these heads are good at getting into the small crevices. Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> The brushes are well designed and easy to use.  The package they come in is another story.  I spent 20 min. trying to open the hard, sharp plastic they were packed in without cutting my hands.  I would suggest a softer plastic with easy access to the brushes.</li>
            <li> I thought I wouldn&#x27;t like this when it arrived because the heads are smaller, but it turns out this is a better product. Less wasted bristles, my mouth feels cleaner, and I&#x27;m using the entire brush rather than parts of it. So while I ordered these in error, I do believe I shall keep ordering.</li>
            <li> These are the original Sonicare heads, don&#x27;t even bother with the generic ones. I&#x27;ve now tried several generics to save money, and ended up with heads that were so loose they vibrated off the toothbrush or so sharp they cut my gums. Save yourself the headache and just buy the original heads. I love these because they are compact and fit in smaller mouths.</li>
            <li> I take it that all brush heads are interchangeable. However, these ones are smaller than what were on the toothbrush originally. Don&#x27;t know if that changes the cleaning ability.</li>
            <li> I tried to find the right heads for my toothbrush - a Philips Sonic care that I have had for 2 years and that desperately needs more heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems I failed. These won&#x27;t fit my toothbrush, despite my efforts to try to make sure I got the right heads. Why are these so incompatible? Why are they so expensive?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t give stars for something I can&#x27;t use, and I feel it is unnecessarily complicated to try to find the right heads - not to mention expensive to make a mistake.</li>
            <li> I like the new better than the old (newer model toothbrush unit)..   I feel there is less mold buildup that plagued the older models.. I havent had the problems some people report (but I do not use the color rings that might be the cause?)..</li>
            <li> When I was looking at the replacement brush heads, I was confused about the various kinds available.  I ordered the ProResults pack but I actually needed the other type of brush head (whatever it is called).  I wish there was better clarification between types/sizes.  Overall I&#x27;m satisfied since I knew I would eventually need the ProResults brush heads too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My purchase arrived sooner than I expected which, of course, pleased me immensley.  The price was great too.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush. I know I am supposed to brush for a long time but my arms get very tired so this really helps. Amazon service is great. I set up autoship and it always got here on time.</li>
            <li> Easy to order, no tax, no shipping, won&#x27;t buy it any other way in the future</li>
            <li> Absolutely everything was great about my order--compact size fits better in most mouths, free shipping from Amazon, a discount for subscribing to get new brush heads every 6 months, and of course, a high quality product.  Highly recommend these brush heads!</li>
            <li> For those of us with smaller mouths, the compact head brush makes a huge difference.  It really reaches everywhere, front, back and around, and is much easier to manuever.</li>
            <li> Amazon is one of a few places that has the compact brush heads for our Sonicare toothbrushes and also at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> These heads are smaller than the ones that come with the originasl Sonicare.  I prefer these more than those and will only use these from now on since they get deeper in to the back teeth easy.  Great improvement!</li>
            <li> As is needed for the Sonicare toothbrush.  Ordered it online and received the product as advertised.  Exactly what I wanted, in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> product was good, i bought two versions the small brush head and the big brush head, the small head works better for the way i have some extra periodontal wires in my mouth</li>
            <li> I must not order the right stuff very often because I didn&#x27;t know about subscription service (which I signed up for this time).  Now I won&#x27;t have to remember to reorder - it will be here when I need it.  The product is what I always order but this was a new vendor and they sent my order right out and charged me the expected amount - professionally done.  I think the compact heads can reach into my jaw teeth easier so that&#x27;s why I get them instead of the full-head.</li>
            <li> The larger heads came with my Philips Sonicare Toothbrush, but, on the advice of my dentist, I&#x27;ve been ordering the compact heads whenever I need a replacement.  They make it much easier to reach the tough places, like the upper and lower back teeth.</li>
            <li> Replacement of heads are necessary and this is the place to get them much cheaper than any place else I have found them.</li>
            <li> This was as described and a great value. would buy again if and when possible. The smaller head makes it easier to move around and get to places the big one can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This is my third set of heads that I have bought for my current handle. I have been using Sonicare brushes for close to a decade now. The longevity of the handle and bristles keeps getting better and better. This set is no exception.  This smaller head is great for getting the back of my molars and for angling down to get my lower bicuspids without splashing toothpaste everywhere. It also allows me to get closer to the gum without irritation.  Just to note, these brush heads will NOT last more than two months if you brush longer than 5 minutes every day. I personally get about 6 weeks before the bristles start to fray and cleaning power becomes affected. Still, I would not trade these brushes for twelve regular tooth bushes. I&#x27;ve never had a cavity thanks to Sonicare. It&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I prefer the compact brush head for a couple of reasons. The smaller brush is able to reach all the way to the back teeth comfortably. The compact brush does the back of the front teeth easily. I get much better results with the compact brush than with the full size brush head.</li>
            <li> My Sonicare changed my dental life.  Although I had thought it was silly to use an electric toothbrush, my teeth are so much cleaner!  Trips to the dentist are a breeze (after many cavities).  These are expensive but we use the Amazon subscribe and save service.  The dentist recommended a smaller brush head so we went with these.</li>
            <li> This size brush is perfect for people with a small mouth and enables you to thoroughly reach all parts of your mouth and teeth .Most places sell the larger size which does not work for me. So glad you have this size</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd soniccare electric t.b.  I would never go back to a manual t.b.  In addition, it is an excellent way to give you gums a lite message to keep them healthy.</li>
            <li> These are the original type of toothbrushes that come with the Sonicare (same size, and brushtype).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are very good, however because of the fast brushing, and when using it together with the UV-bacteria killing bulb, the blue lines on the brush fade quite fast (blue hairs that become white are an indicator of changing the brush).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you ask me, the brush is perfect, not too hard, not too soft, brushes well between the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However at the rate that brushes need to be replaced, and considering their size, they should sell them for half the price.&lt;br /&gt;I still think $10/brush is a ripoff...</li>
            <li> The product was as pictured.  I like the compact head which can get to the teeth in the back of the mouth.  I also like that this is the original Sonicare toothbrush head.</li>
            <li> The merchandise I received all turned out to my expectations.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Sonicare toothbrushes are the best, and these compact brush heads are just right for the Philips Sonicare ProResults FlexCare toothbrush.  Oral hygiene is easy as pie with the toothbrush and brush heads.  Thanks, Amazon--great product, great price, great service!</li>
            <li> You have to replace the heads to get the most out of this toothbrush. Great product. Will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> These are the standard compact brush heads packaged in the retail package---perfect for small mouths and teeth.</li>
            <li> I like that I don&#x27;t have to go all over the place to find replacement heads.  I bought 3 packs so I am good for awhile.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product....I just find it confusing to find the right size brush to fit my toothbrush......They just don&#x27;t fit as snug as the original brushes that came with the toothbrush</li>
            <li> Difficult to find.  Best for sensitive gums and teeth.</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t use this ourselves, but our 1.5 year old seems to love to brush her teeth with this and this is the perfect size.</li>
            <li> Both my husband and myself have smaller mouths.  This toothbrush is the nicest size and does the job well.  Really a great size!!</li>
            <li> I prefer the smaller brush head over the standard. This is all based on preference the standard work just as well.</li>
            <li> These compact brush heads were purchased for my Sonicare Pro because I have a small dental arch and so brushing is more comfortable with the smaller size heads.  My favorite feature of the heads is the wear stripe which indicates the need to change; it is genius, with nothing to track unlike the sticker system which was a pain to manage.  The brush they fit on is great and has made me one of the star patients of my dentist&#x27;s office.  I&#x27;m talking perfect checkups and not too much plaque to remove.  This is a quality product that does the job and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> good deal and you cannot find the compact brushheads anywhere</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare toothbrush and there are several different brush heads for it. My opinion is that these ProResults Compact Brush Heads are the best.They fit very well around and behind my teeth.     Having a 3pk makes always having a brush head available easier.    My dentist recommended the Sonicare and he also recommended the compact brush heads. He was so right. My teeth are super clean and look great.Also not so much scraping on my teeth to get the plaque off when I have my teeth cleaned every six months.</li>
            <li> The bristles on these brush heads are very hard. Next time will pick up at my dentists office.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, and the product was as advertised.  The compact heads are pretty durable and really nice for cleaning low clearance areas.</li>
            <li> Bristles are uneven and bristle head was too big.  Odd contour and bristles were too hard and rough.  Will try a smaller, round, soft bristle head next time. This uneven one was more affordable, but will try the round next time. Cheaper is not always better.</li>
            <li> I have a narrow bit.  These are perfect!</li>
            <li> Recomended by my dentist but not sold at stores I frequent.  Glad I can get it on line.</li>
            <li> These are the standard replacement heads for the Philips Sonicare at the best price I&#x27;ve seen! No complaints at all!!</li>
            <li> What can I say, these are perfect brushes for a perfect toothbrush.  My girlfriend has a smaller mouth and she couldn&#x27;t be happier with the compact heads.</li>
            <li> a pesar de q aun no las he usado porque recien compre el cepillolas cabezas llegaron en su estuche celladas y empacadas</li>
            <li> Perfect match for my Phillips Sonicare toothbrush!  It is on a scheduled order which works out perfect.</li>
            <li> I have a very hard time finding these compact heads in any local stores.  I prefer them because my dentist was always telling me that I was destroying my gums with the larger heads.  The compact heads help me to avoid brushing my gums along with my teeth.  You should not be brushing your gums.</li>
            <li> FOR THE KIDS IN THE FAMILY AND DON&#x27;T FORGET TO REPLACE THE HEADS EVERY 3 MONTHS.</li>
            <li> I always have problems with my teeth and gum. I need good tooth brush and I find that Philips Sonicare was great and help me with my teeth and gum. To my surprise, my dentist told me that my teeth and gum were good after I switched my other electric tooth brush to Philips Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;Great product. Love it and I was glad to make my decision to switch to Philips Sonicare!</li>
            <li> These were hard to find. I love the smaller head as I have a small mouth.</li>
            <li> I like the small size and the indicator of usage but it doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as they think it should.  The package is also hard to get into.</li>
            <li> The smaller brush heads CLEAN TEETH  better than the large heads. the price at $30 is pretty high for 3 tooth brushes, but they work good , and my teeth and gums are happy.</li>
            <li> This pack represented the best value when I needed refills for my Sonicare toothbrush.  Not always easy to find the COMPACT type so I was pleased to see them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not adequately clear from the product page is that the products we received are not Philips original. After just a week of use the print on it is now smeared all over the shaft. I have no idea how the durability will compare to OE?</li>
            <li> Amazon scores again with another product priced MUCH lower than anywhere else.  We prefer the compact heads over the regular ones and you can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s price.  Not much to say about the heads without mentioning that the Sonicare is like heaven for your mouth.  My husband went from 60% gum loss to less than 10% in only 6 months!  We used Oral-B&#x27;s $15 toothbrushed for years because we thought all rotating toothbrushes are created the same.  Boy, were we wrong.  We started using Sonicare 3 years ago and can&#x27;t imagine using anything else, even when we travel.  Our kids use the Sonicare, too, and just love them.</li>
            <li> These brushes last for years.</li>
            <li> I purchased these brushes because the heads that came with the Sonicare brush were too big for my mouth.  I really like the size of these brushes.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed.  Very quick service.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in these.  The ProResults paint wore off the brush in about 2 weeks.  The bristles were soft after a month.  I reluctantly bought more ProResults brush heads at Costco last month.  I found that the Costco brushheads are much higher quality.  These are knockoffs.  Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> Love the smaller/compact heads, they make it easier on my childs small mouth as well as easier for me to reach the hard to reach teeth in the back of my mouth. Paid less here than any other store I checked. Love the free shipping. I have saved a lot of money with Amazon.</li>
            <li> I needed some brush heads but these brush heads are expensive to be changing out every 3 months. I like that they let you know when you need to change it out when the blue strip fades away. The ones I bought were cheap because I bought them when they were on sale. I&#x27;d say get them if they go on sale which I did and I usually buy the standard ones and not the compact ones.</li>
            <li> Works great and gets into small areas. Snaps onto the base with no problem. Like that they have a different color band so everyone in the family knows which color is their&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Me and my family really liked this toothbrush. It does what it is supposed to do and does it great. Because of my not good care, it stopped recharging on the 10 month of usage but sonic customer service quickly send me new charger. Great, nice, effective. Will buy again and again.</li>
            <li> Sonicare is a great product and combined with Amazon&#x27;s pricing and quick shipment really makes for a good purchase.</li>
            <li> if you have a small mouth and a sonic toothbrush, this is for you.</li>
            <li> Been using these for years with my Sonicare!  This is my third or fourth order!  Works great!  I normally replace every 3 months!</li>
            <li> Love using my Phillips Sonicare with these brushes.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 years and have never felt my tooth so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> they are tooth brushes I guess they do what they&#x27;re supposed to</li>
            <li> If your mouth is small, these compact brush heads are great. They fit better than the big ones and you do a better job at reaching all your teeth when brushing. They&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li> I had searched and searched for a smaller sized toothbrush head for my Sonicare.  I have a small oral cavity and the bigger brush that came with my Sonicare purchase was too big for my use and I became discouraged and stopped using my Sonicare product.  I was happy to find the smaller sized toothbrush head on Amazon.  The package came with three toothbrush heads for a very reasonible price.  The product arrived very quickly.  Thanks Amazon.com</li>
            <li> Fabulous toothbrush heads....used them for years.  Expensive but do a great job and get to all the nooks and crannies in my mouth for excellent cleaning and great overall oral health.</li>
            <li> This is our 2nd, great product.</li>
            <li> Like ink cartridges, they have us over a barrel. Without the replacement heads, one&#x27;s Sonicare is useless; the price has gone up over $5 for the compact 3-pack. Anyhow, the compact bristles are about 5/8\\&quot;, compact for those of us with smallish mouths, and easier around the back of the molars. I&#x27;d always bang around with the standard-size brushes, giving myself a jolt and a shock. However, the standard 3-pack size is less expensive and covers more surface, I&#x27;ll go back to the other size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: while removing the compact brush head, it came off in two parts... just swell. Still works, but I will use a screw driver to pry off the brush head next time. Not what I expected for anything this expensive.</li>
            <li> I had an orginal model that just refused to die, but finally it did. So I ordered a new unit it came with the small extended heads. Wow exactly what I needed to get in and around those wisdom teeth, and to clean along gum line for all my gold caps. It cleans even better than my old unit. I&#x27;m sold! Every cleaning makes you teeth feel you just got them cleaned at the dentist.</li>
            <li> was what I needed. does what I want. I do not have much more to say about it than that.</li>
            <li> Product works great and is a good value for 3 SOnic replacement heads. Product delivered as stated from Amazon. I needed the compact heads for my mouth and they fit perfectly for good brushing.</li>
            <li> I have had this for over 2 years already and its still going strong. The only thing is that the replacement heads are expensive, but the rest of the unit is well-made, and the ultraviolet sterilization light continues to function perfectly. My dentist noticed the difference after I started using this one and my teeth in general feel much cleaner post-brushing.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are much smaller than I thought, but they do the job</li>
            <li> These must be knock offs because they did not fit the wand properly. Sent them back and went to Costco-fit perfectly and less $$</li>
            <li> Thank goodness I found Sonicare when I did.  Just wish I had used it from the get-go!  Use Sonicare and put a dentist out of business!!!  Ha!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed and it is well worth the expense of the initial purchase.</li>
            <li> I like putting a new brush head on my toothbrush because you really get such a smooth, slick feeling. These (and all brush heads for this toothbrush) don&#x27;t last as long as would like - somewhere around a month and a half or two before the blue indicator color starts disappearing and the clean isn&#x27;t as good - but otherwise very nice. I like the smaller brush heads because they can reach my molars better and generally fit better in my mouth.</li>
            <li> i have a medium-sized mouth (according to those dental trays), and this is great to go around on the tongue-side of the arch and back to the molars. the regular-sized one is a tad bit too big, so it&#x27;s harder to get in near the arch. good sonicare-quality brush heads.</li>
            <li> I find it very difficult to use the brush on my front teeth without getting more than just the brush on my teeth and I get vibrations that I find very uncomfortable. As for the rest of my teeth it works well. I get good results I have used the various modes and they have worked well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I am only giving a 2 review is the vibrations and the fact that I have to use a regular toothbrush to brush my front couple of teeth without feeling the uncomfortable vibrations. I have tried all three heads that came with the product and had the same.</li>
            <li> My wife prefers the compact style brush head, we have used Philips Sonicare for over an year with great satisfaction and Amazon always offers the best price around.</li>
            <li> Tooth brusheads arrived when expected and were very well packed. I Love my Sonicare and am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed with these. The brush head easily pulls apart when you change heads (which we do do as me and my wife use the same charger). I tried gluing it on, but then it won&#x27;t fit the charger properly.</li>
            <li> Great brush, reaches everywere in a mouth, cleanes teeth well. It is hard enouth to scrub teeth, but soft for gums to keep them not irritated.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say. They work just as I expected them too for people with smaller mouths. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great.  They do whiten your teeth.  They work great with my Sonicare toothbrush.  Unfortunately, they barely last three months, which makes them a bit expensive.  However, I like the results and will continue to buy them. I like the small size too.</li>
            <li> I love this product mostly because Amazon has it and it&#x27;s hard to find anywhere else! The standard size brush heads are hard on my gums, and the dental hygienist recommended this size. MUCH easier to brush without roughing-up my gums.</li>
            <li> just as it supposed to be</li>
            <li> Compact brush heads fit around each tooth for the best cleaning</li>
            <li> worked well and better than buying in the store. yes i would recommend this to anyone. the product is the same as in the store.</li>
            <li> With the smaller head brush I&#x27;m able get into the areas where my dental hygienist spends more time on my cleaning.s</li>
            <li> I have been using the Sonicare for years and these smaller heads do a better job of cleaning my teeth than the larger ones.</li>
            <li> I have purchased replacement heads from costco and had no issues. I purchased these through Amazon, and I am not convinced these are authentic Phillips Sonicare brush heads. The logo rubbed off very quickly and the current head i am using is already showing the color for replacement. (the blue bristles should change to white in 3 months to show replacement) I have only been using this product for a couple weeks. other than that, they fit the toothbrush and work like a regular brush should. i am just a little surprised they say they need to be replaced already.</li>
            <li> These work much better for me than the full sized replacements. I can clean areas that the full size seem to miss.</li>
            <li> Perfect for people who use a compact-sized toothbrush.  These are difficult to find in retail stores, which usually just sell the standard-size brush heads.</li>
            <li> No one can beat Phillips Sonicare!  The 3 head pack is very reasonably priced.  If you don&#x27;t own the Phillips Sonicare system, I highly recommend it, then you can buy the brush head replacements so it is so easy to change your toothbrush every 3 months!</li>
            <li> It was difficult to find this product and I was hopeful what I ordered would fit my toothbrush and it did.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Philips. This company offers very good after service and great products for customer. However, I can not be satisfied with this item. I purchased this 3 brush head pack, and 2 of them is not working. They make terrible noise and can not brush my teeth well. I don&#x27;t know what is this happening.. Only 1 of them work properly like usual. I think I was unlucky this time. I want to exchange 2 of them, but I think that&#x27;s impossible.. because this is one package and I already threw out the box... OMG!</li>
            <li> The brushes on these are a little smaller than what I imagined but they work fine.</li>
            <li> These little compact brush heads fit in my small mouth without a problem. My brushing has improved immensely since switching from the larger heads to these smaller ones. I&#x27;m able to reach further and get into the smaller crevices. I love them!</li>
            <li> It was great to see someone who carries the \\&quot;compact\\&quot; size brush head replacements at a fairly good price. Nice product, timely delivered.</li>
            <li> These are great and I really can&#x27;t live without these but man they are so expensive. I can never find them at Walmart/Target or any drugstore so I just end up buying them here.</li>
            <li> The compact brush heads were a necessary resupply for the Sonicare toothbrush. This was the most convenient and cheapest method of purchase.</li>
            <li> I prefer the compact brush heads for my Sonicare since I have a small mouth.  The brush heads last quite a few months.</li>
            <li> If you want to keep your teeth, you should use this product.&lt;br /&gt;It is expensive but good deal if you can keep your teeth.</li>
            <li> Fake brand and mimic the Phillips brand. Don&#x27;t purchase these,  at least from Amazon fulfillment</li>
            <li> These brushes are great! More affordable then the sonicare website! I love the smaller size, they clean so good! Definitely recommend them and I will continue to order them!</li>
            <li> I love the Compact size, small and efficient.</li>
            <li> The compact size is perfect for people like me--i am a small person with a small mouth. The product cleans very well. I have been using them for at least 2 yrs and intend to continue doing so.</li>
            <li> I really love my Sonicare&lt;br /&gt;But there was just one flaw&lt;br /&gt;There were no extra compact heads&lt;br /&gt;To fit my little jaw&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the trusty guide&lt;br /&gt;In 3 months you must change&lt;br /&gt;So when I couldn&#x27;t get a spare&lt;br /&gt;I thought it rather strange&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to use the standard head&lt;br /&gt;To maintain my hygiene&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t trust a worn-out brush&lt;br /&gt;To keep my molars clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bigger brush just didn&#x27;t fit&lt;br /&gt;My mouth must be too small&lt;br /&gt;Thank goodness they now stock this one&lt;br /&gt;So I can reach them all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This smaller brush gets to the back&lt;br /&gt;Back where it&#x27;s hard to reach&lt;br /&gt;It really helps me to avoid&lt;br /&gt;My dentist&#x27;s irate speech&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fits the Philips FlexCare brush&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not for the Elite&lt;br /&gt;So stock up now, in packs of three&lt;br /&gt;And now this rhyme&#x27;s complete&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amanda Richards, March 24, 2008</li>
            <li> If you get an electric brush this is The One to get. Far superior to any other on the market.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Philips Sonicare ProResults Compact Brush Heads, 3pk and the Philips Sonicare ProResults HX6013 Brush Head Standard 3pk. They were $24.99 on Amazon and they arrived quickly, no tax or shipping. In stores they sell for at least $31. Can&#x27;t beat it--no gas to the store and less expensive. The Sonicare is \\&quot;the\\&quot; best toothbrush and both heads are great. The compact fit smaller mouths best.</li>
            <li> They work fantastic and are the best price we could find on the internet for this item.  Buy them here!</li>
            <li> After reading some other folks reviews I ordered the Philips brand and was really glad I did. They fit the base perfectly and are exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> I like the smaller brush heads</li>
            <li> expensive, but they work well</li>
            <li> Glad to find Phillips compact brush heads on Amazon because they are hard to find locally.  The compact brush heads do a better job of getting behind my back teeth than the standard heads do.  They also make it easier to brush the inside surfaces of my teeth.</li>
            <li> While I can&#x27;t beat the rhyming review for these, I can do a dance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I&#x27;m dancing right now.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These compact-sized heads are great for kid units or kid-sized-adult units like myself.  Could I brush with the \\&quot;normal\\&quot; size?  Well, no, not really, it made things very difficult and it didn&#x27;t quite reach around back molars.  This size, however, is super because it gets in and around my teefers like a pig finding truffles so afterwards I&#x27;m fresh, clean and smiling pretty.</li>
            <li> These are just what the title says - COMPACT!  Do not buy these unless you want a brush that&#x27;s half the size of the original equipment.</li>
            <li> Finally I can get to places that were causing problems.  Wish I had known about the compact head years ago.  Something so simple can \\&quot;fix\\&quot; the problem.</li>
            <li> I prefer these compact brush heads over the regular size.  It may be because I am a woman and have a smaller mouth.  I also have a strong gag reflex and find the the larger a toothbrush head is, the more I have issues with that.  The size and shape of these are great and I find that they do a wonderful job of cleaning as well.  I am hooked!</li>
            <li> I ordered this because on the chart it says that it fits the diamondclean base.  It definitely does NOT.  I will be returning them.</li>
            <li> I feel like this is a very good product.  And they were at a good price.  I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> What can I really say about these....I needed replacement heads and so I bought these. They work just as they should and the value on amazon was a good price</li>
            <li> Fits the Philips Sonicare Flexcare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush that I bought from Costco.  It does NOT fit the Sonicare Elite version.  I like these better than the DiamondClean Standard replacement brush heads they sell at Costco because the price is cheaper (Amazon had the cheapest prices I could find anywhere for these replacement heads) and the small head size is great for reaching the backs of my molars, which was hard to do with the bigger brush head.  I had these items on auto-ship, which was super convenient because this is one of those items you&#x27;re going to be buying over and over again for many years.  My only gripe is that they don&#x27;t last very long.  The blue bristles that indicate when the brush should be replaced wear out after just 3-4 weeks.</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare toothbrush and change my brushes regularly!  I use the smaller heads and also the larger ones.  This is a good find!</li>
            <li> Phillips Sonicare Compact Replacement Brush heads, The wife and I love the compact brush heads to get in the tight spots.</li>
            <li> These compact brush heads are good to clean individual teeth, but I prefer to have the bigger brush heads to clean my whole mouth including all the teeth better than with compact brush heads.</li>
            <li> As we get older, it&#x27;s easier for gums to pull away from the teeth, causing problems. This was beginning to happen to me about 6 years ago (when I was 64), so I opted for a Sonicare. I even took it on a two-month cruise and vacation with me, because the results for my gums (affirmed by my dentist) were so positive. I continue to rely on them. I&#x27;ve never had my wisdom teeth removed, so the smaller heads are better for getting into the small spaces in my mouth. Thanks for carrying this item!</li>
            <li> These heads are terrible.  The bristles come off and get stuck in your teeth.</li>
            <li> fast shipping, fair price, easy transaction, my thanks!</li>
            <li> Love these little brush heads.  They really reach and get to places I didn&#x27;t even know existed.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I needed.  It was simply to buy additional brush heads for my Philips Sonicare.  It satisfied my need.</li>
            <li> Been using a Sonicare for several years due to slight periodontal disease and it has done the job well.  These&lt;br /&gt; Brushes. Last about 3 months soare a good buy.</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare, and try to buy multiple brushes (to save money) since my dentsist really insists I keep the brushes fresh and new. I prefer the compact brush, and like that these come with different colored rings so if you have multiple users in the same household, you can color code the brushes. Fine enough.</li>
            <li> Love these!  They are smaller than the regular brush heads so they fit great in my smaller mouth.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit for Sonicare holder.</li>
            <li> I have a very small mouth and gag reflex. I find these really helpful for this. I recommend for kids as well</li>
            <li> Very dissatisfied do not clean like original diamond brushes, tried to return, not allowed;( will not purchase again, found original head at same price</li>
            <li> I bought the no-name brand last time and didn&#x27;t like the quality. These are much better! I also prefer the small brush head shape because it fits easily in all the hard to reach areas like behind the bottom front teeth and around that corner. These are noticeably better than the no-name product, although more expensive!</li>
            <li> Great product! Arrived on time!</li>
            <li> Expensive, but very effective in cleaning.</li>
            <li> really can&#x27;t think but that the manufacturer, Phillips, who makes the sonicare rig, makes a pretty penny on the follow up needs of their customers. really, these should be less than half the cost that they are. in my opinion</li>
            <li> We really like these compact brush heads as they make it easier to keep our teeth clean and we change them every 3 months.</li>
            <li> I have shopped around. Even Sam&#x27;s can&#x27;t beat the price of these. Will always purchase here. Convenience at my door!</li>
            <li> I bought this 3-pack when I bought the toothbrush. I wanted to try the difference between the compact head and the full head. I don&#x27;t know what to say except that they work just fine. With the compact head I can reach way back into the back molars and it makes for brushing behind the teeth a lot easier.</li>
            <li> It was for mom in Japan. She said it&#x27;s reeeeaaaaaly good!!</li>
            <li> I really like my phillips sonicare, feels like I just had a cleaning from the dentist. The compact brush head is just right.</li>
            <li> Good buy for mySonicare.</li>
            <li> Like compact heads much better than larger heads.  Good price.  Seems to last longer than the 3 months they advertise.</li>
            <li> The heads detach from the stem when taking them off of the base.</li>
            <li> Do Not Buy these heads they are knock-offs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased these last year and struggled to get the head to fit the brush, I should of guessed at that point that they were not the real-deal.&lt;br /&gt;Not only do they not fit the holder &amp; need to be finessed onto the brush but the bristles fall out, literally, by the mouthful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money. I bought the proper ones from a local pharmacy. They are pricier but are authentic Sonicare.</li>
            <li> These teeth bush spares work very well on my Phillips sonic tooth brush device.  What else would you expect.  These reviews can get annoying.</li>
            <li> I was long overdue to replace my toothbrush heads but never again. It makes a world of a difference. Great buy!</li>
            <li> I like the smaller brush head. It gets into the nooks &amp; crannys better. Especially the backside of the front teeth</li>
            <li> These brushes are exactly what I wanted and expected. They arrived very quickly despite being shipped from overseas, which was awesome. I can&#x27;t really decide weather I like the these or the larger brushes better because they, and the Sonicare itself of course, both leave my teeth squeaky clean but I think these make it a bit easier to reach all the way back to scrub up my wisdom teeth.</li>
            <li> Great for people who feel like not enough room for brush.</li>
            <li> It seems like I&#x27;m changing out the heads regularly...I&#x27;ve already returned the toothbrush itself twice because it lost power. Overall, I&#x27;m not thrilled with this product for the cost.</li>
            <li> These compact brush heads are the way to go!  Much better for getting to all the angles needed to thoroughly clean your teeth.  Think about how small most dental tools are, like that little polisher they use.  These brush heads get all the way to the back and right down to the roots.  They can be hard to find in stores, though.  Ordering on Amazon is the best price and the easiest way.</li>
            <li> Works great - great price too.</li>
            <li> We are very pleased with the product and the delivery.</li>
            <li> On the advice of my dental hygienist niece, I started using a Sonicare about five years ago and I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else. I have a small adult mouth, so get the best cleaning from the compact brush, Initially, there were difficult to find locally. On Amazon, they are reasonably priced and easy to order.</li>
            <li> arrived quickly and are perfect quality.  Worth the money to buy the real thing, not a knock-off</li>
            <li> These brush heads are just what I needed. I have a small mouth and they work much better than the regular size. I will definitely buy more!</li>
            <li> Just as expected. Good replacement for my old Sonicare. Sonicare&#x27;s excellent reputation is well deserved. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> The compact head brushes are my favorite, but often hard to find at the retail drug stores near me.  So happy to be able to buy on line.  These are the tiny ones - good for people with small mouths and jaws - or when you want to concetrate action onto each tooth by-itself.</li>
