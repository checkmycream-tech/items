            <li>I have been adding it to cologne mixtures with good effect - it brings a variety of notes, including Earthy, leather, and tobacco.</li>
            <li>This was a good price and buy.</li>
            <li>It will be good to use in the diffuser.</li>

            <li>I was very pleased when we found the Nature&#x27;s Kiss store.  </li>
            <li>Love it, smells as it  should!</li>
            <li>The oil really smells great.</li>
            <li>but this seller wrote me a really lovely email asking for a review, so</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the oil :)</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s all I can ask for :)</li>
            <li>One of my favorite oils to use for me and my son!&lt;br /&gt;For adhd and sleep.</li>
            <li>Ages well, so that it smells better as time passes.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this order.</li>
            <li>Good price for a high quality oil, arrived fast, I recommend it for someone who would like to try vetiver essence</li>
            <li>Good quality Essential Oil.</li>
            <li>I thought I owed it to him since the item arrived super quick and</li>
            <li>The smell is different &amp; strong but very effective mixed with massage oil or lotion.</li>
            <li>I can tell it helps to calm my nerves too.  </li>
            <li>Supposed to be calming and perhaps useful for maintaining attention.</li>
            <li>Love this oil, It helps me sleep when I can&#x27;t do it naturally.</li>
            <li>The smell is intense but very fresh</li>
            <li>I mixed it with frankinsence, tansy, and orange to make the smell a little more pleasant.  </li>
            <li>It smells pure and powerful.</li>
            <li>and although it&#x27;s too early to tell if it is benefiting my son, he does seem to enjoy having it diffused in his room each evening</li>
            <li>This is my first time to use Vetiver oil.  </li>
            <li>I use this for special massage to clear toxins.  </li>
            <li>thanks so much!</li>
            <li>Which is kind of handy because I would like to diffuse Vetiver Essential Oil, but don&#x27;t want to put thick oils in the diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered vetiver essential oil which arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>Recommend product very highly A+.</li>
            <li>the pure smell represents the high quality vetiver.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was not what I was originally looking for as far as using for topical application.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy on the skin, and mixes well with other oils.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally do reviews, I have two kids under the age of 4, so I&#x27;m a little too busy :)</li>
            <li>I have only used the oil a few times thus far, but I am rating it 5 stars because it is exactly what I ordered, it arrived very quickly</li>
            <li>This 100% pure essential oil arrived well packed &amp; on time.</li>
            <li>Love the woodsy smell&amp; how thick it is.</li>
            <li>Most Vertiver is thick and woodsy smelling.</li>
            <li>The smell is not great to me- very intense; woodsy and musty, not an oil I would use strictly to enjoy the scent.  </li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite base note essential oils for tying blends together, and a favorite company!  </li>
            <li>This is the only vetiver I have tried but it seems to be a high quality oil.  </li>
            <li>I use it around night time when the boys need to calm down.  </li>
            <li>Adding a little bit makes the mix more complex and masculine.</li>
            <li>I bought this oil to help bring more calm to our (at times) crazy house!  </li>

            <li> I only need to use a small amount and it last all day.</li>
            <li> have an autistic son who is 3 and read a lot about the benefits of using essential oils to help their development and for my son, his anxiety as well.  </li>

            <li> I bought this oil to mix with other oils, salt and herbs to make a wrap cleanse mix and I loved it. The smell is intense but very fresh</li>
            <li> Supposed to be calming and perhaps useful for maintaining attention. Perhaps it does. We like the smell.</li>
            <li> I give this product a rating of excellent for quality. The bottle sealed when I received. The oil really smells great. It smells pure and powerful.</li>
            <li> the pure smell represents the high quality vetiver. I only need to use a small amount and it last all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a while for a good Vetiver oil and am always leery because of the cost of the oil.  I was very pleased when we found the Nature&#x27;s Kiss store.  The oil is just as I remember it, with woodsy and dank basement-y notes, thanks so much!</li>
            <li> Product delivered in advertised time frame. I am not an expert on the different types of vetiver oils, but I like this product. I have been adding it to cologne mixtures with good effect - it brings a variety of notes, including Earthy, leather, and tobacco. Adding a little bit makes the mix more complex and masculine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally do reviews, I have two kids under the age of 4, so I&#x27;m a little too busy :) but this seller wrote me a really lovely email asking for a review, so I thought I owed it to him since the item arrived super quick and I am pleased with the oil :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an autistic son who is 3 and read a lot about the benefits of using essential oils to help their development and for my son, his anxiety as well.  I did my research and purchased several oils that have proven to work for autistic children, one of which is the Vetiver I bought from this seller.  I have only used the oil a few times thus far, but I am rating it 5 stars because it is exactly what I ordered, it arrived very quickly and although it&#x27;s too early to tell if it is benefiting my son, he does seem to enjoy having it diffused in his room each evening and that&#x27;s all I can ask for :)</li>
            <li> I use this for special massage to clear toxins.  The smell is different &amp; strong but very effective mixed with massage oil or lotion.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Very good quality, smell and texture.  I was concerned because I had never purchased from Nature&#x27;s Kiss.  This was a good price and buy.</li>
            <li> WILL ALWAYS HAVE THIS ON HAND TO MAKE BODY SHAMPOO AND LOTION. IT SMELLS PEPPERY AND LAST A LONG TIME.</li>
            <li> I must admit did not smell like what I expected,  but give it a chance it does have that relaxing effect if that is what you are looking for which I was.</li>
            <li> For Vetiver, the scent and the viscosity (thickness of the liquid) is weak. It will be good to use in the diffuser. Which is kind of handy because I would like to diffuse Vetiver Essential Oil, but don&#x27;t want to put thick oils in the diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was not what I was originally looking for as far as using for topical application. I will buy Vetiver from a different supplier to get the thicker, stronger scented grade I need to make the therapeutic Calming Child blend for my son&#x27;s ADD &amp; Tourette&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to buy this again, for diffusing!</li>
            <li> Good price for a high quality oil, arrived fast, I recommend it for someone who would like to try vetiver essence</li>
            <li> Very good.  Helps me sleep at night.</li>
            <li> I dont have a lot of experience with EO&#x27;s as I am just starting my journey. I did use my Vetiver oil in a diffuser this past weekend and it did seem to have a calming effect. I would reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> Have ordered this twice. One of my favorite oils to use for me and my son!&lt;br /&gt;For adhd and sleep. Love the woodsy smell&amp; how thick it is.</li>
            <li> Love it, smells as it  should! very happy for the purchase i am never disappointed with their oils</li>
            <li> Most Vertiver is thick and woodsy smelling. This product is thin and smells of solvent.</li>
            <li> Great smelling oil (if you like those kinds of woodsy scents). The scent reminds me of the much more expensive agarwood oil. Ages well, so that it smells better as time passes. It&#x27;s also easy on the skin, and mixes well with other oils.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite base note essential oils for tying blends together, and a favorite company!  GREAT quality oils without the hype or run-up in prices for the hype.</li>
            <li> I ordered vetiver essential oil which arrived very quickly. The strength ad beauty of the vetiver&#x27;s scent was everything I hoped it would be. I use it to release stress both in the office and at home. I do recommend Nature&#x27;s Kiss vetiver essential oil.</li>
            <li> Love this oil, It helps me sleep when I can&#x27;t do it naturally. A must for holistic living. Good price</li>
            <li> shipped according to email and plan and quality is great.</li>
            <li> This 100% pure essential oil arrived well packed &amp; on time. This is my first time to use Vetiver oil.  It is a delicate fragrance and I don&#x27;t have an allergic reaction.  I plan to use the oil in soaps, lotions, etc. I am pleased with this order.</li>
            <li> Good quality Essential Oil. Good service and item packaged well for protection of glass jar. Recommend product very highly A+.</li>
            <li> This is the only vetiver I have tried but it seems to be a high quality oil.  The smell is not great to me- very intense; woodsy and musty, not an oil I would use strictly to enjoy the scent.  I have two rambunctious little boys (one with ADD and Aspergers)and I bought this oil to help bring more calm to our (at times) crazy house!  I mixed it with frankinsence, tansy, and orange to make the smell a little more pleasant.  It seems to help a lot when I diffuse it.  I use it around night time when the boys need to calm down.  They have literally gone and laid down and cuddled on the couch when I put it in my diffuser!  I also put a few drops of vetiver and lavender on a cotton ball and put it on a bed side table as a natural sleep aid.  I can tell it helps to calm my nerves too.  I would recommend this to parents looking to help manage little kid craziness in a natural way.  Natures Kiss seems to have the lowest prices on the market as well.</li>
            <li> Do NOT BUY If you are expecting the same quality of scent as Plant Therapy or Eden&#x27;s Garden also sold here on Amazon.  Sadly, I immediately put this in my diffuser when it got here and i&#x27;m still trying to get the stench out of my living room.  Gross.</li>
