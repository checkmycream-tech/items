            <li>Not finding a good reason for it not being available over-the-counter, I purchased here on Amazon, and am so very glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many products to remove the hair but they have either damaged my face or done nothing at all.</li>
            <li>The $25.00 rebate is good for every prescription you fill, there is also a $35.00 rebate on the Vaniqa website right now.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>after dealing with this problem fir many years i am glad to say i found something that actually works.  </li>
            <li>wanted facial hair, I am just thrilled</li>
            <li>The item arrived on time and package right, I will be updating in about 4 weeks to let you guys know if it works.</li>
            <li>I noticed the difference practically right away.  </li>
            <li>Having had this problem of very much un</li>
            <li>When I first heard of this, I did a lot of research.  </li>
            <li>and i noticed a difference within the first week of use.  </li>
            <li>The person is in their 50s and said that it works if you are consistent.</li>
            <li>This is the first product that I have ever used that has shown positive results.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t know how much of a relief this is.</li>
            <li>This is a much cheaper alternative to the Vaniqa.</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy this product as long as it is available.</li>
            <li>It has only been a week, but it&#x27;s doing an amazing job of slowing down hair re-growth.  </li>
            <li>Now, 6 weeks later, the results are total and there&#x27;s a great sigh of relief that this is one less issue I don&#x27;t have to worry about in today&#x27;s busy world.  </li>
            <li>I used Vaniqa for an year but suddenly it was not longer available in my country, so I switched to Eflora that is the same but can be bought without a prescription whitch I couldn&#x27;t get in the States.</li>
            <li>I feel that maybe in a few months I could be hair free.</li>
            <li>I began using it on my freshly threaded upper lip which made it quite obvious that this product was working.  </li>
            <li>The main thing to mention is the final peace of mind this product gave to the issue of unwanted hair.  </li>
            <li>The most frustrating symptom has been unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li>It is exactly the same price as it is half the size of my prescribed Vaniqa.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 years now. It is the same ingredient as Vaniqa - only costs A LOT less. I will continue to order from Skincare Labs!</li>
            <li> The main thing to mention is the final peace of mind this product gave to the issue of unwanted hair.  When I first heard of this, I did a lot of research.  I wanted to know why a product for unwanted hair would be &#x27;by prescription only&#x27; because it seemed harmless enough.  Not finding a good reason for it not being available over-the-counter, I purchased here on Amazon, and am so very glad I did.  I noticed results within about a week.  Now, 6 weeks later, the results are total and there&#x27;s a great sigh of relief that this is one less issue I don&#x27;t have to worry about in today&#x27;s busy world.  No more worry about checking the areas of unwanted hair before I leave the house.</li>
            <li> I have always used vaniqa and wanted to try the generic. I like the price of the product, however I don&#x27;t think it works as well. It does slow the hair growth down if applied twice a day, I just noticed it&#x27;s not as effective as vaniqa. Not sure if I will purchase again. Great seller .. arrived quickly! I think one needs to try it themselves as it works differently on each person.</li>
            <li> I used Vaniqa for an year but suddenly it was not longer available in my country, so I switched to Eflora that is the same but can be bought without a prescription whitch I couldn&#x27;t get in the States. It slows hair growing time, making your skin look softer and luminous.</li>
            <li> i know for everyone products work differently.  but its been two months and i noticed a difference within the first week of use.  after dealing with this problem fir many years i am glad to say i found something that actually works.  it has dramactically slowed the growth and made the hairs finer.  i only apply once daily and will continue to purchase this product.  it is cheaper than the brand name and works just like my doctor said it would.  continued use will maintain the results.</li>
            <li> The person is in their 50s and said that it works if you are consistent. You will definitely see a reduction in hair growth. Must use twice a day for effective results.</li>
            <li> Vaniqa Eflora (Psoret): Reduce &amp; Slow Growth of Unwanted Hair -15g by ranbaxy seems to be working in just a short time. Hair growth has slowed down. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> This product works wondderful. Let me tell you, I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks and the hair on my chin had become lesser. I use it morning and night and I&#x27;m very happy and very thankful for this product. I never wanna be without this product. I&#x27;m very happy withe results. Thank you to whomever invented this product. God will bless you..</li>
            <li> did not work at all.  Not identified as Vaniqa anywhere on box or tube. followed instructions carefully.  waste of money</li>
            <li> used as directed , did not reduce or slow unwanted hair growth. the product seem to work in the opposite</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0078ANX0Y Vaniqa Eflora (Psoret): Reduce &amp; Slow Growth of Unwanted Hair -15g]] I purchased the Vaniqa Eflora and I have been using it twice a day for the past 3 weeks. I can definitely see a difference in facial hair thickness and growth. I have slower hair growth and thinner hair follicles. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using Vaniqa for 2 years and it works great. I pay $103.00 minus the $25.00 rebate for a 45g tube.  The $25.00 rebate is good for every prescription you fill, there is also a $35.00 rebate on the Vaniqa website right now. This fake Vaniqa from INDIA is more expensive by weight. You don&#x27;t get a rebate. I also wouldn&#x27;t risk using anything on my face that came from India.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from PCOS (Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome) for about 13yrs. The most frustrating symptom has been unwanted facial hair. It has gotten so bad that I have to shave everyday or I have a 5 O&#x27;clock shadow. The constant shaving has caused hyper-pigmentation on my chin and neck. I don&#x27;t even let my husband touch my face. It has caused me to become very insecure. I have tried so many products to remove the hair but they have either damaged my face or done nothing at all. This is the first product that I have ever used that has shown positive results. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week and have only had to shave twice. You don&#x27;t know how much of a relief this is. I feel that maybe in a few months I could be hair free.</li>
            <li> The item arrived on time and package right, I will be updating in about 4 weeks to let you guys know if it works. I have pcos and am using it on my chin.</li>
            <li> When I ordered, I thought it was cheaper than the $100 prescription.  It is exactly the same price as it is half the size of my prescribed Vaniqa. It does work but does not save you any money....</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t do as it said that it would.  I am still using it by the directions that came in the package.</li>
            <li> It actually is working for me.  i did not realize it until a few days ago.  I have had  issues with chin hairs, some had become ingrown.  If this product did not work for me, the next thing to try would be laser hair removable.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I noticed the difference practically right away.  I began using it on my freshly threaded upper lip which made it quite obvious that this product was working.  It has only been a week, but it&#x27;s doing an amazing job of slowing down hair re-growth.  Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This is great! I have a prescription for Vaniqua which insurance does not pay for so the prescription cost was $108.00.  Although in a different box  it seems to have the same ingredients and content as the prescription does.  I find for me it works and is so less expensive. I will continue to buy this product as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> This is a much cheaper alternative to the Vaniqa. It uses the same basic generic ingredients found in vaniqa so that it gives the same results. The advantage to this is that you do not need to have a prescription.</li>
            <li> I did not see or notice any change using this product and I have never used  it again. applying this product twice a day made no difference at all.</li>
            <li> This is the second time that I have order this wonder cream...it works just as good as the prescription Vaniqu, with a much better price. Instructions basically the same, I will never be with out this product. Having had this problem of very much un wanted facial hair, I am just thrilled, Price is great, came on time, great instruction.</li>
            <li> its a little expenseve but you got to keep it up but it works less expenseve at amazon this my wife 2nd will get it again</li>
