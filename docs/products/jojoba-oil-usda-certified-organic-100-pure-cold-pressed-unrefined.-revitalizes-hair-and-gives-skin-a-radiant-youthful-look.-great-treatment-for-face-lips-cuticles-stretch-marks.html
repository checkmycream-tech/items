            <li>It protects and repairs many scalp and skin issues, with nourishing properties for eyelashes, lips, cuticles and nails, literally effective from head to toe.  </li>
            <li>It is absolutely perfect for essential oils to create your own aromatherapy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very light scent&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had never heard of using Jojoba oil for hair, skin, and nails, but I knew that you could find this amazing super moisturizing oil in a lot of hair and skincare products, so I was thrilled to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Jojoba oil is one of my favorite oils.</li>
            <li>I use Jojoba oil for hair and scalp treatments, and on my nails after manicures,.. making sure I go around my cuticles.</li>
            <li>i love this oil.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I also mix a bit in with my regular moisturizer and it works great!</li>
            <li>I use this in so many ways.</li>
            <li>The oil is actually more like a liquid wax.</li>
            <li>–it’s found in many beauty products from shampoos to moisturizers.</li>
            <li>I love to put scented oil in my hair while it is still damp.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The dropper could work better, the one I got has a habit of dripping a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Glides smoothly on the skin, provides a nice slip, and is beneficial as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Highly pleased.</li>

            <li>I loved that even though its an oil, it still feels really lightweight on the skin.</li>
            <li>This 2 Oz bottle of Jojoba oil has a nice dropper top which makes it very easy to add drops when mixing oils or applying directly to my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Jojoba oil is the perfect carrier for other things.</li>
            <li>Jojoba rinses out easily</li>
            <li>I can easily recommend it.</li>
            <li>I plan on mainly using this on my nails and hair, but might eventually see how it works on sunburn, since I heard it can be good for that too.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>The scent is barely there, more like a hint of scent, so this is perfect to use with your favorite essential or fragrance oils.</li>
            <li>I put it on my cuticles, and it has made a huge difference</li>
            <li>i received a free sample to test and review.</li>

            <li>The oil is content from the seeds, is odor free, it does not have any harmful impacts and seldom leads to any allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>really like the dropper cover of this oil which makes it very easy to use and apply this product without creating a mess.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>your skin will look and feel softer and so much nicer! :)</li>
            <li>I love essential oils and was excited when I was offered to review this Kate Blanco Jojoba oil to give my honest and unbiased opinion.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Jojoba oil is a light feeling oil that absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling or looking greasy.</li>
            <li>It might be too light for a massage, but would be a good carrier for facial serums, cuticle treatments, hair treatments, etc.</li>
            <li>It’s one of the most budget friendly choices, and it really does work.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to apply the oil sparingly–you really don’t need that much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Large Bottle!!</li>
            <li>Especially my hair, it&#x27;s so nice and smooth now</li>
            <li>I received a Free sample for an evaluation; however, my personal usages, results, statements and opinions are all my own.</li>
            <li>was lucky to get this product under promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
            <li>Jojoba oil absorbs quickly and isn&#x27;t sticky or greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>I put this on after a warm shower and applying a toner and wake up the next day with extremely soft skin–I love it!</li>
            <li>applied my this Jojoba Oil to my hair at night before bed, but it worked great as a styling/smoothing cream when you&#x27;re styling your hair for the day.&lt;br /&gt;After a week or so of using this on my hair every other day, it feels really soft and looks so much more moisturized.</li>
            <li>It should rub on easily and absorb reasonably well into your skin.</li>
            <li>My nails have always been very brittle and break easily.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is also good to put on the ends of your hair if you have dry brittle hair.  </li>

            <li>This bottle is filled with the pure oil itself, and can be used as a moisturizer for both the face and the hair.</li>
            <li>a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great as a carrier oil for fragrance and this particular version doesn&#x27;t add anything to the scent.  </li>
            <li>After it warmed up it turned back into a nice oil.  </li>
            <li>I got what I pay for, totally worth a try.</li>
            <li>while my body is still damp, it does NOT leave any greasy, oily, sticky, or slippery residue, it absorbs immediately and I am able to dress directly after my application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>

            <li>Jojoba is a popular carrier oil to use with essential oils.</li>
            <li>Jojoba oil is an ingredient commonly mentioned in many beauty magazines, and it’s with good reason</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think this is a great starting choice for anyone looking for a natural alternative moisturizer and want to give the oils a try.</li>
            <li>The manufacturer of Kate Blanc Organic Jojoba Oil is so confident of improved and effective skin results that they are willing to offer 100% Money Back Guarantee, with no questions asked, even if the returned bottle is empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a Free sample for an evaluation; however, my personal usages, results, statements and opinions are all my own.d skin - vitamin E, B-complex, copper, zinc, selenium, iodine, and chromium.</li>
            <li>Though the oil can be used for treating dry hair (split ends, etc), it can also be used on the face and neck as a moisturizer, on dry parched hands (excellent for aging hands) and as a softener for cuticles - using it makes cuticle care</li>
            <li>I frequently make my own bath and beauty products as well as test new (to me) products.</li>
            <li>Jojoba oil acts as a natural hair serum that imparts shine with a nourished, healthy, brighter look and soft smooth hair.</li>

            <li>Another thing I really like about this is the fact that it has a very light nutty odor–you can barely detect it.</li>
            <li>We like to know exactly what were putting on our skin, it is the largest organ on humans after all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love to use it as a carrier oil for some of my essential oils too.</li>
            <li>I have many different oils in my bathroom cabinet for a multitude of uses.</li>

            <li>Jojoba Oil is one of my favorites, as there are so many uses for this oil, such as:&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li>I personally don&#x27;t are for most hand creams because they are too perfumed and the perform gets on everything I touch.</li>
            <li>Having used this for a month now, I must say it’s a fantastic natural moisturizer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Jojoba is exactly all that.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The one thing that I found that I was interested in was using it on hand and nails.  </li>
            <li>It had an appropriate safety seal and did not open or leak during shipping.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>The oil is very light with a clear golden yellow color, and without any</li>
            <li>This bottle specifically may not look like much, but since you don’t use much per application, one of these should be able to easily last 2+ months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would love to have long nails</li>
            <li>The main difference is that commercial chemical products will temporarily mask the negative symptom conditions at best, but do nothing to repair the damage.</li>
            <li>Higher grade organic Jojaba is golden and clear in color.  </li>
            <li>Or, the pure oil itself may be used on skin, hair, or cuticles.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It certainly looks, smells, and absorbs like jojoba oil as I know it.</li>
            <li>and it is not 100% pure organic Jojaba oil.  </li>
            <li>This used more than 1/2 the bottle (my hair is long and dry, so it really soaked up the oil), but my hair was in amazing shape the next day -- so soft and smooth and manageable.</li>
            <li>Helps to protects skin from sun damage and prevents premature aging symptoms, such as fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li>Helps to protects skin from sun damage and prevents premature aging symptoms, such as fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Natural pure and organic plant extract oils are important for both skin and hair care, they are nourishing agents as opposed to commercial chemical based products.  </li>
            <li>Ijust apply a drop from the pipette to my nail and massage it in and the oils bond with the nail to make them harder and more durable.</li>
            <li>It really does work and the color</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have much of a taste.</li>
            <li>However, it really works.</li>
            <li>If you have shorter hair, you probably won&#x27;t need as much oil.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much in the way of a scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much in the way of a scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product</li>
            <li>Jojoba oil is found as an additive in many cosmetic products, especially those marketed as being made from natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised at how many different things you can do with this oil.</li>
            <li>used the Kate Blanc Cosmetics Jojoba Oil, which comes in a nice sized 2oz bottle in a few ways.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Jojoba oil is from the jojoba bush, an evergreen plant indigenous to the hot desert areas states of Arizona, New Mexico and California.</li>
            <li>For those who feel weird about putting oils on their face/body, they actually get absorbed by your body rather quickly and I haven’t experienced any breakouts whatsoever.</li>
            <li>Jojoba is the only oil that closely resembles human sebum, which is the substance that we naturally produce from our own oil glands below the skin surface.</li>
            <li>Jojoba is the only oil that closely resembles human sebum, which is the substance that we naturally produce from our own oil glands below the skin surface.</li>
            <li>I have used products containing jojoba oil, but this is my first time using just jojoba oil directly.</li>
            <li>facial skin care, it safely removes cosmetic make up before a thorough cleansing, and then I re-apply jojoba oil as moisturizer after facial serum applications.</li>
            <li>Anyway, this product is a solid purchase and came quickly.</li>
            <li>However, I highly recommend it if you like Jojoba oil.</li>
            <li>I also think I got a little more manageability/</li>
            <li>I love to add a few drops to my hair.  </li>
            <li>I take this and add a few drops into my favorite conditioner and apply it to my hair.</li>
            <li>it soaks right in and unlike lotions we don&#x27;t have to do multiple coats in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so everytime before applying new coat of ail polish</li>
            <li>This helps to promote an increase of new hair cells that lead to new hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This helps to promote an increase of new hair cells that lead to new hair growth.  </li>
            <li>This new routine seems to be helping my hair</li>
            <li>I wish everyone would at least give this product a try because all jojoba oil are not the same, this one has the best ingredient that earth has to offer, organic, pure, cold press, chemical free!</li>
            <li>I have super dry hair</li>
            <li>I use a lot of essential oils and this particular Jojoba Oil is perfection for mixing my oils and even just from the bottle!!  </li>
            <li>My face soaked it up pretty quickly and I was left with no oily residue (my skin is naturally dry too).</li>
            <li>Mine arrived frozen solid due to our lovely winter weather.  </li>
            <li>really like to use my complimentary bottle on my skin with some essential oils mixed in.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>It comes in a dark brown bottle to prevent degradation from light exposure.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, my favorite use for Jojoba Oil is on my dry scalp and dry hair.</li>
            <li>My result is soft and manageable hair that is easy to control, no heavy weighed down feeling, and instead I receive some additional soft volume.</li>
            <li>It will cost about the same (or less) and you will have a lot more.</li>
            <li>By using 100% pure and organic plant extracts such as Kate Blanc Organic Jojoba Oil, this will nourish and repair skin conditions and will not irritate skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It should be clear and have almost no odor.</li>
            <li>I know they say to not apply directly to the skin/face</li>
            <li>Overall a must have for any household really.</li>
            <li>E is also an anti-inflammatory, so it calms and hydrates sensitive</li>
            <li>Lessens irritated skin and promotes natural production of collagen.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>

            <li>Lessens irritated skin and promotes natural production of collagen.</li>
            <li>I just put some on my hands before typing this review and it is already absorbed--just leaving soft skin and cuticles.  </li>

            <li> I can easily recommend it.</li>

            <li> It should rub on easily and absorb reasonably well into your skin.</li>

            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great as a carrier oil for fragrance and this particular version doesn&#x27;t add anything to the scent.  </li>

            <li> Jojoba Oil is one of my favorites, as there are so many uses for this oil, such as:&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t are for most hand creams because they are too perfumed and the perform gets on everything I touch.</li>
            <li> Having used this for a month now, I must say it’s a fantastic natural moisturizer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Jojoba is exactly all that.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> The one thing that I found that I was interested in was using it on hand and nails.  </li>
            <li> It had an appropriate safety seal and did not open or leak during shipping.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The oil is very light with a clear golden yellow color, and without any</li>
            <li> This bottle specifically may not look like much, but since you don’t use much per application, one of these should be able to easily last 2+ months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would love to have long nails</li>
            <li> The main difference is that commercial chemical products will temporarily mask the negative symptom conditions at best, but do nothing to repair the damage.</li>
            <li> Higher grade organic Jojaba is golden and clear in color.  </li>
            <li> Or, the pure oil itself may be used on skin, hair, or cuticles.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It certainly looks, smells, and absorbs like jojoba oil as I know it.</li>
            <li> and it is not 100% pure organic Jojaba oil.  </li>
            <li> This used more than 1/2 the bottle (my hair is long and dry, so it really soaked up the oil), but my hair was in amazing shape the next day -- so soft and smooth and manageable.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Natural pure and organic plant extract oils are important for both skin and hair care, they are nourishing agents as opposed to commercial chemical based products.  </li>
            <li> Ijust apply a drop from the pipette to my nail and massage it in and the oils bond with the nail to make them harder and more durable.</li>
            <li> It really does work and the color</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have much of a taste.</li>
            <li> However, it really works.</li>
            <li> If you have shorter hair, you probably won&#x27;t need as much oil.</li>

            <li> Jojoba oil is found as an additive in many cosmetic products, especially those marketed as being made from natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised at how many different things you can do with this oil.</li>
            <li> used the Kate Blanc Cosmetics Jojoba Oil, which comes in a nice sized 2oz bottle in a few ways.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Jojoba oil is from the jojoba bush, an evergreen plant indigenous to the hot desert areas states of Arizona, New Mexico and California.</li>
            <li> For those who feel weird about putting oils on their face/body, they actually get absorbed by your body rather quickly and I haven’t experienced any breakouts whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Jojoba is the only oil that closely resembles human sebum, which is the substance that we naturally produce from our own oil glands below the skin surface.</li>
            <li> Jojoba is the only oil that closely resembles human sebum, which is the substance that we naturally produce from our own oil glands below the skin surface.</li>
            <li> I have used products containing jojoba oil, but this is my first time using just jojoba oil directly.</li>
            <li> facial skin care, it safely removes cosmetic make up before a thorough cleansing, and then I re-apply jojoba oil as moisturizer after facial serum applications.</li>
            <li> Anyway, this product is a solid purchase and came quickly.</li>
            <li> However, I highly recommend it if you like Jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> I also think I got a little more manageability/</li>
            <li> I love to add a few drops to my hair.  </li>
            <li> I take this and add a few drops into my favorite conditioner and apply it to my hair.</li>
            <li> it soaks right in and unlike lotions we don&#x27;t have to do multiple coats in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> This helps to promote an increase of new hair cells that lead to new hair growth.  </li>
            <li> This new routine seems to be helping my hair</li>
            <li> I wish everyone would at least give this product a try because all jojoba oil are not the same, this one has the best ingredient that earth has to offer, organic, pure, cold press, chemical free!</li>
            <li> I have super dry hair</li>
            <li> I use a lot of essential oils and this particular Jojoba Oil is perfection for mixing my oils and even just from the bottle!!  </li>
            <li> My face soaked it up pretty quickly and I was left with no oily residue (my skin is naturally dry too).</li>
            <li> Mine arrived frozen solid due to our lovely winter weather.  </li>
            <li> really like to use my complimentary bottle on my skin with some essential oils mixed in.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> It comes in a dark brown bottle to prevent degradation from light exposure.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, my favorite use for Jojoba Oil is on my dry scalp and dry hair.</li>
            <li> My result is soft and manageable hair that is easy to control, no heavy weighed down feeling, and instead I receive some additional soft volume.</li>
            <li> It will cost about the same (or less) and you will have a lot more.</li>
            <li> By using 100% pure and organic plant extracts such as Kate Blanc Organic Jojoba Oil, this will nourish and repair skin conditions and will not irritate skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It should be clear and have almost no odor.</li>
            <li> I know they say to not apply directly to the skin/face</li>
            <li> Overall a must have for any household really.</li>
            <li> E is also an anti-inflammatory, so it calms and hydrates sensitive</li>
            <li> Lessens irritated skin and promotes natural production of collagen.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>

            <li> I just put some on my hands before typing this review and it is already absorbed--just leaving soft skin and cuticles.  </li>
            <li> SOFT heels!!&lt;br /&gt;AWESOME</li>
            <li> It works very, very well if you have dry</li>
            <li> Kate Blanc Organic Jojoba Oil is 100% pure and natural and it soothes and heals all my dry skin prone areas - my elbows, legs, knees, and the heels of my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is becoming easier to manage, and not so dull looking.</li>
            <li> , I have provided a short summary on the effectiveness, and different uses for Kate Blanc 100% pure and natural Jojoba Oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> organic and pure Jojoba Oil from Kate Blanc comes in a dark amber color bottle to help protect the oils from the damage of light and it has an eyedropper applicator to carefully measure out the necessary drops.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is the last statement above that applies of Kate Blanc&#x27;s 100% pure Jojoba Oil.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Organic Jojoba Oil from Kate Blanc is 100% pure and Jojoba is the only oil that closely resembles human sebum.</li>
            <li> Acne – jojoba has the capacity to kill bacteria, the anti-microbial properties contains iodine that prevent harmful bacteria growth, which causes pimples, blackheads, and acne breakouts  Organic Jojoba Oil from Kate Blanc is 100% pure and Jojoba is the only oil that closely resembles human sebum.</li>
            <li> I find it is a very thin textured, light oil that absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> It is safe for everyday use due to the natural nourishing properties contained in the jojoba oil that our skin and hair require.</li>
            <li> This is of similar viscosity to other hair oils that are liquid at room temperature (avocado, argan) and is light yellow in color.</li>

            <li> i use nail polish all the time, so my nails look very damaged and dry</li>
            <li> Sometimes I use a few extra drops to help smooth over the lower frizzy ends, for a sleek and finished appearance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for 3 days, but so far I like it!</li>
            <li> I have found other jojoba oils even though they have the same claim to be really dark in color which I think isn&#x27;t authentic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a yellowish or golden colored, transparent oil, and a little bit goes</li>
            <li> little Jojoba also absorbs into the dry ends of my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Kate Blanc Organic Jojoba Oil works effectively as a natural moisturizer for my skin, scalp and hair, and sometimes I combine the Jojoba with my other pure and natural oils for a slightly different change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who are new to different essential oils</li>
            <li> The product I received came sealed in the same bottle that is shown in the picture but it is clear.  </li>
            <li> I have a friend who uses this directly on her face daily and loves it.</li>
            <li> In the evenings, I use the jojoba oil for my facial skin moisturizer, and I use it on my eyelashes to keep them soft, nourished and thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I applied about every other day and my nails and the cuticles are already looking much</li>
            <li> done a little research and read that it has quite a few vitamins and minerals in it for healthy skin and hair.</li>
            <li> also have dry, rough cuticles and have been really neglecting them lately, so I was excited to apply this oil to make them softer, smoother, and overall healthier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used products that already have this type of oil mixed in, but never had I ever used the pure, raw oil on its own.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> The tiniest amount, only a drop or two is necessary for facial and neck coverage or else the oil will leave a shine, however, it instantly absorbs into my dry skin.</li>
            <li> If you are going to do this, you will go through the oil quickly (especially if you have long hair).</li>
            <li> so you can expect this bottle to last you a really long time too!</li>
            <li> Used this way, the oil will last a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I do it occasionally because of my dry patches (combo skin).</li>
            <li> I use Jojoba Oil as a facial, and body moisturizer and in addition, for my dry scalp and hair condition.</li>

            <li> I will try to update after about a month to see how long they have grown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I comb out my hair and massage 2 tablespoons of jojoba into my scalp and hair, while my hair is still dry; I do NOT have wet hair for this pre-wash and deep conditioning application.</li>
            <li> It was also affective in removing makeup from my face, but so are a few of the other oils that I normally use.</li>
            <li> I have dry, somewhat sensitive skin (I basically need a natural product or my skin reacts in some negative way!), so I am cautious about what I apply to my skin.  </li>

            <li> Having dry skin, I like applying some sort of oil to my face, but I do not want it to be greasy.  </li>
            <li> I let my hair air dry.</li>
            <li> What I did here was saturate my dry hair with jojoba oil, then put my hair under a processing cap for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t overly greasy or even overly dry.</li>
            <li> My cuticles are healed, soft and with no more cracking and peeling.</li>
            <li> This oil has a very faint scent and makes my feet and hands look and feel much better.</li>
            <li> I tend to use a little coconut oil when my hands get dry, but now I am likely to start with couple drops of Jojoba then the coconut as a barrier</li>
            <li> I rate it only 4 stars because I would prefer it to be a little thinner.</li>
            <li> I color my hair regularly, so it can look a little damaged.</li>

            <li> If anything, they’ve helped my acne due to how nourishing it is for the skin.</li>
            <li> I have done this every other day, and I am already seeing some results.</li>
            <li> The jojoba oil revitalizes the dry and dull condition of my hair; it eliminates the dry straw look, and adds both moisture and body.</li>
            <li> Then I use a wide toothcomb to distribute the oil through to the ends, let it soak into my scalp and hair for a few hours before I shampoo the oil out of my hair.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s been used for scars, to moisturize hair and skin, for cuticles, acne, sunburn, anti-aging, and a few other things.</li>

            <li> (I have thick, waist-length hair, but even so, it only takes a few drops.)</li>
            <li> less frizz when I was using this.</li>
            <li> My split ends have also been quite a bit less noticeable</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a lot, a little goes a long way, so I squeezed 3-4 drops out (I have long mid-back length hair) and smoothed though the base of my head down, focusing on the tips especially where I have lots of dry, split ends.</li>
            <li> I also add a little bit to my moisturizers each morning and night, and it makes my skin feel and look great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using this now for a little over a week.</li>
            <li> I have used this for few weeks now</li>

            <li> Mine arrived frozen solid due to our lovely winter weather.  The jar did not crack.  After it warmed up it turned back into a nice oil.  We like to know exactly what were putting on our skin, it is the largest organ on humans after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like to use my complimentary bottle on my skin with some essential oils mixed in.  At night we use lavender oils in it and even on my sons skin it works really nice.  I like that it soaks right in and unlike lotions we don&#x27;t have to do multiple coats in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband uses it like beard oil, he likes it too.</li>
            <li> Jojoba oil is one of my favorite oils. I use Jojoba oil for hair and scalp treatments, and on my nails after manicures,.. making sure I go around my cuticles. I love to use it as a carrier oil for some of my essential oils too. This 2 Oz bottle of Jojoba oil has a nice dropper top which makes it very easy to add drops when mixing oils or applying directly to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jojoba oil is a light feeling oil that absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling or looking greasy. The scent is barely there, more like a hint of scent, so this is perfect to use with your favorite essential or fragrance oils. As part of my daily routine I use HA and Vitamin C serums along with a moisturizer. Jojoba oil works great added along with the products I use and helps to lock in moisture. It works very, very well if you have dry skin,...your skin will look and feel softer and so much nicer! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product sample received in exchange for review purposes.</li>
            <li> Great for oily skin. Leaves my skin moisture without getting greasy. No scents LOVE IT! I got what I pay for, totally worth a try.</li>
            <li> I reviewed this product for ilovetoreview.com and it&#x27;s the best jojoba oil I ever used. I use it on my hair, skin and nails. It has made such a difference in every aspect. Especially my hair, it&#x27;s so nice and smooth now and my nails aren&#x27;t brittle.</li>
            <li> Jojoba oil is very good for us but it&#x27;s thicker than I like. I don&#x27;t know if this is supposed to be thick, maybe you do. However, I use this as an oil carrier for essential oils. I have a friend who uses this directly on her face daily and loves it. I rate it only 4 stars because I would prefer it to be a little thinner. However, I highly recommend it if you like Jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> Wow! this is a great product! my hair just loves it! I wish everyone would at least give this product a try because all jojoba oil are not the same, this one has the best ingredient that earth has to offer, organic, pure, cold press, chemical free! I really feel good using this wonderful product! Thank you Kate for showing love to your customer with great products! you are awesome!:-)</li>
            <li> I have many different oils in my bathroom cabinet for a multitude of uses. Some for hair, nails, skin, health.... Jojoba oil is one of the newest in the collection. I&#x27;ve used products that already have this type of oil mixed in, but never had I ever used the pure, raw oil on its own.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve done a little research and read that it has quite a few vitamins and minerals in it for healthy skin and hair. It&#x27;s been used for scars, to moisturize hair and skin, for cuticles, acne, sunburn, anti-aging, and a few other things. I&#x27;ve used this bottle for my cuticles because I like my nails to look amazing. Well, my prenatal and vegetarian diet make them look good, but this jojoba oil makes them look even nicer. I mixed it in with my home made hair mask and replaced one oil with it. It seemed to work just as well and also conditioned my curls. They also seemed slightly less tangled. It was also affective in removing makeup from my face, but so are a few of the other oils that I normally use. I plan on mainly using this on my nails and hair, but might eventually see how it works on sunburn, since I heard it can be good for that too.&lt;br /&gt;Good product- no skin irritation or discomfort after use either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a bottle of Jojoba Oil for reviewing purposes. All opinions expressed are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> i love this oil. i tis great for my nails, my skin, it is a great moisturizer. i use nail polish all the time, so my nails look very damaged and dry so everytime before applying new coat of ail polish i use this oil and after couple of weeks my nails look healthier and stronger. i woudl recommend this oil to everyone. i received a free sample to test and review.</li>
            <li> A bit of background for those who are unfamiliar with Jojoba oil. It is the liquid produced in the seed of the Simmondsia chinensis (Jojoba) plant, a shrub, which is native to southern Arizona, southern California, and northwestern Mexico. The oil makes up approximately 50% of the jojoba seed by weight. Jojoba oil is found as an additive in many cosmetic products, especially those marketed as being made from natural ingredients. In particular, such products commonly containing jojoba are lotions and moisturizers, hair shampoos and conditioners. Or, the pure oil itself may be used on skin, hair, or cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the last statement above that applies of Kate Blanc&#x27;s 100% pure Jojoba Oil. It is organic, contains no preservatives  and absorbs on the area you are treating instantly - no sense of grease of oily residue. Though the oil can be used for treating dry hair (split ends, etc), it can also be used on the face and neck as a moisturizer, on dry parched hands (excellent for aging hands) and as a softener for cuticles - using it makes cuticle care easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all the &#x60;moisturizers on the market these days,  if you are frustrated with lack of results, try this Jojoba Oil - it softens naturally and leaves face, neck, hands, foot heels and where ever you have dry skin problems faster that anything you&#x27;ve ever tired. An excellent product - even for actinic keratoses! Grady Harp, February 15</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know anything about jojoba oil until I received this. I search the internet for ways to use this oil. I was really surprised at how many different things you can do with this oil. You can use it from head to toe. I have used this for few weeks now and I put it in my night cream for added moisturizer. It seems to have improved my dry patches that I have had on my face. I haven&#x27;t had no break outs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also used it as a makeup remover, after shower moisturizer, shave prepper, hair treatment and dry cuticle treatment. I would recommend this jojoba oil. Sample received for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product to help strengthen my nails without having to take pills. Jojoba oil does the trick! Ijust apply a drop from the pipette to my nail and massage it in and the oils bond with the nail to make them harder and more durable. It&#x27;s good for so many things, but that is what sold me. It also doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell.</li>
            <li> I have dry, somewhat sensitive skin (I basically need a natural product or my skin reacts in some negative way!), so I am cautious about what I apply to my skin.  Having dry skin, I like applying some sort of oil to my face, but I do not want it to be greasy.  The jojoba oil is surprisingly light and works well under makeup.  Note:  After applying about 2 drops (you do not need a lot), allow it to absorb into your skin for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Nice one. Well made and had no side effects. Nice bottle, bubble wrapped nicely. A sample was sent for review purposes.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic! It really does work and the color is spot on. I have found other jojoba oils even though they have the same claim to be really dark in color which I think isn&#x27;t authentic. This one is definitely great and works as a wonderful easy moisturizer. I know they say to not apply directly to the skin/face but I do it occasionally because of my dry patches (combo skin). I also mix a bit in with my regular moisturizer and it works great! Overall a must have for any household really. It is a great multi-purpose product! I would recommend it. *I received this product complimentary in return for my honest review*</li>
            <li> I use Jojoba Oil as a facial, and body moisturizer and in addition, for my dry scalp and hair condition. Kate Blanc Organic Jojoba Oil is 100% pure and natural and it soothes and heals all my dry skin prone areas - my elbows, legs, knees, and the heels of my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natural pure and organic plant extract oils are important for both skin and hair care, they are nourishing agents as opposed to commercial chemical based products.  The main difference is that commercial chemical products will temporarily mask the negative symptom conditions at best, but do nothing to repair the damage. At worst, the chemicals in commercial products sometimes lead to eventual skin irritations. By using 100% pure and organic plant extracts such as Kate Blanc Organic Jojoba Oil, this will nourish and repair skin conditions and will not irritate skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This organic and pure Jojoba Oil from Kate Blanc comes in a dark amber color bottle to help protect the oils from the damage of light and it has an eyedropper applicator to carefully measure out the necessary drops. It is safe for everyday use due to the natural nourishing properties contained in the jojoba oil that our skin and hair require. The oil is very light with a clear golden yellow color, and without any scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it after my shower while my body is still damp, it does NOT leave any greasy, oily, sticky, or slippery residue, it absorbs immediately and I am able to dress directly after my application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For facial skin care, it safely removes cosmetic make up before a thorough cleansing, and then I re-apply jojoba oil as moisturizer after facial serum applications. The tiniest amount, only a drop or two is necessary for facial and neck coverage or else the oil will leave a shine, however, it instantly absorbs into my dry skin. In the evenings, I use the jojoba oil for my facial skin moisturizer, and I use it on my eyelashes to keep them soft, nourished and thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my favorite use for Jojoba Oil is on my dry scalp and dry hair. I have coarse-textured, thick hair almost eight inches past shoulder length. Every month I have a chemical color process to cover my oncoming grey hair, therefore twice a month I use jojoba as a pre-wash conditioner. I comb out my hair and massage 2 tablespoons of jojoba into my scalp and hair, while my hair is still dry; I do NOT have wet hair for this pre-wash and deep conditioning application. Then I use a wide toothcomb to distribute the oil through to the ends, let it soak into my scalp and hair for a few hours before I shampoo the oil out of my hair. The jojoba oil revitalizes the dry and dull condition of my hair; it eliminates the dry straw look, and adds both moisture and body. When I don’t have time to pre-condition, I use a few drops of jojoba oil and mix it into a small amount of shampoo in my hand, and/or my rinse out conditioner. Jojoba rinses out easily I do NOT have a problem with any greasy residue and it works to detangle hair, no mats or knots to comb through. My result is soft and manageable hair that is easy to control, no heavy weighed down feeling, and instead I receive some additional soft volume. Sometimes I use a few extra drops to help smooth over the lower frizzy ends, for a sleek and finished appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Kate Blanc Organic Jojoba Oil works effectively as a natural moisturizer for my skin, scalp and hair, and sometimes I combine the Jojoba with my other pure and natural oils for a slightly different change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who are new to different essential oils, I have provided a short summary on the effectiveness, and different uses for Kate Blanc 100% pure and natural Jojoba Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jojoba oil is from the jojoba bush, an evergreen plant indigenous to the hot desert areas states of Arizona, New Mexico and California.

            <li> This is a great size bottle of jojoba oil.  I use this in so many ways. I think it great that it comes with the dropper, as this is something I need when I use jojoba.  I love to add a few drops to my hair.  I just drop 3-4 drops into my hands after my shower, rub my hands together, and scrunch my hair starting at the tips and working to the top. It is great for your skin as well.  Just run a few drops into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use them for my bath fizz balls.  I add in a 5-10 drops as I make my fizzes to add to my bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this discounted/free in exchange for my review.</li>
            <li> Been using the oil for a bit and see no big difference on my skin and cuticles.  I have used it a few times on my hair and I dont like how it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> I have recently began to purchase organic oils, after reading up on all the great things that you can use them for.  Jojoba Oil is one of my favorites, as there are so many uses for this oil, such as:&lt;br /&gt;Hair Treatment - it is great for curing split ends&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin Treatment - it is a great moisturizer, and absorbs very quickly without leaving your face feeling greasy, and it smells wonderful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Facial Treatment - great for anti aging and reducing wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nail Treatment - great for use on your cuticles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Kate Blanc Cosmetics Jojoba Oil, which comes in a nice sized 2oz bottle in a few ways.  I put it on my cuticles, and it has made a huge difference, this is keeping my cuticles looking great.  I also add a little bit to my moisturizers each morning and night, and it makes my skin feel and look great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you are looking for a great organic oil, that has multiples uses, look no further, this is one of the best!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for free to review and and share my unbiased opinion, I am not affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon and enjoys sharing my experiences with others so that they can make an informative buying decision.</li>
            <li> Jojoba oil is produced from the seeds of the Jojoba plant (Simmondsia chinensis) a small shrub that is native to desert regions of Mexico, and the American Southwest. The oil is actually more like a liquid wax. Its great for hair and skin and also your nails.&lt;br /&gt;It nourishes and makes the skin glow.&lt;br /&gt;It prevents the signs of aging and and eliminates scars. Its not greasy and so absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the dropper cover of this oil which makes it very easy to use and apply this product without creating a mess.&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky to get this product under promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
            <li> I have used products containing jojoba oil, but this is my first time using just jojoba oil directly. I do use a lot of other oils including Argan oil, rosehip oil and coconut oil. I frequently make my own bath and beauty products as well as test new (to me) products. I received a sample of this jojoba oil to review. I find it is a very thin textured, light oil that absorbs quickly. I just put some on my hands before typing this review and it is already absorbed--just leaving soft skin and cuticles.  I am surprised my hands don&#x27;t even feel greasy (they usually do for a little while after applying a hand cream). I personally don&#x27;t are for most hand creams because they are too perfumed and the perform gets on everything I touch. I tend to use a little coconut oil when my hands get dry, but now I am likely to start with couple drops of Jojoba then the coconut as a barrier layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little Jojoba also absorbs into the dry ends of my fine hair. It seems there is another oil I can use as a leave-in conditioner (along with Argan, and coconut oil). No wonder many of my favorite hair products contain Jojoba! Jojoba is a popular carrier oil to use with essential oils. I think I will try it in my DIY peppermint foot scrub as I like what it does for the cuticles in my hands. It is a good option when you want a light, easily absorbed oil. It might be too light for a massage, but would be a good carrier for facial serums, cuticle treatments, hair treatments, etc. Jojoba is now one of my staples for my DIY skin care and bath ingredient pantry!</li>
            <li> I use a lot of essential oils and this particular Jojoba Oil is perfection for mixing my oils and even just from the bottle!!  The amber colored bottle comes with a dropper so you don&#x27;t waste any! You really only need a small amount!&lt;br /&gt;This Jojoba oil absorbs quickly and isn&#x27;t sticky or greasy feeling. It has done amazing things for my cuticles. I have such dry cuticles that I bite them, that makes them worse!! My cuticles are healed, soft and with no more cracking and peeling. WOW!!&lt;br /&gt;On my heels before bed I apply a couple of drops,massage in and put on socks, the next morning SOFT heels!!&lt;br /&gt;AWESOME product!! Large Bottle!! Grab it when it comes back in stock!</li>
            <li> Jojoba oil is an ingredient commonly mentioned in many beauty magazines, and it’s with good reason–it’s found in many beauty products from shampoos to moisturizers. This bottle is filled with the pure oil itself, and can be used as a moisturizer for both the face and the hair. Having used this for a month now, I must say it’s a fantastic natural moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a variety of oils out there that also have moisturizing properties, including argan oil and rosehip oil, but Jojoba oil tends to be a bit cheaper than those two. Another thing I really like about this is the fact that it has a very light nutty odor–you can barely detect it. I put this on after a warm shower and applying a toner and wake up the next day with extremely soft skin–I love it! This bottle specifically may not look like much, but since you don’t use much per application, one of these should be able to easily last 2+ months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this is a great starting choice for anyone looking for a natural alternative moisturizer and want to give the oils a try. It’s one of the most budget friendly choices, and it really does work. For those who feel weird about putting oils on their face/body, they actually get absorbed by your body rather quickly and I haven’t experienced any breakouts whatsoever. If anything, they’ve helped my acne due to how nourishing it is for the skin. Just make sure to apply the oil sparingly–you really don’t need that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product for review, and I hope that it’s been helpful for you! Feel free to leave any questions/comments below and I’ll do my best to respond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;The Good&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;+ Works fantastically as a moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;+ Very light scent&lt;br /&gt;+ Great value&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;The Bad&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;- None!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/5</li>
            <li> Free product provided for evaluation and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good quality of Jojoba oil as best I can tell.  It certainly looks, smells, and absorbs like jojoba oil as I know it. It doesn&#x27;t have much of a taste. It&#x27;s a yellowish or golden colored, transparent oil, and a little bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great as a carrier oil for fragrance and this particular version doesn&#x27;t add anything to the scent.  I like jojoba because it blends well with essential oils, lasts a long time and doesn&#x27;t go rancid, ruining my fragrance creations.  It&#x27;s great for the skin and hair too.  I love to put scented oil in my hair while it is still damp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in an amber bottle with an eyedropper to dispense it with.  The dropper could work better, the one I got has a habit of dripping a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good oil.  I can easily recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this now for a little over a week. I have focused using this on my hair since it needs all the help it can get. I take this and add a few drops into my favorite conditioner and apply it to my hair. I let it sit on my hair for a good 10 minutes or so before washing out. I have done this every other day, and I am already seeing some results. My hair is becoming easier to manage, and not so dull looking. I color my hair regularly, so it can look a little damaged. This new routine seems to be helping my hair out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used this on my skin, and it makes a nice massage oil. Glides smoothly on the skin, provides a nice slip, and is beneficial as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely a oil I will be keeping in my hair care routine! I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing the results after long term use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> Jojoba oil is the perfect carrier for other things. It should be clear and have almost no odor. It should rub on easily and absorb reasonably well into your skin. This Jojoba is exactly all that. It is absolutely perfect for essential oils to create your own aromatherapy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is amber to prevent the oil from oxidizing and going rancid. The eyedropper is a nice addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A free sample was provided for review.</li>
            <li> Great product and value. I am using this as a beard grooming product. Instead of spending a lot of money on &amp;#34;beard oil&amp;#34;, I would recommend buying whatever oils you want seperately and making something yourself. It will cost about the same (or less) and you will have a lot more. I looked at one beard oil in the mall that was over forty dollars for an ounce, which to me is way overpriced. Anyway, this product is a solid purchase and came quickly. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love essential oils and was excited when I was offered to review this Kate Blanco Jojoba oil to give my honest and unbiased opinion.  I have used Jojoba oil in the past for my dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started researching on ways to use the jojoba oil.  The one thing that I found that I was interested in was using it on hand and nails.  My nails have always been very brittle and break easily.  I would love to have long nails but I have not been successful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this oil last week and can already tell a difference in my nails.  They are not as brittle as they were.  Now they have not grown a lot but it has only been a week.  Since they are not as brittle ,I think they will grow nicely.  I will try to update after about a month to see how long they have grown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also good to put on the ends of your hair if you have dry brittle hair.  There are a lot of uses for Jojoba oil I.the internet&lt;br /&gt;  Just search it up and I am sure you will find a way to use this great oil.</li>
            <li> Jojoba oil has a lot of potential uses, but I&#x27;ve always preferred it for the hair, so that&#x27;s how I used this. I tried two different types of application and this performed admirably in both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I used this just as a hair oil. The night before, I shampooed, used conditioner, and used detangling spray (as always). I let my hair air dry. Then, in the morning, I ran a bit of this through my hair and used a brush to evenly distribute it. (I have thick, waist-length hair, but even so, it only takes a few drops.) It helps to put a few drops in your palms and rub them together, then pat through your hair. This prevents making any hair stick together and gives you a nice shine without an oily or greasy look. (Or at least, that&#x27;s what it did for me.) I also think I got a little more manageability/less frizz when I was using this. Used this way, the oil will last a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, I used this as a deep conditioner. If you are going to do this, you will go through the oil quickly (especially if you have long hair). However, it really works. What I did here was saturate my dry hair with jojoba oil, then put my hair under a processing cap for 30 minutes. After that I shampooed to get the oil out (had to shampoo twice), conditioned as usual, and used a detangling spray. This used more than 1/2 the bottle (my hair is long and dry, so it really soaked up the oil), but my hair was in amazing shape the next day -- so soft and smooth and manageable. If you have shorter hair, you probably won&#x27;t need as much oil. I like this as an alternative to coconut oil for deep conditioning, though, because the jojoba oil is liquid at room temperature so it is easier to distribute through my hair (coconut oil, meanwhile, is solid at room temperature and has to be melted first).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, in sum, this is a great deep conditioner and also a good general-purpose hair oil. It comes in a dark brown bottle to prevent degradation from light exposure. It had an appropriate safety seal and did not open or leak during shipping. The eye dropper is convenient for distributing a few drops when using as a hair oil. (For deep conditioning, I just poured out of the bottle onto my hair.) This is of similar viscosity to other hair oils that are liquid at room temperature (avocado, argan) and is light yellow in color. I didn&#x27;t notice much in the way of a scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the seller for evaluation purposes.ropriate safety seal and did not open or leak during shipping.

            <li> Looking forward to using this</li>
            <li> I ordered this and it is not 100% pure organic Jojaba oil.  The product I received came sealed in the same bottle that is shown in the picture but it is clear.  Higher grade organic Jojaba is golden and clear in color.  I will be returning and ordering from someone else.</li>
            <li> I used this Jojoba Oil to make a whipped body butter for my daughter. I don&#x27;t like using anything with chemicals on my kids, so I try to get everything as organic as possible. I was really pleased with the consistency of the oil. It wasn&#x27;t overly greasy or even overly dry. It was hydrating enough to make her skin really soft without leaving behind an awkward greasy feeling. I mixed it with Shea Butter and some lavender essential oil. They all blended together soooo creamy! I am really impressed with how lovely it blends into the Shea. This is exactly what I was looking for. Highly pleased. (I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.)</li>
            <li> I use the convenient dropper to apply the oil along my cuticles to help keep them moisturized. I also put the oil on my feet nightly to keep them moisturized since that they to dry out due to my constant use of sandals. This oil has a very faint scent and makes my feet and hands look and feel much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for 3 days, but so far I like it! I bought it to use with essential oils as a face serum! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I had never heard of using Jojoba oil for hair, skin, and nails, but I knew that you could find this amazing super moisturizing oil in a lot of hair and skincare products, so I was thrilled to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it arrived I used it in my hair that night. You don&#x27;t need a lot, a little goes a long way, so I squeezed 3-4 drops out (I have long mid-back length hair) and smoothed though the base of my head down, focusing on the tips especially where I have lots of dry, split ends. I have super dry hair and it&#x27;s even worse this time of year, so I loved that this really smoothed my hair out and made it noticeable softer and smoother. In fact, my husband even noticed and commented on how soft my hair felt and that it smelled good too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied my this Jojoba Oil to my hair at night before bed, but it worked great as a styling/smoothing cream when you&#x27;re styling your hair for the day.&lt;br /&gt;After a week or so of using this on my hair every other day, it feels really soft and looks so much more moisturized. My split ends have also been quite a bit less noticeable too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also use this fabulous oil as a face or skin moisturizer too. I loved that even though its an oil, it still feels really lightweight on the skin. My face soaked it up pretty quickly and I was left with no oily residue (my skin is naturally dry too). Again, you only need about 1-2 drops for your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have dry, rough cuticles and have been really neglecting them lately, so I was excited to apply this oil to make them softer, smoother, and overall healthier. I applied about every other day and my nails and the cuticles are already looking much better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have absolutely loved using my Jojoba Oil from Kate Blanc cosmetics. I&#x27;m thrilled that there are so many wonderful uses for it, and I love how incredibly moisturizing and nourishing it is for skin and hair. A little goes a long way so you can expect this bottle to last you a really long time too!</li>
