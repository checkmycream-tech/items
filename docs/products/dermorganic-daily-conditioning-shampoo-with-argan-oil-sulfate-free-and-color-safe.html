            <li>I am very happy with this shampoo and let me assure you all I have used them ALL!!!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the greatest shampoo.</li>
            <li>Great Product!!</li>
            <li>Love it!!!</li>

            <li>Smells good too!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for that!</li>
            <li>Its good too, but not as wonderful as the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Smells great, lathers and cleanses.</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re looking for great organic hair care products, then DermOrganics isn&#x27;t the answer.</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I am happy with it.</li>
            <li>This is a great shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Great shampoo</li>
            <li>Works great</li>
            <li>I am so happy that I found it.</li>
            <li>Lol</li>
            <li>Otherwise product is great.</li>
            <li>This is a great shampoo, undeniably.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it was great..</li>
            <li>Good results, good price and lots!  </li>
            <li>I love this!!</li>
            <li>Amazing!  </li>
            <li>I found out that almost all shampoos have some kind of sulfates!</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s prices for these products are excellent and this shampoo is a top quality product.  </li>
            <li>It no longer is the silky-smooth, pleasantly scented conditioning shampoo I&#x27;ve loved for 2 years running.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think just a bit more oil could have been added, but is still a very  good shampoo.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful sulfate free conditioning shampoo.</li>
            <li>The one drawback is the lack of a good scent,</li>
            <li>It leaves the hair gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>and it had a good reputation.</li>
            <li>Undamaged and in good condition.</li>
            <li>I was delighted to find it cleans my hair</li>
            <li>This is the best shamoo I have ever used and its sulfate free.</li>
            <li>I found this with good reviews and decided to try it.</li>
            <li>So if you are looking for a good quality shampoo</li>
            <li>to ruin a good product and kill your customer goodwill.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve thought about hair extensions, Minoxidil and done the keratin-packed conditioners (good up to a point</li>
            <li>I believe it is a good buy for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this Shampoo/ cleanser its great on my hair</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Great shampoo and price for sulfate free!</li>
            <li>Great lather for a sulfate free shampoo!</li>
            <li>Happy with the product :)</li>
            <li>The shampoo lathers nicely and has a good smell too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: light, good scent, thoroughly cleans and thoroughly washes out, moisturizing but still cleans!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Simply LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did!  </li>
            <li>The first lather is not too impressive.  </li>
            <li>So glad I found it!</li>
            <li>Love Amazon Prime!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo!</li>
            <li>Even when I go to the salon, I bring my own shampoo and conditioner because it is sooooo much better than what they use!</li>
            <li>its amazing EXCEPT</li>
            <li>I looked up \\&quot;sulfate free shampoo\\&quot; on Amazon and it with this Conditioner has been great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>This is one of those products that is amazing, but it depends on the person.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair look amazing.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is amazing ...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>DermOrganic does have a nice lather but thats it.</li>
            <li>ive tried the Wen, liked it, but too costly.</li>
            <li>I really liked this shampoo, I had been using Pantene for a while</li>
            <li>Nice cleansing with hair hydration as the aftermath.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is that kind to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I went to a Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply store thinking I&#x27;d buy a nice sized plastic bottle to put the shampoo in.</li>
            <li>I went to a Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply store thinking I&#x27;d buy a nice sized plastic bottle to put the shampoo in.</li>
            <li>Lathers nicely without using a lot.</li>
            <li>The smell is very nice and light and my hair feels like silk.</li>
            <li>i ordered this, loved that it came in such a great sized bottle for a great price.</li>
            <li>Excellent value for such a large bottle and great service too!</li>
            <li>Maybe it isn&#x27;t a good fit.</li>
            <li>Also, I love the way it feels and how nicely it suds up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s by far one of the best shampoo&#x27;s i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Safe, affordable and effective.</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing product I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>THE VERY FINE POWDERY FLAKES</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re happy with DermOrganic products because of your personal results from using them, that&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Love it very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I saw this was a new product and had very good reviews</li>
            <li>Shampoo is very light weight.  </li>
            <li>the sulfate free formulation is good for my baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Love the way this shampoo leaves my hair so nourished and manageable.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel stripped like most sulfate shampoos do for me.</li>
            <li>I had been using Wen for about 5 months and thought I would switch to something more affordable.</li>
            <li>Overall - great product!</li>
            <li>Although I have written to the product manufacturer about this product which I USED TO LOVE, and no longer do -</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I wish it was better</li>
            <li>It is not as moisturizing as Wen and leaves my hair feeling more</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I would really love this conditioning shampoo-</li>
            <li>My hair got really damaged over the years and this shampoo did a great job of repairing the ends and adding strength and shine.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>And no it doesn&#x27;t lather as much as most, but it&#x27;s not supposed to having no sulfates in it.</li>
            <li>Fabulous product !</li>
            <li>It is not too flowery, like so many shampoos are, but has a more earthy smell.  </li>
            <li>Rinse that out and add one more pump</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay shampoo.</li>
            <li>love it love</li>
            <li>I love it ...</li>
            <li>I love the smell, and I love not having puffy eyes after I use it.</li>
            <li>OKAy, if you have oily hair or scalp, this may not be your choice.  </li>
            <li>My hair is more manageble.</li>
            <li>a week after I&#x27;ve applied the color- instead of a healthy and youthful appearance.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>We really love this product.</li>
            <li>This product is absolutely fabulous!</li>
            <li>I am using the argan oil, for so many years..</li>
            <li>its ok nothing permanent.</li>
            <li>Love the smell, lathers well, will continue to use.</li>
            <li>The reason I bought this shampoo is because I love the leave in Argan oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe with more time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Again, I&#x27;m going to give this more time and will update if things change.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Try it; you will definetley love it.  </li>
            <li>ENJOY!</li>
            <li>We will be sure to reorder it.</li>
            <li>Wish it had more conditioner.  </li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this.</li>
            <li>Now, after having used the shampoo for over a month, I have to say, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I do, however, love the conditioner and oil treatment in this line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for two years now and still love it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sulfate free!</li>
            <li>All GLUTEN FREE too!</li>
            <li>It really wasn&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li>Love what it does for my hair.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and my scalp doesnt feel any better......</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>try out this product and 99.5% of you will love it.</li>
            <li>I look forward to trying more products soon.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo, although it arrived with a non working pump.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I used to LOVE LOVE LOVE this shampoo, despite the faulty pump.</li>
            <li>It works, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Solution: start a cut at the top of the bottle with a saw.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using the bottle this way for many weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much better to spend a couple of bucks for a replacement pump mechanism than hassle with trying to get a seller to ship me</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased that it&#x27;s a dual purpose</li>
            <li>Its feels very rich and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Shampoo comes out clean and shiny, and kind of looks like lotion.</li>
            <li>My husband laughed at me raving about it so much that he thought I should go work for the company!  </li>
            <li>I received two huge bottles and love the product so it turned out better for me, but just understand what you are purchasing is not as pictured here.</li>
            <li>so I can check it as soon as I get it, and return it more easily that way.</li>
            <li>This is the best shampoo for dry hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair has never felt better, been softer, more manageable, smooth, silkier or healthier.</li>
            <li>It is best for very dry hair, and a non oily scalp.</li>
            <li>Much better for your hair as it is sulfate free...</li>
            <li>Smells great and leaves your hair sooo soft.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much that I&#x27;m about to order another bottle.</li>
            <li>- THAT is the original and better formula.</li>
            <li>it is the most creamy, rich and soothing shampoo on the market.</li>
            <li>It is easily damaged by sun, wind, salt water or pool water.  </li>
            <li>It does clean, but mostly conditions.</li>
            <li>Moms know how nice it is to smell clean baby or children&#x27;s hair, well, this will really make you smell it,its just a nice clean unperfumed smell.  </li>
            <li>I just put keratin in my hair and was looking for a new shampoo and conditioner to keep the keratin good, this did the job.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone with fine hair like mine.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is fine.  </li>
            <li>My hair is wavy and fine</li>
            <li>but I DON&#x27;T recommend for fine hair.  </li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t suds for me, which is fine since lather is not indicative of cleansing ability.</li>
            <li>Really helps keep it healthy!</li>
            <li>I wanted a product to help my dry hair and this isn&#x27;t as good as I was hoping it would be!</li>
            <li>no sulfate and works great and smells terrific.  </li>
            <li>I wrote because this was a great product that I have been using for several years</li>
            <li>My hair dresser said it&#x27;s no doubt because I am using sulfate free products.</li>
            <li>WITH THE SULFATE FREE</li>
            <li>The reason I bought this is because my wife had dermatitis and this was sulfate free</li>
            <li>I use Dermorganics argan oil, so when I was searching for a sulfate free shampoo and saw this one I thought I would give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try it because it is sulfate free.</li>
            <li>for the lather, I honestly think it is too much.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s also free of organic ingredients.  </li>
            <li>This product is great for your hair especially if colored.</li>
            <li>The product feels very watery and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel nice after shampooing.</li>
            <li>I rarely stick with a hair care regimen through more than two bottles - this is the exception.</li>
            <li>I always use sulfate free</li>
            <li>I called the company to ask if the formula had been changed, and they confirmed that it had.  </li>
            <li>I have finally found a shampoo that works great on curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Find a jar-top that will fit over the bottle remnant so as to protect the shampoo from water.</li>
            <li>It is gently but effective and I have used it on permed and color treated hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this because it&#x27;s labeled sulfate free shampoo.  </li>
            <li>You must be a competitor, quite honestly I don&#x27;t care if it actually is not organic because the product works great and my hair has improved so much since I started using it.  </li>
            <li>This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve used in a long time and it stopped my scalp itch the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>It smells right, it suds right up, it seems to work, but eww, the texture is kind of off</li>
            <li>I do not know if the manufacturer changed the formula or if the seller added some cheap soap in to the original product.</li>
            <li>It does clean my hair, but not like you would expect from sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li>this was my first dermorganic purchase, and I love the way it makes my hair feel and has a light neutral scent that can be used by men or women.</li>
            <li>After doing much research and reading reviews, I tried this brand and loved it at first.</li>
            <li>And, of course, it does foam which shame on me for not being more aware</li>
            <li>It is super gentle and does not over-strip, but it gets them nice and clean without a greasy residue.</li>
            <li>Clean lasts for days.</li>
            <li>I have an abundant and coarse hair so, using this shampoo makes my hair more voluminous and have reduced itching of the scalp.</li>
            <li>used it along with the conditioner, my hair was tangle and brittle, but it felt clean.</li>
            <li>But this does leave the hair clean.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling clean and silky.</li>
            <li>A good quality product that lasts much longer than a cheaper shampoo because you don&#x27;t need to use as much.</li>
            <li>use this one when I have a special night ahead of me.</li>
            <li>I quit using their conditioner and serum - they are nothing special.</li>
            <li>I eyeballed one that looked the right size, bought it, brought it home, and HOORAY!</li>
            <li>I eyeballed one that looked the right size, bought it, brought it home, and HOORAY!</li>
            <li>This shampoo is great for fine hair-it doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li>The smell is bright and crisp not heavy or perfumy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I&#x27;ve used it on my kids several times, and once I got over thinking their hair smelled like I&#x27;d washed it in a sink at the airport, I had to admit it was pretty great.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t pay full price</li>
            <li>So if you want to try all 3, buy a sample (i think 1 oz each) kit vs full size one.</li>
            <li>But usually a good occasional shake-and-stir resolves the problem.</li>
            <li>THIS SHAMPOO ALSO LATHERS UP UNLIKE MOST OTHER SULFATE FREE TYPES, AND HAS A NICE AROMA TOO.</li>
            <li>The lady that does my hair commented that I really needed to have a sulfate free shampoo because the shampoos I had been fine in drugstores were damaging my hair.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo leaves my hair feeling fresh and clean and weightless.  </li>
            <li>This seller was quick and efficient</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Maybe one day i will get rich enough to just have my own stuff made to cater to my needs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super gentle and makes my hair feel moisturized, smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li>best way I can describe the new consistency is to say it&#x27;s like a slightly liquefied styrofoam; it doesn&#x27;t flow or pour.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this great shampoo by DermOrganic would be great on any hair but for my particularly difficult (fine/thin/processed/aging) hair, this shampoo is nothing short of a revelation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much better to spend a couple of bucks for a replacement pump mechanism than hassle with trying to get a seller to ship me a new one.</li>
            <li>So far what I like most about this is that it is affordable, cleans hair well and rinses out quickly, doesn’t have a overpowering perfume fragrance and is sulfate-free.  </li>
            <li>I love my Amika mask, which is amazing and addictive - we will have to see if I can give it up to try a new product.     </li>
            <li>All of the dermorganic products are AMAZING on my hair and I will never go back to styling my hair without using Moroccan Argan Oil.  </li>
            <li>this sulfate free shampoo lathers up very well...</li>
            <li>So if you, like me, were using this product as a gentle alternative to the 99% of available shampoos that have CAPB - be forewarned.  </li>
            <li>Simply put, the shampoo smells nice and cleans well.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo it makes my beard feel soft and helps it behave after combing.  </li>
            <li>If you have ever wanted to try Wen, but didn&#x27;t want to spend that much money to try something, I suggest Dermorganic shampoo, better price and much richer.</li>
            <li>For the rest of us who love the old formula - have you found any replacements???</li>
            <li>Love the product&#x27;s natural and organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>Combined with our soft water, it really makes my hair feel nice and makes tons of bubbles.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so worth</li>
            <li>I ended up shelling out for Moroccan Oil because it offers more moisture for my hair, but if this works for you</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say its worth about that price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for several years and really liked it.  </li>
            <li>It kept my hair in amazing condition, it retained my beautiful color and overall, was a dream on my thick and silky hair.</li>
            <li>It does not clean as well as the other shampoos with sulfate, but it is perfect to keep my super long curls nourished and nice!</li>
            <li>profusely, it is rich and gentle, when you are rinsing (even before the conditioner)</li>
            <li>This is sulfate free, my main reason for purchasing.</li>
            <li>favorite part about this product is that after I dry my hair feels light.</li>
            <li>Luckily I found the trial sized package of this at Marshalls and fell in love, had to go back to Marshalls and buy the liter.  </li>
            <li>It IS free of paraben free and free of other \\&quot;bad\\&quot; ingredients</li>
            <li>Great on my color treated hair, especially because I use the organic color dye and this shampoo definitely gives me longer life to the coloring job</li>
            <li>It has made my hair soft, strong, and combined with the leave-in treatment - changed my life and erased plenty of frustration from my life.</li>
            <li>So far so good; I have only used it twice.  </li>
            <li>It is very gentle to the hair, it leaves the hair silky and nourished.</li>
            <li>Consumers need to be aware that just because the brand name \\&quot;DermOrganic\\&quot; includes word organic, DermOrganic products do not include any organic ingredients whatsoever.</li>
            <li>For information on understanding organic content in products, consumers should be aware of the FDA requirements for labeling products as organic.</li>
            <li>I also want to point out that this is completely GLUTEN FREE.</li>
            <li>Within a couple of weeks, my hair was so much softer and healthier looking!</li>
            <li>I saw someone mention that they bought some at TJ Maxx and the first ingredient is NOT aloe but water</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot, dermorganic!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through so many different brands/bottles of shampoo over the years</li>
            <li>The natural sulfate free ingredients are an added bonus.</li>
            <li>I use consistently &amp; will never use another shampoo again</li>
            <li>First thing is that its not organic.</li>
            <li>Soft, shiny and smooth.  </li>
            <li>a value, thanks!</li>
            <li>You might like all, or like me - just their stellar shampoo.</li>
            <li>i purchased it from a local store thinking it would prove better for my hair and scalp....</li>
            <li>Have only been able to review this shampoo after using for a week.</li>
            <li>I decided to look up on others like American Crew except more Organic.</li>
            <li>But I found they sell the actual pump top thing for a couple of bucks.</li>
            <li>But I found they sell the actual pump top thing for a couple of bucks.</li>
            <li>The shampoo itself lathers great, its amazing to me how it moisturizes your skin, but because of my type of skin it moisturizes and then clogs my pores and in a few days i have red bumps all over my face on my back and sometimes chest.</li>
            <li>After using this for a few weeks, my hair is great, it doesn&#x27;t get as oily and it is shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li>It has definitely been good for my hair that has recently been keratin treated.</li>
            <li>Only good for a short trip</li>
            <li>Dermorganics makes my hair way soft and smooth and just like it&#x27;s is REALLY</li>
            <li>so just Gona stick with my old tried and true method.</li>
            <li>Rather than creating their own formula, I think they may have simply bought bulk quantities Nexxus Therappe, and mixed in a good amount of electro-statically charged water, because this shampoo makes for a frizzy mess.  </li>
            <li>, it will dry your hands out- be sure to use lotion.</li>
            <li>(Note: because it was dry or maybe it was just able to do that).</li>
            <li>, their hair smells much better after it is dry!</li>
            <li>hair has a keratin treatment, and is pretty decent.</li>
            <li>Plus it comes in a large bottle with a pump that makes it so much easier to dispense.</li>
            <li>Other sulfate free shampoos I&#x27;ve used have not been so successful and a lot more expensive.</li>
            <li>This is a reasonably priced shampoo.  </li>
            <li>and she didn&#x27;t like the product as much, though.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell too.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that her hair has been very tangley since using it.</li>
            <li>I have lots of curly hair, which is usually very shiny and doesn&#x27;t require a lot of conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I am an African American woman and I have really soft natural hair and this product work great for me</li>
            <li>it cleans it very well</li>
            <li>Shaking doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>it really seems to take the chlorine out and soften my hair.</li>
            <li>that didn&#x27;t foam and was gentle on my hair.  </li>
            <li>It really just tangles and tangles and strips my hair.  </li>
            <li>Its gentle yet nourishing.</li>
            <li>I feel like my hair gets really tangly when I use it.  </li>
            <li>Very misleading product.</li>
            <li>and I have to say, I don&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li>Use the shampoo and then buy a regular, cheap sulfate-free conditioner at Target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is a lot softer and smoother and doesn&#x27;t frizz as much as it used to.  </li>
            <li>and I find five pumps works really well.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend it if you can find it for a cheap price.</li>
            <li>Is not as organic as it wants to appear.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It stills provides a nice lather without all the harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell very good, and it is very thin.</li>
            <li>but i love the feel of this product, love the smell, and obviously how little i have to use!</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s okay shampoo, but</li>
            <li>Other than that, its an okay shampoo.</li>
            <li>Go rub mint leaves in your hair to clean it if you need totally organic.</li>
            <li>We all have sensitive skin with being redheads and it is very gentle on skin</li>
            <li>If you turn the bottle upside down, the shampoo plops to the top of the bottle like a solid object, leaving the bottom of the bottle clean with no shampoo residue visible.</li>
            <li>The product is not thick; it&#x27;s actually really runny.</li>
            <li>After one month of using the product, my hair was super soft, drying time was cut down by HALF and my hairdresser said my hair was incredibly strong and more resilient.  </li>
            <li>Now I have to find a new product!</li>
            <li>I have to return the whole bottle of shampoo in order to get a new pump.</li>
            <li>The bottle is HUGE so it lasts a very long time too.</li>
            <li>However, for dry, chemically treated hair, it is fabulous.</li>
            <li>But my latest bottle smelled peculiar and had separated into a watery component and an oddly grainy component.</li>
            <li>I can tell in one shot if a product is meh, decent or A-Ok.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>High five.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The shampoo keeps my hair just as clean for just as long as sulfate shampoos.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair silky soft and no frizz!!</li>
            <li>This product works fabulous on my soft, delicate, baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Detangles my fine blonde hair, makes it soft and ultra touchable, not heavy at all.</li>
            <li>I find my hair soft but not as much body texture as I would expect it to be.</li>
            <li>I am so picky when it comes to hair products that I too am surprised that I like it this much.</li>
            <li>Its gentle, I use on my 3 year old and 7 year old and their hair glistens!  </li>
            <li>Not very often I get so excited about a product,  </li>
            <li>This new version?</li>
            <li>Sometimes, the pump doesn&#x27;t even work, even on a new bottle.  </li>
            <li>I have to mail order it as I live in Canada but never would ever think of switching.</li>
            <li>so I had to go shopping for a new shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this to protect my newly colored hair.</li>
            <li>So yesterday I grabbed the new pump bottle - and the pump doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>a new one.but</li>
            <li>My itchy scalp, the main reason for going Sulfrate-Free, is completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(got it from a local brick and mortar store), and know it should be white, smooth, and creamy when it comes out of the pump.</li>
            <li>/&gt;My keratin treatments last nicely, and I like the way this shampoo isn&#x27;t harsh on my hair.</li>
            <li>To be fair, I have long, dry, colored hair, and I&#x27;m somewhat long in the tooth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it wouldn&#x27;t be as bad if you have thick or very healthy hair, but for fine dryer hair you&#x27;ll certainly need to follow up with a moisture treatment of some sort.</li>
            <li>(I do need conditioner DermOrganic Mask) and it is very soft and shinny.  </li>
            <li>I am going to stock up on the old where I can find it!</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>My first reaction when opening this shampoo was total revulsion by the scent.</li>
            <li>But it smells exactly like the low-grade soap you get from any public washroom.</li>
            <li>it was my first expensive shampoo and it never fails to amaze me that through daily blow drying and straightening I&#x27;ve still got soft and healthy hair!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sensitive to cocamidopropyl betaine (a foaming agent also known as CAPB and other names) and this was one of the few good shampoos on the market that didn&#x27;t contain it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of near by shopping, so TJ&#x27;s is where I find new products.</li>
            <li>From the previous sulfate free shampoos  </li>
            <li>it lathers up beautifully although it&#x27;s SULFATE-FREE- and completely cleansed my 3-days&#x27; dirty hair in one shot (out of habit, I lathered, rinsed &amp; repeated</li>
            <li>, however, the last bottle of the shampoo smells so vial that I cannot, with peace of mind, use it any longer since I shampoo in the shower and whatever they did to this formerly great shampoo, or if this particular bottle was spoiled, I am concerned about what it is that makes it stink so badly [which it never used to do] being absorbed into my body..</li>
            <li>I have fine hair which tends to get limp and this perks it up.</li>
            <li>and so I naturally removed the top but was sad to see it clump/dry up so quickly.</li>
            <li>Large bottle will last a while.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that it doesn&#x27;t contain a heap of bad ingredients like most commercial shampoos.</li>
            <li>Since I bought it I can see clear improvement in my hair</li>
            <li>Obviously, I somewhat expected it to be like that, because its sulfate free.</li>
            <li>Never had any allergies or allergic reactions, but developed a rash after using this shampoo</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft, shiny and manageabe.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It does really well at replinishing moisture following hair coloring.</li>
            <li>My hair has never been so soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Did not need any conditioner, my hair is soft and shiny with shampoo alone.  </li>
            <li>If you have acne or sensitive skin, or if youre worried about your pores getting clogged up.</li>
            <li>It did leave my hair soft</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s gentle enough that it doesn&#x27;t strip or change the color of my hair.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo has completely eliminated that problem.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>This is one of the few shampoos on the market that is truly free of sodium laureth sulfate.</li>
            <li>They have sensitive skin, and so far, no issues with that.</li>
            <li>Their hair is soft with no tangles, and no additional conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought being an organic shampoo it wont give much lather as regular one does..</li>
            <li>/&gt;EDITED on March 18, 2013 to add: My latest liter sized pump bottle of this shampoo has been sitting on the shelf for a few weeks until I used up my earlier one.</li>
            <li>It says it has an \\&quot;rich luxurious lather\\&quot; on the back, and it is the total opposite of that.</li>
            <li>If anything ammonium lauryl sulfate is better than the other for the fact that its molecular structure is not small enough to penetrate the skin, but it can still dry your hair out.</li>
            <li>I will absolutely NEVER use another shampoo as long as this one is available.</li>
            <li>Plus the large size bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>so for anyone who has long hair, colour treated, sometimes frizzy like mine , i highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Sadly this shampoo was too drying for me personally, but I love the ingredients and it&#x27;s worth a try if you want to switch to a sulfate-free and paraben-free shampoo.</li>
            <li>Dermorganic saved my hair hands down, and my husband RAVED about being able to run his hands through my hair when he kissed me for the first time after being apart due to his military deployment.</li>
            <li>It is exactly the way my dad&#x27;s german-made shaving cream used to be 30 yrs ago - thick and rich, not only that, the smell is similar.</li>
            <li>The conditioner actually worked for her hair in the first 3 weeks but her hair went back to being the same and she eventually stopped using it.</li>
            <li>I had a problem with the highlighting of my hair at one point and my hairdresser told me that what ever shampoo and conditioner I have been using is the only thing that kept me from having a complete disaster !</li>
            <li>I have very itchy dry scalp and fine thick hair.</li>
            <li>If you use it in the shower and have a hard time bending over, keep a reacher handy in case you drop it--and be careful not to drop it on your foot!</li>
            <li>Both sodium lauryl sulfate or ammonia lauryl sulfate are harsh surfactants in MOST commercial shampoos which can dry your hair and skin out.</li>
            <li>&gt; Only down side is that, it did seemed to fade my color a tad more than the other sulfate color-shampoos.</li>
            <li>I got very efficient and tossed out the old liter bottle, and then it took a few days to use up the shampoo I&#x27;d kept in a small bottle I&#x27;d filled for a trip.</li>
            <li>I am comparing the old left overs I bought a year ago and this product.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and shiny, but I can&#x27;t say &amp;#34;manageable,&amp;#34; because my hair is too short to be unmanageable!</li>
            <li>Sometimes I can find it at Marshall&#x27;s for a few bucks cheaper, but that is a rare occasion.</li>
            <li>As a loyal user of this shampoo for 6+ years, I was shocked to receive my latest shipment.</li>
            <li>, my face doesn&#x27;t break out anymore, I lose less hair, and I only have to wash my hair once every 2-3 days, this is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>To make my hair a little softer I used Neutrogena triple moisture after the wash.&lt;br /&gt;Second time I used it with the mask, and was a little better but still tangles.</li>
            <li>To avoid to much volume, when hair still wet, I rub into my palms a small dot of Lorea&#x27;l Sulfate free color care system (bought at Amazon) and onto the hair (no the scalp), then dry and style it, accordingly</li>
            <li>Anyway, not good shampoo for fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It does not dry out your hair or create build up on your scalp.</li>
            <li>It cleans well, but does not dry the hair out at all.</li>
            <li>first time I used it, it felt a little brittle, but I thought, I give it another try.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It was first recommended to me by my hairdresser some years ago and although it may seem a little pricey</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sulfate free and makes my haircolor last much longer than ordinary shampoos which contain harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>Smells a tad funny and has a weird texture, but it gets my hair clean and my conditioner covers up any herbal smell left over from the shampoo.</li>
            <li>Not sure about shiny and smooth, but it could just be the weather in my city (dry air).</li>
            <li>No amount of shaking fixed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to submit a complaint to the company that distributes the shampoo, Healthy Sexy Beauty, but although Amazon asks you to do just that, they make it literally impossible to do so via their customer service maze.</li>
            <li>And of course the old liter pump bottle was long gone so I couldn&#x27;t reuse the pump from it.</li>
            <li>And of course the old liter pump bottle was long gone so I couldn&#x27;t reuse the pump from it.</li>
            <li>I wash my hair daily and have been using the same bottle for approximately one month or more.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo seems to now weigh my hair down and and make really unmanageable.</li>
            <li>The only thing you have to work is the pump not friendly at first</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and doesn&#x27;t look dry at all.</li>
            <li>However, we can hardly use more tahn half the shampoo in the bottle because everytime the pumping mechanism breaks</li>
            <li>My last salon used the old foil method of highlighting my hair and always left them on too long.  </li>
            <li>I now have a short hairstyle and no dry hair or split ends issues to deal with, and haven&#x27;t conditioned my hair in the year since I had it cut short.</li>
            <li>I have very thick (for a white girl), baby fine hairs.</li>
            <li>The smell gives me a headache right in the center of my forehead and made me feel slightly</li>
            <li>complete the shampoo process with a conditioner in our very dry, Southern California</li>

            <li> Perfect texture.</li>
            <li> this works wonderfully on my curly hair...</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this shampoo and let me assure you all I have used them ALL!!!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the greatest shampoo.</li>
            <li> Great Product!!</li>
            <li> Love it!!!</li>
            <li> love this shampoo!!!</li>
            <li> Cost is great and shipping and packaging were awesome.</li>
            <li> Smells good too!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for that!</li>
            <li> Its good too, but not as wonderful as the shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Smells great, lathers and cleanses.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re looking for great organic hair care products, then DermOrganics isn&#x27;t the answer.</li>
            <li> lol.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Great shampoo</li>
            <li> Works great</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I found it.</li>
            <li> Lol</li>
            <li> Otherwise product is great.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo, undeniably.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it was great..</li>
            <li> Good results, good price and lots!  </li>
            <li> I love this!!</li>
            <li> Amazing!  </li>
            <li> I found out that almost all shampoos have some kind of sulfates!</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s prices for these products are excellent and this shampoo is a top quality product.  </li>
            <li> It no longer is the silky-smooth, pleasantly scented conditioning shampoo I&#x27;ve loved for 2 years running.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think just a bit more oil could have been added, but is still a very  good shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful sulfate free conditioning shampoo.</li>
            <li> The one drawback is the lack of a good scent,</li>
            <li> It leaves the hair gorgeous.  </li>
            <li> and it had a good reputation.</li>
            <li> Undamaged and in good condition.</li>
            <li> I was delighted to find it cleans my hair</li>
            <li> This is the best shamoo I have ever used and its sulfate free.</li>
            <li> I found this with good reviews and decided to try it.</li>
            <li> So if you are looking for a good quality shampoo</li>
            <li> to ruin a good product and kill your customer goodwill.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve thought about hair extensions, Minoxidil and done the keratin-packed conditioners (good up to a point</li>
            <li> I believe it is a good buy for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love this Shampoo/ cleanser its great on my hair</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Great shampoo and price for sulfate free!</li>
            <li> Great lather for a sulfate free shampoo!</li>
            <li> Happy with the product :)</li>
            <li> The shampoo lathers nicely and has a good smell too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: light, good scent, thoroughly cleans and thoroughly washes out, moisturizing but still cleans!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Simply LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did!  </li>
            <li> The first lather is not too impressive.  </li>
            <li> So glad I found it!</li>
            <li> Love Amazon Prime!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!</li>
            <li> Even when I go to the salon, I bring my own shampoo and conditioner because it is sooooo much better than what they use!</li>
            <li> its amazing EXCEPT</li>
            <li> I looked up \\&quot;sulfate free shampoo\\&quot; on Amazon and it with this Conditioner has been great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> This is one of those products that is amazing, but it depends on the person.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair look amazing.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is amazing ...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> DermOrganic does have a nice lather but thats it.</li>
            <li> ive tried the Wen, liked it, but too costly.</li>
            <li> I really liked this shampoo, I had been using Pantene for a while</li>
            <li> Nice cleansing with hair hydration as the aftermath.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is that kind to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I went to a Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply store thinking I&#x27;d buy a nice sized plastic bottle to put the shampoo in.</li>
            <li> I went to a Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply store thinking I&#x27;d buy a nice sized plastic bottle to put the shampoo in.</li>
            <li> Lathers nicely without using a lot.</li>
            <li> The smell is very nice and light and my hair feels like silk.</li>
            <li> i ordered this, loved that it came in such a great sized bottle for a great price.</li>
            <li> Excellent value for such a large bottle and great service too!</li>
            <li> Maybe it isn&#x27;t a good fit.</li>
            <li> Also, I love the way it feels and how nicely it suds up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s by far one of the best shampoo&#x27;s i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Safe, affordable and effective.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing product I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> THE VERY FINE POWDERY FLAKES</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re happy with DermOrganic products because of your personal results from using them, that&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Love it very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I saw this was a new product and had very good reviews</li>
            <li> Shampoo is very light weight.  </li>
            <li> the sulfate free formulation is good for my baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li> Love the way this shampoo leaves my hair so nourished and manageable.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel stripped like most sulfate shampoos do for me.</li>
            <li> I had been using Wen for about 5 months and thought I would switch to something more affordable.</li>
            <li> Overall - great product!</li>
            <li> Although I have written to the product manufacturer about this product which I USED TO LOVE, and no longer do -</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I wish it was better</li>
            <li> It is not as moisturizing as Wen and leaves my hair feeling more</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I would really love this conditioning shampoo-</li>
            <li> My hair got really damaged over the years and this shampoo did a great job of repairing the ends and adding strength and shine.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> And no it doesn&#x27;t lather as much as most, but it&#x27;s not supposed to having no sulfates in it.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product !</li>
            <li> It is not too flowery, like so many shampoos are, but has a more earthy smell.  </li>
            <li> Rinse that out and add one more pump</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay shampoo.</li>
            <li> love it love</li>
            <li> I love it ...</li>
            <li> I love the smell, and I love not having puffy eyes after I use it.</li>
            <li> OKAy, if you have oily hair or scalp, this may not be your choice.  </li>
            <li> My hair is more manageble.</li>
            <li> a week after I&#x27;ve applied the color- instead of a healthy and youthful appearance.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> We really love this product.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely fabulous!</li>
            <li> I am using the argan oil, for so many years..</li>
            <li> its ok nothing permanent.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, lathers well, will continue to use.</li>
            <li> The reason I bought this shampoo is because I love the leave in Argan oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe with more time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Again, I&#x27;m going to give this more time and will update if things change.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Try it; you will definetley love it.  </li>
            <li> ENJOY!</li>
            <li> We will be sure to reorder it.</li>
            <li> Wish it had more conditioner.  </li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this.</li>
            <li> Now, after having used the shampoo for over a month, I have to say, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I do, however, love the conditioner and oil treatment in this line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for two years now and still love it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sulfate free!</li>
            <li> All GLUTEN FREE too!</li>
            <li> It really wasn&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li> Love what it does for my hair.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and my scalp doesnt feel any better......</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> try out this product and 99.5% of you will love it.</li>
            <li> I look forward to trying more products soon.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, although it arrived with a non working pump.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I used to LOVE LOVE LOVE this shampoo, despite the faulty pump.</li>
            <li> It works, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Solution: start a cut at the top of the bottle with a saw.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using the bottle this way for many weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Much better to spend a couple of bucks for a replacement pump mechanism than hassle with trying to get a seller to ship me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased that it&#x27;s a dual purpose</li>
            <li> Its feels very rich and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Shampoo comes out clean and shiny, and kind of looks like lotion.</li>
            <li> My husband laughed at me raving about it so much that he thought I should go work for the company!  </li>
            <li> I received two huge bottles and love the product so it turned out better for me, but just understand what you are purchasing is not as pictured here.</li>
            <li> so I can check it as soon as I get it, and return it more easily that way.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo for dry hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair has never felt better, been softer, more manageable, smooth, silkier or healthier.</li>
            <li> It is best for very dry hair, and a non oily scalp.</li>
            <li> Much better for your hair as it is sulfate free...</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves your hair sooo soft.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much that I&#x27;m about to order another bottle.</li>
            <li> - THAT is the original and better formula.</li>
            <li> it is the most creamy, rich and soothing shampoo on the market.</li>
            <li> It is easily damaged by sun, wind, salt water or pool water.  </li>
            <li> It does clean, but mostly conditions.</li>
            <li> Moms know how nice it is to smell clean baby or children&#x27;s hair, well, this will really make you smell it,its just a nice clean unperfumed smell.  </li>
            <li> I just put keratin in my hair and was looking for a new shampoo and conditioner to keep the keratin good, this did the job.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone with fine hair like mine.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is fine.  </li>
            <li> My hair is wavy and fine</li>
            <li> but I DON&#x27;T recommend for fine hair.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t suds for me, which is fine since lather is not indicative of cleansing ability.</li>
            <li> Really helps keep it healthy!</li>
            <li> I wanted a product to help my dry hair and this isn&#x27;t as good as I was hoping it would be!</li>
            <li> no sulfate and works great and smells terrific.  </li>
            <li> I wrote because this was a great product that I have been using for several years</li>
            <li> My hair dresser said it&#x27;s no doubt because I am using sulfate free products.</li>
            <li> WITH THE SULFATE FREE</li>
            <li> The reason I bought this is because my wife had dermatitis and this was sulfate free</li>
            <li> I use Dermorganics argan oil, so when I was searching for a sulfate free shampoo and saw this one I thought I would give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try it because it is sulfate free.</li>
            <li> for the lather, I honestly think it is too much.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s also free of organic ingredients.  </li>
            <li> This product is great for your hair especially if colored.</li>
            <li> The product feels very watery and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel nice after shampooing.</li>
            <li> I rarely stick with a hair care regimen through more than two bottles - this is the exception.</li>
            <li> I always use sulfate free</li>
            <li> I called the company to ask if the formula had been changed, and they confirmed that it had.  </li>
            <li> I have finally found a shampoo that works great on curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Find a jar-top that will fit over the bottle remnant so as to protect the shampoo from water.</li>
            <li> It is gently but effective and I have used it on permed and color treated hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it&#x27;s labeled sulfate free shampoo.  </li>
            <li> You must be a competitor, quite honestly I don&#x27;t care if it actually is not organic because the product works great and my hair has improved so much since I started using it.  </li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve used in a long time and it stopped my scalp itch the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> It smells right, it suds right up, it seems to work, but eww, the texture is kind of off</li>
            <li> I do not know if the manufacturer changed the formula or if the seller added some cheap soap in to the original product.</li>
            <li> It does clean my hair, but not like you would expect from sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li> this was my first dermorganic purchase, and I love the way it makes my hair feel and has a light neutral scent that can be used by men or women.</li>
            <li> After doing much research and reading reviews, I tried this brand and loved it at first.</li>
            <li> And, of course, it does foam which shame on me for not being more aware</li>
            <li> It is super gentle and does not over-strip, but it gets them nice and clean without a greasy residue.</li>
            <li> Clean lasts for days.</li>
            <li> I have an abundant and coarse hair so, using this shampoo makes my hair more voluminous and have reduced itching of the scalp.</li>
            <li> used it along with the conditioner, my hair was tangle and brittle, but it felt clean.</li>
            <li> But this does leave the hair clean.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling clean and silky.</li>
            <li> A good quality product that lasts much longer than a cheaper shampoo because you don&#x27;t need to use as much.</li>
            <li> use this one when I have a special night ahead of me.</li>
            <li> I quit using their conditioner and serum - they are nothing special.</li>
            <li> I eyeballed one that looked the right size, bought it, brought it home, and HOORAY!</li>
            <li> I eyeballed one that looked the right size, bought it, brought it home, and HOORAY!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great for fine hair-it doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> The smell is bright and crisp not heavy or perfumy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I&#x27;ve used it on my kids several times, and once I got over thinking their hair smelled like I&#x27;d washed it in a sink at the airport, I had to admit it was pretty great.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t pay full price</li>
            <li> So if you want to try all 3, buy a sample (i think 1 oz each) kit vs full size one.</li>
            <li> But usually a good occasional shake-and-stir resolves the problem.</li>
            <li> THIS SHAMPOO ALSO LATHERS UP UNLIKE MOST OTHER SULFATE FREE TYPES, AND HAS A NICE AROMA TOO.</li>
            <li> The lady that does my hair commented that I really needed to have a sulfate free shampoo because the shampoos I had been fine in drugstores were damaging my hair.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo leaves my hair feeling fresh and clean and weightless.  </li>
            <li> This seller was quick and efficient</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Maybe one day i will get rich enough to just have my own stuff made to cater to my needs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super gentle and makes my hair feel moisturized, smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li> best way I can describe the new consistency is to say it&#x27;s like a slightly liquefied styrofoam; it doesn&#x27;t flow or pour.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this great shampoo by DermOrganic would be great on any hair but for my particularly difficult (fine/thin/processed/aging) hair, this shampoo is nothing short of a revelation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Much better to spend a couple of bucks for a replacement pump mechanism than hassle with trying to get a seller to ship me a new one.</li>
            <li> So far what I like most about this is that it is affordable, cleans hair well and rinses out quickly, doesn’t have a overpowering perfume fragrance and is sulfate-free.  </li>
            <li> I love my Amika mask, which is amazing and addictive - we will have to see if I can give it up to try a new product.     </li>
            <li> All of the dermorganic products are AMAZING on my hair and I will never go back to styling my hair without using Moroccan Argan Oil.  </li>
            <li> this sulfate free shampoo lathers up very well...</li>
            <li> So if you, like me, were using this product as a gentle alternative to the 99% of available shampoos that have CAPB - be forewarned.  </li>
            <li> Simply put, the shampoo smells nice and cleans well.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo it makes my beard feel soft and helps it behave after combing.  </li>
            <li> If you have ever wanted to try Wen, but didn&#x27;t want to spend that much money to try something, I suggest Dermorganic shampoo, better price and much richer.</li>
            <li> For the rest of us who love the old formula - have you found any replacements???</li>
            <li> Love the product&#x27;s natural and organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> Combined with our soft water, it really makes my hair feel nice and makes tons of bubbles.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so worth</li>
            <li> I ended up shelling out for Moroccan Oil because it offers more moisture for my hair, but if this works for you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say its worth about that price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for several years and really liked it.  </li>
            <li> It kept my hair in amazing condition, it retained my beautiful color and overall, was a dream on my thick and silky hair.</li>
            <li> It does not clean as well as the other shampoos with sulfate, but it is perfect to keep my super long curls nourished and nice!</li>
            <li> profusely, it is rich and gentle, when you are rinsing (even before the conditioner)</li>
            <li> This is sulfate free, my main reason for purchasing.</li>
            <li> favorite part about this product is that after I dry my hair feels light.</li>
            <li> Luckily I found the trial sized package of this at Marshalls and fell in love, had to go back to Marshalls and buy the liter.  </li>
            <li> It IS free of paraben free and free of other \\&quot;bad\\&quot; ingredients</li>
            <li> Great on my color treated hair, especially because I use the organic color dye and this shampoo definitely gives me longer life to the coloring job</li>
            <li> It has made my hair soft, strong, and combined with the leave-in treatment - changed my life and erased plenty of frustration from my life.</li>
            <li> So far so good; I have only used it twice.  </li>
            <li> It is very gentle to the hair, it leaves the hair silky and nourished.</li>
            <li> Consumers need to be aware that just because the brand name \\&quot;DermOrganic\\&quot; includes word organic, DermOrganic products do not include any organic ingredients whatsoever.</li>
            <li> For information on understanding organic content in products, consumers should be aware of the FDA requirements for labeling products as organic.</li>
            <li> I also want to point out that this is completely GLUTEN FREE.</li>
            <li> Within a couple of weeks, my hair was so much softer and healthier looking!</li>
            <li> I saw someone mention that they bought some at TJ Maxx and the first ingredient is NOT aloe but water</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot, dermorganic!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through so many different brands/bottles of shampoo over the years</li>
            <li> The natural sulfate free ingredients are an added bonus.</li>
            <li> I use consistently &amp; will never use another shampoo again</li>
            <li> First thing is that its not organic.</li>
            <li> Soft, shiny and smooth.  </li>
            <li> a value, thanks!</li>
            <li> You might like all, or like me - just their stellar shampoo.</li>
            <li> i purchased it from a local store thinking it would prove better for my hair and scalp....</li>
            <li> Have only been able to review this shampoo after using for a week.</li>
            <li> I decided to look up on others like American Crew except more Organic.</li>
            <li> But I found they sell the actual pump top thing for a couple of bucks.</li>
            <li> But I found they sell the actual pump top thing for a couple of bucks.</li>
            <li> The shampoo itself lathers great, its amazing to me how it moisturizes your skin, but because of my type of skin it moisturizes and then clogs my pores and in a few days i have red bumps all over my face on my back and sometimes chest.</li>
            <li> After using this for a few weeks, my hair is great, it doesn&#x27;t get as oily and it is shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li> It has definitely been good for my hair that has recently been keratin treated.</li>
            <li> Only good for a short trip</li>
            <li> Dermorganics makes my hair way soft and smooth and just like it&#x27;s is REALLY</li>
            <li> so just Gona stick with my old tried and true method.</li>
            <li> Rather than creating their own formula, I think they may have simply bought bulk quantities Nexxus Therappe, and mixed in a good amount of electro-statically charged water, because this shampoo makes for a frizzy mess.  </li>
            <li> , it will dry your hands out- be sure to use lotion.</li>
            <li> (Note: because it was dry or maybe it was just able to do that).</li>
            <li> , their hair smells much better after it is dry!</li>
            <li> hair has a keratin treatment, and is pretty decent.</li>
            <li> Plus it comes in a large bottle with a pump that makes it so much easier to dispense.</li>
            <li> Other sulfate free shampoos I&#x27;ve used have not been so successful and a lot more expensive.</li>
            <li> This is a reasonably priced shampoo.  </li>
            <li> and she didn&#x27;t like the product as much, though.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell too.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that her hair has been very tangley since using it.</li>
            <li> I have lots of curly hair, which is usually very shiny and doesn&#x27;t require a lot of conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I am an African American woman and I have really soft natural hair and this product work great for me</li>
            <li> it cleans it very well</li>
            <li> Shaking doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> it really seems to take the chlorine out and soften my hair.</li>
            <li> that didn&#x27;t foam and was gentle on my hair.  </li>
            <li> It really just tangles and tangles and strips my hair.  </li>
            <li> Its gentle yet nourishing.</li>
            <li> I feel like my hair gets really tangly when I use it.  </li>
            <li> Very misleading product.</li>
            <li> and I have to say, I don&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li> Use the shampoo and then buy a regular, cheap sulfate-free conditioner at Target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is a lot softer and smoother and doesn&#x27;t frizz as much as it used to.  </li>
            <li> and I find five pumps works really well.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend it if you can find it for a cheap price.</li>
            <li> Is not as organic as it wants to appear.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It stills provides a nice lather without all the harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell very good, and it is very thin.</li>
            <li> but i love the feel of this product, love the smell, and obviously how little i have to use!</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s okay shampoo, but</li>
            <li> Other than that, its an okay shampoo.</li>
            <li> Go rub mint leaves in your hair to clean it if you need totally organic.</li>
            <li> We all have sensitive skin with being redheads and it is very gentle on skin</li>
            <li> If you turn the bottle upside down, the shampoo plops to the top of the bottle like a solid object, leaving the bottom of the bottle clean with no shampoo residue visible.</li>
            <li> The product is not thick; it&#x27;s actually really runny.</li>
            <li> After one month of using the product, my hair was super soft, drying time was cut down by HALF and my hairdresser said my hair was incredibly strong and more resilient.  </li>
            <li> Now I have to find a new product!</li>
            <li> I have to return the whole bottle of shampoo in order to get a new pump.</li>
            <li> The bottle is HUGE so it lasts a very long time too.</li>
            <li> However, for dry, chemically treated hair, it is fabulous.</li>
            <li> But my latest bottle smelled peculiar and had separated into a watery component and an oddly grainy component.</li>
            <li> I can tell in one shot if a product is meh, decent or A-Ok.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> High five.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The shampoo keeps my hair just as clean for just as long as sulfate shampoos.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair silky soft and no frizz!!</li>
            <li> This product works fabulous on my soft, delicate, baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li> Detangles my fine blonde hair, makes it soft and ultra touchable, not heavy at all.</li>
            <li> I find my hair soft but not as much body texture as I would expect it to be.</li>
            <li> I am so picky when it comes to hair products that I too am surprised that I like it this much.</li>
            <li> Its gentle, I use on my 3 year old and 7 year old and their hair glistens!  </li>
            <li> Not very often I get so excited about a product,  </li>
            <li> This new version?</li>
            <li> Sometimes, the pump doesn&#x27;t even work, even on a new bottle.  </li>
            <li> I have to mail order it as I live in Canada but never would ever think of switching.</li>
            <li> so I had to go shopping for a new shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this to protect my newly colored hair.</li>
            <li> So yesterday I grabbed the new pump bottle - and the pump doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> a new one.but</li>
            <li> My itchy scalp, the main reason for going Sulfrate-Free, is completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (got it from a local brick and mortar store), and know it should be white, smooth, and creamy when it comes out of the pump.</li>
            <li> /&gt;My keratin treatments last nicely, and I like the way this shampoo isn&#x27;t harsh on my hair.</li>
            <li> To be fair, I have long, dry, colored hair, and I&#x27;m somewhat long in the tooth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it wouldn&#x27;t be as bad if you have thick or very healthy hair, but for fine dryer hair you&#x27;ll certainly need to follow up with a moisture treatment of some sort.</li>
            <li> (I do need conditioner DermOrganic Mask) and it is very soft and shinny.  </li>
            <li> I am going to stock up on the old where I can find it!</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> My first reaction when opening this shampoo was total revulsion by the scent.</li>
            <li> But it smells exactly like the low-grade soap you get from any public washroom.</li>
            <li> it was my first expensive shampoo and it never fails to amaze me that through daily blow drying and straightening I&#x27;ve still got soft and healthy hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to cocamidopropyl betaine (a foaming agent also known as CAPB and other names) and this was one of the few good shampoos on the market that didn&#x27;t contain it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of near by shopping, so TJ&#x27;s is where I find new products.</li>
            <li> From the previous sulfate free shampoos  </li>
            <li> it lathers up beautifully although it&#x27;s SULFATE-FREE- and completely cleansed my 3-days&#x27; dirty hair in one shot (out of habit, I lathered, rinsed &amp; repeated</li>
            <li> , however, the last bottle of the shampoo smells so vial that I cannot, with peace of mind, use it any longer since I shampoo in the shower and whatever they did to this formerly great shampoo, or if this particular bottle was spoiled, I am concerned about what it is that makes it stink so badly [which it never used to do] being absorbed into my body..</li>
            <li> I have fine hair which tends to get limp and this perks it up.</li>
            <li> and so I naturally removed the top but was sad to see it clump/dry up so quickly.</li>
            <li> Large bottle will last a while.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that it doesn&#x27;t contain a heap of bad ingredients like most commercial shampoos.</li>
            <li> Since I bought it I can see clear improvement in my hair</li>
            <li> Obviously, I somewhat expected it to be like that, because its sulfate free.</li>
            <li> Never had any allergies or allergic reactions, but developed a rash after using this shampoo</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft, shiny and manageabe.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It does really well at replinishing moisture following hair coloring.</li>
            <li> My hair has never been so soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Did not need any conditioner, my hair is soft and shiny with shampoo alone.  </li>
            <li> If you have acne or sensitive skin, or if youre worried about your pores getting clogged up.</li>
            <li> It did leave my hair soft</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s gentle enough that it doesn&#x27;t strip or change the color of my hair.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo has completely eliminated that problem.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few shampoos on the market that is truly free of sodium laureth sulfate.</li>
            <li> They have sensitive skin, and so far, no issues with that.</li>
            <li> Their hair is soft with no tangles, and no additional conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought being an organic shampoo it wont give much lather as regular one does..</li>
            <li> /&gt;EDITED on March 18, 2013 to add: My latest liter sized pump bottle of this shampoo has been sitting on the shelf for a few weeks until I used up my earlier one.</li>
            <li> It says it has an \\&quot;rich luxurious lather\\&quot; on the back, and it is the total opposite of that.</li>
            <li> If anything ammonium lauryl sulfate is better than the other for the fact that its molecular structure is not small enough to penetrate the skin, but it can still dry your hair out.</li>
            <li> I will absolutely NEVER use another shampoo as long as this one is available.</li>
            <li> Plus the large size bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> so for anyone who has long hair, colour treated, sometimes frizzy like mine , i highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Sadly this shampoo was too drying for me personally, but I love the ingredients and it&#x27;s worth a try if you want to switch to a sulfate-free and paraben-free shampoo.</li>
            <li> Dermorganic saved my hair hands down, and my husband RAVED about being able to run his hands through my hair when he kissed me for the first time after being apart due to his military deployment.</li>
            <li> It is exactly the way my dad&#x27;s german-made shaving cream used to be 30 yrs ago - thick and rich, not only that, the smell is similar.</li>
            <li> The conditioner actually worked for her hair in the first 3 weeks but her hair went back to being the same and she eventually stopped using it.</li>
            <li> I had a problem with the highlighting of my hair at one point and my hairdresser told me that what ever shampoo and conditioner I have been using is the only thing that kept me from having a complete disaster !</li>
            <li> I have very itchy dry scalp and fine thick hair.</li>
            <li> If you use it in the shower and have a hard time bending over, keep a reacher handy in case you drop it--and be careful not to drop it on your foot!</li>
            <li> Both sodium lauryl sulfate or ammonia lauryl sulfate are harsh surfactants in MOST commercial shampoos which can dry your hair and skin out.</li>
            <li> &gt; Only down side is that, it did seemed to fade my color a tad more than the other sulfate color-shampoos.</li>
            <li> I got very efficient and tossed out the old liter bottle, and then it took a few days to use up the shampoo I&#x27;d kept in a small bottle I&#x27;d filled for a trip.</li>
            <li> I am comparing the old left overs I bought a year ago and this product.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and shiny, but I can&#x27;t say &amp;#34;manageable,&amp;#34; because my hair is too short to be unmanageable!</li>
            <li> Sometimes I can find it at Marshall&#x27;s for a few bucks cheaper, but that is a rare occasion.</li>
            <li> As a loyal user of this shampoo for 6+ years, I was shocked to receive my latest shipment.</li>
            <li> , my face doesn&#x27;t break out anymore, I lose less hair, and I only have to wash my hair once every 2-3 days, this is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> To make my hair a little softer I used Neutrogena triple moisture after the wash.&lt;br /&gt;Second time I used it with the mask, and was a little better but still tangles.</li>
            <li> To avoid to much volume, when hair still wet, I rub into my palms a small dot of Lorea&#x27;l Sulfate free color care system (bought at Amazon) and onto the hair (no the scalp), then dry and style it, accordingly</li>
            <li> Anyway, not good shampoo for fine hair.  </li>
            <li> It does not dry out your hair or create build up on your scalp.</li>
            <li> It cleans well, but does not dry the hair out at all.</li>
            <li> first time I used it, it felt a little brittle, but I thought, I give it another try.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It was first recommended to me by my hairdresser some years ago and although it may seem a little pricey</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sulfate free and makes my haircolor last much longer than ordinary shampoos which contain harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> Smells a tad funny and has a weird texture, but it gets my hair clean and my conditioner covers up any herbal smell left over from the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Not sure about shiny and smooth, but it could just be the weather in my city (dry air).</li>
            <li> No amount of shaking fixed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to submit a complaint to the company that distributes the shampoo, Healthy Sexy Beauty, but although Amazon asks you to do just that, they make it literally impossible to do so via their customer service maze.</li>
            <li> And of course the old liter pump bottle was long gone so I couldn&#x27;t reuse the pump from it.</li>
            <li> And of course the old liter pump bottle was long gone so I couldn&#x27;t reuse the pump from it.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair daily and have been using the same bottle for approximately one month or more.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo seems to now weigh my hair down and and make really unmanageable.</li>
            <li> The only thing you have to work is the pump not friendly at first</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and doesn&#x27;t look dry at all.</li>
            <li> However, we can hardly use more tahn half the shampoo in the bottle because everytime the pumping mechanism breaks</li>
            <li> My last salon used the old foil method of highlighting my hair and always left them on too long.  </li>
            <li> I now have a short hairstyle and no dry hair or split ends issues to deal with, and haven&#x27;t conditioned my hair in the year since I had it cut short.</li>
            <li> I have very thick (for a white girl), baby fine hairs.</li>
            <li> The smell gives me a headache right in the center of my forehead and made me feel slightly</li>
            <li> complete the shampoo process with a conditioner in our very dry, Southern California</li>
            <li> My hair looks much thicker, FEELS twice as thick, looks and feels silkier with clear revival of my color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin highlighted hair - does not weigh it down.</li>
            <li> It became very unhealthy with so many split ends.</li>
            <li> I saw on Dr. Oz that for older hair, a sulfate-free shampoo, followed by a little argan oil, helps with the dryness and fly-aways.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t strip hair, Foams into a luxurious lather, and keeps my very thick hair clean, silky and shiny.</li>
            <li> The shampoo in the bottle I&#x27;ve almost used up right now, got thick and hard to pump; I added some hot tap water to it, shook/stirred it, and solved that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It left mine and my 3 yr old daughters hair so dry that I couldnt even brush through it while it was wet.</li>
            <li> The keratin treatment opened a whole new world of manageable hair for me; no more bangs that do funky waves instead of just hanging down straight, no more frizzing, etc.</li>
            <li> but it usually dries up my scalp and makes it very itchy</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I had to get past the very lotion-like texture-</li>
            <li> so ive been on the never ending search for a similar product to manage my long colour treated hair(i</li>
            <li> This stuff leaves my fine hair feeling like straw - and I don&#x27;t process my hair, so I&#x27;m confused as to how other reviewers have had such luck with it.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo has made it soft and natural that its having a lil hard time staying up</li>
            <li> After using this product my hair was left feeling extremely dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> to prevent sulfate to make my new colored hair pale and dead-looking appearance -</li>
            <li> mainly go betweeen manic panic or pravana for colour, but ive done box colour in the past as well).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay - foams up and cleans hair without sulfates - but it is disappointing if you are hoping for something like Wen conditioning cream.</li>
            <li> that I guess I am used to with more artificial products.</li>
            <li> It lasts so long, as well.</li>
            <li> I used Wen for a long time until I realized I was having issues with my allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> and they leave your hair limp and too soft)..</li>
            <li> i have long hair about 3/4 way down my back and to wash all of it i need only 5 pumps.</li>
            <li> About a few months back, I started using American Crew because of how dry my hair is with regular tresemme shampoo or whatever my parents buy.</li>
            <li> I bought the small bottle for a try and now I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Far less expensive than brand name sulfate free shampoos, I use this even if I don&#x27;t do a keratin treatment as it is far less harsh than detergent &amp; sulfate shampoos.</li>
            <li> This may work for thick/ coarse hair as some other reviewers have described</li>
            <li> It lathers up, perhaps not as much as other shampoos, but generously enough to get the job done.</li>
            <li> I havent been using it very long, so I cant attest to its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> It will air dry your hair faster</li>
            <li> and I now have dry scales on my scalp.</li>
            <li> but then I just use my Batiste dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> My ends are dry</li>
            <li> It does help with the itchy, dry scalp till the build-up sets in (makes me think it&#x27;s not truly sulfate-free).</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for about 6 months now and it has definately improved my scalp and the condition of my hair, which is curly, dry, color-treated.  </li>
            <li> But to maintain the effects of the keratin treatments (if the hair&#x27;s cared for properly they last for a few months), I was told to use a sulfate-free shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do home keratin treatments on my thick coarse wavy frizzy hair every 4 months and since that is definately not organic and somewhat toxic I want it to last as long as possible, and this shampoo delivers - cleans without removing the keratin treatment.</li>
            <li> So i highly NOT recommended...</li>
            <li> I have wavey-curly hair, processed, live in a damp climate that creates frizz and swim in chlorine at least twice a week.</li>
            <li> I have much less itching after a month of using the shampoo and rinse daily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the shampoo for about a week, but my hair seems less frizzled and tangled.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure it is any different than my current products.</li>
            <li> The only thing that keeps my bleached hair from being a tangled mess.</li>
            <li> You really only need to use a little (one pump), lather and repeat.  </li>
            <li> but I do notice my roots look a little oily the next day</li>
            <li> My hair is dry due to the fact  </li>
            <li> Finish cutting the top off with heavy shears.</li>
            <li> even though it&#x27;s not really as organic as the name implies, but when I received mine, it was curdled.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also a thick foamy gel in a pump bottle whose feed tube stops far from the bottom.</li>
            <li> But it is just average on my hair, which is on the dry side.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and the previous formulation worked for my dry scalp.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way too.</li>
            <li> can both mess up my curl pattern and cause my hair to look dry and fly-away, well it doesn&#x27;t make sense.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use any other product anymore.</li>
            <li> A check of their labels will show that the word organic doesn&#x27;t appear anywhere other than within the brand name.</li>
            <li> I like the way this lathers, not like other shampoos.</li>
            <li> bottle would be empty in 2 wks!)</li>
            <li> I use it every other day.  </li>
            <li> For the past year I&#x27;ve tried everything - H&amp;S, Prescribed Antibacterial Shampoos, and American Crew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Due to Celiac&#x27;s Disease, we bought his product and have not had the need to look anywhere else.  </li>
            <li> So it is not like any other shampoo.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a sulphate-free (because I color my hair) AND sodium chloride free shampoo (because I have a Brazilian blow-out), which is nearly impossible to find without spending an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li> This shampoo cured my husband&#x27;s dry scalp within  a few shampooings.</li>
            <li> his dull greying hair had life back in it and shined and even had some gold highlights again that his brown hair used to have.  </li>
            <li> I have been using WEN and it is a little too heavy for my medium processed long hair.  </li>
            <li> If I could leave negative stars for this, it would certainly be the first time I have ever been so completely disappointed and damaged by a product that claimed to be conditioning.</li>
            <li> , i know its different from hair to another, but if this product is truly organic, then my scalp wouldnt have dandruff at least.</li>
            <li> I have thick, long hair just past my shoulders and a bottle of this shampoo will last me close to 6 months.</li>
            <li> I have long blonde hair and it feels like silk, which is difficult because my hair is highlighted and tends to be dry.  </li>
            <li> I have seen reviews about people saying that they get a watered down product of this</li>
            <li> One bottle down, buying another.</li>
            <li> it it does not weigh it down.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to get the last little bit out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> The previous formula was life changing.</li>
            <li> of them helped by seborrheic dermatitis, and instead made my scalp less inhabitable for hair to grow.</li>
            <li> I have no shame in taking a product back that does nothing for me, but at the same time i have no problem paying for a product that works for me, even if its expensive.</li>
            <li> my hair is stronger and less frizzy...</li>
            <li> This means that perhaps an inch and a half...</li>
            <li> This product stripped all moisture from my hair, leaving it a knotted mess with the texture of straw.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and regular shampoos weigh my hair down</li>
            <li> , i feel like the shampoo is never really out, and it&#x27;s hard to manage.</li>
            <li> I did repurpose this &amp;#34;Conditioning Shampoo&amp;#34; for use when I am working on my car and have heavy duty grease, oil and grime to get off my hands,</li>
            <li> but it has few organic ingredients....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now and it still never disappoints.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve continued using it year round.</li>
            <li> So I will be marching my behind back to the store to return the bottle i bought.</li>
            <li> My husband starting using it and is now addicted as well.</li>
            <li> , the conditioner is nothing special..don&#x27;t waste money on it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t return it because i used it a few times.</li>
            <li> two inches: A LOT OF SHAMPOO IS TRAPPED IN THE BOTTLE.</li>
            <li> Seems to be made from quality ingredients and one of the few shampoos I have found that isn&#x27;t made in China.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap, but it&#x27;s truly sulfate-free.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t then my hair feels heavy and too squeaky clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m also using the shampoo as a body wash, so I&#x27;ll use the product faster and dob&#x27;t want to go through the trouble of returning it.</li>
            <li> Less hair loss &amp; no more scalp irritation...</li>
            <li> Also, sometimes the consistency is watery, other times, it&#x27;s lumpy or really thick.  </li>
            <li> Currently I am transitioning from a perm to my natural texture, and this left both types of my hair feeling terrible.</li>
            <li> I have always had to get highlights every 6 weeks and by the 6th week my hair usually looks horrendous.  </li>
            <li> THAT I USUALLY GET IN THE WINTER.</li>
            <li> like I used ordinary shampoo with sulfates.</li>
            <li> It was expensive, but instead of returning it I&#x27;ve relegated it to body shampoo, as it seems to rinse cleanly enough off my skin.  </li>
            <li> and it is not not able to push the shampoo out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;travel pack&amp;#34; is too small.  </li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;ll buy this again when the container is used up.</li>
            <li> I have longer hair past the shoulders</li>
            <li> This has no overwhelming flowery perfume smell, cleans well.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s so weird because when I came back to the US</li>
            <li> I was not sure if this product would work</li>
            <li> and it is HEAVY!</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not pleased with the way my hair feels after I rinsed.  </li>
            <li> It doesnt smell bad, but not good either, which to me just means that there&#x27;s no unnecessary ingredients.</li>
            <li> So I submitted the complaint to Amazon instead.</li>
            <li> this stuff is so thick</li>
            <li> The pump will stop working because it is so thick that it won&#x27;t go up the tube anymore</li>
            <li> I am a redhead, and tend to have thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thick course hair.</li>
            <li> but when it comes out of the bottle, I almost can see original foamy substance and then watery creamy nasty chemical that should not be part of it.</li>
            <li> things: only bad thing is how hard it is to get out of the bottle sometimes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Just ridiculous.</li>
            <li> A brief summary of organic labeling requirements can be found at: [...].</li>
            <li> duh!</li>
            <li> Mayonnaise and beer are supposed to be \\&quot;good\\&quot; conditioners for the hair, doesn&#x27;t mean I want to go around smelling like a backwoods redneck!      </li>
            <li> My daughter has thin, shiny hair that she blow dries</li>
            <li> I have been addicted ever since.  </li>
            <li> My daughters thin baby hair is easier to manage in ponytails and braids.  </li>
            <li> During the winter months I will start developing eczema on my scalp, so I switched to this organic shampoo to keep away unnecessary chemicals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rather annoyed by this lack of service on their part.</li>
            <li> I tried using the conditioner to help it, but it made it worse.</li>
            <li> After chemo my hair came in thin and curly.  </li>
            <li> It doesnt foam up as much as other shampoos, but it doesnt have that bad sulfate stuff, so its not supposed to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not good!  </li>
            <li> A few months ago I switched to this brand because it seemed to keep out the bad ingredients</li>
            <li> now silly me, i automatically thought it was a 2 in one,</li>
            <li> The pump was really annoyed her!</li>
            <li> Sadly from what everyone has said, the formulation has changed.</li>
            <li> In the meantime, ill just be another consumer lost in the money sucking cosmetic product market.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> Now - shampoo has a weird texture.</li>
            <li> weird</li>
            <li> Seems silly.</li>
            <li> I find it disappointing that the product is named Dermorganic</li>
            <li> when ever I feel my hair is dirty</li>
            <li> I know, that sounds crazy, but my hair seems thicker than before, and shinier.</li>
            <li> really chicken s</li>
            <li> Sorry Chaz, Im a fool for cheating on you!</li>
            <li> Crazy lather is bad for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a completely unpleasant odor...</li>
            <li> I am giving it 3 as it is very expensive  .  </li>
            <li> so no need to buy a very expensive shampoo.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe it because my hair didn&#x27;t even look that bad.  </li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find out I needed a conditioner.</li>
            <li> but im quite disappointed by it...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product after seven times used caused crazy dandruff and itchy scalp, i hated it and wished didnt buy it</li>
            <li> What a terrible disappointment.</li>
            <li> VERY disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I bought the wrong thing, but this stuff leaves my hair like straw!!!  </li>
            <li> What an awful, awful thing this is!</li>
            <li> It smells terrible and seems diluted...</li>
            <li> So disappointed!!</li>
            <li> The HairOne knock off gave me a horrible reaction.</li>
            <li> Maybe its just my hair, but the lather is terrible and it doesn&#x27;t feel like its cleaning my hair at all.</li>
            <li> The smell is horrible, and consistency changed to watery.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was looking for a sulphate-free (because I color my hair) AND sodium chloride free shampoo (because I have a Brazilian blow-out), which is nearly impossible to find without spending an arm and a leg. This is a reasonably priced shampoo.  Smells a tad funny and has a weird texture, but it gets my hair clean and my conditioner covers up any herbal smell left over from the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Never had any allergies or allergic reactions, but developed a rash after using this shampoo</li>
            <li> Got this shampoo from Amazon...no sulfate and works great and smells terrific.  I use Wen conditioning cleanser for a conditioner with it.  Clean lasts for days.</li>
            <li> Simply put, the shampoo smells nice and cleans well.</li>
            <li> Love the way this shampoo leaves my hair so nourished and manageable.  Can&#x27;t use any other product anymore. Love it!</li>
            <li> Bought this a second time.  Shampoo is very light weight.  Doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel stripped like most sulfate shampoos do for me.</li>
            <li> What an awful, awful thing this is! This product stripped all moisture from my hair, leaving it a knotted mess with the texture of straw. I had been using Wen for about 5 months and thought I would switch to something more affordable. Sorry Chaz, Im a fool for cheating on you! I did repurpose this &amp;#34;Conditioning Shampoo&amp;#34; for use when I am working on my car and have heavy duty grease, oil and grime to get off my hands, its amazing EXCEPT, it will dry your hands out- be sure to use lotion. If I could leave negative stars for this, it would certainly be the first time I have ever been so completely disappointed and damaged by a product that claimed to be conditioning. My hair had to be cut to remove the damage it caused, and this is after pouring coconut oil on my hair just to get it untangled, it took hours before my hair had regained enough moisture to even touch it. Save yourself some heartache, stay away from this vile product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confused how sulfate free shampoo still lathers. It is not as conditioning as I would like on it&#x27;s own. If you purchase this shampoo, you will need to purchase conditioner. Other than that, it&#x27;s okay shampoo, but not what I was looking for to replace my Wen products.</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting the item as pictured... Not the case. I received two huge bottles and love the product so it turned out better for me, but just understand what you are purchasing is not as pictured here. Smells great, lathers and cleanses. The only thing I don&#x27;t care for is that it&#x27;s not moisturizing enough. I end up using a separate moisturizer and moisturizing oil after I wash my hair with this product. If I didn&#x27;t I could not get a comb through it at all. I&#x27;m sure it wouldn&#x27;t be as bad if you have thick or very healthy hair, but for fine dryer hair you&#x27;ll certainly need to follow up with a moisture treatment of some sort. Overall - great product!</li>
            <li> I would rate this about a 7 out of 8. I think just a bit more oil could have been added, but is still a very  good shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have double processed platinum blonde hair that MUST be meticulously maintained in order to prevent my hair from frying or breaking off.  All of the dermorganic products are AMAZING on my hair and I will never go back to styling my hair without using Moroccan Argan Oil.  After one month of using the product, my hair was super soft, drying time was cut down by HALF and my hairdresser said my hair was incredibly strong and more resilient.  Organic Shmanic.  Mayonnaise and beer are supposed to be \\&quot;good\\&quot; conditioners for the hair, doesn&#x27;t mean I want to go around smelling like a backwoods redneck!      Dermorganic saved my hair hands down, and my husband RAVED about being able to run his hands through my hair when he kissed me for the first time after being apart due to his military deployment.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair.  It is easily damaged by sun, wind, salt water or pool water.  In only one or 2 shampoos my hair is noticeably shinier and softer. I am so hooked.</li>
            <li> Consumers need to be aware that just because the brand name \\&quot;DermOrganic\\&quot; includes word organic, DermOrganic products do not include any organic ingredients whatsoever. A check of their labels will show that the word organic doesn&#x27;t appear anywhere other than within the brand name. For information on understanding organic content in products, consumers should be aware of the FDA requirements for labeling products as organic. A brief summary of organic labeling requirements can be found at: [...]. If you&#x27;re happy with DermOrganic products because of your personal results from using them, that&#x27;s great. But if you&#x27;re looking for great organic hair care products, then DermOrganics isn&#x27;t the answer. In fact, I have to give them 0 stars just because I think they&#x27;re trying to mislead consumers.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. It will air dry your hair faster and it strengthens your hair. My hair dresser begs me to use this when I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon this product by chance, and I must say that it is the BEST product that I have ever tried. I have wavy, coarse hair and it does wonders for it. I also have a greasy scalp and this product takes care of that problem  for me! Simply LOVE it! My daughter has thin, shiny hair that she blow dries and she didn&#x27;t like the product as much, though.</li>
            <li> Although I have written to the product manufacturer about this product which I USED TO LOVE, and no longer do - - I have not heard back from the manufacturer to date.  I wrote because this was a great product that I have been using for several years, however, the last bottle of the shampoo smells so vial that I cannot, with peace of mind, use it any longer since I shampoo in the shower and whatever they did to this formerly great shampoo, or if this particular bottle was spoiled, I am concerned about what it is that makes it stink so badly [which it never used to do] being absorbed into my body..</li>
            <li> You must be a competitor, quite honestly I don&#x27;t care if it actually is not organic because the product works great and my hair has improved so much since I started using it.  That is all that counts for me!  End of the story.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful!  It leaves my hair soft, shiny and manageabe.&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate that it is made from organic ingredients and contains Argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;I complete the shampoo process with a conditioner in our very dry, Southern California&lt;br /&gt;weather.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo/conditioner/oil product ever! The only thing that keeps my bleached hair from being a tangled mess. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. It smells great!  It&#x27;s sulfate free and makes my haircolor last much longer than ordinary shampoos which contain harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> Got this product along with the DermOrganic Sulfate-Free Masque Conditioner as I have Seborrheic dermatitis and tried everything. I read somewhere online that I should avoid shampoos with sulfates. I found out that almost all shampoos have some kind of sulfates! I looked up \\&quot;sulfate free shampoo\\&quot; on Amazon and it with this Conditioner has been great. I have much less itching after a month of using the shampoo and rinse daily.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo it makes my beard feel soft and helps it behave after combing.  I use it about twice a week and will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Beware! The manufacturer has changed the formula of DermOrganic Conditioning Shampoo. They&#x27;ve added ingredients that were not in the product I&#x27;ve used up until now! It no longer is the silky-smooth, pleasantly scented conditioning shampoo I&#x27;ve loved for 2 years running.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best way I can describe the new consistency is to say it&#x27;s like a slightly liquefied styrofoam; it doesn&#x27;t flow or pour. If you turn the bottle upside down, the shampoo plops to the top of the bottle like a solid object, leaving the bottom of the bottle clean with no shampoo residue visible. And the smell! It&#x27;s not a fragrance, it&#x27;s an odor. The smell gives me a headache right in the center of my forehead and made me feel slightly nauseous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have returned the product to the seller and contacted the manufacturer with my observations. What a terrible disappointment. Now I have to find a new product!</li>
            <li> This hair care product was prescribed by my hairdresser. It does really well at replinishing moisture following hair coloring. Cost is great and shipping and packaging were awesome.</li>
            <li> I bought the conditioning shampoo and the hair DermOrganic masque conditioner at Tj Maxx.  I have been addicted ever since.  I have always had to get highlights every 6 weeks and by the 6th week my hair usually looks horrendous.  This last time I went to my hair dresser and it had been 14 weeks!  I couldn&#x27;t believe it because my hair didn&#x27;t even look that bad.  The only thing I was doing differently was using these products.  My hair dresser said it&#x27;s no doubt because I am using sulfate free products. I&#x27;m never going back to sulfate products!  Product smells great too!</li>
            <li> I buy this for my 2 children to use. I have one who has eczema and this is the only shampoo that he can use that does not irritate it further. Sometimes I can find it at Marshall&#x27;s for a few bucks cheaper, but that is a rare occasion. My mom will buy her Marshall&#x27;s out in her town of this to send to me. I also want to point out that this is completely GLUTEN FREE.</li>
            <li> I like the way this lathers, not like other shampoos. The smell is bright and crisp not heavy or perfumy. Cleans well but doesn&#x27;t seem to strip the hair. Will buy this again!!!</li>
            <li> Not very often I get so excited about a product,  but this is wonderful!  We are a family of redheads, strawberry blondes and a greying brown.  I used this on my red hair and its shiny and not greasy.  It feels thicker and the ends of my hair when I braid it are now almost the same thickness as the tops of the braids.  Amazing!  Its gentle, I use on my 3 year old and 7 year old and their hair glistens!  My daughters thin baby hair is easier to manage in ponytails and braids.  We all have sensitive skin with being redheads and it is very gentle on skin and I can even wash my face with it.  My husband laughed at me raving about it so much that he thought I should go work for the company!  I had him use it and his dull greying hair had life back in it and shined and even had some gold highlights again that his brown hair used to have.  I really like the smell too.  Moms know how nice it is to smell clean baby or children&#x27;s hair, well, this will really make you smell it,its just a nice clean unperfumed smell.  I will post  some pics so you can see the shine.  Oh, I did buy one of the Wen shampoos to compare.  Well it sits there unused because it does not compare to this one, not even close.  I&#x27;m just a mom!  Don&#x27;t work for them.  Definately give this a try!  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I orginally bought a liter at TJ Maxx, thinking I just try it out. I don&#x27;t have a lot of near by shopping, so TJ&#x27;s is where I find new products. The smell is very nice and light and my hair feels like silk. I have very fine, thin highlighted hair - does not weigh it down. I didn&#x27;t know about the hair mask, maybe I will try it. I love my Amika mask, which is amazing and addictive - we will have to see if I can give it up to try a new product.     If you have ever wanted to try Wen, but didn&#x27;t want to spend that much money to try something, I suggest Dermorganic shampoo, better price and much richer.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great! But it is just average on my hair, which is on the dry side. I wish it was better but it&#x27;s not. I find it disappointing that the product is named Dermorganic but it has few organic ingredients....but that was not my point in buying it. I wanted a product to help my dry hair and this isn&#x27;t as good as I was hoping it would be!</li>
            <li> GREAT SHAMPOO! WITH THE SULFATE FREE I EXPERIENCE NO ITCHING OF MY SCALP OR THE VERY FINE POWDERY FLAKES THAT I USUALLY GET IN THE WINTER. THIS SHAMPOO ALSO LATHERS UP UNLIKE MOST OTHER SULFATE FREE TYPES, AND HAS A NICE AROMA TOO.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay - foams up and cleans hair without sulfates - but it is disappointing if you are hoping for something like Wen conditioning cream. It is not as moisturizing as Wen and leaves my hair feeling more like I used ordinary shampoo with sulfates.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I like Wen but not the price tag. DermOrganic does have a nice lather but thats it. It left mine and my 3 yr old daughters hair so dry that I couldnt even brush through it while it was wet. I noticed that her hair has been very tangley since using it. Im returning it and going back to Wen..</li>
            <li> This shampoo combined with the masque is all I will use. Even when I go to the salon, I bring my own shampoo and conditioner because it is sooooo much better than what they use! I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now and it still never disappoints.</li>
            <li> Within a couple of weeks, my hair was so much softer and healthier looking! I love this shampoo. It lasts so long, as well.</li>
            <li> For some reason which eludes me now, I bought into media hype and jumped on the \\&quot;Sulfate Free\\&quot; bandwagon and purchased this shampoo.  Rather than creating their own formula, I think they may have simply bought bulk quantities Nexxus Therappe, and mixed in a good amount of electro-statically charged water, because this shampoo makes for a frizzy mess.  I have lots of curly hair, which is usually very shiny and doesn&#x27;t require a lot of conditioner.  How a \\&quot;conditioning\\&quot; shampoo (which by the way doesn&#x27;t appear to actually BE Organic, contrary to the name they&#x27;ve chosen) can both mess up my curl pattern and cause my hair to look dry and fly-away, well it doesn&#x27;t make sense.  My &#x27;do on this shampoo reminds me of when I was three and inserted my mother&#x27;s tweezers into a wall outlet. I tried it three times (and tried using conditioner afterward too) before deciding it truly sucked.  It was expensive, but instead of returning it I&#x27;ve relegated it to body shampoo, as it seems to rinse cleanly enough off my skin.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of body hair, but if you do, and you&#x27;re looking for side work, use this and you COULD  score a gig as one of Miley&#x27;s dancing teddy bears. (I read there might be an opening.)  PJ</li>
            <li> ive tried the Wen, liked it, but too costly. so ive been on the never ending search for a similar product to manage my long colour treated hair(i mainly go betweeen manic panic or pravana for colour, but ive done box colour in the past as well). i ordered this, loved that it came in such a great sized bottle for a great price. now silly me, i automatically thought it was a 2 in one, oops, no i had to order the conditioner lol. so until it gets here i continued to use my regular conitioner with it. but i love the feel of this product, love the smell, and obviously how little i have to use! i have long hair about 3/4 way down my back and to wash all of it i need only 5 pumps. (with wen i needed 20. bottle would be empty in 2 wks!) so for anyone who has long hair, colour treated, sometimes frizzy like mine , i highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> As a loyal user of this shampoo for 6+ years, I was shocked to receive my latest shipment. It smells terrible and seems diluted...so, I used it and my hair is straw and it damaged my color. The previous formula was life changing. It kept my hair in amazing condition, it retained my beautiful color and overall, was a dream on my thick and silky hair. This new version? So disappointed. I saw someone mention that they bought some at TJ Maxx and the first ingredient is NOT aloe but water - THAT is the original and better formula. I am going to stock up on the old where I can find it! So disappointed!! For the rest of us who love the old formula - have you found any replacements??? Can anyone suggest something else? The conditioner still seems to be the same, but couldn&#x27;t even repair the damage the shampoo did. Thanks a lot, dermorganic! It wasn&#x27;t broke - why change it?!</li>
            <li> The best.gave it a try..it was my first expensive shampoo and it never fails to amaze me that through daily blow drying and straightening I&#x27;ve still got soft and healthy hair! I&#x27;ve struggled all my life with damage..now im relieved!</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s prices for these products are excellent and this shampoo is a top quality product.  Great on my color treated hair, especially because I use the organic color dye and this shampoo definitely gives me longer life to the coloring job</li>
            <li> I loved it so much that I&#x27;m about to order another bottle. My hair has never been so soft and shiny.  My itchy scalp, the main reason for going Sulfrate-Free, is completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Only down side is that, it did seemed to fade my color a tad more than the other sulfate color-shampoos.</li>
            <li> I would really love this conditioning shampoo- even though it&#x27;s not really as organic as the name implies, but when I received mine, it was curdled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, curdled, like when milk goes bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works, but I have had this product before (got it from a local brick and mortar store), and know it should be white, smooth, and creamy when it comes out of the pump. But what I received from Amazon, is, well, like curdled milk- white lumps with watery liquid. It smells right, it suds right up, it seems to work, but eww, the texture is kind of off putting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect, if I buy this again, I will get it from a local store so I can check it as soon as I get it, and return it more easily that way.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and pump did not work from day one. The conditioner actually worked for her hair in the first 3 weeks but her hair went back to being the same and she eventually stopped using it. The reason I bought this is because my wife had dermatitis and this was sulfate free but it didn&#x27;t help. The pump was really annoyed her!</li>
            <li> I use Dermorganics argan oil, so when I was searching for a sulfate free shampoo and saw this one I thought I would give it a try.  I&#x27;m so glad I did!  This product works fabulous on my soft, delicate, baby fine hair.  You can feel the difference immediately.  I also bought the hair mask and have great things to say about it as well!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful sulfate free conditioning shampoo. It stills provides a nice lather without all the harsh chemicals. I have been wanting to try this product and I am very happy with it!! And the price was great! Thanks</li>
            <li> Love the product&#x27;s natural and organic ingredients. It has definitely been good for my hair that has recently been keratin treated. The one drawback is the lack of a good scent, that I guess I am used to with more artificial products. Otherwise, I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> I love this Shampoo/ cleanser its great on my hair I am an African American woman and I have really soft natural hair and this product work great for me when ever I feel my hair is dirty it cleans it very well and it does not strip my hair.</li>
            <li> The product is excellent  It leaves the hair gorgeous.  I am giving it 3 as it is very expensive  .  But for that i would give 5</li>
            <li> During the winter months I will start developing eczema on my scalp, so I switched to this organic shampoo to keep away unnecessary chemicals. It not only cleared up my eczema but I&#x27;ve continued using it year round. Detangles my fine blonde hair, makes it soft and ultra touchable, not heavy at all. Very pleased. The bottle is enormous. Purchased it this May and it&#x27;s October now - still using it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through so many different brands/bottles of shampoo over the years and I have finally found the one. I used to bleach my hair often and my hair was so course. It became very unhealthy with so many split ends. A few months ago I switched to this brand because it seemed to keep out the bad ingredients and it had a good reputation. It was everything I hoped for. Since I bought it I can see clear improvement in my hair and I had no issues with the product in any way. I&#x27;ll continue to buy this product!</li>
            <li> My last salon used the old foil method of highlighting my hair and always left them on too long.  My hair got really damaged over the years and this shampoo did a great job of repairing the ends and adding strength and shine.  This seller was quick and efficient</li>
            <li> Maybe I bought the wrong thing, but this stuff leaves my hair like straw!!!  I can use it, not daily, if I mix it with an equal amount of conditioner.  After that, I have to use a leave-on conditioner to untangle it before brushing.  To be fair, I have long, dry, colored hair, and I&#x27;m somewhat long in the tooth.  Maybe it isn&#x27;t a good fit.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo. I do keratin treatments and I believe this helps maintain the treatment. Also, I love the way it feels and how nicely it suds up. It&#x27;s nice that it doesn&#x27;t contain a heap of bad ingredients like most commercial shampoos.</li>
            <li> Love it very easy to use. The only thing you have to work is the pump not friendly at first but than when it&#x27;s working not an issue.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; acts differently from others. It does clean, but mostly conditions. I have fine hair which tends to get limp and this perks it up.</li>
            <li> I had a problem with the highlighting of my hair at one point and my hairdresser told me that what ever shampoo and conditioner I have been using is the only thing that kept me from having a complete disaster ! I will absolutely NEVER use another shampoo as long as this one is available. And no it doesn&#x27;t lather as much as most, but it&#x27;s not supposed to having no sulfates in it. Fabulous product !</li>
            <li> Sadly from what everyone has said, the formulation has changed. The shampoo seems to now weigh my hair down and and make really unmanageable. I have eczema and the previous formulation worked for my dry scalp. This time it reversed the effect and I now have dry scales on my scalp. I requested a refund and they wouldn&#x27;t let me return it bc it&#x27;s a beauty product. I&#x27;m rather annoyed by this lack of service on their part.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Dermorganic Shampoo for a couple of years now. It&#x27;s by far one of the best shampoo&#x27;s i&#x27;ve ever used. It doesn&#x27;t strip hair, Foams into a luxurious lather, and keeps my very thick hair clean, silky and shiny. The natural sulfate free ingredients are an added bonus. Plus the large size bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo.  I use it every other day.  It is not too flowery, like so many shampoos are, but has a more earthy smell.  You really only need to use a little (one pump), lather and repeat.  The first lather is not too impressive.  Rinse that out and add one more pump and you&#x27;ll get all the lather you could ever want.  A good quality product that lasts much longer than a cheaper shampoo because you don&#x27;t need to use as much.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly. Undamaged and in good condition. Will purchase again</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this shampoo.  Did not need any conditioner, my hair is soft and shiny with shampoo alone.  Would recommend to anyone with fine hair like mine.</li>
            <li> The pump doesn&#x27;t reach all the way to the bottom, so I have to dump it into another contained to use the rest of the product.  Sometimes, the pump doesn&#x27;t even work, even on a new bottle.  Also, sometimes the consistency is watery, other times, it&#x27;s lumpy or really thick.  Shaking doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay shampoo.</li>
            <li> love it love it finale my hair and my wallet are in perfect harmony goodbye wen.</li>
            <li> Less hair loss &amp; no more scalp irritation...this sulfate free shampoo lathers up very well...I love it ... I use consistently &amp; will never use another shampoo again</li>
            <li> I tried this because I seem to be allergic to some shampoos. This shampoo makes my hair feel younger. I know, that sounds crazy, but my hair seems thicker than before, and shinier. I love the smell, and I love not having puffy eyes after I use it.</li>
            <li> I have been using WEN and it is a little too heavy for my medium processed long hair.  I saw this was a new product and had very good reviews and YOU GET A LOT OF IT.  I was delighted to find it cleans my hair (I do need conditioner DermOrganic Mask) and it is very soft and shinny.  Good results, good price and lots!  I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Much better for your hair as it is sulfate free... my hair stylist recommended that I get a shampoo like this and it has worked well.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo but I had an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> OKAy, if you have oily hair or scalp, this may not be your choice.  the sulfate free formulation is good for my baby fine hair.  the Argan oil works wonders.  My hair is more manageble.</li>
            <li> For the past year I&#x27;ve tried everything - H&amp;S, Prescribed Antibacterial Shampoos, and American Crew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of them helped by seborrheic dermatitis, and instead made my scalp less inhabitable for hair to grow. I was losing hair, until I started using this low-touch, organic shampoo. It has made my hair soft, strong, and combined with the leave-in treatment - changed my life and erased plenty of frustration from my life.</li>
            <li> A difference in my hair since washing it with this shampoo. I decided to try it because it is sulfate free. Obviously, when coloring hair, no one can avoid showing the silver roots because the hair is growing and the roots are coming silver color. I use DermOrganic Sulfate-Free Cond. to prevent sulfate to make my new colored hair pale and dead-looking appearance - a week after I&#x27;ve applied the color- instead of a healthy and youthful appearance. I have an abundant and coarse hair so, using this shampoo makes my hair more voluminous and have reduced itching of the scalp. To avoid to much volume, when hair still wet, I rub into my palms a small dot of Lorea&#x27;l Sulfate free color care system (bought at Amazon) and onto the hair (no the scalp), then dry and style it, accordingly</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.  Combined with our soft water, it really makes my hair feel nice and makes tons of bubbles.</li>
            <li> We really love this product. However, we can hardly use more tahn half the shampoo in the bottle because everytime the pumping mechanism breaks and it is not not able to push the shampoo out of the bottle. I do not recommend anyone buying this until the company fixes the issue.</li>
            <li> this was my first dermorganic purchase, and I love the way it makes my hair feel and has a light neutral scent that can be used by men or women.</li>
            <li> The reason it has received one star from me is because its a product that&#x27;s misleading and we as consumers dont need anymore of that from company&#x27;s. First thing is that its not organic. NOTHING ABOUT THE PRODUCT IS ORGANIC. NOT EVEN THE ARGAN OIL IN IT. Second ingredient in the product is an aionic surfactant made from coconut oil. If you have acne or sensitive skin, or if youre worried about your pores getting clogged up. DONT USE THIS PRODUCT. If you have no problems with your skin, then buy it. The shampoo itself lathers great, its amazing to me how it moisturizes your skin, but because of my type of skin it moisturizes and then clogs my pores and in a few days i have red bumps all over my face on my back and sometimes chest. It will only take two or three days of using this product before it messes your skin up. I bought this shampoo because i was under the assumption that it was organic, but of course dermorganic is just another company trying to mislead consumers who are buying the heck out of organic products to buy theirs too. In my opinion, thats not just disrespectful to someone who purchased your product but really chicken s*** way to make money. So I will be marching my behind back to the store to return the bottle i bought. I have no shame in taking a product back that does nothing for me, but at the same time i have no problem paying for a product that works for me, even if its expensive. Before trying this product i was using Rusk Shampoo. Very great shampoo but wanted to try something that didnt have the sulfates in them. Both sodium lauryl sulfate or ammonia lauryl sulfate are harsh surfactants in MOST commercial shampoos which can dry your hair and skin out. If anything ammonium lauryl sulfate is better than the other for the fact that its molecular structure is not small enough to penetrate the skin, but it can still dry your hair out. If anyone knows a truly organic shampoo that is not made of coconut oil or anything that would cause pores to getclogged please let me know in the comments. Maybe one day i will get rich enough to just have my own stuff made to cater to my needs. In the meantime, ill just be another consumer lost in the money sucking cosmetic product market. cheers.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely fabulous! I bought the small bottle for a try and now I can&#x27;t live without it. I alternate among clarifying shampoos, kerastase, joico and I use this one when I have a special night ahead of me. It is very gentle to the hair, it leaves the hair silky and nourished. It does not clean as well as the other shampoos with sulfate, but it is perfect to keep my super long curls nourished and nice! It is made of skin products... Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> The shampoo is fine.  I find my hair soft but not as much body texture as I would expect it to be.</li>
            <li> I am using the argan oil, for so many years.. and my hair shines.... love this shampoo!!!</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo! High five. My hair is wavy and fine but there&#x27;s A LOT of it. I&#x27;ve only been using the shampoo for about a week, but my hair seems less frizzled and tangled. The product is not thick; it&#x27;s actually really runny. I think it works well though. I&#x27;d recommend giving it a shot.</li>
            <li> Works great but I do notice my roots look a little oily the next day but then I just use my Batiste dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> Cap didn&#x27;t work. it didn&#x27;t pump any product out at all. its ok nothing permanent. Great shampoo!!!!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and price for sulfate free! I use it after swimming in a chlorine pool...it really seems to take the chlorine out and soften my hair. I also use it on my dog, a mini schnauzer. Otherwise, I use Pureology, which is a lot more expensive.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t care for the smell.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, lathers well, will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff. Ever since I started using it, I don&#x27;t get dandruff, my face doesn&#x27;t break out anymore, I lose less hair, and I only have to wash my hair once every 2-3 days, this is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I feel like when I read back on the reviews (which I also read prior to ordering), I am reading about a different product.  I was looking for something sulfate-free like Wen, that didn&#x27;t foam and was gentle on my hair.  This stuff leaves my fine hair feeling like straw - and I don&#x27;t process my hair, so I&#x27;m confused as to how other reviewers have had such luck with it.  This may work for thick/ coarse hair as some other reviewers have described but I DON&#x27;T recommend for fine hair.  It really just tangles and tangles and strips my hair.  It&#x27;s not good!  And, of course, it does foam which shame on me for not being more aware but I thought sulfate-free shampoos were not supposed to foam???  Anyway, not good shampoo for fine hair.  VERY disappointed.  Stick with Wen!</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;travel pack&amp;#34; is too small.  Only good for a short trip</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. I use it for facial cleanser and show gel as well. One bottle does it all. Its gentle yet nourishing.</li>
            <li> The reason I bought this shampoo is because I love the leave in Argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;My hair has a keratin treatment, and is pretty decent. My texture is about a 4a or 4b.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, it felt a little brittle, but I thought, I give it another try.&lt;br /&gt;I used it along with the conditioner, my hair was tangle and brittle, but it felt clean. To make my hair a little softer I used Neutrogena triple moisture after the wash.&lt;br /&gt;Second time I used it with the mask, and was a little better but still tangles. I will finish the bottle but  will not purchase again. Thank Goodness Neutrogena&#x27;s hair mask saves the day.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a Wen like product this is not it! You must follow up with a conditioner. This lathers and is strictly a shampoo. I was disappointed to find out I needed a conditioner. I can&#x27;t use Wen because of the almond oil. The HairOne knock off gave me a horrible reaction. I used Wen for a long time until I realized I was having issues with my allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read reviews on this and I&#x27;m sorry but those that compared this to Wen either have not used Wen or they don&#x27;t understand how Wen works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right now I&#x27;m giving this 3 stars. It left my hair tangled and I used a conditioner. I&#x27;m waiting on their masque. It did leave my hair soft but I&#x27;m not sure it is any different than my current products. My ends are dry and I was hoping this would fix the issue. Maybe with more time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the lather, I honestly think it is too much. The product doesn&#x27;t seem to have enough moisture to be called a conditioning shampoo. The lather seems to pull out moisture. Again, I&#x27;m going to give this more time and will update if things change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product smells like Ivory soap.</li>
            <li> This product is NOT organic!  It IS free of paraben free and free of other \\&quot;bad\\&quot; ingredients but it&#x27;s also free of organic ingredients.  #misleading.</li>
            <li> This product is great for your hair especially if colored. It does not dry out your hair or create build up on your scalp. Try it; you will definetley love it.  ENJOY!</li>
            <li> always a problem getting one with a pump that works</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo for dry hair.  My hair is dry due to the fact  it has a Brazilian Blow Out and also is color treated, so I can&#x27;t use shampoo with sulfates. This is the best shamoo I have ever used and its sulfate free. It cleans well, but does not dry the hair out at all. Its feels very rich and moisturizing. It is best for very dry hair, and a non oily scalp. If you have oily hair you might not like it. However, for dry, chemically treated hair, it is fabulous. I am so happy that I found it. I have never had any shampoo like it before. it is the most creamy, rich and soothing shampoo on the market. Plus it comes in a large bottle with a pump that makes it so much easier to dispense. I got the matching conditioner too. Its good too, but not as wonderful as the shampoo.  So glad I found it!</li>
            <li> Safe, affordable and effective. This shampoo cured my husband&#x27;s dry scalp within  a few shampooings. We will be sure to reorder it. Love Amazon Prime!</li>
            <li> so this is a shampoo that my wife wanted and I found it here on Amazon about $20 cheaper than what I find in stores for.  I have seen reviews about people saying that they get a watered down product of this I have ordered this twice and have not had that problem as a matter of fact this stuff is so thick it&#x27;s hard to get the last little bit out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Wish it had more conditioner.  I feel like my hair gets really tangly when I use it.  I purchased it because I was looking for a hight quality 2 in 1.  I&#x27;m still looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  After using this for a few weeks, my hair is great, it doesn&#x27;t get as oily and it is shiny and soft.  I would recommend.  Just takes a minute for your hair to adjust.</li>
            <li> I have very thick (for a white girl), baby fine hairs. My hair has never felt better, been softer, more manageable, smooth, silkier or healthier. This is the most amazing product I have ever tried. I have to mail order it as I live in Canada but never would ever think of switching. Though you have to make the \\&quot;sulfate free\\&quot; switch. Look at your shampoo bottle and the first ingredient after water is usually a sulfate. Google that ingredient. After you make the switch, pick up this product. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve used in a long time and it stopped my scalp itch the first time I used it.  Smells good too!</li>
            <li> I have very itchy dry scalp and fine thick hair. This shampoo is great for fine hair-it doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down. But after about 5 shampoos--you have to use something else for the build-up. It does help with the itchy, dry scalp till the build-up sets in (makes me think it&#x27;s not truly sulfate-free).</li>
            <li> DermOrganic is the only shampoo we use. LOVE LOVE LOVE this. It won&#x27;t strip your hair, leaves it silky shiny and so lightweight. I can go 3 days without washing my hair again when using this shampoo. It&#x27;s a life changer. My husband starting using it and is now addicted as well.</li>
            <li> Very misleading product. Not one organic ingredient in it.&lt;br /&gt;The products name is &amp;#34;DermOrganic&amp;#34; to confuse people into thinking that this product is natural.&lt;br /&gt;Pathetic marketing attempt to sell a product that needs all the help it can get.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all I&#x27;ll use on my hair.  I have colored hair and it&#x27;s gentle enough that it doesn&#x27;t strip or change the color of my hair.  It was first recommended to me by my hairdresser some years ago and although it may seem a little pricey it&#x27;s so worth it plus it lasts a long time.  I have thick, long hair just past my shoulders and a bottle of this shampoo will last me close to 6 months.</li>
            <li> After getting my hair straightened, it was recommended I buy a sulfate-free shampoo. After doing much research and reading reviews, I tried this brand and loved it at first. Now, after having used the shampoo for over a month, I have to say, it&#x27;s ok. I do, however, love the conditioner and oil treatment in this line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for almost 2 months now and I have to say, I don&#x27;t really like it. There isn&#x27;t anything moisturizing about it. But, I do still like their conditioner and oil treatment. Not sure I&#x27;ll buy this again when the container is used up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for two years now and still love it.  I have skin allergies and regular shampoos irritate my scalp.  This shampoo has completely eliminated that problem.</li>
            <li> I ordered two of theses. They were packed well and arrived promptly. Would definitely recommend it to others for purchase.</li>
            <li> This is one of those products that is amazing, but it depends on the person. The shampoo keeps my hair just as clean for just as long as sulfate shampoos. It is NOT supposed to lather like a regular shampoo...duh! It&#x27;s sulfate free! Crazy lather is bad for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite part about this product is that after I dry my hair feels light. I have very thick hair and regular shampoos weigh my hair down, i feel like the shampoo is never really out, and it&#x27;s hard to manage. Dermorganics makes my hair way soft and smooth and just like it&#x27;s is REALLY clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad things: only bad thing is how hard it is to get out of the bottle sometimes. The pump will stop working because it is so thick that it won&#x27;t go up the tube anymore so you&#x27;ll have to manually shake some out.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the conditioner is nothing special..don&#x27;t waste money on it. Use the shampoo and then buy a regular, cheap sulfate-free conditioner at Target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, do NOT BUY AT A BEAUTY SUPPLY STORE. Buy it on Amazon (22$ for giant 33ozs or 16$ at beauty store for 12 oz), or at places like TJ Maxx I have seen giant bottles for 20$. Just don&#x27;t pay full price, it&#x27;s unnecessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you just want to try it, there&#x27;s also sample sizes for way cheaper and you can try it without the commitment and to see if it works for your hair type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: light, good scent, thoroughly cleans and thoroughly washes out, moisturizing but still cleans!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Makes my hair look amazing. Soft, shiny and smooth.  I won&#x27;t use anything else. A little goes a long way too.</li>
            <li> Due to Celiac&#x27;s Disease, we bought his product and have not had the need to look anywhere else.  They also make a conditioner that smells wonderful and feels wonderful too.  All GLUTEN FREE too!</li>
            <li> stocking up. a value, thanks!</li>
            <li> It really wasn&#x27;t that great. The product feels very watery and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel nice after shampooing. Maybe it&#x27;s cuz I didnt get the conditioner as well.</li>
            <li> I rarely stick with a hair care regimen through more than two bottles - this is the exception. I have wavey-curly hair, processed, live in a damp climate that creates frizz and swim in chlorine at least twice a week. This doesn&#x27;t suds for me, which is fine since lather is not indicative of cleansing ability. I use the conditioner as well. Love what it does for my hair.</li>
            <li> The lady that does my hair commented that I really needed to have a sulfate free shampoo because the shampoos I had been fine in drugstores were damaging my hair.  I am a redhead, and tend to have thick hair.  I saw a noticeable difference within days.  My hair is a lot softer and smoother and doesn&#x27;t frizz as much as it used to.  I wash my hair daily and have been using the same bottle for approximately one month or more.  I have longer hair past the shoulders and I find five pumps works really well. The shampoo leaves my hair feeling fresh and clean and weightless.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Sadly this shampoo was too drying for me personally, but I love the ingredients and it&#x27;s worth a try if you want to switch to a sulfate-free and paraben-free shampoo. I ended up shelling out for Moroccan Oil because it offers more moisture for my hair, but if this works for you it&#x27;s a bargain.</li>
            <li> It says it has an \\&quot;rich luxurious lather\\&quot; on the back, and it is the total opposite of that. Maybe its just my hair, but the lather is terrible and it doesn&#x27;t feel like its cleaning my hair at all. Obviously, I somewhat expected it to be like that, because its sulfate free. I just don&#x27;t like how they put that on the back. It makes me wonder about what else they claim. Other than that, its an okay shampoo. I definitely recommend it if you can find it for a cheap price. They sell this shampoo at TJ Maxx for 33.8 oz. for only $20. I&#x27;d say its worth about that price.</li>
            <li> I really liked this shampoo, I had been using Pantene for a while but it usually dries up my scalp and makes it very itchy so I had to go shopping for a new shampoo.  Luckily I found the trial sized package of this at Marshalls and fell in love, had to go back to Marshalls and buy the liter.  It&#x27;s super gentle and makes my hair feel moisturized, smooth and clean.  The shampoo lathers nicely and has a good smell too.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. Smells great and leaves your hair sooo soft. The bottle is HUGE so it lasts a very long time too.</li>
            <li> I found this at local TJ maxx and decided to try it out. Wow. One bottle down, buying another. Now - shampoo has a weird texture. It is exactly the way my dad&#x27;s german-made shaving cream used to be 30 yrs ago - thick and rich, not only that, the smell is similar. So it is not like any other shampoo. It foams (not bubbles!) profusely, it is rich and gentle, when you are rinsing (even before the conditioner) your hair will feel silky. I love it. That being said... I quit using their conditioner and serum - they are nothing special. So if you want to try all 3, buy a sample (i think 1 oz each) kit vs full size one. You might like all, or like me - just their stellar shampoo.</li>
            <li> i purchased it from a local store thinking it would prove better for my hair and scalp....but im quite disappointed by it...i have medium thick,frizzy asian hair....and this shampoo makes my hair like STRAW....and my scalp doesnt feel any better......i have to put alot of conditioner and serum after washing my hair with it...</li>
            <li> This shampoo does nothing for my hair.  I always use sulfate free so it&#x27;s not that I am not used to something that doesn&#x27;t lather, I just don&#x27;t feel like it washes the styling product out of my hair.  I didn&#x27;t return it because i used it a few times. It has since been relegated to back-up shampoo, or I use it on my dog. Sometimes I even use it as shaving cream in the shower. It&#x27;s good for that! Lol</li>
            <li> Nice cleansing with hair hydration as the aftermath. Perfect texture.Optimal product performance without buildup or residue. Large bottle will last a while.</li>
            <li> I just put keratin in my hair and was looking for a new shampoo and conditioner to keep the keratin good, this did the job.  My hair comes out feat with this product, I just wash and go.  I have long blonde hair and it feels like silk, which is difficult because my hair is highlighted and tends to be dry.  I would recommend this to anyone, whether or not u have keratin in it.</li>
            <li> this works wonderfully on my curly hair...my hair is stronger and less frizzy...I also use the conditioning masque and the leave in oil</li>
            <li> After using this product my hair was left feeling extremely dry and brittle. I have thick course hair. Currently I am transitioning from a perm to my natural texture, and this left both types of my hair feeling terrible. I tried using the conditioner to help it, but it made it worse.</li>
            <li> Towards the end of the bottle it stopped coming out of the pump and so I naturally removed the top but was sad to see it clump/dry up so quickly. Not my pick for shampoo.</li>
            <li> Wow!  I swim almost daily and my hair can turn into straw.  This shampoo is amazing ... Really helps keep it healthy!</li>
            <li> This is sulfate free, my main reason for purchasing. A lot of people complaining it&#x27;s not totally organic. How do you creat a shampoo that cleans hair that is totally organic? Go rub mint leaves in your hair to clean it if you need totally organic. I do home keratin treatments on my thick coarse wavy frizzy hair every 4 months and since that is definately not organic and somewhat toxic I want it to last as long as possible, and this shampoo delivers - cleans without removing the keratin treatment. Takes an entire 4-5 months for the treatment to wash out. Other sulfate free shampoos I&#x27;ve used have not been so successful and a lot more expensive. This has no overwhelming flowery perfume smell, cleans well. Love it. Far less expensive than brand name sulfate free shampoos, I use this even if I don&#x27;t do a keratin treatment as it is far less harsh than detergent &amp; sulfate shampoos.</li>
            <li> Have only been able to review this shampoo after using for a week. Shampoo comes out clean and shiny, and kind of looks like lotion. But this does leave the hair clean. Not sure about shiny and smooth, but it could just be the weather in my city (dry air). Nonetheless, you can&#x27;t beat the price for the size of it.</li>
            <li> What is it that was delivered to me? This shampoo is nothing like the shampoo I have been using for 3 years. I do not know if the manufacturer changed the formula or if the seller added some cheap soap in to the original product. The smell is horrible, and consistency changed to watery. I am comparing the old left overs I bought a year ago and this product. It looks almost the same but when it comes out of the bottle, I almost can see original foamy substance and then watery creamy nasty chemical that should not be part of it. If the manufacturer changed the formula, I would like the evidence of it, otherwise it makes me think- somebody else diluted it with who knows what. I would like to return it!</li>
            <li> About a few months back, I started using American Crew because of how dry my hair is with regular tresemme shampoo or whatever my parents buy. I decided to look up on others like American Crew except more Organic. I found this with good reviews and decided to try it. My hair is soft and doesn&#x27;t look dry at all. My hair used to stay up spiked in the front, without gel for years and I like it since I didn&#x27;t have to use any product. (Note: because it was dry or maybe it was just able to do that). This shampoo has made it soft and natural that its having a lil hard time staying up and it actually bothers me because I like my hair short and spiked up front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just try out this product and 99.5% of you will love it. I don&#x27;t get dandruffs anymore nor get itchy scalp</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this shampoo and let me assure you all I have used them ALL!!!!  From 99 cent shampoo to $35 a bottle.  So far what I like most about this is that it is affordable, cleans hair well and rinses out quickly, doesn’t have a overpowering perfume fragrance and is sulfate-free.  I use it with the conditioner and the treatment oil is a must.  I have very fine hair it it does not weigh it down.  So if you are looking for a good quality shampoo and I do recommend using the conditioner and oil, give this one a try.  I am so picky when it comes to hair products that I too am surprised that I like it this much.</li>
            <li> this works. my keratin has lasted. so no need to buy a very expensive shampoo. funnily enough my keratin did nothing for me when I was in Europe. that&#x27;s so weird because when I came back to the US my hair regained their straightness.... weird</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for several years and really liked it.  I&#x27;m sensitive to cocamidopropyl betaine (a foaming agent also known as CAPB and other names) and this was one of the few good shampoos on the market that didn&#x27;t contain it.  After receiving my last shipment, I noticed the scent and consistency of the product was different.  And, within days, my face and neck were irritated and breaking out.  I called the company to ask if the formula had been changed, and they confirmed that it had.  So if you, like me, were using this product as a gentle alternative to the 99% of available shampoos that have CAPB - be forewarned.  I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to protect my newly colored hair. It leaves my hair feeling clean and silky. Excellent value for such a large bottle and great service too! I look forward to trying more products soon.</li>
            <li> This product after seven times used caused crazy dandruff and itchy scalp, i hated it and wished didnt buy it, i know its different from hair to another, but if this product is truly organic, then my scalp wouldnt have dandruff at least. So i highly NOT recommended...</li>
            <li> I love this!! I have finally found a shampoo that works great on curly hair.  It leaves your hair silky soft and no frizz!!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, although it arrived with a non working pump. I&#x27;m trying to get Amazon.com  to just send a replacement pump, but it looks like  I have to return the whole bottle of shampoo in order to get a new pump. Seems silly.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get the product in the time frame I was told. Otherwise product is great.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. I get a smaller bottle and refill from the big one and save TONs</li>
            <li> What a shame. I used to LOVE LOVE LOVE this shampoo, despite the faulty pump. I just poured it into a squeeze bottle. But my latest bottle smelled peculiar and had separated into a watery component and an oddly grainy component. No amount of shaking fixed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to submit a complaint to the company that distributes the shampoo, Healthy Sexy Beauty, but although Amazon asks you to do just that, they make it literally impossible to do so via their customer service maze. So I submitted the complaint to Amazon instead. That was several days ago, and I&#x27;ve heard nothing from them or the distributor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Way to ruin a good product and kill your customer goodwill.</li>
            <li> Is not as organic as it wants to appear. Thought I would try it. I&#x27;m allergic to a lot of ingediencies , so just Gona stick with my old tried and true method. Cheaper to used baking soda and apple cider vinegar. Just rinse well. Can&#x27;t bet $2 for about a month if product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this great shampoo by DermOrganic would be great on any hair but for my particularly difficult (fine/thin/processed/aging) hair, this shampoo is nothing short of a revelation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I can tell in one shot if a product is meh, decent or A-Ok. This shampoo, however, blew me away: My hair looks much thicker, FEELS twice as thick, looks and feels silkier with clear revival of my color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me ladies: I&#x27;ve tried &#x27;em all. From WEN (don&#x27;t bother), Biolage, Paul Mitchell, Redken, KMS, you name it) this shampoo is IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I had to get past the very lotion-like texture- it bills itself as looking like facial moisturizer and it does- it lathers up beautifully although it&#x27;s SULFATE-FREE- and completely cleansed my 3-days&#x27; dirty hair in one shot (out of habit, I lathered, rinsed &amp; repeated but it wasn&#x27;t necessary).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve thought about hair extensions, Minoxidil and done the keratin-packed conditioners (good up to a point and they leave your hair limp and too soft)..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just skip it girls and buy this. It works, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I was not sure if this product would work but I was pleasantly surprised. My hair is softer and shinier. I love it!</li>
            <li> My wife was sold some by her stylist of the moment. This is a great shampoo, undeniably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also a thick foamy gel in a pump bottle whose feed tube stops far from the bottom. This means that perhaps an inch and a half... two inches: A LOT OF SHAMPOO IS TRAPPED IN THE BOTTLE. The pump can&#x27;t get at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solution: start a cut at the top of the bottle with a saw. Finish cutting the top off with heavy shears. Find a jar-top that will fit over the bottle remnant so as to protect the shampoo from water. Scoop out portions with your fingers. There are scores of shampoos left in there. We&#x27;ve been using the bottle this way for many weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just ridiculous.</li>
            <li> So far so good; I have only used it twice.  It has Almost no suds.  I believe it is a good buy for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I alternate products that I  use to wash my hair.  I like the pump that comes with it......no waste.&lt;br /&gt;Dr. D</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for about 6 months now and it has definately improved my scalp and the condition of my hair, which is curly, dry, color-treated.  Great lather for a sulfate free shampoo!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo! It is gently but effective and I have used it on permed and color treated hair. Seems to be made from quality ingredients and one of the few shampoos I have found that isn&#x27;t made in China.</li>
            <li> I have a citric allergy and was using an almond shampoo I could only order through Caswell-Masey.&lt;br /&gt;They stopped making the shampoo and I was on the hunt for another shampoo/conditioner. This line is&lt;br /&gt;wonderful! I use it all the time. Even after I color. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It doesnt foam up as much as other shampoos, but it doesnt have that bad sulfate stuff, so its not supposed to. I havent been using it very long, so I cant attest to its effectiveness. It doesnt smell bad, but not good either, which to me just means that there&#x27;s no unnecessary ingredients.</li>
            <li> Your product has help me from loosing tons of hair.  I have been diagnosed with Celiac Disease and it took a lot of education regarding this illness.  It is not just ingesting food but anything that you apply to your body as well.  Please continue to produce this product.</li>
            <li> A couple of years ago my hair stylist gave my hair a keratin treatment. The keratin treatment opened a whole new world of manageable hair for me; no more bangs that do funky waves instead of just hanging down straight, no more frizzing, etc. But to maintain the effects of the keratin treatments (if the hair&#x27;s cared for properly they last for a few months), I was told to use a sulfate-free shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My stylist sold me a bottle of this shampoo, and I&#x27;ve used it ever since. It&#x27;s not cheap, but it&#x27;s truly sulfate-free. I&#x27;ve read the ingredients on shampoo bottles in stores and in online shopping site listings. This is one of the few shampoos on the market that is truly free of sodium laureth sulfate. Even so-called \\&quot;all natural\\&quot; shampoos contain that sulfate ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been buying this shampoo in liter bottles here at Amazon. Sometimes consistency is a problem; I got one bottle that seemed half-watery, half-thickened. But usually a good occasional shake-and-stir resolves the problem. The shampoo in the bottle I&#x27;ve almost used up right now, got thick and hard to pump; I added some hot tap water to it, shook/stirred it, and solved that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My keratin treatments last nicely, and I like the way this shampoo isn&#x27;t harsh on my hair. It lathers up, perhaps not as much as other shampoos, but generously enough to get the job done. I now have a short hairstyle and no dry hair or split ends issues to deal with, and haven&#x27;t conditioned my hair in the year since I had it cut short. This shampoo is that kind to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDITED on March 18, 2013 to add: My latest liter sized pump bottle of this shampoo has been sitting on the shelf for a few weeks until I used up my earlier one. I got very efficient and tossed out the old liter bottle, and then it took a few days to use up the shampoo I&#x27;d kept in a small bottle I&#x27;d filled for a trip. So yesterday I grabbed the new pump bottle - and the pump doesn&#x27;t work. No way; I tried everything, but it won&#x27;t pop up to the open position. And of course the old liter pump bottle was long gone so I couldn&#x27;t reuse the pump from it. But I stumbled on to this solution. I went to a Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply store thinking I&#x27;d buy a nice sized plastic bottle to put the shampoo in. But I found they sell the actual pump top thing for a couple of bucks. I eyeballed one that looked the right size, bought it, brought it home, and HOORAY! It fits, and it works. Much better to spend a couple of bucks for a replacement pump mechanism than hassle with trying to get a seller to ship me a new one.but it won&#x27;t pop up to the open position.

            <li> This is the onlu shampoo I will use anymore.  After chemo my hair came in thin and curly.  With this product it seems to be gaining in strength and seems thicker.</li>
            <li> My first reaction when opening this shampoo was total revulsion by the scent. It isn&#x27;t a completely unpleasant odor... But it smells exactly like the low-grade soap you get from any public washroom. It smells like the blue stuff they fill the Porta-Potties with. I could not wait to give it a rotten review on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;ve used it on my kids several times, and once I got over thinking their hair smelled like I&#x27;d washed it in a sink at the airport, I had to admit it was pretty great. They have sensitive skin, and so far, no issues with that. It is super gentle and does not over-strip, but it gets them nice and clean without a greasy residue. Their hair is soft with no tangles, and no additional conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, their hair smells much better after it is dry! I know this sounds picky, but despite the fragrance, I think I will be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> Lathers nicely without using a lot. I saw on Dr. Oz that for older hair, a sulfate-free shampoo, followed by a little argan oil, helps with the dryness and fly-aways. Leaves my hair soft and shiny, but I can&#x27;t say &amp;#34;manageable,&amp;#34; because my hair is too short to be unmanageable! As others have noted, it is NOT organic, so the name is somewhat deceiving. Keep in mind this is a 1-liter bottle (which makes it a bargain), that&#x27;s a lot of shampoo and it is HEAVY! If you use it in the shower and have a hard time bending over, keep a reacher handy in case you drop it--and be careful not to drop it on your foot!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the greatest shampoo. It doesn&#x27;t smell very good, and it is very thin. It does clean my hair, but not like you would expect from sulfate free shampoo. I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it&#x27;s labeled sulfate free shampoo.  From the previous sulfate free shampoos  I&#x27;ve had before they don&#x27;t lather and I don&#x27;t need conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS shampoo does lather and it does the job. But I&#x27;m not pleased with the way my hair feels after I rinsed.  I HAVE to use conditioner while using this product. If I don&#x27;t then my hair feels heavy and too squeaky clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also using the shampoo as a body wash, so I&#x27;ll use the product faster and dob&#x27;t want to go through the trouble of returning it. I&#x27;m pleased that it&#x27;s a dual purpose product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I won&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li> Great Product!! Recommended for daily use..I thought being an organic shampoo it wont give much lather as regular one does..No but it was great..Happy with the product :)</li>
