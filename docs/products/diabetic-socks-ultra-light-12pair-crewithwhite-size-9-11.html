            <li>I am very happy with the quality and comfort of these socks.</li>
            <li>They are still the best I&#x27;ve found, but they do have their flaws.</li>

            <li>No, these socks aren&#x27;t perfect, but for the price they&#x27;re the best I have found so far.</li>
            <li>So I guess I&#x27;ll be a good wife and order some in the mens size.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t lose their shape which is a good thing, also.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;d not been buying good quality socks???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>they are great and very comfortable ..</li>
            <li>They do give a nice even distibution of snugginess which is good for feet and ankles that swell.</li>
            <li>These socks have perfect elasticity throughout, but they are a bit hot and scratchy for me.  </li>
            <li>these are great socks easy for him to put on with no help can&#x27;t beat the price on these.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>great bargain and really comfortable.</li>
            <li>They have a nice grip without tightening around your ankles or around your arch.  </li>
            <li>Colored polyester socks made my feat too warm all day.</li>
            <li>We were asked to find this kind of sock to minimize pressure to my Father&#x27;s feet.  </li>
            <li>But let me tell you, this is by far the best thing that happened to me since I became a diabetic.</li>
            <li>My mother is thrilled and I have ordered more for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are very comfortable and are holding up nicely.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>She said they are very comfortable and don&#x27;t &amp;#34;fall down&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>These socks let the air circulate and are very comfortable.</li>
            <li>and I am pleased to announce they passed with flying colors.</li>
            <li>I will not be purchasing any more though from here....</li>
            <li>and they are not finished on the top as the pix shows.</li>
            <li>am 100% satisfied with my purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am going to buy more for my husband.</li>
            <li>I am not diabetic but love the way the tops of the sock do not bind my lower leg and ankles.  </li>
            <li>love to wear them.</li>
            <li>They seem to holding up well after many washings.</li>
            <li>will purchase more..</li>
            <li>These are the best thing that have happened to my feet and legs in a long time!</li>
            <li>These are about the best diabetic socks I have worn and I have looked around a while, have ordered other products and returned most.  </li>
            <li>I purchased these cheap diabetic socks recentely.</li>
            <li>what a cheap product...unraveling before even wearing, then as another reviewer says, the socks say size 9-11....</li>
            <li>she liked it so much and already ordered 2 packages for her and her friends.</li>
            <li>These socks are quite comfortable and a god value at the price.</li>
            <li>and he told me he loves it, and its comfortable.  </li>
            <li>They fit well and relive some of my foot irritations.</li>
            <li>but they are so comfortable.</li>
            <li>They are really good and soft  </li>
            <li>good deal, comfortable, not tight but stay up no problem</li>
            <li>I might sound like a lunatic that I get so excited over socks.  </li>
            <li>These socks are super light weight</li>
            <li>However, my husband fell in love with them and snagged the whole order from me.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for offering these great socks for such an affordable price.</li>
            <li>They are soft with a loose compression, which is great for my blood circulation and its firm enough to give you the compression you need &amp; holds up beautifully on your legs and fits into my walking shoes very nicely.</li>
            <li>After a year, he asked me again for a new set :)</li>
            <li>They are soft and very comfortable to wear.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect top of the line for this price, but I expected more than what I got.  </li>
            <li>Good for persons with diabetes as well as anyone who wants a comfortable, modestly priced white cotton sock.</li>
            <li>Thanks you ARROWSON!</li>
            <li>They are flimsy, unraveled at the top and all around low quality.</li>
            <li>These are exactly what my husband needs.  </li>
            <li>These fit softly over compression tube materials that he has to keep on.</li>
            <li>If you want a super soft sock that doesn&#x27;t cut off your circulation and still stays up, then this is the sock for you.  </li>
            <li>First impression was that they run a little small, I wear a size 9 shoe, otherwise good value, they stretch out upon wear, very comfortable</li>
            <li>I was looking for diabetic socks for my very elderly father....</li>
            <li>They are stretchy, but my cotton socks are much smoother.</li>
            <li>It is really recommended to buy them.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li>Very happ with purchase.</li>
            <li>but I really like these socks.</li>
            <li>They did not stay pulled up, seemed to  get stretched easily</li>
            <li>so much I&#x27;ve purchased an additional two dozen pairs to be sure I can replace those I currently wear when they finally wear out.</li>
            <li>Diabetic socks are super confortable, especially to people with circulatory problems.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping these would be a little thicker than they are so as to protect my feet better.</li>
            <li>And a few pair were already unraveling at the top.</li>
            <li>I love these and wear them everyday.</li>
            <li>They have held up extremely well, and are comfortable.</li>
            <li>These with the genuine Birkenstocks I bought on Amazon last week have made my legs and feet feel almost human again!</li>
            <li>I spent so much money and time trying to find the right socks for my swollen legs (even here on Amazon) but nothing was close to these.  </li>
            <li>WHEN WE RECEIVED THE PACKAGE, IT CLEARLY STATES SHOE SIZE 6-8.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve held up well with a modest bit of shrinkage.</li>
            <li>Soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are so soft tho.</li>
            <li>I havn&#x27;t worn these socks yet but their shabby appearance has already left me feeling that I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, these are very soft to the touch and have enough elasticity to stay up, but don&#x27;t constrict at all.  </li>
            <li>They are not super soft, but with the neuropathy, it&#x27;s kind of hard to tell...</li>
            <li>I WOULD HAVE PURCHASED A BIGGER SIZE IF AMAZON HAD CLEARLY STATED THE SIZE.</li>
            <li>There are so many diabetic socks that are falsely listed that it is such a relief to find these.</li>
            <li>the only thing wrong with them is the tops of the socks unvaval very easily</li>
            <li>My dad really enjoys his socks because they are not too tight or cut off his circulation in his legs.</li>

            <li> My dad really enjoys his socks because they are not too tight or cut off his circulation in his legs.</li>
            <li> These are not bad for cheap, ankle-length chew socks (considering the price for 12), but are worthless as support or diabetic socks.  </li>
            <li> These are enormous (they are too long) and are too stretchy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have bought similar socks from other places but they were much more expensive-</li>
            <li> I received my diabetic socks earlier than expected and that was a plus.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I received these socks some of them already had loose hanging threads.</li>
            <li> There was a little shrinkage, but that actually worked on my behalf...</li>
            <li> Not sure how long these will last, but will keep them because it is easier than returning them....</li>
            <li> The minimal pressure does not impair his already impaired circulation.</li>
            <li> The type of cotton was thick and not as soft as other brands of diabetic sock.</li>
            <li> They did not leave constriction marks on your ankles because they were so loose and promptly slid down your ankles.  </li>
            <li> and I am trying to get him out of those other socks he was wearing that was hindering his circulation.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve washed the socks with my other whites (with detergent and chlorine bleach) and dried them in the electric dryer (written instructions notwithstanding).</li>
            <li> I needed them a little shorter.</li>
            <li> I waited until I had washed and dried them before I wrote a review</li>
            <li> I had been having trouble with some socks bothering my feet and lower legs.</li>
            <li> Usually is about $3.97 per each pairs.  </li>
            <li> Not as thin as I expected</li>
            <li> They run small though.</li>
            <li> these socks are extremely ROUGH AND HARD ON THE FEET!!  </li>
            <li> Because I have severe edema and neuropathy, finding socks that are non-binding, yet thin enough to accomadate my feet as they increasingly swell as the day goes by is difficult...</li>
            <li> Some people have complained that these socks are flimsy.</li>
            <li> After washing a couple times I found the socks are a bit delicate.</li>
            <li> My elderly mom has fungus on all of her toe nails and other painful foot problems.  </li>
            <li> Contrary to their description, there is an uncomfortable toe seam.  </li>
            <li> He has extremely poor circulation and suffers from ulcerations in his feet.  </li>
            <li> My father will wear them, though, because he has bad circulation</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with these socks.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> If you want a super soft sock that doesn&#x27;t cut off your circulation and still stays up, then this is the sock for you.  These socks are super light weight and I was concerned that they wouldn&#x27;t stay up and I would be pulling up my socks all day.  Well, that is not the case.  They stay where I put them, my feet don&#x27;t sweat and they keep their shape all day.  My husband is so jealous.  So I guess I&#x27;ll be a good wife and order some in the mens size.  5 thumbs up!!!!</li>
            <li> Diabetic socks are super confortable, especially to people with circulatory problems.  They have a nice grip without tightening around your ankles or around your arch.  I ussually buy them at Wal-Mart but decided to try them when I saw the price.  For $17.00 bucks I received 12 pairs of socks.  Usually is about $3.97 per each pairs.  Do your math!  Affordabililty and quality are the key.</li>
            <li> These are the best thing that have happened to my feet and legs in a long time! Because I have severe edema and neuropathy, finding socks that are non-binding, yet thin enough to accomadate my feet as they increasingly swell as the day goes by is difficult...yet these socks have worked out perfectly! They are not super soft, but with the neuropathy, it&#x27;s kind of hard to tell...LOL! I do know that they do not cut into my legs and so my circulation is not cut off anymore than if I had no socks on. That is a big plus for me. I waited until I had washed and dried them before I wrote a review and I am pleased to announce they passed with flying colors. There was a little shrinkage, but that actually worked on my behalf...I needed them a little shorter. The actual foot size stayed the same. No, these socks aren&#x27;t perfect, but for the price they&#x27;re the best I have found so far. These with the genuine Birkenstocks I bought on Amazon last week have made my legs and feet feel almost human again! Now they can swell all day and I don&#x27;t feel a thing!!! Thanks Amazon for offering these great socks for such an affordable price. I&#x27;m off to buy another 12 pack!</li>
            <li> Los compré ya anteriormenten y los uso prácticamente a diario, excepto cuando utilizo trajes o suites y ropa de salida. He vuelto a comprarlos porque, sin duda, son superiores a cualquier otro.</li>
            <li> These are not bad for cheap, ankle-length chew socks (considering the price for 12), but are worthless as support or diabetic socks.  I might have given them three or four stars if they had just been listed as socks, but since they are described as \\&quot;diabetic socks\\&quot; I rated them on that function.</li>
            <li> I purchased these cheap diabetic socks recentely. When I received these socks some of them already had loose hanging threads. And a few pair were already unraveling at the top. I havn&#x27;t worn these socks yet but their shabby appearance has already left me feeling that I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> These are about the best diabetic socks I have worn and I have looked around a while, have ordered other products and returned most.  I am very happy with the quality and comfort of these socks.</li>
            <li> I was looking for diabetic socks for my very elderly father....found these...ordered them....got them...what a cheap product...unraveling before even wearing, then as another reviewer says, the socks say size 9-11....however, when you get them, the package says shoe size 6 - 8.  Then, when I look here on line, they are located under womens socks...I didn&#x27;t specify a sex when searching for them, just put in diabetic socks....  My father will wear them, though, because he has bad circulation and I am trying to get him out of those other socks he was wearing that was hindering his circulation.  Not sure how long these will last, but will keep them because it is easier than returning them....I will not be purchasing any more though from here....and they are not finished on the top as the pix shows.</li>
            <li> I am so dissapointed in these socks!!  while i have several pair of socks from Dr Scholls...these cannot compare. these socks are extremely ROUGH AND HARD ON THE FEET!!  NEVER AGAIN!!</li>
            <li> I received my diabetic socks earlier than expected and that was a plus.&lt;br /&gt;They are very comfortable and are holding up nicely.&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t lose their shape which is a good thing, also.&lt;br /&gt;I am 100% satisfied with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Donnakay Ortega&lt;br /&gt;Fisher, Il</li>
            <li> I might sound like a lunatic that I get so excited over socks.  But let me tell you, this is by far the best thing that happened to me since I became a diabetic. I spent so much money and time trying to find the right socks for my swollen legs (even here on Amazon) but nothing was close to these.  They are soft with a loose compression, which is great for my blood circulation and its firm enough to give you the compression you need &amp; holds up beautifully on your legs and fits into my walking shoes very nicely. Thanks you ARROWSON! You got a customer for life and I will defiantly recommend these socks to everyone.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect top of the line for this price, but I expected more than what I got.  They are flimsy, unraveled at the top and all around low quality.</li>
            <li> I was hoping these would be a little thicker than they are so as to protect my feet better. I wasn&#x27;t thinking that ultra light meant ultra thin. They are stretchy, but my cotton socks are much smoother. I&#x27;m not used to socks with nylon in them. I hope I can get used to these!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I bought 1 pair for my aunt  she liked it so much and already ordered 2 packages for her and her friends. They are really good and soft  It is really recommended to buy them.</li>
            <li> Some people have complained that these socks are flimsy. I can say that they do appear that way, but I have had them for months and they get washed every week. They have held up extremely well, and are comfortable. I would buy these again, and I recommend them.</li>
            <li> they are great and very comfortable .. the only thing wrong with them is the tops of the socks unvaval very easily</li>
            <li> Bought the socks as a gift.  The recipient loves them.  She said they are very comfortable and don&#x27;t &amp;#34;fall down&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> These socks are quite comfortable and a god value at the price. Good for persons with diabetes as well as anyone who wants a comfortable, modestly priced white cotton sock. I&#x27;ve washed the socks with my other whites (with detergent and chlorine bleach) and dried them in the electric dryer (written instructions notwithstanding). They&#x27;ve held up well with a modest bit of shrinkage. I like these socks so much I&#x27;ve purchased an additional two dozen pairs to be sure I can replace those I currently wear when they finally wear out.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my father because he has diabetic and he told me he loves it, and its comfortable.  After a year, he asked me again for a new set :)</li>
            <li> These socks are truly non-binding. There are so many diabetic socks that are falsely listed that it is such a relief to find these. My mother is thrilled and I have ordered more for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have to revise my 5 star rating, though. After washing a couple times I found the socks are a bit delicate. I&#x27;m going to have to do some hand stitching on the tops to keep them from unraveling as they aren&#x27;t as finished as seen in the image. They are still the best I&#x27;ve found, but they do have their flaws.</li>
            <li> Not as thin as I expected but I am happy with them. The service was great.</li>
            <li> My elderly mom has fungus on all of her toe nails and other painful foot problems.  I bought these socks on a whim based on them being &amp;#34;Ultra Light.&amp;#34;  She became hooked to them the moment she put them on...it is nothing short of a miracle!  Great product!</li>
            <li> Colored polyester socks made my feat too warm all day. These socks let the air circulate and are very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Good quality. They run small though. I am going to buy more for my husband.</li>
            <li> good deal, comfortable, not tight but stay up no problem</li>
            <li> I am not diabetic but love the way the tops of the sock do not bind my lower leg and ankles.  Great value and quality</li>
            <li> THE SOCKS ARE LABLED 9-11. WHEN WE RECEIVED THE PACKAGE, IT CLEARLY STATES SHOE SIZE 6-8. MY MOM IS DIABETIC AND WEARS A SIZE 10 SHOE. I WOULD HAVE PURCHASED A BIGGER SIZE IF AMAZON HAD CLEARLY STATED THE SIZE. LR</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with these socks.  Contrary to their description, there is an uncomfortable toe seam.  They did not stay pulled up, seemed to  get stretched easily and they rode into your shoes.  They did not leave constriction marks on your ankles because they were so loose and promptly slid down your ankles.  The type of cotton was thick and not as soft as other brands of diabetic sock.</li>
            <li> First impression was that they run a little small, I wear a size 9 shoe, otherwise good value, they stretch out upon wear, very comfortable</li>
            <li> They are soft and very comfortable to wear.  The price is reasonable.  I would recommend them to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;I love to wear them.</li>
            <li> Soft. Stay up. Very happ with purchase.</li>
            <li> just what I wanted!!! I have bought similar socks from other places but they were much more expensive- great bargain and really comfortable. excellent service- good company--- kudos!!!</li>
            <li> They fit well and relive some of my foot irritations.</li>
            <li> These socks have perfect elasticity throughout, but they are a bit hot and scratchy for me.  After foot surgery, my incisions are still a bit tender.  However, my husband fell in love with them and snagged the whole order from me.  They do give a nice even distibution of snugginess which is good for feet and ankles that swell.</li>
            <li> Anyone can wear these.  I am not diabetic but they are so comfortable.</li>
            <li> I love these and wear them everyday. I had been having trouble with some socks bothering my feet and lower legs. These are wonderful. They are now the only ones I wear. They seem to holding up well after many washings.</li>
            <li> I am a repeat customer, finding these socks light-weight, and non binding.  We were asked to find this kind of sock to minimize pressure to my Father&#x27;s feet.  He has extremely poor circulation and suffers from ulcerations in his feet.  The minimal pressure does not impair his already impaired circulation.</li>
            <li> My wife wears those socks almost all the time and she loves the feel and comfort she gets from it. Excellent price and very good quality. Would recommend to anyone who needs it.</li>
            <li> my g-friend luv them, thx</li>
            <li> My dad really enjoys his socks because they are not too tight or cut off his circulation in his legs.</li>
            <li> these are great socks easy for him to put on with no help can&#x27;t beat the price on these. will purchase more..</li>
            <li> These are exactly what my husband needs.  He has circulation issues.  These fit softly over compression tube materials that he has to keep on.</li>
            <li> These are enormous (they are too long) and are too stretchy.&lt;br /&gt;They are so soft tho. I&#x27;d like to return them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not diabetic but I really like these socks. All my athletic socks eventually shrink and tighten up.  Maybe I&#x27;d not been buying good quality socks???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, these are very soft to the touch and have enough elasticity to stay up, but don&#x27;t constrict at all.  Zero constriction.  Great buy.</li>
