    <ol>
            <li>perfect size for hair growning out</li>
            <li>Not the best quality</li>
            <li>Good buy!</li>
            <li>They work great on fabric.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s cute and it works and it comes with so many in case some break.</li>
            <li>I use these sometimes instead of safety pins, for light duty jobs/  </li>
            <li>Not so great with my thick hair, but a good value for the price.</li>
            <li>Good basic clips.</li>
            <li>They are far more sturdy than other brands I&#x27;ve used and priced fairly so when the claws break (as they do when you fall asleep in them) or when I lose them (somewhere in the never-ending bottom of my handbag), my heart and pocket don&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li>Holds just the right amount of hair for me.  </li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t grip my hair at all, fall right out.</li>
            <li>perfect for random impromptu do&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I saw the other models and sure enough they have a stiffer spring with more winds compared to these versions.</li>
            <li>The price was good, but my only complaint is that the teeth on these break a bit easy.</li>
            <li>They also don&#x27;t grab very well after I have straightened my hair out, unless I use hairspray.</li>
            <li>Other than that they work ok.</li>
            <li>Items arrived quickly and were what was expected!</li>

            <li> and I do have pretty thick hair.</li>
            <li> As expected, Goody is the go-to brand for hair clips.</li>
            <li> Keeps it away from my face, not too big and not too small.</li>
            <li> Very poorly made, two broke on the first time I wore them.</li>
            <li> These were for the wife and she said they are not as durable as the previous models.</li>
            <li> These are small clips meant to be used on small amounts  of hair</li>
            <li> Work well holding small pieces of hair.</li>
            <li> The product is decent, but it showed up with the package broken/open and one of the clips missing.  :(</li>
            <li> Received the completely wrong item.</li>
            <li> Really bad grip, it doesn&#x27;t hold my hair</li>

            <li> The price was good, but my only complaint is that the teeth on these break a bit easy. They are the same as you would get in the store and I do have pretty thick hair. They also don&#x27;t grab very well after I have straightened my hair out, unless I use hairspray. Other than that they work ok.</li>

            <li> These are small clips meant to be used on small amounts  of hair and I think they would work well.  They are  not heavy-duty clips.  I ordered them, however, to clip sheer curtains back away from a window where my cats have a window seat.  They work great on fabric.  You can also spray paint these clips to blend with your d√©cor.  I use these sometimes instead of safety pins, for light duty jobs/  Looks a lot classier!!!!!</li>
            <li> These were like twice the price here than they are at Target. And they don&#x27;t even hold my hair up well. oh well.</li>
            <li> These were for the wife and she said they are not as durable as the previous models. I saw the other models and sure enough they have a stiffer spring with more winds compared to these versions. She will not be ordering these again</li>
            <li> Good basic clips. Work well holding small pieces of hair. Not so great with my thick hair, but a good value for the price.</li>
            <li> Really bad grip, it doesn&#x27;t hold my hair</li>
            <li> I RECEIVED COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ITEM</li>
            <li> Received the completely wrong item.</li>
