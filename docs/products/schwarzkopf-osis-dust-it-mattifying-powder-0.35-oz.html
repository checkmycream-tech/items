            <li>it will come right out.</li>
            <li>This is a great thickening product you need very little to put in your palms rub hands through hair.</li>
            <li>it gives more volume to the hair, but I don&#x27;t really like how the hair feels afterwards, kind of sticky and dull.</li>
            <li>I have bought this exact product at a salon before and after receiving this one from Amazon, I feel it is a knock off product.  </li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ll use this very much.</li>
            <li>We got his hair high enough for a long haired flat top and then sprayed it with strong hairspray and it lasted most of the day.  </li>
            <li>Almost too much haha</li>

            <li>Love the product and the same day shipping was unbelievable.  </li>
            <li>Be careful how much you use!</li>

            <li>Makes your hair feel weird and washing it takes a little extra attention, but all in all a great product.  </li>
            <li>I, too, had trouble washing it out of my hair at first.</li>

            <li> I bought this for my teen son who has longer hair that can easily go flat.  </li>
            <li> This bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Not only did it make my hair overly dry</li>
            <li> This is the only product I have found to give my flat thin hair lift and body without additional oils (I also have very oily hair).  </li>
            <li> Turns out a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I think I also received an imitation product as it did not work at all.</li>
            <li> The bottle is small, but don&#x27;t be deceived, it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> I would watch a few youtube video tutorials before using it.  </li>
            <li> It holds very tightly and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Just remember to use a very little bit at the roots and then &amp;#34;fluff&amp;#34; your hair.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be alarmed by how small the bottle is when it arrives like I was.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using OSIS Dust It for several years and have not been disappointed with the product I&#x27;ve purchased from this specific vendor.</li>
            <li> but it is quite sticky and hard to wash out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> if gives you the ability to manage your hair and give it fullness I would recommend this product for anyone that needs their hair to feel thick</li>
            <li> a bit expensive, but got it for 50% on amazon than anywhere else i bought it.</li>
            <li> it was difficult to get it out of my hair.</li>
            <li> Terrible.  </li>

            <li> Exactly what I buy at the hairdressers!  Works great for how I style my hair, will definitely order it again.</li>
            <li> Just a tiny amount gives a ton of texture.....great stuff.</li>
            <li> Gives amazing volume! Almost too much haha</li>
            <li> I have bought this exact product at a salon before and after receiving this one from Amazon, I feel it is a knock off product.

            <li> I think I also received an imitation product as it did not work at all. Returned it. Will try to purchase from a hair salon to see if it makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. I, too, had trouble washing it out of my hair at first. However, if you use Neutrogena Anti-Residue Shampoo, http://www.neutrogena.com/product/mobile/hair/shampoos/anti-residue+shampoo.do  it will come right out. Rinsing your hair with Apple cider vinegar is also great for getting residue buildup out of your hair.</li>
            <li> If you want to add volume to your roots, this is the stuff! I bought it because a friend recommended it and I am so happy she did. This stuff works GREAT!</li>
            <li> I think this would work best on people with very short hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product for texture.  Easy to use and only takes a small amount.  Gives hair that added volume, especially good on fine hair.</li>

            <li> This absolutely works. My hair stylist used it on me once and I told her I just had to have some. I sprinkle some on my crown roots, tease and away I go. It holds very tightly and even the next morning my hair still looks decent. 5stars!</li>
            <li> Love the product and the same day shipping was unbelievable.  I really didn&#x27;t believe that it would make it here in the same day, but it did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a product that gives fine hair a boost, this is it.  I paid much more at my salon and got hooked on it. Even with the same day shipping charge, it was less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just remember to use a very little bit at the roots and then &amp;#34;fluff&amp;#34; your hair.  It helps maintain your style even after sleeping.</li>
            <li> Love it. Been using this for years. a bit expensive, but got it for 50% on amazon than anywhere else i bought it. The bottle is small, but don&#x27;t be deceived, it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I applied this as directed. Not only did it make my hair overly dry it was difficult to get it out of my hair. I had to wash I my hair three times, and even then there was some residue in my hair.  This was a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before. It works well,</li>
            <li> Great product and super fast delivery</li>
            <li> This fabulous product gives my hair texture without weighing it down.  Love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> it gives more volume to the hair, but I don&#x27;t really like how the hair feels afterwards, kind of sticky and dull.</li>
            <li> Gives my fine hair great body.</li>

            <li> Bottle is tiny but supposedly lasts forever</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teen son who has longer hair that can easily go flat.  I heard about this product from a friend, and couldn&#x27;t figure out how a powder could give hair a lift. But it actually works.  You sprinkle it in at the roots (part hair by section, shake like salt, and move to the next section.) Then use your fingers to rub it in at the scalp (like you were lathering your shampoo).  Voila - your hair lifts.  We got his hair high enough for a long haired flat top and then sprayed it with strong hairspray and it lasted most of the day.  I would watch a few youtube video tutorials before using it.  I found plenty. Don&#x27;t be alarmed by how small the bottle is when it arrives like I was.  Turns out a little goes a long way.  This bottle will last a long time. Makes your hair feel weird and washing it takes a little extra attention, but all in all a great product.  Glad to have discovered it.</li>
            <li> So far so good with this vendor.  I&#x27;ve been using OSIS Dust It for several years and have not been disappointed with the product I&#x27;ve purchased from this specific vendor.</li>
            <li> Great for fine hair that needs extra texture! I&#x27;ve been using this for years. I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I love this product I can get my super thick hair to do whatever I want with this product. I don&#x27;t use anything else with it no hair spray or gel just this. I love it and I&#x27;m a faithful user of it.</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh, I love this stuff! A friend came into town and her hair looked fabulous. She said it was OSiS. A little goes a long way. I&#x27;ll be ordering again!</li>
            <li> Makes your hair feel....dusty</li>
            <li> This is a great thickening product you need very little to put in your palms rub hands through hair.</li>
            <li> Terrible.  made my hair greasy!</li>
            <li> This is, by far, the best volumizing powder out there!</li>
            <li> Fine thin hair needs this product. I have been using this for over 3 years now and cannot live with it out.</li>
