            <li>The fake logo is just a little bit bigger, too be honest, looks better than the real logo.</li>
            <li>The real ones have a black sticker with a bar code on the back.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This mascara is seriously amazing!  Its truly something you should see to believe.  But the independent presenters are not permitted to sell younique through external sites, including this one so be sure to order from an authorized presenter to ensure your product is not damaged, expired,  or fake. I order from lashalert.com</li>
            <li> This is a great product IF bought by a true Younique representative. I have been using this product for a long time and yes it truly does work. However, you are not allowed to sell Younique products on this site or any retail site which leads me to believe it is probably damaged, fake or expired. If you would like a reputable seller where you are guaranteed the 14 day warranty and actual Fiber Lash product please feel free to take a look at my sellers page https://www.youniqueproducts.com/fastlash</li>
            <li> I  saw this on the tv show the Doctors, and also a couple of my friends were using it, so I thought why not, it is awesome! Really brings out your lashes, makes them look incredible long, thick and beautiful! Its a must for me to use forever!</li>
            <li> Not sure if I like it</li>
            <li> I really like my moodstruck</li>
            <li> It is beautiful and I love it more than anything ♡♡♡</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly.  Is very easy to use and really does make a difference to your eyelash length and thickness.</li>
            <li> The product is horrible</li>
            <li> This works great! I virtually have no eyelashes and they make it look like I have nice long full lashes.</li>
            <li> Great product! But make sure to buy from a a Younique Independent Presenter to insure quality!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> This mascara is absolutely amazing...the difference between lashes with and without Younique 3D Fiber Lashes is incredible. Definitely worth the price. I do not think that I could ever use regular mascara again! The fibers tend to fall on my face after awhile, but I&#x27;ve read that is most likely due to how I apply it. I don&#x27;t have enough good things to say about this product!!</li>
            <li> I have received COUNTERFEIT Younique by several sellers in the last month, so be careful. If the price is too good to believe... there is a reason why. You can tell the fakes pretty easily. The real ones have a black sticker with a bar code on the back. The fake ones have an instruction sheet on the back. The logo on top of the case looks pretty good though. The fake logo is just a little bit bigger, too be honest, looks better than the real logo. Here are a couple pictures comparing the front and the backs of each.</li>
            <li> The worst mascara. Don&#x27;t worth this money. Got cheaper brands and much better</li>
            <li> knock off product for the full price of the real thing</li>
            <li> Go Good quality fast shipping A++++++</li>
            <li> I purchased from a Younique representative and LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I will never use just plain mascara again! Using this product correctly, I get much longer lashes that have much more volume, too. Used correctly, the fibers do not fall in my eyes. It took some practice and watching a number of different youtube videos to find out that the fibers should be &amp;#34;pressed&amp;#34; onto the transferring gel rather than stroked from bottom to top as we do mascara. They give me all the benefits of false lashes except that they look real! My natural lashes are short and thin...NOT with this 3D Fiber Lash Mascara! I highly recommend them. I also recommend watching a few YouTube videos to watch how to apply them as well as reading the enclosed instructions.</li>
