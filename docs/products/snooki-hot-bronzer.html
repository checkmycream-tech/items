            <li>In love with this product!</li>
            <li>everytime I need more!</li>
            <li>My wife tried this lotion as a sample and really liked it.</li>
            <li>Nice smell</li>
            <li>but my skin is looking nice.</li>
            <li>It did give me a nice tan</li>
            <li>but i really liked it.</li>
            <li>If you have never used a tingle lotion, bought this because it had Snooki&#x27;s name on it, and didn&#x27;t read the after affects - that is your own fault.</li>
            <li>It gives you the right amount of Bronzer and tingle for a beautiful tan.</li>
            <li>i have never been such a beautiful shade of brown in my life since i am so fair skinned.</li>
            <li>But its ok.</li>
            <li>and on top of that they didnt even give me the option of getting a refund....</li>
            <li>But then I realized I was more of an orange instead of a bronze.</li>
            <li>: Make sure you shake it before you use it, sometimes the tingle ingredients sink to the bottom.</li>
            <li>It worked okay.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, I still left with an awesome tan, so</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>This is the second tingle lotion I have used, I used Ed Hardy Obnoxious (an awesome lotion too), but this is definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li>First off, this tanning lotion smells amazing!  </li>
            <li>how my body reacted to it, I&#x27;ve been reading a lot of these reviews and most people love it.</li>
            <li>This item ships fast everytime and is always in great contition.</li>
            <li>my favorite lotion I&#x27;ve ever used..</li>
            <li>It wears off at the latest, 2 hrs.</li>
            <li>and i have light to medium complexion!</li>
            <li>I Love this lotion, I love tingle lotions</li>
            <li>the hotter the better and</li>
            <li>am giving this lotion a 5-star rating because it does what you want it to do, it does it very well, and it smells great while doing it.</li>
            <li>If you like a hot bronzer with fast results this is perfect!</li>
            <li>In a perfect world, I would have it be a little hotter, but I love it!</li>
            <li>If you like hot tanning lotion with a bronzer this is a good one.</li>
            <li>Good amount of bronze, not to much.&lt;br /&gt;Great combination of hot and bronze</li>
            <li>lotion),it does smell good at first</li>
            <li>It does heat you up pretty good</li>
            <li>At the same time, I am an experienced tanner, and I am experienced using hot lotions.</li>
            <li>But as far as price goes it is a great price and shipping</li>
            <li>She says that this bottle doesn&#x27;t tingle as much, but it still is really good</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t tan easily at all.  </li>
            <li>I love Snooki, and this product is probably good if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin like me</li>
            <li>I tan easy</li>
            <li>It has a strong tingler in it along with the bronzer</li>
            <li>Smells AMAZING, reminds me of Snooki&#x27;s first fragrance.</li>
            <li>The lotion gives me a great tan, definitely has me sizzling when i use it(not that it was a drawback</li>
            <li>For experienced tanners only.</li>
            <li>Today I received a free sample of this tanner.</li>
            <li>I purchased this lotion because it had a pretty good amount of positive reviews</li>
            <li>At first I loved it &amp; the tingle is intense.</li>
            <li>It is worth it to buy!</li>
            <li>Also love the fact that its so much cheaper here then at the salon!</li>
            <li>I have used tingle lotions before, but wasn&#x27;t sure if this one would be too hot.</li>
            <li>I love Snooki Hot Bronzer.</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t sure about tingle lotions, try sample packets first.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try I it.</li>
            <li>this first time i used this i thought i was going to pass out is gets so hot, but the results are AMAZING.</li>
            <li>turned bright red</li>
            <li>and I was BRIGHT red!!!</li>
            <li>i ended up with credit on my amazon account though, so its better than nothing,, but i was really looking forward to trying out the lotion.</li>
            <li>and I am a light golden brown.</li>
            <li>But this made me get good and red!</li>
            <li>This item was delivered super quick, which was a plus.  </li>
            <li>this got to my house super fast!!</li>
            <li>Please do note that this lotion is extremely hot!</li>
            <li>While I knew it was a tingler, I didn&#x27;t expect it to be this hot!</li>
            <li>I just bought this lotion.. Not being aware that it was a tingler lotion!</li>
            <li>The physical bottle is adorable, too!</li>
            <li>It is an ULTRA HOT bronzer, and that is no lie!</li>
            <li>This stuff IS HOT!</li>
            <li>First I want to say: YES!</li>
            <li>HOT bronzer is right!</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing too (all three have the same scent.)</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff, gets you dark quick, don&#x27;t order if you don&#x27;t like tinglers because they do burn, and this one is very intense, I however love tinglers and this is by far my favorite</li>
            <li>It gives you the warmth and redness of a tingle without the extreme itch after which I loved.</li>
            <li>DO NOT use it right out of the gate.</li>
            <li>It smells very fruity and sweet - like candy.</li>
            <li>but after a couple hours it kind of smells like spray tan, and it arrived super quick, less than a week to come and like a day before the estimated arrival</li>
            <li>was very fast.</li>
            <li>This lotion smells a little like fruit rollups which to me is a good smell</li>
            <li>I have never used a hot lotion before.</li>
            <li>I did some research on hot lotions</li>
            <li>The results we almost immediate after my first use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty ticked off</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to use this lotion you have to get use to the hot tingler.</li>
            <li>Alot of tanning lotions leave you smelling funny</li>
            <li>It is hot.</li>
            <li>the first use an by tan #3 was looking how I wanted.</li>
            <li>But the next day I was significantly more tan than the day before</li>
            <li>and I wanted to try a tingler for the first time.</li>
            <li>I tried this lotion for the first time 2 days ago, I did not know that it had an ingredient to make you tingle</li>
            <li>seller has the cheapest lotion and is very responsive!</li>
            <li>This is not only my all time favorite lotion l/tingle but also a very well seller!</li>
            <li>I have never in my time tanning used a product this hot.</li>
            <li>You will need a second lotion to use for your face I have been using an Australian gold lotion it blends pretty good</li>
            <li>first of all my snooki tanning lotion ddnt even smell like the real thing let alone tingle at all.</li>
            <li>I would only recommend this product for experience tanners, or those who are familiar with hot, tingling lotions.</li>
            <li>It had a good hot bronzer to it but not hot enough you had to get out of the tanning bed.</li>
            <li>I was very nervous that this product would make my skin feel like it was on fire.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin very itchy also.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this lotion!</li>
            <li>Much cheaper on amazon than to purchase in tanning salon</li>
            <li>it is very creamy and not greasy.</li>
            <li>I buy this lotion all of the time and this is not the real deal.</li>
            <li>and I never burn with the real snooki bronzer.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that I am light skinned and Irish, so</li>
            <li>I thought that this was going to be one of those hyped up celebrity products, but this stuff does really work.</li>
            <li>I never used to read much about products.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I only use it like once a week because I like to enjoy tanning</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wanna burn the whole time.</li>
            <li>I visit to mix my Jwoww and Snooki lotion together, that way it will not be as intense, but I can still use it and have the tingle affect.</li>
            <li>If you like to look like a dark spray tan, go for this. &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>and then the next day only my stomach because I wouldn&#x27;t be able to take all the burn.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>and I thought the hot meant &amp;#34;sexy, cool, in style&amp;#34; not actually hot burn your skin.</li>
            <li>Besides the bottle being different than the real snooki bronzer, when i tried it ,I got burnt to a crisp...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a frequent tingler user, but I nearly couldn&#x27;t stay in the bed for the whole session!</li>
            <li>Guess its normal for this tanning cream to burn.</li>
            <li>I accidentally got the lotion on my boyfriends face and his face was beat red right away for over an hour.</li>
            <li>So - if you like the lotion and it&#x27;s just a little too intense for you, try mixing it with a non-tingle lotion that you enjoy using.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>It turns your skin red and it stays hot for hours after you get out of the tanning bed -</li>
            <li>and it is much easier to bare.</li>
            <li>This stuff is hot and painful even for an experienced tanner.</li>
            <li>I have  went tanning  6 times so far using the lotions</li>
            <li>and my skin felt so soft.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin or anything</li>
            <li>so whatever that ingredient is I need to stay far away from.</li>
            <li>this is by far</li>
            <li>It may be intensified by the fact that I&#x27;m using it in a high pressure bed, but at the same time, I have used other hot lotions in high pressure beds before and it didn&#x27;t feel like this.</li>
            <li>If your skin is sensitive to stuff be careful using too much!</li>
            <li>It really has the tingle and gets you dark fast.  </li>
            <li>and I sometimes have white spots which I read that it is normal with a tingler.</li>
            <li>Shipping arrived the day it said it would, And I also got two samples of other lotions (which was very generous!)</li>
            <li>It tingled for about an hour after I got out of the bed and my skin was red for a few hours afterward, but it is so worth it.</li>
            <li>is a tingler, not too strong yet not too weak.</li>
            <li>i am not pleased with the product I feel that it may have been old or not the correct product because it leaves you very sticky afterwards to the point you want to wash it off</li>
            <li>- she really felt the burn and it helped her get a little darker than she could have without it.</li>

            <li> I purchased this lotion because it had a pretty good amount of positive reviews</li>
            <li> At first I loved it &amp; the tingle is intense.</li>
            <li> It is worth it to buy!</li>
            <li> Also love the fact that its so much cheaper here then at the salon!</li>
            <li> I have used tingle lotions before, but wasn&#x27;t sure if this one would be too hot.</li>
            <li> I love Snooki Hot Bronzer.</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t sure about tingle lotions, try sample packets first.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try I it.</li>
            <li> this first time i used this i thought i was going to pass out is gets so hot, but the results are AMAZING.</li>
            <li> turned bright red</li>
            <li> and I was BRIGHT red!!!</li>
            <li> i ended up with credit on my amazon account though, so its better than nothing,, but i was really looking forward to trying out the lotion.</li>
            <li> and I am a light golden brown.</li>
            <li> But this made me get good and red!</li>
            <li> This item was delivered super quick, which was a plus.  </li>
            <li> this got to my house super fast!!</li>
            <li> Please do note that this lotion is extremely hot!</li>
            <li> While I knew it was a tingler, I didn&#x27;t expect it to be this hot!</li>
            <li> I just bought this lotion.. Not being aware that it was a tingler lotion!</li>
            <li> The physical bottle is adorable, too!</li>
            <li> It is an ULTRA HOT bronzer, and that is no lie!</li>
            <li> This stuff IS HOT!</li>
            <li> First I want to say: YES!</li>
            <li> HOT bronzer is right!</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing too (all three have the same scent.)</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff, gets you dark quick, don&#x27;t order if you don&#x27;t like tinglers because they do burn, and this one is very intense, I however love tinglers and this is by far my favorite</li>
            <li> It gives you the warmth and redness of a tingle without the extreme itch after which I loved.</li>
            <li> DO NOT use it right out of the gate.</li>
            <li> It smells very fruity and sweet - like candy.</li>
            <li> but after a couple hours it kind of smells like spray tan, and it arrived super quick, less than a week to come and like a day before the estimated arrival</li>
            <li> was very fast.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells a little like fruit rollups which to me is a good smell</li>
            <li> I have never used a hot lotion before.</li>
            <li> I did some research on hot lotions</li>
            <li> The results we almost immediate after my first use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty ticked off</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to use this lotion you have to get use to the hot tingler.</li>
            <li> Alot of tanning lotions leave you smelling funny</li>
            <li> It is hot.</li>
            <li> the first use an by tan #3 was looking how I wanted.</li>
            <li> But the next day I was significantly more tan than the day before</li>
            <li> and I wanted to try a tingler for the first time.</li>
            <li> I tried this lotion for the first time 2 days ago, I did not know that it had an ingredient to make you tingle</li>
            <li> seller has the cheapest lotion and is very responsive!</li>
            <li> This is not only my all time favorite lotion l/tingle but also a very well seller!</li>
            <li> I have never in my time tanning used a product this hot.</li>
            <li> You will need a second lotion to use for your face I have been using an Australian gold lotion it blends pretty good</li>
            <li> first of all my snooki tanning lotion ddnt even smell like the real thing let alone tingle at all.</li>
            <li> I would only recommend this product for experience tanners, or those who are familiar with hot, tingling lotions.</li>
            <li> It had a good hot bronzer to it but not hot enough you had to get out of the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> I was very nervous that this product would make my skin feel like it was on fire.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin very itchy also.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this lotion!</li>
            <li> Much cheaper on amazon than to purchase in tanning salon</li>
            <li> it is very creamy and not greasy.</li>
            <li> I buy this lotion all of the time and this is not the real deal.</li>
            <li> and I never burn with the real snooki bronzer.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that I am light skinned and Irish, so</li>
            <li> I thought that this was going to be one of those hyped up celebrity products, but this stuff does really work.</li>
            <li> I never used to read much about products.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I only use it like once a week because I like to enjoy tanning</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wanna burn the whole time.</li>
            <li> I visit to mix my Jwoww and Snooki lotion together, that way it will not be as intense, but I can still use it and have the tingle affect.</li>
            <li> If you like to look like a dark spray tan, go for this. &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> and then the next day only my stomach because I wouldn&#x27;t be able to take all the burn.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> and I thought the hot meant &amp;#34;sexy, cool, in style&amp;#34; not actually hot burn your skin.</li>
            <li> Besides the bottle being different than the real snooki bronzer, when i tried it ,I got burnt to a crisp...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a frequent tingler user, but I nearly couldn&#x27;t stay in the bed for the whole session!</li>
            <li> Guess its normal for this tanning cream to burn.</li>
            <li> I accidentally got the lotion on my boyfriends face and his face was beat red right away for over an hour.</li>
            <li> So - if you like the lotion and it&#x27;s just a little too intense for you, try mixing it with a non-tingle lotion that you enjoy using.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> It turns your skin red and it stays hot for hours after you get out of the tanning bed -</li>
            <li> and it is much easier to bare.</li>
            <li> This stuff is hot and painful even for an experienced tanner.</li>
            <li> I have  went tanning  6 times so far using the lotions</li>
            <li> and my skin felt so soft.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin or anything</li>
            <li> so whatever that ingredient is I need to stay far away from.</li>
            <li> this is by far</li>
            <li> It may be intensified by the fact that I&#x27;m using it in a high pressure bed, but at the same time, I have used other hot lotions in high pressure beds before and it didn&#x27;t feel like this.</li>
            <li> If your skin is sensitive to stuff be careful using too much!</li>
            <li> It really has the tingle and gets you dark fast.  </li>
            <li> and I sometimes have white spots which I read that it is normal with a tingler.</li>
            <li> Shipping arrived the day it said it would, And I also got two samples of other lotions (which was very generous!)</li>
            <li> It tingled for about an hour after I got out of the bed and my skin was red for a few hours afterward, but it is so worth it.</li>
            <li> is a tingler, not too strong yet not too weak.</li>
            <li> i am not pleased with the product I feel that it may have been old or not the correct product because it leaves you very sticky afterwards to the point you want to wash it off</li>
            <li> - she really felt the burn and it helped her get a little darker than she could have without it.</li>
            <li> Definitely works be careful not touch your face or children</li>
            <li> other reviews say this lotion has tingle on the face actually it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy again to rotate with my other lotions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> There are better lotions out there that aren&#x27;t painful.</li>
            <li> so be careful using it on your face</li>
            <li> So deffinitely be careful with what you touch after.</li>
            <li> It lasts for one to two hours and you&#x27;ll look like you just spent a day at the beach.  </li>
            <li> I think I might need to try a different lotion to get more of a base color</li>
            <li> Love the feeling and doesn&#x27;t smell bad like other lotions I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> it was \\&quot;like walking through hell, naked, with my raw skin covered in butter...</li>
            <li> Be careful with this stuff!</li>
            <li> I use regular beds and go in for 15 to 20 minutes usually after 7 to 10 minutes I start to feel the heat from the tingle come into affect.</li>
            <li> A lot of people say it hurts, but it feels like extreme goosebumps to me.  </li>
            <li> I did not like the product personally other</li>
            <li> Not worth the pain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning a while now and haven&#x27;t see lotion get me as dark as i am now.</li>
            <li> It tingled less than the other, but gave more/better coloring after just one use!</li>
            <li> and eventhough I am really tight with my money</li>
            <li> I suggest if you have sensitive skin, test it first, it was very painful for me.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you don&#x27;t put it on your face or touch someone elses face after use - its painful for someone who isn&#x27;t used to it!</li>
            <li> and I NEVER burn, I have a dark complexion but this kicked my butt!</li>
            <li> s I will continue to use my little concoction.</li>
            <li> Burns really bad the first couple of times you use it.</li>
            <li> usually I have trouble with my feet, hands, and face getting tanned</li>
            <li> Using this for just a week had me very dark!</li>
            <li> I tried just a small dot on my husband needed to see if i was allergic and his skin inflamed</li>
            <li> I may be one of those people that are just hard to tan.</li>
            <li> it was sooooo painful my arms turned red and started to show little bumps..</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical to buy all of the Snooki lotions, but I read tons of reviews and saw nothing too negative.</li>
            <li> I would recommend having a decent base tan before using this or you will tingle wayyyy worse.</li>
            <li> Worst EVER burns your skin like hot chili peppers.</li>
            <li> Did not like this product, really bad color, did not live up to the brand name.</li>
            <li> bad buy waste of moneu</li>
            <li> My skin had such a horrible reaction that my blood pressure shot up my skin</li>
            <li> Should use only AFTER you have a base tan!  </li>
            <li> cause makes you feel dirty..</li>
            <li> it will burn like crazy and there&#x27;s no stopping the burn</li>
            <li> a base tan and then use this lotion.</li>
            <li> Very painful.</li>
            <li> AWFUL!</li>
            <li> do not buy this lotion, its terrible</li>
            <li> and then I noticed the welts all over my body from head to toe, it was awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> other reviews say this lotion has tingle on the face actually it doesn&#x27;t. was a good deal tho. Its good for bronzing  and the smell is good. But there is no tingle which was what I was looking for. But its ok.</li>
            <li> I ended up in the emergency room because of this stuff. My skin had such a horrible reaction that my blood pressure shot up my skin looked like I had been in the sun for hours only 2 mins after applying the lotion.</li>
            <li> If you like hot tanning lotion with a bronzer this is a good one. I noticed it is hotter if I haven&#x27;t used any lotion that day. Good amount of bronze, not to much.&lt;br /&gt;Great combination of hot and bronze</li>
            <li> I have never used a hot lotion before. I did some research on hot lotions and I figured I would give it a try. I was very nervous that this product would make my skin feel like it was on fire. But it didn&#x27;t. It did tingle. But after my first few tans I got use to it! But the results are AMAZING!!! Once I started using the lotion people started to notice my tan! And the tan is not an orange streaky tan! It is worth it to buy! I will buy again!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is hot and painful even for an experienced tanner. It does get you tan though. You have to shower after tanning which defeats the bronzer affect. Makes your skin very itchy also. Be careful with this stuff! There are better lotions out there that aren&#x27;t painful.</li>
            <li> The lotion gives me a great tan, definitely has me sizzling when i use it(not that it was a drawback, i do like that it is a tingle lotion),it does smell good at first but after a couple hours it kind of smells like spray tan, and it arrived super quick, less than a week to come and like a day before the estimated arrival, the vendor also included another sample pack of a different lotion, will def. buy from them again&#x3D;D!</li>
            <li> I wouldnt buy from this seller based on the simple fact that i never even received my order. and on top of that they didnt even give me the option of getting a refund.... i ended up with credit on my amazon account though, so its better than nothing,, but i was really looking forward to trying out the lotion.</li>
            <li> At first I loved it &amp; the tingle is intense. But then I realized I was more of an orange instead of a bronze. If you like to look like a dark spray tan, go for this. &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> This is the best tingling lotion I have ever used. The results we almost immediate after my first use. I have been using this lotion for a couple of weeks now, &amp; I am the darkest I&#x27;ve ever been. I would highly recommend this lotion! Please do note that this lotion is extremely hot! The tingling does have a lasting effect until washed off. I would only recommend this product for experience tanners, or those who are familiar with hot, tingling lotions. The lotion also has a wonderful smell!!</li>
            <li> i am not pleased with the product I feel that it may have been old or not the correct product because it leaves you very sticky afterwards to the point you want to wash it off cause makes you feel dirty..I have bought this several times at different salons and it didn&#x27;t make you feel like that</li>
            <li> Great seller!!!!  Received product as described on sellers site.  Much cheaper on amazon than to purchase in tanning salon....works just as good as described.  Should use only AFTER you have a base tan!  Does have the tingle described but creates an amazing tan!  If your skin is sensitive to stuff be careful using too much!</li>
            <li> Pro: Smells great!&lt;br /&gt;Con: Made my skin breakout in red patches.</li>
            <li> Worst EVER burns your skin like hot chili peppers. I put it on my arm all over to test it and i thought i was going to have to see a DR.. it was sooooo painful my arms turned red and started to show little bumps.. i had to shower to get it off.. I tried just a small dot on my husband needed to see if i was allergic and his skin inflamed turned bright red it lasted for 10 mins.. .called to get a refund since I opened it they refused a refund I&#x27;m pretty ticked off NEVER EVER BUY THIS EVER!!</li>
            <li> Smells delicious and give you great color! I love the \\&quot;hot\\&quot; lotions because they seem to give you color faster! Also love the fact that its so much cheaper here then at the salon! Even with shipping! Will be getting it again!</li>
            <li> This lotion smells a little like fruit rollups which to me is a good smell it is very creamy and not greasy. On the back of the bottle in the directions it says do not put on face and I learned why you shouldn&#x27;t put it on your face let&#x27;s just say my face was burning instantly within seconds. You will need a second lotion to use for your face I have been using an Australian gold lotion it blends pretty good you cant tell I&#x27;m using 2 different lotions. I use regular beds and go in for 15 to 20 minutes usually after 7 to 10 minutes I start to feel the heat from the tingle come into affect. When I get out of the tanning bed I am red in some spots and I sometimes have white spots which I read that it is normal with a tingler. If you&#x27;re going to use this lotion you have to get use to the hot tingler. I use Jergens and a bath and body brand lotion when I get out of the bed. After leaving the tanning salon the tingling hot usually lasts for about an hour with some redness I then see some color. I am fair skinned usually I have trouble with my feet, hands, and face getting tanned I have  went tanning  6 times so far using the lotions and I am a light golden brown. I hope to get darker. I think I might need to try a different lotion to get more of a base color then go back to using the SNOOKI lotion. I would definitely buy it again from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical to buy all of the Snooki lotions, but I read tons of reviews and saw nothing too negative. I have used tingle lotions before, but wasn&#x27;t sure if this one would be too hot. In fact, it&#x27;s perfect. It gives you the warmth and redness of a tingle without the extreme itch after which I loved. It tingled for about an hour after I got out of the bed and my skin was red for a few hours afterward, but it is so worth it. The smell is amazing too (all three have the same scent.) Just make sure you don&#x27;t put it on your face or touch someone elses face after use - its painful for someone who isn&#x27;t used to it! The price is perfect and it came in plastic so I knew it hadn&#x27;t been opened. In a perfect world, I would have it be a little hotter, but I love it! I would definitely buy again to rotate with my other lotions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Make sure you shake it before you use it, sometimes the tingle ingredients sink to the bottom.</li>
            <li> If you like a hot bronzer with fast results this is perfect! It&#x27;s one of the best lotions I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> Did not like this product, really bad color, did not live up to the brand name.</li>
            <li> My wife tried this lotion as a sample and really liked it. She says that this bottle doesn&#x27;t tingle as much, but it still is really good - she really felt the burn and it helped her get a little darker than she could have without it.</li>
            <li> Works great! It smells like strawberries. Alot of tanning lotions leave you smelling funny but this one doesnt. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Great product!  Love the feeling and doesn&#x27;t smell bad like other lotions I&#x27;ve tried. I would recommend this for everyone.</li>
            <li> I love Snooki Hot Bronzer. It gives you the right amount of Bronzer and tingle for a beautiful tan. For experienced tanners only. It is hot.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this bronzer!! I use a different one for my face but I was tan the first use an by tan #3 was looking how I wanted. Its a great product! Thanx Snooki!!!</li>
            <li> I buy this lotion all of the time and this is not the real deal. Besides the bottle being different than the real snooki bronzer, when i tried it ,I got burnt to a crisp...and I never burn with the real snooki bronzer. This seller should be ashamed for selling bogus lotions!! I only hope no one else buys this garbage.</li>
            <li> It worked okay. Burns really bad the first couple of times you use it.</li>
            <li> Best tanning lotion I have ever used.  Instantly darker after just 1 tan!  It does heat you up pretty good so be careful using it on your face</li>
            <li> While I knew it was a tingler, I didn&#x27;t expect it to be this hot! I&#x27;m a frequent tingler user, but I nearly couldn&#x27;t stay in the bed for the whole session! Nevertheless, I still left with an awesome tan, so if you can handle the burn, it&#x27;s for you!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff, gets you dark quick, don&#x27;t order if you don&#x27;t like tinglers because they do burn, and this one is very intense, I however love tinglers and this is by far my favorite</li>
            <li> this got to my house super fast!! I love this and it is also cheaper than anywhere I can buy</li>
            <li> Definitely works be careful not touch your face or children it will burn like crazy and there&#x27;s no stopping the burn</li>
            <li> This is the second tingle lotion I have used, I used Ed Hardy Obnoxious (an awesome lotion too), but this is definitely my favorite. It tingled less than the other, but gave more/better coloring after just one use! Smells AMAZING, reminds me of Snooki&#x27;s first fragrance. I would recommend having a decent base tan before using this or you will tingle wayyyy worse. I like the tingle, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me. If you aren&#x27;t sure about tingle lotions, try sample packets first. It is not for everyone. Shipping was fast, packaging was excellent, bottle is beautiful, product exceeded expectation.</li>
            <li> I just bought this lotion.. Not being aware that it was a tingler lotion! I accidentally got the lotion on my boyfriends face and his face was beat red right away for over an hour. So deffinitely be careful with what you touch after. You WILL see results from this lotion! Only been using for 2 days and already tan. You don&#x27;t smell like burnt skin after you use it and it has a nice smell!</li>
            <li> Look, I understand pain is beauty, but this lotion BURNS.  If you can stand the pain, it does give you great color.  I used it only twice and eventhough I am really tight with my money I threw it away.  Not worth the pain.</li>
            <li> This item was delivered super quick, which was a plus.  First off, this tanning lotion smells amazing!  My last one smelt gross.  Because this is a \\&quot;hot\\&quot; lotion, it heats up while it&#x27;s on your skin.  A lot of people say it hurts, but it feels like extreme goosebumps to me.  It lasts for one to two hours and you&#x27;ll look like you just spent a day at the beach.  But the next day I was significantly more tan than the day before and my skin felt so soft.  Keep in mind that I am light skinned and Irish, so I don&#x27;t tan easily at all.  I thought that this was going to be one of those hyped up celebrity products, but this stuff does really work.</li>
            <li> AWFUL! literally makes you feel like fire ants are crawling all over you and it lasts for hours! do not buy this lotion, its terrible</li>
            <li> Wow! finally a lotion that works! Ive tried them all..I may be one of those people that are just hard to tan. But this made me get good and red! Nice smell and it doesn&#x27;t get gamey smelling after you get out of the bed.</li>
            <li> Today I received a free sample of this tanner. I was so excited to try I it. As soon as I put it on I thought I was having an allergic reaction. I took a shower to wash it off and took an allergy med but it still burned. I decided to read some of the reviews. Guess its normal for this tanning cream to burn. It&#x27;s been 10 minutes and it&#x27;s still burning but my skin is looking nice.</li>
            <li> first of all my snooki tanning lotion ddnt even smell like the real thing let alone tingle at all. the clerk and i compared them when i noticed it wasnt tingeling. bad buy waste of moneu</li>
            <li> I put this stuff on and it instantly burned my skin! Very painful.</li>
            <li> I purchased this lotion because it had a pretty good amount of positive reviews and I wanted to try a tingler for the first time. It def. is a tingler, not too strong yet not too weak. It did give me a nice tan and I would purchase this product again. The physical bottle is adorable, too!</li>
            <li> This lotion was the best I have used in the 2012 year! It had a good hot bronzer to it but not hot enough you had to get out of the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> I tried this lotion for the first time 2 days ago, I did not know that it had an ingredient to make you tingle and I made the mistake of putting it in my face, as soon as I stepped in the booth my face started to burn so I got out to wipe it off then my body started to burn and then I noticed the welts all over my body from head to toe, it was awful. I even had to be put on prednisone! I&#x27;ve never been allergic to anything in my life  and I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin or anything so whatever that ingredient is I need to stay far away from. But that&#x27;s just me and how my body reacted to it, I&#x27;ve been reading a lot of these reviews and most people love it. I suggest if you have sensitive skin, test it first, it was very painful for me.</li>
            <li> I walked out of the tanning bed and I was BRIGHT red!!! It is an ULTRA HOT bronzer, and that is no lie! I looked like a lobster and I NEVER burn, I have a dark complexion but this kicked my butt! BEWARE to all the fair skinned girls out there!</li>
            <li> Caution: This stuff burns! I never used to read much about products. I bought this thinking it was a regular ol&#x27; bronzer and I thought the hot meant &amp;#34;sexy, cool, in style&amp;#34; not actually hot burn your skin. I love Snooki, and this product is probably good if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin like me</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It&#x27;s not at all greasy, and it smells amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy this product if you do not want to feel a tingling sensation when tanning.&lt;br /&gt;After you&#x27;re done tanning your skin may look a bit red, but it fades into a tan.</li>
            <li> In love with this product! I tan easy so it does &amp; only have to visit the salon once a week. snooki did great with this tingle lotion! Very fast shipping &amp; very great price!  def ordering again from them!</li>
            <li> I buy this product everytime I use it all up. This is the best kind of tanning lotion I have ever used. It has a strong tingler in it along with the bronzer so you are 2 shades darker as soon as you get out of the tanning bed. I would not change lotions. This item ships fast everytime and is always in great contition. I will buy from here everytime I need more!</li>
            <li> If you like lotion with tingle in it, this is a MUST! It also has bronzer this is by far my favorite lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.. It does get you very red but thats the point of the lotion. Using this for just a week had me very dark! It smells good, has bronzer and is very cheap! I&#x27;ve been tanning a while now and haven&#x27;t see lotion get me as dark as i am now. Shipping arrived the day it said it would, And I also got two samples of other lotions (which was very generous!) seller has the cheapest lotion and is very responsive! This is a must have lotion!! I&#x27;m going to start buying two at a time.. This is not only my all time favorite lotion l/tingle but also a very well seller!</li>
            <li> This stuff IS HOT! I only use it like once a week because I like to enjoy tanning I don&#x27;t wanna burn the whole time. One day I&#x27;ll only do it on my arms and legs and then the next day only my stomach because I wouldn&#x27;t be able to take all the burn. It WILL make your skin BEAT RED! It wears off at the latest, 2 hrs. And just incase you forget to the read the back, DON&#x27;T PUT IT ON YOUR FACE! But as far as price goes it is a great price and shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It really has the tingle and gets you dark fast.  I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Love it, works great and i have light to medium complexion!</li>
            <li> HOT bronzer is right! this first time i used this i thought i was going to pass out is gets so hot, but the results are AMAZING. i have never been such a beautiful shade of brown in my life since i am so fair skinned. i would recommend this to anyone that likes the tingle lotions</li>
            <li> I Love this lotion, I love tingle lotions the hotter the better and this lotion is Great!!</li>
            <li> I did not like the product personally other my like the warming but I did not</li>
            <li> I like the snookie lotion because it leaves your skin tan and moisturized after a session. The tingler is something i have never used before but i really liked it. I will definatey be buying another bottle when i run out.</li>
            <li> Turns you red and burns for a while after tanning.but like how it worked</li>
            <li> Great product - probably the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.  Allows you to obtain great color and has the most &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; of any product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> First I want to say: YES! It turns your skin red and it stays hot for hours after you get out of the tanning bed - but it is SUPPOSED to because that is what hot/tingle lotions do. If you have never used a tingle lotion, bought this because it had Snooki&#x27;s name on it, and didn&#x27;t read the after affects - that is your own fault. Don&#x27;t give this lotion a 1-star rating because of YOUR lack of research and reading. The lotion works like it is supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving this lotion a 5-star rating because it does what you want it to do, it does it very well, and it smells great while doing it. It smells very fruity and sweet - like candy. At the same time, I am an experienced tanner, and I am experienced using hot lotions. I have never in my time tanning used a product this hot. It may be intensified by the fact that I&#x27;m using it in a high pressure bed, but at the same time, I have used other hot lotions in high pressure beds before and it didn&#x27;t feel like this. I believe the way I described it was \\&quot;like walking through hell, naked, with my raw skin covered in butter...sizzling.\\&quot; I wake up the next morning, after having showered the night before, and it is STILL tingling in the bends of my arms/knees. I like the intensity, I just have to get used to it. I was also told by the person that owns the tanning bed I visit to mix my Jwoww and Snooki lotion together, that way it will not be as intense, but I can still use it and have the tingle affect. I did that and it is much easier to bare. So - if you like the lotion and it&#x27;s just a little too intense for you, try mixing it with a non-tingle lotion that you enjoy using. I am the darkest I have ever gotten from the tanning bed in the short length of time I&#x27;ve been going this summer, s I will continue to use my little concoction. (:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get a base tan and then use this lotion. DO NOT use it right out of the gate. You will probably regret it.</li>
