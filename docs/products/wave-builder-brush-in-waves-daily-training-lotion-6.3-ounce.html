            <li>then add some spin&#x27;n classic for good shine, definition and hold and your waves</li>
            <li>I am no longer attempting to get hair waves but delivery was good and the two times I used the product I was satisfied with the scent and texture, and I enjoyed not feeling an itch with the hair net on.</li>
            <li>Beside all of those cons I do enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>this product is really great to have for people who are just starting out getting waves</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>another great wavebuilder product all i do is put some of this in my hair brush till dry</li>
            <li>This is a great product that allows you to style your hair and keep it from being dry without all the excess greasiness.</li>
            <li>This conditioner really gives my scalp and hair a healthy look.  </li>

            <li>because i think he really helps in advertising your products</li>
            <li>but if you already have them it wont really help with defining them i tried to use this as a non durag product like put it in my hair, brush and go</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>im sure that if i dedicated the time into it this would deepen my waves a little but since it doesnt have that shine thar</li>
            <li>you do&#x27;nt have to bring your brush every where you go just brush it normal morning noon or night</li>
            <li>As soon as the &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; comes out, it looks clear.</li>
            <li>isnt really vital for me</li>

            <li> I love this product it have my waves on point, I would recommend this product to anyone that want good 360 waves.</li>
            <li> This lotion works as described as long as you brush your hair often.  Takes about a week or two to see results.</li>
            <li> This product was very good just brush your hair I do&#x27;nt get it when people say it looks bad or crazy when some one is brushing there hair alot of time look you do&#x27;nt have to bring your brush every where you go just brush it normal morning noon or night</li>

            <li> This is probably the best conditioner I have ever used on my head!  I am in my 30s and have always had thin hair and dry scalp.  This conditioner really gives my scalp and hair a healthy look.  I am just mad I am just starting to use it.  I may have held on to more of my hair if I had started using sooner.</li>
            <li> It adds extra shine and makes your softer... The bottle is kinda small and it&#x27;s pretty watery... Beside all of those cons I do enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product 100% satisfied</li>
            <li> another great wavebuilder product all i do is put some of this in my hair brush till dry then add some spin&#x27;n classic for good shine, definition and hold and your waves will be spinnin i love wavebuilder!!! and when i orderd the product came before the estimated date im ordering from this seller again soon</li>
            <li> Too watery for my thick short hair</li>
            <li> Never heard about this until I saw an ad on Facebook and never used this before now and I wish I had.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that allows you to style your hair and keep it from being dry without all the excess greasiness. I definetly suggest this product!</li>
            <li> This is the second time i am buying this product. I love it. It is non greasy. I will always buy this product.  I recommand to all</li>
            <li> This product worked well for my waves but the concern that I have this lotion feels like water and not actual lotion. As soon as the &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; comes out, it looks clear. When you rub this in your hair, your hands feel like it was in water but like I said it did help my waves but no product gives you waves. It&#x27;s all about the brushing.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Full bottle and everything</li>
            <li> great for Training, I would recommed it to any one.whos thinking about wave..</li>
            <li> The product I like, but the packing was horrible. When I open the box the probuct was every where. The WaveBuiler lotion  cap was wide open. How hard is it to tape the lid down? More than half my product is in the trash or down the drain from me washing it off my hands.The receipt is unreadable because the contents soak it.</li>
            <li> Awesome will buy again !</li>
            <li> For the size it&#x27;s ok but the content is too watery. It is made like hand sanitizer. I get better results from Sporting Waves and warm water. Only thing it&#x27;s training is how to wet ya hair.</li>
            <li> you got to thank this guy on you tube nick wavy because i think he really helps in advertising your products and he said this thing will be good that&#x27;s why i bought and i hope is good best luck</li>
            <li> Exceptional! I Love Wave Builder Products.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my son. It is keeping his hair moist and we are already seeing the waves begin to form.</li>
            <li> my lil brother likes it so hey it good in my  book shouts outs to wave builder and the wavers out there spining</li>
            <li> this product is really great to have for people who are just starting out getting waves but if you already have them it wont really help with defining them i tried to use this as a non durag product like put it in my hair, brush and go and it didnt work. im sure that if i dedicated the time into it this would deepen my waves a little but since it doesnt have that shine thar im looking for it isnt really vital for me</li>
            <li> This training lotion is great also. It makes your hair soft and manageable. So far it has been doing what it suppose to do.</li>
            <li> thanks you i love it&lt;br /&gt;thanks you i love it&lt;br /&gt;thanks you i love it&lt;br /&gt;thanks you i love ti&lt;br /&gt;thanks you i love it&lt;br /&gt;tthanks you i love it</li>
