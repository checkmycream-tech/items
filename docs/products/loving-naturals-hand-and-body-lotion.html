            <li>I WILL MISS THEIR WONDERFUL PRODUCTS</li>

            <li>The Texture  Very good, on the thicker side.</li>
            <li>This lotion is GREAT.  </li>
            <li>Their lip balm is also great.</li>
            <li>Great lotion</li>
            <li>Has a great smell and cooling feeling.</li>
            <li>Loving naturals also has great customer service!</li>
            <li>I put some on 3 - 4 times a day and my skin feels great.</li>
            <li>Please choose wisely  </li>
            <li>And with so many fewer ingredients!  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love the purity and feel of this lotion, absorbs quick, never greasy and softens wonderfully.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazingly good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is creamy and spreads nicely.  </li>
            <li>Also, I keep it away from warm spots in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>The Loving Naturals stuff came up with a rating of 0 (no known problems)</li>
            <li>I tried this lotion and find it quite nice.  </li>
            <li>I had a friend mention that she found mold in her bottle of Loving Naturals Unscented Hemp Hand &amp; Body Lotion</li>
            <li>because of how the bottle design is, you&#x27;d think it wouldn&#x27;t be that good, but it&#x27;s actually great, they should sell it in national stores or whole foods market.</li>
            <li>According to Loving Naturals FAQ page:  - There should be a \\&quot;born on date\\&quot; and \\&quot;expiration date\\&quot; listed on the product container and that most of their products have an expiration date 2 years from the \\&quot;born on date\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>This lotion does not cause my daughter any discomfort, it keeps her skin moist and, best of all, is made with all natural ingredients that are not harmful in any way.  </li>
            <li>i used it on my legs after i took a warm shower and shaved (when my legs are the most dry/ tight/</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to buying more of the Loving Naturals products.</li>
            <li>Plus, I love the handy pump.  </li>
            <li>Though honestly, it may be better for you than the chemicals :).</li>
            <li>Plus I love that all of the ingredients are safe and organic</li>
            <li>I love the smell (lavender and grapefruit) and the texture of this lotion.  </li>
            <li>will keep looking for a non toxic product that moisturizes the skin more.</li>
            <li>i was looking through the EWG cosmetic database and this was the most natural/ healthiest moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I bought it for our son, because it&#x27;s safe without any girlie scent :-)  </li>
            <li>And I do peek into the bottle once in awhile, just to be sure</li>
            <li>just got this and am enjoying it.</li>
            <li>I really love this lotion -</li>
            <li>in fact, I&#x27;m here to buy more and figured I would add my review.  </li>
            <li>It is the most unscented thing I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>Safe, unscented,</li>
            <li>Most lotions that I have tried (all which had many more ingredients than this lotion</li>
            <li>The price we pay for not using toxic preservatives requires us to pay more attention to their condition.  </li>
            <li>Aloe and shea based lotions seem to work much better.</li>
            <li>Because of this, it is important that I find a lotion that is both effective in moisturizing my skin (and ideally, helps to control the eczema), while also not having potentially toxic/harmful ingredients, as I expose myself to a lot of the lotion!  </li>
            <li>I am a nurse and have issues with extremely dry and peeling skin on my hands and this stuff is awesome!  </li>
            <li>The scents are light, smell excellent, and do not smell feminine (nor masculine, they just smell natural and good).</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been very happy with the LN body lotion and like it for reasons other than its safety.</li>
            <li>Great that it&#x27;s made in the US and contains only safe ingredients.</li>
            <li>When I tried Loving Naturals&#x27; unscented body lotion, our search for a good lotion was finally over.  </li>
            <li>I am very conscious about what I am putting on my skin, so I was happy to find a natural lotion with good reviews.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>The Cosmetic Safety Database rates it as a 0 for one of the safest products available</li>
            <li>A plus with the peppermint version is it lightly tingles when used.   </li>
            <li>It glides on smooth and wears well.</li>
            <li>I purchased the unscented hemp lotion and feel that it is the perfect amount of moisture for everyday dryness.  </li>
            <li>I was willing to do this because I am a strong advocate of healthy living</li>
            <li>, the scents smell great, are light, and do not linger long.  </li>
            <li>Many of them feel good going on, but the moisturizing effect seems to be more or less temporary.  </li>
            <li>well, it&#x27;s not an intense moisturizer, but pretty good still.</li>
            <li>I really loved Loving Naturals&#x27; mission and safe product practices, but with 2 bottles contaminated with mold, it&#x27;s hard to trust the brand again.  </li>
            <li>This was my original review until finding the mold.  </li>
            <li>Thank you Loving Naturals for making safe products that actually work!</li>
            <li>I like the light and interesting smell of the Grapefruit and Lavender, and the lotion makes my skin much softer than the drugstore brands I was using before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I researched formulas without this chemical and found the Loving Natural&#x27;s brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that this really doesn&#x27;t have a scent</li>
            <li>It also makes a great general body moisturizer too, leaving my skin feeling super soft and not at all greasy once it&#x27;s absorbed!  </li>
            <li>first came across the Loving Natural&#x27;s when I read a newspaper article saying that the preservative \\&quot;paraben\\&quot; had been found in the tissue of women with breast cancer.</li>
            <li>I have done a lot of research on different lotions and tried a LOT of different ones, and I have been happy enough with Loving Naturals&#x27; Unscented Hemp Lotion that I have stopped looking!  </li>
            <li>I have very dry skin and was always looking for moisturizers with good ingredients and no fragrance that worked well.  </li>
            <li>This is a great everyday, non-toxic lotion, however, if you need intensive moisture relief, this probably will not be sufficient.</li>
            <li>The 16 oz bottle has lasted 3 months so far, and maybe has another 4-6 weeks more, so say 4.5 months if you bathe twice a day.  </li>
            <li>So if you have liked the lotion but not the scent, I would definitely recommend unscented.  </li>
            <li>I see that its out right now</li>
            <li>I have tried other natural lotions but this one is by far the best!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several products from this company and have only been happy with the sunscreen- which works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Its very strong and over powering, as well as it lingers on the skin for a long time.  </li>
            <li>it also works pretty  </li>
            <li>I looked at my creams and lotions at home, and sure enough, they all had some form of this chemical.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Knowing the problems with mold that others have experienced, I&#x27;ve decided to order the smaller bottles of the lotion so that I won&#x27;t having it sitting around too long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty picky about what I put on my skin</li>
            <li>I think the only thing that would make this lotion better were if it were sold in more physical locations.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m sure for you scent lovers, you could add some essential oils to the mixture).  </li>
            <li>When you first put it on it is a bit greasy, but that goes away within minutes.</li>
            <li>Guess I will be looking at whole foods for products that I can smell before buying!</li>
            <li>These scents last a bit longer than the body wash, but overall, after say 10 minutes, you or your partner would have to put a nose to the skin to pick up a trace of the pleasant scent.   </li>
            <li>Sure enough, there is black mold on the top layer of lotion!</li>
            <li>i should have realized when 5 star reviews of this product were given by people who HADNT reviewed any other products than &#x27;loving naturals&#x27;  its a shame that companies use the review tool for their marketing purpose.  </li>
            <li>this product is great for not being toxic, but the moisture doesn&#x27;t last as long as with other more toxic products like nivea.  </li>
            <li>and I loved it; it kept my skin and my baby&#x27;s skin moisturized, soft, delicate and smooth.</li>
            <li>The scent of the body wash was acceptable, but the lotion smells like either carmex or some kind of strange old medicated ointment.  </li>
            <li>I have been switching my daughter off of all products containing the ingredient \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; after finding out that it is a catch all word and you really don&#x27;t know what chemicals it contains.  </li>
            <li>I also noticed some very suspicious reviewing of this product line.</li>
            <li>I really wish companies would abstain from tampering with the reviewing process.</li>
            <li>It has really helped my dermatitis.</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li>and it really moisturizes.  </li>
            <li>I am really horrified.  </li>
            <li>and I have very oily skin too.  </li>
            <li>The unscented hemp really is unscented, which was pleasing.</li>
            <li>It just doesnt seem to do much.  </li>
            <li>The lotion also felt very greasy after application</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s priced reasonably and made by a family-owned company that cares about its products and customers.</li>
            <li>The cream makes my skin feel soft right away.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand about the mold issue but their website says most of their products expiration dates are 2 years from the born on date and  exposure to extreme temperatures can reduce the shelf life and compromise quality of any products, especially natural products.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re still not like the hands of a princess due in no part to the lotion, but they&#x27;re much more moist, and I&#x27;m not embarrassed to touch someone with them now, which I&#x27;m prone to do.</li>
            <li>The cost of the lotion is also very manageable, especially given how quickly I go through it.  </li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure if those had mold, but I checked another brand new bottle I had, which hadn&#x27;t been used yet, only to find the exact same thing - MOLD!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>As recommended on their site, I have stored the lotion in a cool, dry place to help extend the shelf life, but still, mold was found in those 2 bottles.</li>
            <li>, WE LIVE IN FL AFTER MOVING FROM BOSTON.</li>
            <li>I have also been trying to cut down on how much plastic we buy, so tried the bulk lotions at our local store (so we could refill our own containers), but could not find any with the same low EWG rating.  </li>
            <li>- Also, Aspen Bark is used as an addition to naturally preserve their products and protects it from mold and bacteria.  </li>
            <li>I just reordered this lotion - it is the Holy Grail of moisturizers, as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  </li>
            <li>saw the posts about mold, so went and checked my nearly year-old bottle -</li>
            <li>Before I give my review, I will say I was surprised to see 1 star reviews for this product.</li>
            <li>I ordered directly from there site - I don&#x27;t think Amazon was carrying it at that time (or</li>
            <li>I cannot believe I have been applying mold on my young children every day.  </li>
            <li>I have a similar review for the body wash, which I also highly recommend.   </li>
            <li>it made my legs feel back to normal.</li>
            <li>Because I have my hands in water a lot, they used to be so dry that certain fabrics would stick to them.</li>
            <li>After finding out whats really in those big commercial brands we just don&#x27;t have enough really natural lotions to pick from.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a body wash and lotion for not only my 18 month old, but me and my husband as well.  </li>
            <li>sorry to see the negative review of this body lotion featured so prominently, I guess because many people thought it was helpful and</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not like the other moisturizers that say \\&quot;natural and organic\\&quot; but end up having all these chemicals in them (the FDA doesn&#x27;t regualate cosmetic safety and use of the word natural btw), this one really is natural.</li>
            <li>The whole family uses this lotion now and I will not buy any other brand.</li>
            <li>Or maybe its because I live in dry Arizona.</li>
            <li>The scent also does not linger long, so it is completely acceptable for men who prefer to smell neutral.</li>
            <li>My son is also prone to eczema, and I noticed today after only 2 washes that his skin looks significantly drier, which is not a good thing.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has very dry and sensitive skin.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> it also works pretty  </li>
            <li> I looked at my creams and lotions at home, and sure enough, they all had some form of this chemical.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Knowing the problems with mold that others have experienced, I&#x27;ve decided to order the smaller bottles of the lotion so that I won&#x27;t having it sitting around too long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty picky about what I put on my skin</li>
            <li> I think the only thing that would make this lotion better were if it were sold in more physical locations.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m sure for you scent lovers, you could add some essential oils to the mixture).  </li>
            <li> When you first put it on it is a bit greasy, but that goes away within minutes.</li>
            <li> Guess I will be looking at whole foods for products that I can smell before buying!</li>
            <li> These scents last a bit longer than the body wash, but overall, after say 10 minutes, you or your partner would have to put a nose to the skin to pick up a trace of the pleasant scent.   </li>
            <li> Sure enough, there is black mold on the top layer of lotion!</li>
            <li> i should have realized when 5 star reviews of this product were given by people who HADNT reviewed any other products than &#x27;loving naturals&#x27;  its a shame that companies use the review tool for their marketing purpose.  </li>
            <li> this product is great for not being toxic, but the moisture doesn&#x27;t last as long as with other more toxic products like nivea.  </li>
            <li> and I loved it; it kept my skin and my baby&#x27;s skin moisturized, soft, delicate and smooth.</li>
            <li> The scent of the body wash was acceptable, but the lotion smells like either carmex or some kind of strange old medicated ointment.  </li>
            <li> I have been switching my daughter off of all products containing the ingredient \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; after finding out that it is a catch all word and you really don&#x27;t know what chemicals it contains.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed some very suspicious reviewing of this product line.</li>
            <li> I really wish companies would abstain from tampering with the reviewing process.</li>
            <li> It has really helped my dermatitis.</li>
            <li> Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li> and it really moisturizes.  </li>
            <li> I am really horrified.  </li>
            <li> and I have very oily skin too.  </li>
            <li> The unscented hemp really is unscented, which was pleasing.</li>
            <li> It just doesnt seem to do much.  </li>
            <li> The lotion also felt very greasy after application</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s priced reasonably and made by a family-owned company that cares about its products and customers.</li>
            <li> The cream makes my skin feel soft right away.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand about the mold issue but their website says most of their products expiration dates are 2 years from the born on date and  exposure to extreme temperatures can reduce the shelf life and compromise quality of any products, especially natural products.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re still not like the hands of a princess due in no part to the lotion, but they&#x27;re much more moist, and I&#x27;m not embarrassed to touch someone with them now, which I&#x27;m prone to do.</li>
            <li> The cost of the lotion is also very manageable, especially given how quickly I go through it.  </li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t sure if those had mold, but I checked another brand new bottle I had, which hadn&#x27;t been used yet, only to find the exact same thing - MOLD!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> As recommended on their site, I have stored the lotion in a cool, dry place to help extend the shelf life, but still, mold was found in those 2 bottles.</li>
            <li> , WE LIVE IN FL AFTER MOVING FROM BOSTON.</li>
            <li> I have also been trying to cut down on how much plastic we buy, so tried the bulk lotions at our local store (so we could refill our own containers), but could not find any with the same low EWG rating.  </li>
            <li> - Also, Aspen Bark is used as an addition to naturally preserve their products and protects it from mold and bacteria.  </li>
            <li> I just reordered this lotion - it is the Holy Grail of moisturizers, as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  </li>
            <li> saw the posts about mold, so went and checked my nearly year-old bottle -</li>
            <li> Before I give my review, I will say I was surprised to see 1 star reviews for this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered directly from there site - I don&#x27;t think Amazon was carrying it at that time (or</li>
            <li> I cannot believe I have been applying mold on my young children every day.  </li>
            <li> I have a similar review for the body wash, which I also highly recommend.   </li>
            <li> it made my legs feel back to normal.</li>
            <li> Because I have my hands in water a lot, they used to be so dry that certain fabrics would stick to them.</li>
            <li> After finding out whats really in those big commercial brands we just don&#x27;t have enough really natural lotions to pick from.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a body wash and lotion for not only my 18 month old, but me and my husband as well.  </li>
            <li> sorry to see the negative review of this body lotion featured so prominently, I guess because many people thought it was helpful and</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not like the other moisturizers that say \\&quot;natural and organic\\&quot; but end up having all these chemicals in them (the FDA doesn&#x27;t regualate cosmetic safety and use of the word natural btw), this one really is natural.</li>
            <li> The whole family uses this lotion now and I will not buy any other brand.</li>
            <li> Or maybe its because I live in dry Arizona.</li>
            <li> The scent also does not linger long, so it is completely acceptable for men who prefer to smell neutral.</li>
            <li> My son is also prone to eczema, and I noticed today after only 2 washes that his skin looks significantly drier, which is not a good thing.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has very dry and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I also live in a very dry climate so this review is based on my moderately dry hands (no cracking, bleeding skin).</li>
            <li> Even my husband who hates all lotion because it \\&quot;feels gross\\&quot; is willing to use this on our girls, at least.  </li>
            <li> It provides long lasting moisture and with continued use has been healing my skin.  </li>
            <li> So suffice it to say, you need to have a care for your natural products unlike your toxic brands that you can probably hand down to your grandchildren.</li>
            <li> This lotion goes on well enough but dries to a chalky, dry residue.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and very dry skin, so must lotion my entire body every day.  </li>
            <li> The same for the companies who claim their product is organic and it really is not.</li>
            <li> I had a minor panic attack when I read</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s a bad batch with these 2 bottles I have ordered from their website (Loving Naturals) that both contain MOLD, not sure if it&#x27;s their \\&quot;secret ingredient\\&quot;, but after being deceived with a \\&quot;0 rating\\&quot; from EWG, mold is quite hazardous.</li>
            <li> Though I&#x27;m sure a product that does not have a strong, lingering (and ridiculously artificial) smell would be a turn off for the women (and disappointingly some men) who have a passion for stinking up the office and the rest of the world with their perfumes.</li>
            <li> but my skin also feels dry still.  </li>
            <li> (the dark spot in the middle&#x27;s just the impression from where the pump has been).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> AND, it keeps me moisturized in our dry Colorado winters!  </li>
            <li> From my previous bottles, I didn&#x27;t open the cap</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it daily on my 2 children, ages 2 and 4 for the past several months.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cold much of the year where I live, so perhaps that&#x27;s got something to do with it.</li>
            <li> scented body wash - I like the body wash just fine, but the smell was a little weird for my tastes.  </li>
            <li> The price does include freeshipping, but I&#x27;m being careful not to waste this as I need it to last a little while in order to make it feasible to use regularly.</li>
            <li> I spent hours, yes, HOURS, going through the Environmental Working Groups database to find products to use for my children.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, too.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t want to believe it, but as I dispensed lotion onto my hand, I noticed a weird discoloration in the lotion.</li>
            <li> some other reviewers say they had mold in their lotion.  </li>
            <li> I have read the reviews of people finding mold growing in their lotion, which is unfortunate, but is an issue to be aware of when using any cosmetic products with fewer ingredients/chemicals.  </li>
            <li> My hands get dry from washing dishes, washing hands after changing my little one&#x27;s diaper, giving my little one a bath, etc.</li>
            <li> I AM SADDENED TO SEE THEIR WEBSITE SEEMS TO BE CLOSING DOWN</li>
            <li> Even when typical lotions say \\&quot;unscented\\</li>
            <li> About a week ago, I started noticing what looked like a few pieces of lint/dirt when applying the lotion.  </li>
            <li> Goes on easily, not oily, absorbs well.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work, as I waited 3 weeks for it to arrive and have tried to phase out the rest of the bad chemical products in my house.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually do reviews.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually buy scented products but decided to risk it and try the \\&quot;Grapefruit &amp; Lavender.\\</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I realized what a small bottle the 8oz. would be.</li>
            <li> I thought that was weird because the lotion is white.  </li>
            <li> But, no more.</li>
            <li> Not very pleasant.</li>
            <li> Works well in a dry climate, doesn&#x27;t have a weird smell and my daughter likes it.</li>
            <li> I am also disappointed how difficult it is to find a natural product that actually works.</li>
            <li> This one does not bother me in the least.  </li>
            <li> Not a pleasant sensation.</li>
            <li> Mold in moisturizer is pretty disgusting.</li>
            <li> Not sure what it was, I opened the bottle only to be shocked to find MOLD, disgusting, fuzzy, dark colored MOLD.</li>
            <li> Today I was SHOCKED and STUNNED when I opened the cap and saw a layer of black MOLD on the lotion.  </li>
            <li> Wow, how disgusting!</li>
            <li> &quot; I find there is still a weird perfume-y (or something) smell.  </li>
            <li> and I hate that feeling.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disgusted.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am a nurse and have issues with extremely dry and peeling skin on my hands and this stuff is awesome!  It provides long lasting moisture and with continued use has been healing my skin.  It also makes a great general body moisturizer too, leaving my skin feeling super soft and not at all greasy once it&#x27;s absorbed!  Plus I love that all of the ingredients are safe and organic and I don&#x27;t have to worry about exposing my body to any harmful toxins! Thank you Loving Naturals for making safe products that actually work!</li>
            <li> I have been switching my daughter off of all products containing the ingredient \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; after finding out that it is a catch all word and you really don&#x27;t know what chemicals it contains.  Ordered this lotion to try. Works well in a dry climate, doesn&#x27;t have a weird smell and my daughter likes it.</li>
            <li> This lotion goes on well enough but dries to a chalky, dry residue. Not very pleasant. I also noticed some very suspicious reviewing of this product line. I really wish companies would abstain from tampering with the reviewing process. I&#x27;ve tried several products from this company and have only been happy with the sunscreen- which works pretty well.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t want to believe it, but as I dispensed lotion onto my hand, I noticed a weird discoloration in the lotion. Not sure what it was, I opened the bottle only to be shocked to find MOLD, disgusting, fuzzy, dark colored MOLD. I have used the Unscented lotion and I loved it; it kept my skin and my baby&#x27;s skin moisturized, soft, delicate and smooth. From my previous bottles, I didn&#x27;t open the cap so I wasn&#x27;t sure if those had mold, but I checked another brand new bottle I had, which hadn&#x27;t been used yet, only to find the exact same thing - MOLD! Not sure if it&#x27;s a bad batch with these 2 bottles I have ordered from their website (Loving Naturals) that both contain MOLD, not sure if it&#x27;s their \\&quot;secret ingredient\\&quot;, but after being deceived with a \\&quot;0 rating\\&quot; from EWG, mold is quite hazardous. I really loved Loving Naturals&#x27; mission and safe product practices, but with 2 bottles contaminated with mold, it&#x27;s hard to trust the brand again.  This will be the last time I purchase from them.  NOTE:   According to Loving Naturals FAQ page:  - There should be a \\&quot;born on date\\&quot; and \\&quot;expiration date\\&quot; listed on the product container and that most of their products have an expiration date 2 years from the \\&quot;born on date\\&quot;.  I have looked everywhere on the 2 bottles and there are no \\&quot;born on dates\\&quot; nor \\&quot;expiration dates\\&quot; listed any where.  - Also, Aspen Bark is used as an addition to naturally preserve their products and protects it from mold and bacteria.  As recommended on their site, I have stored the lotion in a cool, dry place to help extend the shelf life, but still, mold was found in those 2 bottles.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very dry and sensitive skin.  Our pediatrician has recommended brand after brand of lotion to try on her, and none worked.  Actually, they made her scream from pain and irritated her skin for hours afterwards.  When I tried Loving Naturals&#x27; unscented body lotion, our search for a good lotion was finally over.  This lotion does not cause my daughter any discomfort, it keeps her skin moist and, best of all, is made with all natural ingredients that are not harmful in any way.  The whole family uses this lotion now and I will not buy any other brand.</li>
            <li> I have tried other natural lotions but this one is by far the best! It has really helped my dermatitis. It soaks in well. The Cosmetic Safety Database rates it as a 0 for one of the safest products available so I have no reservations about using it on my children. I plan to reorder this again and again.</li>
            <li> I also was in search of a product that got a low rating on EWG, especially after taking my grad school toxicology course and learning about some of the chemicals we unknowingly put on our bodies.  I love the smell (lavender and grapefruit) and the texture of this lotion.  It is creamy and spreads nicely.  I have also been trying to cut down on how much plastic we buy, so tried the bulk lotions at our local store (so we could refill our own containers), but could not find any with the same low EWG rating.  And yes, I did check, no mold in my bottle.  Though honestly, it may be better for you than the chemicals :).</li>
            <li> I just reordered this lotion - it is the Holy Grail of moisturizers, as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  I have very dry skin and was always looking for moisturizers with good ingredients and no fragrance that worked well.  Many of them feel good going on, but the moisturizing effect seems to be more or less temporary.  This stuff is amazingly good.&lt;br /&gt;I saw the posts about mold, so went and checked my nearly year-old bottle - it&#x27;s fine.  It&#x27;s cold much of the year where I live, so perhaps that&#x27;s got something to do with it. Even if mold were a problem, I&#x27;d do what one reviewer suggested and just get smaller quantities.</li>
            <li> this product is great for not being toxic, but the moisture doesn&#x27;t last as long as with other more toxic products like nivea.  will keep looking for a non toxic product that moisturizes the skin more.</li>
            <li> This is the moisturizer to use. This product scores a 0 (0 as in zero hazard/very low carcinogen risk) on EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep Database, which should be the standard.   Before I give my review, I will say I was surprised to see 1 star reviews for this product. Mold in moisturizer is pretty disgusting. However, I have not used the unscented hemp version, and have not had any mold in my bottles. Maybe it&#x27;s something in the hemp version, or maybe it&#x27;s the reviewers&#x27; living environment. Or maybe its because I live in dry Arizona. For now, just stick to the lavender or the peppermint - there&#x27;s no reason to buy the unscented, as you will read below, the scents smell great, are light, and do not linger long.  The Scent  The scents are light, smell excellent, and do not smell feminine (nor masculine, they just smell natural and good). The scent also does not linger long, so it is completely acceptable for men who prefer to smell neutral. Though I&#x27;m sure a product that does not have a strong, lingering (and ridiculously artificial) smell would be a turn off for the women (and disappointingly some men) who have a passion for stinking up the office and the rest of the world with their perfumes. These scents last a bit longer than the body wash, but overall, after say 10 minutes, you or your partner would have to put a nose to the skin to pick up a trace of the pleasant scent.   The Texture  Very good, on the thicker side. Not oily.   A plus with the peppermint version is it lightly tingles when used.   The Life  I bathe 2-3 times a day and moisturize after. The 16 oz bottle has lasted 3 months so far, and maybe has another 4-6 weeks more, so say 4.5 months if you bathe twice a day.  I have a similar review for the body wash, which I also highly recommend.   I don&#x27;t usually do reviews. I was willing to do this because I am a strong advocate of healthy living and I believe all companies who supply carcinogenic products to the public should be put out of business. The same for the companies who claim their product is organic and it really is not. I am also disappointed how difficult it is to find a natural product that actually works. You can help promote this idea/standard by switching to this product. Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li> i decided to get this cause i was looking through the EWG cosmetic database and this was the most natural/ healthiest moisturizer. it&#x27;s not like the other moisturizers that say \\&quot;natural and organic\\&quot; but end up having all these chemicals in them (the FDA doesn&#x27;t regualate cosmetic safety and use of the word natural btw), this one really is natural. it also works pretty  well, it&#x27;s not an intense moisturizer, but pretty good still. i used it on my legs after i took a warm shower and shaved (when my legs are the most dry/ tight/ irritated)and  it made my legs feel back to normal. it&#x27;s also not greasey and doesn&#x27;t leave that moist/ greasey feeling on your legs after you apply. it absorbs and drys after like 1-2 minutes. you also get a lot for the price (not based on drugstore standards but department store/ sephora standards). because of how the bottle design is, you&#x27;d think it wouldn&#x27;t be that good, but it&#x27;s actually great, they should sell it in national stores or whole foods market.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect lotion if you want something that doesn&#x27;t have a scent.  I bought it for our son, because it&#x27;s safe without any girlie scent :-)  It glides on smooth and wears well.</li>
            <li> This is an update to my review below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sorry to see the negative review of this body lotion featured so prominently, I guess because many people thought it was helpful and \\&quot;saved\\&quot; them from buying a faulty product. I would suggest that people reconsider and try this lotion. I&#x27;m being self-interested here in that I want to see this company stay in business so I can buy from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first came across the Loving Natural&#x27;s when I read a newspaper article saying that the preservative \\&quot;paraben\\&quot; had been found in the tissue of women with breast cancer. I looked at my creams and lotions at home, and sure enough, they all had some form of this chemical. I researched formulas without this chemical and found the Loving Natural&#x27;s brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been very happy with the LN body lotion and like it for reasons other than its safety. I like the light and interesting smell of the Grapefruit and Lavender, and the lotion makes my skin much softer than the drugstore brands I was using before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knowing the problems with mold that others have experienced, I&#x27;ve decided to order the smaller bottles of the lotion so that I won&#x27;t having it sitting around too long. Also, I keep it away from warm spots in the bathroom. And I do peek into the bottle once in awhile, just to be sure (the dark spot in the middle&#x27;s just the impression from where the pump has been).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t often review products, and I&#x27;ve never re-reviewed a product, but I hope I can add a balancing voice to the criticisms of this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got this and am enjoying it. Great that it&#x27;s made in the US and contains only safe ingredients. I don&#x27;t usually buy scented products but decided to risk it and try the \\&quot;Grapefruit &amp; Lavender.\\&quot; I like the scent! especially for daytime. It&#x27;s vigorous. Could be used by a man, too. The cream makes my skin feel soft right away. I don&#x27;t think I realized what a small bottle the 8oz. would be. The price does include freeshipping, but I&#x27;m being careful not to waste this as I need it to last a little while in order to make it feasible to use regularly. I&#x27;m looking forward to buying more of the Loving Naturals products.</li>
            <li> I spent hours, yes, HOURS, going through the Environmental Working Groups database to find products to use for my children.  The Loving Naturals stuff came up with a rating of 0 (no known problems) and so I figured I would give it a shot.  I ordered directly from there site - I don&#x27;t think Amazon was carrying it at that time (or I didn&#x27;t think to check)  I really love this lotion - in fact, I&#x27;m here to buy more and figured I would add my review.  I purchased the unscented hemp lotion and feel that it is the perfect amount of moisture for everyday dryness.  I have no problem putting a bit on my face after a shower, or all over my girls after a bath.  Even my husband who hates all lotion because it \\&quot;feels gross\\&quot; is willing to use this on our girls, at least.  I had a minor panic attack when I read some other reviewers say they had mold in their lotion.  I just checked our bottle (which we have had for quite a while now) and there is no mold.  On a side note, I also ordered the grapefruit and vanilla (I think it was) scented body wash - I like the body wash just fine, but the smell was a little weird for my tastes.  So if you have liked the lotion but not the scent, I would definitely recommend unscented.  It is the most unscented thing I have ever tried.  Even when typical lotions say \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; I find there is still a weird perfume-y (or something) smell.  This one does not bother me in the least.  This is a great everyday, non-toxic lotion, however, if you need intensive moisture relief, this probably will not be sufficient.</li>
            <li> This lotion is GREAT.  Safe, unscented, and it really moisturizes.  We use it for ourselves and our baby. Their lip balm is also great.</li>
            <li> i should have realized when 5 star reviews of this product were given by people who HADNT reviewed any other products than &#x27;loving naturals&#x27;  its a shame that companies use the review tool for their marketing purpose.  Please choose wisely  this is a scame</li>
            <li> I purchased the Unscented Hemp Hand &amp; Body Lotion based on the zero score from the Environmental Working Group.  I&#x27;ve used it daily on my 2 children, ages 2 and 4 for the past several months.  About a week ago, I started noticing what looked like a few pieces of lint/dirt when applying the lotion.  I thought that was weird because the lotion is white.  Today I was SHOCKED and STUNNED when I opened the cap and saw a layer of black MOLD on the lotion.  I cannot believe I have been applying mold on my young children every day.  I am really horrified.  I purchased this product thinking I was choosing the safest lotion on the market, instead I have been applying mold on my kids.  I have contacted the company to tell them they need to recall this product and I have contacted the Consumer Product Safety Commission.</li>
            <li> Great lotion I would highly recommend it. Has a great smell and cooling feeling. Loving naturals also has great customer service!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty picky about what I put on my skin and I have very oily skin too.  I tried this lotion and find it quite nice.  Goes on easily, not oily, absorbs well.  It was also listed a \\&quot;0\\&quot; on the EWG&#x27;s SkinDeep website ([...]  I am a consumer only and have no affiliation with the company that makes this lotion.  I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and very dry skin, so must lotion my entire body every day.  Because of this, it is important that I find a lotion that is both effective in moisturizing my skin (and ideally, helps to control the eczema), while also not having potentially toxic/harmful ingredients, as I expose myself to a lot of the lotion!  I have done a lot of research on different lotions and tried a LOT of different ones, and I have been happy enough with Loving Naturals&#x27; Unscented Hemp Lotion that I have stopped looking!  Most lotions that I have tried (all which had many more ingredients than this lotion, even if trying to be \\&quot;natural\\&quot;) just kept my skin acceptably moisturized; this lotion actually helps reduce eczema flare-ups.  And with so many fewer ingredients!  The cost of the lotion is also very manageable, especially given how quickly I go through it.  I think the only thing that would make this lotion better were if it were sold in more physical locations.  However, the fact that it is sold through Amazon (and thus, eligible for Prime shipping) made it an acceptable choice for a product that I buy on a regular basis.  I have read the reviews of people finding mold growing in their lotion, which is unfortunate, but is an issue to be aware of when using any cosmetic products with fewer ingredients/chemicals.  The price we pay for not using toxic preservatives requires us to pay more attention to their condition.  But assuming that the mold-growth is the exception rather than the rule, I cannot recommend this lotion enough, especially for anyone with eczema.</li>
            <li> I am very conscious about what I am putting on my skin, so I was happy to find a natural lotion with good reviews.  I love that this really doesn&#x27;t have a scent (I&#x27;m sure for you scent lovers, you could add some essential oils to the mixture).  Plus, I love the handy pump.  AND, it keeps me moisturized in our dry Colorado winters!  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I HAVE MY UMPTEENTH BOTTLE OF THE HEMP LOTION IN OUR BATHROOM, AND CHECKED IT AFTER READING THE REVIEWS. ZERO MOLD AND I HAVE HAD IT FOR ABOUT 4 MONTHS. I AM SADDENED TO SEE THEIR WEBSITE SEEMS TO BE CLOSING DOWN AS THEY HAVE NO STOCK. I WILL MISS THEIR WONDERFUL PRODUCTS AS MY HUSBAND USES THEIR LIP SUNSCREEN AND I USE THEIR BODY SUNSCREEN. MY HUSBAND IS A PHYSICIAN AND I AM A NURSE, WE LIVE IN FL AFTER MOVING FROM BOSTON. WHAT A SHAME THEY SEEM TO BE GOING UNDER. I WISH WE HAD STOCKED UP.</li>
            <li> MOLD! Wow, how disgusting! I had a friend mention that she found mold in her bottle of Loving Naturals Unscented Hemp Hand &amp; Body Lotion so I checked mine. Sure enough, there is black mold on the top layer of lotion! I can only hope that since it pumps from the bottom, I haven&#x27;t been applying mold to my hands. I will never purchase from this company again. I&#x27;m disgusted. I sent an email to the company as well as posting about the mold on their Facebook page, so we&#x27;ll see if I get a response.  This was my original review until finding the mold.  I was searching for a lotion with a rating of 0 or 1 from the cosmetic database and decided to give this one a try. I love it! The unscented hemp really is unscented, which was pleasing. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products that claim to be unscented, but still have a smell that lingers. My hands get dry from washing dishes, washing hands after changing my little one&#x27;s diaper, giving my little one a bath, etc. I also live in a very dry climate so this review is based on my moderately dry hands (no cracking, bleeding skin). When you first put it on it is a bit greasy, but that goes away within minutes. A little goes a long way, too. You don&#x27;t have to keep reapplying it like you do with some lotions. I put some on 3 - 4 times a day and my skin feels great.</li>
            <li> It just doesnt seem to do much.  I use it and I can feel it on my skin but my skin also feels dry still.  Aloe and shea based lotions seem to work much better.</li>
            <li> I am presently on a bottle that I had bought in June 2012, and there is NO mold what so ever. I had ordered an extra one before realizing I had 2 already and I am just now using it. I love the purity and feel of this lotion, absorbs quick, never greasy and softens wonderfully. I don&#x27;t understand about the mold issue but their website says most of their products expiration dates are 2 years from the born on date and  exposure to extreme temperatures can reduce the shelf life and compromise quality of any products, especially natural products. So suffice it to say, you need to have a care for your natural products unlike your toxic brands that you can probably hand down to your grandchildren. I would hope that this does not affect its continuation. I see that its out right now and I wanted to order another, not wanting to forget and be without. After finding out whats really in those big commercial brands we just don&#x27;t have enough really natural lotions to pick from.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a body wash and lotion for not only my 18 month old, but me and my husband as well.  The lavender and grapefruit scent smells like citronella.  Its very strong and over powering, as well as it lingers on the skin for a long time.  My son is also prone to eczema, and I noticed today after only 2 washes that his skin looks significantly drier, which is not a good thing.  My husband thought it smelled like GIN.  It was definitely funky and not what I would want my baby smelling like.  I also purchased the peppermint and tea tree scent body wash/lotion.  The scent of the body wash was acceptable, but the lotion smells like either carmex or some kind of strange old medicated ointment.  The lotion also felt very greasy after application and I hate that feeling.  I really wanted this to work, as I waited 3 weeks for it to arrive and have tried to phase out the rest of the bad chemical products in my house.  Guess I will be looking at whole foods for products that I can smell before buying!</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion I have ever used bar none, and, best of all, it&#x27;s nontoxic and recommended by the Environmental Working Group. Because I have my hands in water a lot, they used to be so dry that certain fabrics would stick to them. Not a pleasant sensation. They would also \\&quot;pick\\&quot; some fabrics. But, no more. They&#x27;re still not like the hands of a princess due in no part to the lotion, but they&#x27;re much more moist, and I&#x27;m not embarrassed to touch someone with them now, which I&#x27;m prone to do. Also, I have psoriasis, and it is the only lotion that has ever soothed it and kept it from flaking. It&#x27;s priced reasonably and made by a family-owned company that cares about its products and customers. I can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
