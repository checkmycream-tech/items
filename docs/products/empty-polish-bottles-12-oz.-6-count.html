            <li>Once I did that, the brushes were perfectly good.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it is a good product.</li>

            <li>Good product for what I needed them to do.</li>
            <li>good people to deal with--always make good on their promises, and has quality products-polite correspondences-very courteous-shipments are packed well-almost too good</li>
            <li>Of the 6, one of the brushes were unusable, but I still love these bottles!</li>
            <li>We made our own colors and had a blast.</li>

            <li>They&#x27;re nice, seem durable</li>
            <li>Nice design.</li>
            <li>I have started dabbling with making my own nail polishes, and I ordered these bottles.  </li>
            <li>I used them for helping my kids make their own chemical free nail polish!</li>
            <li>The oil came in a squeeze bottle,but brushing the oil on my cuticle gives me more control.</li>
            <li>The resin also comes in a squeeze,brushing resin on also gives me better control of the resin application to my nails.</li>
            <li>Okay for my intended use of cuticle oil application, but I wouldn&#x27;t use these for applying nail polish.</li>
            <li>I love nail art</li>

            <li>buy again if I need more.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve since found joy in mixing some of my unused polishes to create new, and grand color schemes.</li>
            <li>Wish bottle opening was wider but still purchase is a good value and vendor sent bottles from Florida to Hawaii fast.</li>
            <li>These bottles are good for head cement, super glue, and other liquids for fly tying.  </li>
            <li>I make my own nailpolish and these bottles were exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Brush is fine.</li>
            <li>I have another bottle filled with resin.</li>
            <li>The tops fit well and seem well made.</li>
            <li>The caps screw on and are secure.</li>
            <li>The bottles arrived quickly and well wrapped to avoid any breakage.</li>
            <li>The brush also feels more bristle-like than soft.</li>
            <li>i got some super cheap syringes (needle-less, obviously) that make it super easy to suck up polish and inject it into these bottles.</li>
            <li>Exactly as shown and quick response.</li>
            <li>Just right for aqueous flux on the workbenches.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking that they&#x27;ll come in handy down the line when I get to the point of making my own indie polishes.</li>
            <li>I guess since I&#x27;m making my own colors, I can just use the ball from a bottle I empty.</li>
            <li>I made tinted sheer colors for top coats.</li>
            <li>Heavy nice glass and the brushes go all the way to the bottom of bottle.</li>
            <li>These are fairly large bottles with decent quality brushes that allow you to make custom colors.  </li>
            <li>I saw some reviews that said the neck of the bottles were too narrow,  but they seem pretty standard to me (and I own almost 400 bottles of polish).  </li>
            <li>I love that it came with the little mixing balls.</li>
            <li>The Bottles &amp; brushes are great, but I ordered 2 of these 6 packs back in December (haven&#x27;t used them until recently) and noticed none of them had the little ball in them.</li>
            <li>Which kind of sucks, but</li>
            <li>Definitely a must have for anyone interested in polish.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft, even and pliable,  too.</li>
            <li>The bottles are fine, but the brush bristles are very stiff and plastic-y.</li>
            <li>The brushes are a little stuff so make sure to scrunch them a little before putting in the nail polish.</li>
            <li>i love my little bottles - service was fast and none were broken - would use this vender again and recommend to friends</li>
            <li>I recommend dipping the brushes in some acetone and crunching them around a bit to soften the bristles and get rid of any residue before use (allowing it to dry completely before sticking them in polish, of course).</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Got this because I was looking for a thinner brush for my opi nail polish. It&#x27;s great. There was one review that it came with those little mixing balls but they don&#x27;t which isn&#x27;t a big deal. The brushes are a little stuff so make sure to scrunch them a little before putting in the nail polish.</li>
            <li> I bought these empty bottles to mix nail polishes with my sister.  We made our own colors and had a blast.</li>
            <li> My daughter was doing a class project for an invention and she made her own nailpolish.  These were pefect once we used a tiny funnel to fill them.  They have a really narrow neck.  Besides that, great.</li>
            <li> Exactly as shown and quick response.</li>
            <li> The bottles were not wide-mouth like the picture shows. But that&#x27;s really a minor thing for me. They&#x27;re nice, seem durable and they each have one BB in them to aid in mixing. GREAT price, too. I&#x27;m very happy with this product :o)</li>
            <li> Descent bottles...brushes are a bit thin.</li>
            <li> Mine each came with a mixing ball, unlike some reviewers... However the brushes are TERRIBLE. They are really skinny and incredibly stiff. I tried bending the bristles a bit on one to loosen them up, but it didn&#x27;t help at all and now it&#x27;s fanned out at weird angles. I guess I&#x27;ll still use them for storage of excess polish if I try my hand at DIY jelly polish.</li>
            <li> Great bottles to have at home or in a spa. Excellent for retail/resale purposes too. I used them for helping my kids make their own chemical free nail polish!</li>
            <li> The Bottles &amp; brushes are great, but I ordered 2 of these 6 packs back in December (haven&#x27;t used them until recently) and noticed none of them had the little ball in them. Which kind of sucks, but I guess since I&#x27;m making my own colors, I can just use the ball from a bottle I empty. Or I&#x27;ll find the balls to order elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Did not come with mixing balls :( Had to order some.  Other than that, jars are as advertised.  All arrived unbroken.</li>
            <li> These bottles are good for head cement, super glue, and other liquids for fly tying.  Bottle opening is small though.  Wish bottle opening was wider but still purchase is a good value and vendor sent bottles from Florida to Hawaii fast.</li>
            <li> Some of the bottles were broken when received.</li>
            <li> The bottles arrived quickly and well wrapped to avoid any breakage. The brushes are a bit stiff, but after pulling the brush between my finger nails, they softened up enough to use them with my essential oils.</li>
            <li> The ball bearing was not in the bottle.</li>
            <li> Got these awhile ago,I have several uses for them.One is being used formula cuticle oil.The oil came in a squeeze bottle,but brushing the oil on my cuticle gives me more control.I have another bottle filled with resin.Resin used for fiberglass nail application.The resin also comes in a squeeze,brushing resin on also gives me better control of the resin application to my nails.I have two other bottles with nail polishes that I mixed myself.I made tinted sheer colors for top coats.The bottles came to me clean,and wrapped well.I have been looking for empty nail polish bottles for a long time, and now I found them.</li>
            <li> Came with no mixing balls, although it says they are include. Had to buy them separately, adding to the overall cost so, not worth the price.</li>
            <li> These bottles are like nail polish bottles. Even with the brush. I use these for all my sealant liquids that I use for jewelry making. Instead of pulling out the big bottles I just use these when I need them. I just put a label on them so I know what they are.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll waste the remaining bit of whatever liquid you choose to place in these bottles because the brush is about 2-3mm off the bottom. The brush also feels more bristle-like than soft. However, the bottles are sturdy.</li>
            <li> i love my little bottles - service was fast and none were broken - would use this vender again and recommend to friends</li>
            <li> Durable. Brush is fine. I make my own nailpolish and these bottles were exactly what I needed. They are yhe size of standard nailpolishes found in the store or slightly larger. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Just right for aqueous flux on the workbenches.</li>
            <li> ...but they don&#x27;t come with the ball bearing as pictured. I had to purchase those separately. I recommend dipping the brushes in some acetone and crunching them around a bit to soften the bristles and get rid of any residue before use (allowing it to dry completely before sticking them in polish, of course). Once I did that, the brushes were perfectly good.</li>
            <li> I initially bought these empty bottles to use with PVA, to make application easier as a basecoat when using glitter polishes. I&#x27;ve since found joy in mixing some of my unused polishes to create new, and grand color schemes. I&#x27;m thinking that they&#x27;ll come in handy down the line when I get to the point of making my own indie polishes. At the price, they can&#x27;t be beat. Definitely a must have for anyone interested in polish.</li>
            <li> Bottles were perfect for my needs.  I saw some reviews that said the neck of the bottles were too narrow,  but they seem pretty standard to me (and I own almost 400 bottles of polish).  The brushes are soft, even and pliable,  too.</li>
            <li> These are very nice looking bottles with good brushes. Nice design. I&#x27;m using them for touch-up paint for tiny spots at home and for minoxidil for my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Would not purchase again. The bottles are fine, but the brush bristles are very stiff and plastic-y. Okay for my intended use of cuticle oil application, but I wouldn&#x27;t use these for applying nail polish.</li>
            <li> These are great. In the picture, it looks like the &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; part is really thin, but it fluffs up to just like any other nail polish brush, and so far i&#x27;ve have never had a bristle &amp;#34;shed&amp;#34; while i&#x27;m using the polish. I love that it came with the little mixing balls. i got some super cheap syringes (needle-less, obviously) that make it super easy to suck up polish and inject it into these bottles.</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointed in these. I bought based on the reviews that said there was a mixing ball in each. NO mixing balls in any of mine.</li>
            <li> These are fairly large bottles with decent quality brushes that allow you to make custom colors.  The tops fit well and seem well made.</li>
            <li> Brush doesn&#x27;t extend too far down in the bottle.</li>
            <li> Brush is rather short and there are no ball bearings. Otherwise, it is a good product.</li>
            <li> I love nail art and these are one of the basic items required.&lt;br /&gt;I gave these a try and they are better than I imagined.&lt;br /&gt;Durable bottles and good brush.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again if I need more.</li>
            <li> good people to deal with--always make good on their promises, and has quality products-polite correspondences-very courteous-shipments are packed well-almost too good</li>
            <li> These are perfect bottles for mixing my polish. Heavy nice glass and the brushes go all the way to the bottom of bottle. Will buy more when needed and will recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I have started dabbling with making my own nail polishes, and I ordered these bottles.  Of the 6, one of the brushes were unusable, but I still love these bottles!</li>
            <li> Good product for what I needed them to do. Each bottle came with a little ball inside which helps mix contents. The caps screw on and are secure. Size is perfect. Will buy these again when needed.</li>
