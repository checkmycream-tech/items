    <ol>
            <li>and this is the best price we&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>Great &amp; works good material tnx!</li>
            <li>I want a face wash that does both (and if they could make one that also brushes my teeth that would be great).</li>
            <li>Happy to use this product.</li>
            <li>Now that I have teenagers of my own, I&#x27;ve passed it on and it works for them, too!</li>
            <li>Good for me because I have oily skin</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t decided if I like the natural one or this one better, they both seem to do a very good job.</li>
            <li>Using makeup remover and washing my face is one too many steps at bedtime.</li>
            <li>but I have to wait to see more results</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin, even in the winter.</li>
            <li>It also rinses off easily when you use it.</li>
            <li>But as a mid-20s adult it works fairly well.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t aggravate my fair skin which is a major bonus.</li>
            <li>Keeps my face clean, that&#x27;s all I wanted out of it</li>
            <li>this one is a good middle of the road cleanser.</li>
            <li>This is the most gentle moisturizer I have found that still cleans good enough.</li>
            <li>I would recommend using something more natural and paraben free.</li>
            <li>This is a great product that does its job well and is very affordable especially compared to higher end fancy health and beauty products.  </li>
            <li>and I rarely breakout now</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that has never responded well to using more abrasive face washes, but has the tendency to break out with cleansers lacking salicylic acid...</li>
            <li>I really wish these guys can have one of the product that comes with the original formula.</li>
            <li>However, after using this product for well over a year, I can say that nothing has more consistently given me clear skin that</li>
            <li>so I can wash my face more often and the price was pretty reasonable and it feels nice on my extra sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a few different face washes and like this one the best.</li>
            <li>I have used other face washes that are more gentle than this, like Aveeno ultra calming face wash, but it doesn&#x27;t feel like it cleans good enough as Clearasil.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>I have skin that gets red easy and is oily.</li>
            <li>I have used this facewash for about 9 years now, and I would say that it performs very well.</li>
            <li>Clearasil has stopped making this and the new hydrabkast version makes my skin breakout!</li>
            <li>and this is one of the better washes in making it less greasy.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Most of what I used then really dried out my face, but this never did.  </li>
            <li>But ever since the company switched to the new formula (Salicylic Adid)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s some kind of natural face cleanser with Sea Salt for about the same price (too lazy to go</li>
            <li>After a couple weeks of use my skin has continued to stay clear.</li>
            <li>but these are 6 years old...</li>
            <li>then I have it near my sink in the kitchen</li>
            <li>My skins are too sensitive to handle these salicylic acid chemical.  </li>
            <li>We can&#x27;t find this sensitive formula in stores anymore</li>
            <li>It does have a tendency to dry the skin if you use twice a day, but using once a day it works very well for keeping skin clear.</li>
            <li>For those old Clearasil user fan, the only alternative brand I can find that are similar to the old Clearasil formula are the Wal-mart \\&quot;Equate\\&quot; brand.  </li>
            <li>I chose this product as I have sensitive skin, and some regular face wash burns my skin.</li>
            <li>I been a loyal Clearasil user for the past 20yrs and have been recommending it to my friends and family as well.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed too much changes other</li>
            <li>Using if everyday has been my key for success.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Not sure if this stuff expires, and I know that sometimes the product image on Amazon sometimes doesn&#x27;t match the actual product they are selling but these are 6 years old...</li>
            <li> Using makeup remover and washing my face is one too many steps at bedtime. I want a face wash that does both (and if they could make one that also brushes my teeth that would be great). Anyway, I don&#x27;t like this face wash because it doesn&#x27;t foam up well and it doesn&#x27;t fully remove my makeup with one wash.</li>
            <li> During my prolific acne days as a teen, Clearasil did not cut it. But as a mid-20s adult it works fairly well. Previously I&#x27;d been using the off brand walgreens facewashes with dissipointing results,</li>
            <li> Use the product in a very limited quantity and occasionally. I would recommend using something more natural and paraben free.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed too much changes other then I have it near my sink in the kitchen so I can wash my face more often and the price was pretty reasonable and it feels nice on my extra sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin, even in the winter. Clearasil has stopped making this and the new hydrabkast version makes my skin breakout! Please start manufacturing this again!</li>
            <li> Great &amp; works good material tnx!</li>
            <li> I work in a warehouse and workout at the gym alot since I bought this it&#x27;s my #1 go to and I rarely breakout now</li>
            <li> I been a loyal Clearasil user for the past 20yrs and have been recommending it to my friends and family as well. But ever since the company switched to the new formula (Salicylic Adid) my face start breaking out. I am not the only one who felt this way. Is too harsh on us. I really wish these guys can have one of the product that comes with the original formula. My skins are too sensitive to handle these salicylic acid chemical.  For those old Clearasil user fan, the only alternative brand I can find that are similar to the old Clearasil formula are the Wal-mart \\&quot;Equate\\&quot; brand.  They are usually placed next to Clearasil since is their store brand comparing with Clearasil. Switching to Wal-Mart&#x27;s Equate brand is starting to reduce the breakout on my face. Trust me, for me to write a review like this is because I am mad about the breakout that I been getting using this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that does its job well and is very affordable especially compared to higher end fancy health and beauty products.  I recommend this product to my teenage relatives who are going through those awkward teen years.</li>
            <li> I chose this product as I have sensitive skin, and some regular face wash burns my skin. Happy to use this product.</li>
            <li> We can&#x27;t find this sensitive formula in stores anymore and this is the best price we&#x27;ve found. My husband swears by this stuff. It&#x27;s the only face wash he&#x27;ll use.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> I started using this product in the early-90s when I when I was a teenager.  Most of what I used then really dried out my face, but this never did.  Now that I have teenagers of my own, I&#x27;ve passed it on and it works for them, too!</li>
            <li> Keeps my face clean, that&#x27;s all I wanted out of it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently found another product at Walmart (can&#x27;t remember the name) it&#x27;s some kind of natural face cleanser with Sea Salt for about the same price (too lazy to go check).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t decided if I like the natural one or this one better, they both seem to do a very good job. I&#x27;ll probably alternate each for a month and decide.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with both juvenile and adult acne for over 15 years and have tried multiple products including harsh chemical peels and tea extracts. However, after using this product for well over a year, I can say that nothing has more consistently given me clear skin that this product. Using if everyday has been my key for success. It also doesn&#x27;t aggravate my fair skin which is a major bonus. Highly recommended.</li>

It does have a tendency to dry the skin if you use twice a day, but using once a day it works very well for keeping skin clear. I have sensitive skin that has never responded well to using more abrasive face washes, but has the tendency to break out with cleansers lacking salicylic acid...this one is a good middle of the road cleanser. Shipping was prompt once I had enough other things to order for the $25, I just wish this item wasn&#x27;t an &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34; item, and shipped prime like it used to!</li>
            <li> This cleaner isn&#x27;t bad.  Like anything you&#x27;ll find out there, it&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s decent.  Good for me because I have oily skin and this is one of the better washes in making it less greasy.</li>
