            <li> I received it in a timely manner and it was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> No other hair oil beats it</li>
            <li> I use this product daily and it keeps my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I do the bare minimum for my hair.</li>
            <li> Product as described - can&#x27;t live without it if you have long hair.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way with this product so the price is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I have tried the oil just a couple of times so far, so it&#x27;s a little early for conclusions.</li>
            <li> I use to have a hard time keeping my hair straight and soft and this oil does it.</li>
            <li> The product I was shipped was legit - I still had my previous bottle which I purchased from a high end salon and they are identical.</li>
            <li> This bottle will last me a really long time.</li>
            <li> It truly does not weigh down your hair like some other oil products and it makes your hair really shine.</li>
            <li> it does not make your hair flat and oily looking!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the dispenser long enough to know if the pump continues to work in the long run.</li>
            <li> I have long, wavy, &amp; curly hair.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> A friend of mine from the gym noticed my straight long thick hair and recommended this Moccrocan oil.  </li>
            <li> I also use it occasionally on my face and neck along with my other face creams.</li>
            <li> My hair is very long and dry, use this after every shampoo, and when ever it looks dry.  </li>
            <li> Makes hair easier to dry.</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF IS GOLD FOR DRY HAIR.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure how so little can do so much to finish your hairstyle</li>
            <li> I only used half a pump.  </li>
            <li> Product as expected.</li>
            <li> I put it on my hair when its wet</li>
            <li> I previously used a much less expensive band available in chain stores.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I have been using Moroccan oil for about 5 years and have had to use any other hair products since.</li>
            <li> It also goes on without being greasy like some of the other brands.  </li>
            <li> It lasts quite a while too as only a small amount is sufficient</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s very careful with his customers!&lt;br</li>
            <li> May seem a little pricy,  but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I am a woman of color with thick, coarse hair who does not relax my hair.  </li>
            <li> but it is a little thicker than other gloss treatments.</li>
            <li> Not greasy and is not full of perfume.</li>
            <li> This produce does wonders on dry, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Works well with less mess!</li>
            <li> It dispenses the dime-sized portion that is needed, and prevents waste.</li>
            <li> this size lasts me at least 6 months.</li>
            <li> However, the shipping is slow and I had to contacted the seller to speed up the shipping.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this stuff!</li>
            <li> Wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally addicted!</li>
            <li> I wish that it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> but it is expensive for even this size of bottle.  </li>
            <li> A friend introduced me to this product when I was having a bad hair day</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t help but wonder if the silicone in it won&#x27;t be bad for my hair using it long-term.</li>

            <li> Smells great. Smoothes hair</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Delivered fast</li>
            <li> A friend introduced me to this product when I was having a bad hair day and it does work miracles.  I am not sure how so little can do so much to finish your hairstyle but indeed it does.  I have had several people tell me how great my hair looks since I started using the oil, so I guess it really does make a big difference.</li>
            <li> Best oil treatment ever...</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  I have used it for years and my granddaughter uses it as well for her very curly hair.</li>
            <li> I keep 2 bottles of this stuff on back-up. I can not be without it!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with my purchase. I received it in a timely manner and it was exactly what I expected.I will definitely order from you again. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Perfect! Arrived before predicted.</li>
            <li> When I use this product people will tend to ask what the amazing beach smell is around me. I smile, knowing its the oil in my hair. A little bit goes a long way with this product so the price is totally worth it. It lasts me almost 8 months with this bottle. Highly recommend it for someone who wants a little shine, a good smell, and less frizz</li>
            <li> Great product.. helps on dry hair before the flat iron.. love it... I can&#x27;t leave without it...</li>
            <li> I love this product. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love the smell?  My hair shines. Feels soft.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair smell amazing and helps reduce blow drying time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using this for a year and absolutely loved it. I ran out around Christmas and asked for it as a present but received aragon oil instead. Tried that for 2 months and realized  (again) how amazing morrocan oil is for my dry brittle hair. Went back to this a month ago and my long brown hair is shiny and beautiful again!</li>
            <li> I got this to help my frizzies in the humidity.  It smells GREAT.  It does not smell like argan oil and I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t like that smell.  This is a different smell, very pleasant.  However, I&#x27;m a Wen girl and this product although it is nice, it took away some of my bounce.  I only used half a pump.  The pump on this is very good.  It pumps out just a nice, small amount.  If your hair is thick or very course this may be great for you.  I kept it though.  I gave away so many things I&#x27;ve purchased but this one I did keep.</li>
            <li> best product ever, it makes me hair smooth and beatiful without making it oily. i love it</li>
            <li> This is was purchased as a gift.  My mom loves it; she believes this is one of the best hair products for her hair.</li>
            <li> Love this will buy again soon as i need more thanks</li>
            <li> Great oil for the hair. Not greasy and is not full of perfume.</li>
            <li> keeps hair in control and not greasy, a product i use often</li>
            <li> Love it!! Smells amazing</li>
            <li> My hair is very long and dry, use this after every shampoo, and when ever it looks dry.  Works great on the dry ends.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this stuff! I have also tried similar products...nothing compares.  May seem a little pricy,  but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. It was real stuff. I use to have a hard time keeping my hair straight and soft and this oil does it. A little goes a long way! This bottle will last me a really long time. I love the pump that came with it. And u can turn to lock it for traveling. My hair stylist uses it on me and gave me a sample and after that was gone I had to buy more. Can&#x27;t imagine doing my hair without it.</li>
            <li> I love this hair product.</li>
            <li> Very healthy product which make your hair feel great. I have been using this product for more than 5 years</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  I&#x27;m a fan.  Can&#x27;t believe I can put oil on my hair and it makes my hair soft, not oily.  Smells great too.  Great for dry, fly away hair too.</li>
            <li> excellent oil treatment.  Delivery as VERY prompt !</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff. It smells great and helps with my dry hair.</li>
            <li> since my hair dresser used it on my hair after getting it colored, I bought some and have never stopped using it since that was over 5 years ago. people say my hair really looks healthy shiney and young, not brassy and dry and stiff like most post menopausal women&#x27;s hair gets.</li>
            <li> This is a staple hair product!  It leaves hair shiny, soft and manageable.  Light lovely fragrance!</li>
            <li> I have been using Moroccan oil for about 5 years and have had to use any other hair products since. I order on amazon as they have the best prices, the salons charge about 10% more.</li>
            <li> Does work well with curly, frizzy hair. Makes hair easier to dry.</li>
            <li> This Moroccan Oil Hair Treatment leaves my hair soft, shiny, and smooth. I have medium length silver hair,and I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments since I started using the Moroccan Oil. I previously used a much less expensive band available in chain stores. It didn&#x27;t deliver the same results.&lt;br /&gt;An added bonus for me is that it&#x27;s mild floral scent is not overpowering like some hair products.&lt;br /&gt;I tried the smaller bottle first to make sure it was worth the cost. The larger bottle is much more cost-efficient. It dispenses the dime-sized portion that is needed, and prevents waste. I haven&#x27;t had the dispenser long enough to know if the pump continues to work in the long run.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS STUFF! My boyfriend is using it in his beard now too and it smells so good!</li>
            <li> Best product for hair EVER!  Shines, conditions without being oily or weighing fine hair down.  Even use the tiny bit left on my hands on face &amp; neck.  Fabulous product</li>
            <li> Love this product. Arrived on time, packaged well, no leaks in the box.</li>
            <li> awesome product for hair and skin!</li>
            <li> This oil smells really good!</li>
            <li> It was a gift . I love the stuff.  Sent to a friend</li>
            <li> The original Moroccan Oil is pricier than some of the copy cat brands, but it&#x27;s worth it.  A tiny bit is all you need and keeps my hair sleek, shiny and very smooth.  It also goes on without being greasy like some of the other brands.  Love it.</li>

            <li> Product as described - can&#x27;t live without it if you have long hair. The scent is intoxicating...Love it !!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this oil. It makes my hair silky smooth and it smells amazing. It lasts quite a while too as only a small amount is sufficient so it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Great product! Swear by it! The pump is convenient... makes it easy to fill up my travel-size bottle, too. This is a must-have product to keep you hair shiny and silky. Good bye split ends and fly aways!</li>
            <li> Love using morrocan oil in my hair. Nice smell and good size bottle. Wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive but I realize they all cost about this much.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this! I use it in my hair to soften it and it does help. I was hoping it would add a gloss to my hair as well but it is a little thicker than other gloss treatments. I also use it on my hands and it does soften the skin as well.</li>
            <li> Great for recovery after swimming or sun damage.</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF IS GOLD FOR DRY HAIR.  LOVE IT, LOVE IT AND SMELLS SO GOOD !!</li>
            <li> Love the pump.  Keep the shower nice and neat.</li>
            <li> Truly the best treatment for hair.</li>
            <li> Great product with a good price.</li>
            <li> I cannot rave about moroccan oil enough. I&#x27;m totally addicted! I used Enjoy before I found moroccan oil and though I love enjoy products, moroccan oil has won me over! I love the smell and how clean the shampoo and conditioner get my hair. This oil is amazing!!! It makes me hair feel smooth and silky (without weighing it down). I have extensions and this oil works wonders at detangling and smoothing the ends. Love love love it! Also this bottle should last a while and the pump is great! Works well with less mess!</li>

            <li> The best oil so far but it is expensive for even this size of bottle.  A friend of mine from the gym noticed my straight long thick hair and recommended this Moccrocan oil.  It feels like applying liquid of gold o to my hair every day.  The fragrance smells so good and I like how my thick hair more softer than before.  I tried so many different hair products form Bio silk to Chi treatment that made my hair even dryer.  This one earned a keep!  Thanks to my friend!  However, the shipping is slow and I had to contacted the seller to speed up the shipping.</li>
            <li> I have used it twice and so far so good. I love the smell and makes my hair feel so soft.</li>

            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this stuff. It&#x27;s not too heavy and not too light. I put it on my hair when its wet and it dries with a beautiful shine and doesn&#x27;t change the texture ( if you have waves you will still have waves after applying this product). It truly does not weigh down your hair like some other oil products and it makes your hair really shine. I also absolutely love the smell.</li>
            <li> I love this product and this was the best deal I found.  The product I was shipped was legit - I still had my previous bottle which I purchased from a high end salon and they are identical.</li>
