            <li>&amp;#34;Warning!&amp;#34;  Be sure you are ordering the correct perfume.  </li>
            <li>Received it as a gift a couple of years ago and it has since become my favorite.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS FRAGRANCE....</li>
            <li>One of my favorite fragrances.</li>
            <li>Love how clean and sexy this smells!</li>
            <li>excellent fragrance, amazing delivery, great price for an amazing scent, long lasting, packaging was secure!</li>
            <li>Its sweet &amp; just a nice smell....</li>
            <li>My Insolence is a completely different fragrance and it does not smell very good at all.</li>
            <li>It does grab everyone&#x27;s attention because it is unique, clean smelling, and absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>This is a very  light, fresh smelling fragrance I love this spray...</li>
            <li>I was excited to be able to find it on Amazon......</li>
            <li>Overall, a great product and a much better price than in the department stores.</li>
            <li>This is such a beautiful scent.  </li>
            <li>It is a hidden gem that would sell off the shelves if more ladies knew of this great scent.</li>
            <li>It was okay the first couple of days, but I noticed that the smell started to change with the passing days..</li>
            <li>A hint of orange blossom and rose impart a striking intensity, while sensual iris and tonka bean resins finish the scent, making Insolence the ultimate luxury</li>
            <li>Nice soft smell.</li>
            <li>any of my female friends who smelled it also loved it.</li>
            <li>If Insolence sounds like something you would like I would strongly recommend getting a sample first.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume, and I haven&#x27;t been able to find it locally.</li>
            <li>I love this soft, clean, floral scent.</li>
            <li>This is an old classic scent that I&#x27;ve loved for years.</li>
            <li>It was time for me to move on from one of my favorite fragrances and find something new.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sensual and sexy and very classy.</li>
            <li>The deliver was on time and even if it weren&#x27;t they wait would have been worth it.</li>
            <li>The first whiff from the bottle smelled kind of nice, but immediately upon dry down, this smelled strongly like cheap floor cleaner.  </li>
            <li>would never order a fragrance without testing it first because they can smell very different on each person when they react with your own body.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why, but it seems like the kind of scent that would be favored by overweight older women who like polyester pant suits (sorry,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s beautiful, delicate and sexy at the same time.</li>
            <li>My wife has received several perfume gifts from family members in the retail business on many occasions.  </li>
            <li>I received a sample of this several months ago and fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>and I really hope they don&#x27;t quit making it!</li>
            <li>I love how it smells on my jacket or clothes the next day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Apparently I made the mistake of purchasing this perfume when I actually meant to purchase &amp;#34;My Insolence&amp;#34; which is probably my favorite that my wife has ever worn...</li>
            <li>the bottle is truly pretty...</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on it, especially from guys!</li>
            <li>if you like a nice SOFT lasting fragrance</li>
            <li>I looked all over at different retailers for this particular fragrance, not to mention, it&#x27;s my wife&#x27;s favorite.</li>
            <li>Every time I wear it everyone wants to know what is that scent.</li>
            <li>but they should really change that</li>
            <li>I really hope they don&#x27;t decide to discontinue it.</li>
            <li>Absolutely intoxicating.</li>
            <li>I really like this perfume, because the smell is special.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other than that phenomenal .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s feminine but not too girly sweet and romantic without being overpoweringly amber-y or musky.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I, like several others found that the fragrance has changed tremendously.</li>
            <li>This product came in pink colored spray, my other one was Amber color, smells good.  </li>
            <li>The scent lasts very long and smells even better when you smell it later on.</li>
            <li>Not only am I satisfied with the perfume, because I bought it again in the past, but also with the package and with the delivery date that was the right one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Insolence reminds me of something &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; people wear which is exactly what my wife said when we both pretty much came to the realization that we both disliked the aroma...</li>
            <li>Complete strangers always complement me on the aroma.</li>
            <li>This is the only perfume that he really notices.</li>
            <li>It lasts all day and the smell is not heavy, but lingers throughout the day and evening.</li>
            <li>It was the first time in a long time that I had worn a new fragrance and actually received unsolicited comments by way of compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very disappointing though that I will no longer be able to purchase my favorite scent in stores.</li>
            <li>you previously liked it, you may have done the same thing I did and confused the perfume with &amp;#34;My Insolence&amp;#34; vs &amp;#34;Insolence&amp;#34;,</li>
            <li>Amazon was the only way I surprised my wife on her birthday in 2014.</li>
            <li>Every time i wear it there is not a single person who doesn&#x27;t notices it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;GUERLAIN describes Insolence as \\&quot;Exuberant notes of violet are accompanied by jubilant red berries like raspberry.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s feminine but not too girly sweet and romantic without being overpoweringly amber-y or musky.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I, like several others found that the fragrance has changed tremendously.</li>
            <li> This product came in pink colored spray, my other one was Amber color, smells good.  </li>
            <li> The scent lasts very long and smells even better when you smell it later on.</li>
            <li> Not only am I satisfied with the perfume, because I bought it again in the past, but also with the package and with the delivery date that was the right one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Insolence reminds me of something &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; people wear which is exactly what my wife said when we both pretty much came to the realization that we both disliked the aroma...</li>
            <li> Complete strangers always complement me on the aroma.</li>
            <li> This is the only perfume that he really notices.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day and the smell is not heavy, but lingers throughout the day and evening.</li>
            <li> It was the first time in a long time that I had worn a new fragrance and actually received unsolicited comments by way of compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very disappointing though that I will no longer be able to purchase my favorite scent in stores.</li>
            <li> you previously liked it, you may have done the same thing I did and confused the perfume with &amp;#34;My Insolence&amp;#34; vs &amp;#34;Insolence&amp;#34;,</li>
            <li> Amazon was the only way I surprised my wife on her birthday in 2014.</li>
            <li> Every time i wear it there is not a single person who doesn&#x27;t notices it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;GUERLAIN describes Insolence as \\&quot;Exuberant notes of violet are accompanied by jubilant red berries like raspberry.</li>
            <li> Insolence was once a very lingering and inviting fragrance; which is no more, does not last at all!</li>
            <li> When I put this particular bottle of cologne on, it doesn&#x27;t last past an hour.  </li>
            <li> I got it earlier than expected and gave it to my mother as a gift for her birthday.</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;ve never smelled anything even similar like lots of other fragrances.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this perfume is old or not.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s just the mental image</li>
            <li> Wife loves this fragrance and it is harder to find at the brick and mortar stores.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing this perfume for a long time, this bottle does not hold the scent as previous ones did.</li>
            <li> I wouldnt advice any other perfume in the world but this.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> This is not a very appealing fragrance...</li>
            <li> I found it about 4 years ago and have been wearing it everyday since.</li>
            <li> Bought the small purse size sample of this, based on the rave reviews.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> I think they stopped making it or at least the department store where&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am totally disappointed with my purchase and do not recommend anyone to spend this type of money on cologne that is possibly old.</li>
            <li> &quot; has a subtle fragrance which I feel can be used day or night.  </li>
            <li> Overly designed, pretentious, difficult to handle and terribly heavy glass container.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;Its ridiculous.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s comment upon walking into the room after I&#x27;d first put it on was to make a disgusted face and ask \\&quot;what&#x27;s that smell?!\\&quot;.    </li>
            <li> and I never get tired of it.</li>
            <li> I wore it to church and within an hour it grew faint and within three hours it  had evaporated.</li>
            <li> , so others dont get the wrong impression.  </li>
            <li> Weird shaped bottle, though.</li>
            <li> It smells expensive and is truly affordable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was difficult to find this perfume in stores, that&#x27;s why I have to order on line.</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, they go crazy.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed with the perfume dispenser...</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed...</li>
            <li> Very, very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> So it is impossible to use it!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Everything came as explained. The perfume came in perfect condition. I wish this perfume wasnt discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume &amp; get sooooo many compliments wherever and whenever I wear it!!!  I am disappointed with the perfume dispenser...It quit working after a week. I will give this seller another try, because of the price, but buyer beware....</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Insolence\\&quot; has a subtle fragrance which I feel can be used day or night.  My wife has received several perfume gifts from family members in the retail business on many occasions.  So far, the bottle designs are great and the fragrances are not so great.  When I bought her \\&quot;Isolence\\&quot; she took to this perfume immediately (Keeps me out of the doghouse for awhile!). I recommend \\&quot;Insolence\\&quot; as an addition to any woman&#x27;s fragrance collection.</li>
            <li> I am about to buy the 2nd one already. The Best sweet smell I can have in my skin. I just love it!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome</li>
            <li> Perfect seller and transaction.. Absolutely love this perfume.. Awesome price !</li>
            <li> This is one of two of my signature scents and everyone always tells me I smell so good and ask what I&#x27;m wearing.  Hard to find in stores and I&#x27;m so glad I can get this on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Lovey scent. Overly designed, pretentious, difficult to handle and terribly heavy glass container. Wish we could buy the essence in generic glass vial. Sigh. It is a lovely scent.</li>
            <li> did not receive what I ordered.....see 3.4 oz i got the gift set and the 3.4 oz went up in price too</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance.  Complete strangers always complement me on the aroma.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it. Nice soft smell. Very sexy.</li>
            <li> I have used this fragrance for years.  I think they stopped making it or at least the department store where&lt;br /&gt;I always purchased it no longer carries it.  I was happy to find it thru Amazon.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my Mom for Valentine&#x27;s she loves they way this smell whenever she wears it she always get nice remarks.</li>
            <li> As I received my perfume, its atomizer doesn&#x27;t work. It splashes the perfume around the bottle waisting it. So it is impossible to use it!!! I am very disappointed...</li>
            <li> It was time for me to move on from one of my favorite fragrances and find something new. I received a sample of this several months ago and fell in love with it.  It was the first time in a long time that I had worn a new fragrance and actually received unsolicited comments by way of compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GUERLAIN describes Insolence as \\&quot;Exuberant notes of violet are accompanied by jubilant red berries like raspberry. A hint of orange blossom and rose impart a striking intensity, while sensual iris and tonka bean resins finish the scent, making Insolence the ultimate luxury fragrance.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always preferred fruit over floral, but quite often the scents end up being too sweet to be sensual or good for evening wear. The thing that I enjoy about this fragrance is that I find it the perfect one to wear both at work and for an evening out. Although the scents of berries and vanilla are there, they are mellowed out with the scents of orange blossom and rose without overpowering them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would never order a fragrance without testing it first because they can smell very different on each person when they react with your own body. If Insolence sounds like something you would like I would strongly recommend getting a sample first.</li>
            <li> my daughter grabbed this one - she loves it</li>
            <li> Amazon has been a blessing. I looked all over at different retailers for this particular fragrance, not to mention, it&#x27;s my wife&#x27;s favorite. Amazon was the only way I surprised my wife on her birthday in 2014. &amp;#34;Thank you for making me a hero for a day&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My very favorite perfume!!  I get so many compliments when I wear this perfume. I wish it were available in more stores, but buying it on Amazon is wonderful.</li>
            <li> This is such a beautiful scent.  Whenever I wear this, I feel confident, sexy, and sensual.  It does grab everyone&#x27;s attention because it is unique, clean smelling, and absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> I wanna express my opinion toward the product. all things were done perfectly. the product was that which I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume, I get so many compliments from everyone. I am asked from strangers, WHAT IS THE NAME OF THAT PERFUME YOU ARE WEARING? Can not find it in store any more. Which angers me.</li>
            <li> I, like several others found that the fragrance has changed tremendously. Insolence was once a very lingering and inviting fragrance; which is no more, does not last at all! I wore it to church and within an hour it grew faint and within three hours it  had evaporated. I even noticed that the color has changed from gold to lilac. BIG MISTAKE!!! Guerlain please rectify this situation and re establish the relationship with your once faithful consumers.</li>
            <li> This product came in pink colored spray, my other one was Amber color, smells good.  Happy to find it on amazon.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this perfurme for 7 years now and I aboslutely love it. I sometimes struggle to find it at Ulta and then realized &amp;#34;Hello! Amazon!&amp;#34; so now I didn&#x27;t have to hunt. It was at conveniently at my door! Yay! Enjoy!!</li>
            <li> This is an old classic scent that I&#x27;ve loved for years. It&#x27;s sensual and sexy and very classy. Every time I wear it everyone wants to know what is that scent.</li>
            <li> FAVORITE fragrance. you would LOVE it .. if you like a nice SOFT lasting fragrance</li>
            <li> this perfum is my favourite. I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> love love love love love love love it!!!All time favorite perfumes! excellent fragrance, amazing delivery, great price for an amazing scent, long lasting, packaging was secure! The only thing i have a problem with is that the product description says 3.4 onces but yet the box and actual product only has 3.3. I dont wanna be nit picky about it but they should really change that, so others dont get the wrong impression.  Other than that phenomenal .</li>
            <li> Love how clean and sexy this smells!</li>
            <li> Bought the small purse size sample of this, based on the rave reviews.  The first whiff from the bottle smelled kind of nice, but immediately upon dry down, this smelled strongly like cheap floor cleaner.  I don&#x27;t know why, but it seems like the kind of scent that would be favored by overweight older women who like polyester pant suits (sorry, that&#x27;s just the mental image I get when smelling this).  My husband&#x27;s comment upon walking into the room after I&#x27;d first put it on was to make a disgusted face and ask \\&quot;what&#x27;s that smell?!\\&quot;.    The odor immediately gave me a headache.  I tried washing it off of my wrists, to no avail.  I&#x27;ve showered, and I can *still* smell it on me. It&#x27;s like the perfume from hell.  Can&#x27;t seem to get the smell out of the house either, despite having the windows open for a couple of hours.  All this from two tiny drops on my wrists...    bleh!</li>
            <li> My mom bought me Insolence a couple of times and I am in love with the scent! It&#x27;s beautiful, delicate and sexy at the same time. The scent lasts very long and smells even better when you smell it later on. Amazing!</li>
            <li> I got it earlier than expected and gave it to my mother as a gift for her birthday. To be honest it was the perfect present! She put it on in the morning and I could still smell it at night. It was absolutely splendid</li>
            <li> Wife loves this fragrance and it is harder to find at the brick and mortar stores. Also was a good value.</li>
            <li> It was okay the first couple of days, but I noticed that the smell started to change with the passing days..</li>
            <li> Not only am I satisfied with the perfume, because I bought it again in the past, but also with the package and with the delivery date that was the right one.</li>
            <li> Most beautiful light smell.  People always comment.  Love it.  I am a Beautiful and Spellbound wearer.  Weird shaped bottle, though.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, and I haven&#x27;t been able to find it locally. I used to buy it at Macy&#x27;s and they quit carrying it. Every time I wear it my husband comments on how good I smell. This is the only perfume that he really notices. I&#x27;m so glad I found this on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Been a favorite for years... Always get great comments!!!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume best scent ever</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this perfume is old or not.  The scent doesn&#x27;t last at all.  I&#x27;ve been wearing this cologne for years and was purchasing it from Dillards Department Store until they discontinued it in my city.  The scent would last all day.  I constently got compliments on the fragrance that I was wearing.  When I put this particular bottle of cologne on, it doesn&#x27;t last past an hour.  I am totally disappointed with my purchase and do not recommend anyone to spend this type of money on cologne that is possibly old.</li>
            <li> This is my very favorite scent. Have to get it now because they are not making it any more. Wonderful scent.</li>
            <li> Insolence is my signature scent and has been for about 7 years and I never get tired of it. It is one of the only fragrances that I wear. I get so many compliments on the scent. Do not confuse Insolence with My Insolence. My Insolence is a completely different fragrance and it does not smell very good at all. My Insolence came out after Insolence and initially used Hilary Swank as the spokesperson for the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to be able to find this fragrance in my area at Nordstrom, Macys, Dillards, Ulta and Sephora. It is now not being carried at any store in my area. My birthday just recently passed and my boyfriend had to order a bottle here on Amazon (thank goodness he was able to find it here). It is very disappointing though that I will no longer be able to purchase my favorite scent in stores. I really hope they don&#x27;t decide to discontinue it. That would be a great mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whenever I mention this perfume no one has ever heard of it. Maybe it would be in the best interest of Guerlain to market the fragrance. It is a hidden gem that would sell off the shelves if more ladies knew of this great scent.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing this perfume for a long time, this bottle does not hold the scent as previous ones did.</li>
            <li> I love this soft, clean, floral scent. I receive compliments from both men and women when wearing it. It is a &amp;#34;feel good&amp;#34; scent. It smells expensive and is truly affordable. I prefer the perfume to the toilette (wear less/lasts longer).&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to women of all ages, it&#x27;s both youthful and sophisticated.</li>
            <li> This is probably my 6th bottle of Insolence. I just love it...and I really hope they don&#x27;t quit making it! I get sooo many compliments from this perfume from both men and women. To me it smells like Mr. Bubble &amp; violets candy. Its sweet &amp; just a nice smell....&amp; I&#x27;ve never smelled anything even similar like lots of other fragrances. You do not need more than just one spray, 2 at the most...seriously. Its staying power is amazing...I love how it smells on my jacket or clothes the next day. If u want to leave ur scent on ur mans pillow so he can smell u when u leave...get this! :)  SUPER GOOD!</li>
            <li> This perfume is my favorite! Although I use others off and on inbetween using this one... I ALWAYS go back to this perfume! I feel beautiful wearing it and the smell lasts ages!</li>
            <li> I constantly receive compliments on this fragrance. It lasts all day and the smell is not heavy, but lingers throughout the day and evening.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Warning!&amp;#34;  Be sure you are ordering the correct perfume.  I ordered this perfume and wanted &amp;#34;My Insolence&amp;#34; by Guerlain.  This did not smell like the perfume I have. You can not return this perfume!  Very, very disappointed.  Now I&#x27;m stuck with this and it sticks, literally!</li>
            <li> This is not a very appealing fragrance...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently I made the mistake of purchasing this perfume when I actually meant to purchase &amp;#34;My Insolence&amp;#34; which is probably my favorite that my wife has ever worn...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Insolence reminds me of something &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; people wear which is exactly what my wife said when we both pretty much came to the realization that we both disliked the aroma...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you previously liked it, you may have done the same thing I did and confused the perfume with &amp;#34;My Insolence&amp;#34; vs &amp;#34;Insolence&amp;#34;, for which both appear to be by Guerlain</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing perfume I have ever try. Absolutely intoxicating. Every time i wear it there is not a single person who doesn&#x27;t notices it. The deliver was on time and even if it weren&#x27;t they wait would have been worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this scent! Received it as a gift a couple of years ago and it has since become my favorite. I was excited to be able to find it on Amazon......easy shopping/shipping, great price!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It was a great price and shipped quickly</li>
            <li> This is a very  light, fresh smelling fragrance I love this spray...the bottle is truly pretty...I keep it where it is visible!!</li>
            <li> I really like this perfume, because the smell is special.&lt;br /&gt;It remembers me candies&lt;br /&gt;It was difficult to find this perfume in stores, that&#x27;s why I have to order on line.</li>
            <li> This is the one and only perfume that EVERY man, no exceptions, gives me compliments about it. As a matter of fact, they go crazy. I wouldnt advice any other perfume in the world but this.&lt;br /&gt;Also any of my female friends who smelled it also loved it. There was no one who DID NOT like it.&lt;br /&gt;Its ridiculous. They say it has pheromones in it...I dont know..whatever it is...it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS FRAGRANCE....I HOPE THEY NEVER STOP MAKING IT.</li>
            <li> This is a great scent.............everyone asks me what I have on, even people smell it the next day at the gym in the morning, so its lasts!</li>
            <li> I tried this scent in a store at teh airport in Aruba and loved it. I wish I had bought it there.  This does not smell the same as I remember. Smells nice but not as good as the one I should have bought.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite fragrances. Very light.</li>
            <li> This scent is so beautiful- I found it about 4 years ago and have been wearing it everyday since. I get so many compliments on it, especially from guys! It&#x27;s feminine but not too girly sweet and romantic without being overpoweringly amber-y or musky.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried the EDP yet, only because I am so used to one spray of the EDT to last the day. I feel like I need to re-apply before a night out, though. Overall, a great product and a much better price than in the department stores.</li>
