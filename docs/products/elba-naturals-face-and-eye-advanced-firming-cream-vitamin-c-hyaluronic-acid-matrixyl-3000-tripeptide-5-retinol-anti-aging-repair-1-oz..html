            <li>, you don&#x27;t even know what old looks like&amp;#34; and dismiss my worry since I&#x27;m not 50</li>
            <li>Used this eye cream for 2 weeks and like the feeling on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It mimmicks the body&#x27;s natural communication to help cells flush out the toxins or render them inert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I have extremely sensitive skin and have been using this product for over a week</li>
            <li>However, I have extremely sensitive skin and have been using this product for over a week</li>
            <li>When I tested this product on my hands, it left them smooth and hydrated all day long, even through several hand washings.  </li>
            <li>It also includes dozens of other mostly botanical extracts and oils along with vitamins and other ingredients that are helpful for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that Elba uses natural ingredients from herbs, nuts, flowers, and fruits to create a less chemical-based formula than some other brands.  </li>
            <li>This eye cream is slightly viscous and white like a lotion, but it absorbs into the skin quickly like a serum, leaving it feeling silky.  </li>
            <li>Some people with sensitive skin have reported such reactions as reddening of the skin, stinging at the site of application and rash.  </li>
            <li>Please note, if you experience any of these reactions, discontinue use and consult a medical professional.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and need products such as this.  </li>
            <li>I love the way this absorbs into my skin and doesn’t leave a greasy feeling behind.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m approaching the big 3-0 in the next year and my eyes are really starting to look old!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using serums and creams with those ingredients for several years and can really see the difference in my middle aged</li>
            <li>I have only been using this product for only a week, therefore; this is not enough time to see the MORE DRAMATIC results, but I can&#x27;t wait to see what the results will be after 4-6 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I just love the smell of this product!  The best part is that it doesn&#x27;t have any sort of harsh, irritating fragrance. It has a rich lotion-like consistency and is white in color. It absorbs quickly and made my skin feel very smooth. Plus, it helped reduce the appearance of fine lines. Since it&#x27;s super moisturizing, I would recommend applying it at night. I purchased this product with a 100% off coupon in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I whine a lot about aging. I’m getting awfully close to 57. YIKES! Someone put my life I fast forward because I sure don&#x27;t FEEL 56 let alone 57!!  I’m always excited when I am offered a chance to try a new product.&lt;br /&gt;There are no harsh chemicals or fragrances in this eye cream. There is a soft natural scent. This cream comes in a light-protecting silver bottle so all of the ingredients stay potent to the last drop. The bottle uses an airless pump. About a week after I started using this eye cream the bottle seemed to have an bubble or something that make it squirt out, I lightly tapped the bottle to the palm of my hand, this seemed to fix the problem.&lt;br /&gt;A very small amount goes a long way. So use a light hand, you really will feel the tightening as the cream is absorbed. Once the cream is absorbed you won’t be able to see it, it’s completely invisible and leaves no residue.&lt;br /&gt;AWESOME eye cream!! I love the way this absorbs into my skin and doesn’t leave a greasy feeling behind. Before I took my ‘after’ photo I didn’t I’m thoroughly impressed with the difference in the fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I have received complimentary/free products for the purpose of this review. The opinions are 100% mine. I have not been influenced in any way.</li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few firming eye creams. Elba Naturals makes a great product. My eyes are starting to get very tired looking in the past two weeks and I have loose skin under my eyes. I have been using it now for two weeks. I have to say as soon as I put it on I feel it working and tightening my skin. Love that feeling !!&lt;br /&gt; Smoothes the eye contour&lt;br /&gt;- Lifts and firms the skin around the eyes&lt;br /&gt;- Deflates bags, smoothes wrinkles and fades dark circles&lt;br /&gt;- Eye contour looks younger and more radiant&lt;br /&gt;- Non-Comedogenic&lt;br /&gt;- Non-Acnegenic&lt;br /&gt;It is doing exactly as the company says. I am confident to know while using this product it will help my eyes look much better. Just a little dab goes a long way and this bottle will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Guarantee:&lt;br /&gt;You have 180 days to be 100% happy, or we&#x27;ll refund your money... no questions asked.&lt;br /&gt;They also offer a super guarantee if you do not see an improvement. Elba Naturals stands by their products. I received this product complimentary in exchange for my unbiased opinion and review.</li>
            <li> it is really good. I got it with a high discount code. After using it only one day, I can see my eye dark circle diminished a little bit.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:1697c8117bcbcd563cf3cb3b45b52ac5]] I received a discounted product for review purposes, however all opinions are my own</li>
            <li> Love it! I saw a difference right away!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m approaching the big 3-0 in the next year and my eyes are really starting to look old! I know people think &amp;#34;oh honey, you don&#x27;t even know what old looks like&amp;#34; and dismiss my worry since I&#x27;m not 50+.  Dark circles are inherited in my family and only get worse with age so while I may still be relatively young, trust me when I say my eyes look old! Ive tried combating them with other serums and moisturizers but nothing has worked as amazing as this. I started to use this in the morning and in the evening. Within a couple of days my dark circles were clearing up. Although they didn&#x27;t completely disappear, they were looking so much better! The skin was tighter looking and plump. After a month of using this, I am amazed at the results. I will so be buying more of this as it has done more than I could ever imagine and its so inexpensive! I did get this at a full discount for my unbias opinion in return but I won&#x27;t hesitate to buy more!</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer not only for the eyes, but for the face as well.  I love how it makes my skin feel...soft and supple.  A little dab goes a very long way.  I love that it has Vitamin C in it, as this is know to help fight signs of aging as well as diminish the look of fine lines.  I have only been using this product for only a week, therefore; this is not enough time to see the MORE DRAMATIC results, but I can&#x27;t wait to see what the results will be after 4-6 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say, however, that this product DID NOT do anything for my puffy eyes.  I can&#x27;t say this will be the case for everyone, I&#x27;m just saying it didn&#x27;t work on my puffy eyes.  Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, so please take this into consideration when purchasing.  IT MAY JUST WORK FOR YOU!  With that being said...I received this product, free, in exchange for an honest review. All thoughts and opinions are 100% my own and have not been influenced by the company or anyone else.</li>
            <li> I have been pleased with product.  It absorbs well and leaves my skin feeling moisturized. It has a nice, smooth texture.</li>
            <li> saw immediate changes in my skin texture!  Definite must by!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m picky about what I eat and put on my skin, and try to use organic products whenever I can.  I was pleased to be asked to test this eye cream when I saw that it&#x27;s not only USA-made, organic and natural but that it also has my favorite anti-aging ingredients: hyaluronic acid (holds in moisture, improves elasticity of skin) and Vitamin C (reverses sun damage and regenerates skin cells).  I&#x27;ve been using serums and creams with those ingredients for several years and can really see the difference in my middle aged skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream also contains Matrixyl 3000 (an antioxidant), Tripeptide-5 (stimulates collagen regeneration), retinol (Vitamin A, boosts collagen, speeds up cellular regeneration) and Glycolic Acid (fades sun spots, exfoliates dead skin cells).  All great things for faces of any age!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it (twice a day) around my eyes and mouth for three weeks and I really like it.  It&#x27;s fragrance free and leaves my skin deeply moisturized and plumped.  I believe it&#x27;s also lived up to the &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; part of its name because the bags under my eyes seem slightly diminished.  Of course I still look middle aged - no cream or potion will be able to make me look 20 again.  But when my skin looks dewy and the wrinkles and bags are diminished I declare victory.  Knowing I&#x27;m getting these benefits with organic ingredients and not unpronounceable chemicals makes me that much happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary sample of Elba Advanced Eye Firming Cream for testing and review purposes. I wasn&#x27;t asked to leave a positive review, nor was I paid or otherwise compensated for reviewing this item. Look at the hundreds of reviews I&#x27;ve written over ten years and you&#x27;ll see that I work hard to give an honest opinion of the products I review.</li>
            <li> Great item. I use this in my daily routine, morning and night. Love the way it feels on my skin</li>
            <li> I’ve reached the age where the skin on my face still looks young and firm but the skin around my eyes is giving away my secret.  I’ve recently learned that if I use hyaluronic acid and creams with vitamin C the skin firms up and any odd coloring seems to fade a little.  This Elba n.1 has both of those ingredients as well as aloe, Matrixyl 3000, Tripeptide-5, retinol and Glycolic Acid.  These are all ingredients that can be found in the (gasp and clutch heart) VERY expensive eye products that you find in the high-end department stores and specialty shops.  I’ve actually paid twice as much for a similar product that is not any better than this Elba n.1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle has a built in pump that dispensed the correct dab for each application.  The lotion absorbed quickly and has a pleasant though benign scent.  What most impressed me about this particular brand is: A. it’s organic.  B.  It’s made in the USA.  C. It works.  And of course: the price.</li>
            <li> Used this eye cream for 2 weeks and like the feeling on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It works very well! Great product!</li>
            <li> Love this product .  The dark circles under my eyes are actually disappearing.  I advise using a little eye moisturizer on the outer part of the eyes with the product.  It is a nightly ritual for me  and I stuck with it for about 4 weeks before seeing results.  My eyes look brighter and more youthful.  Hurray !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered another.  Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> This product comes in a thick, white creamy formula that has a fresh scent.  It glides over my skin effortlessly and absorbs quickly.  When I tested this product on my hands, it left them smooth and hydrated all day long, even through several hand washings.  I was reviewing the active ingredients and came across one I was not familiar with and that&#x27;s the Tripeptide-5 and this is what I found while researching it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Palmitoyl Tripeptide-5 is a man-made synthetic chemical that&#x27;s patented and designed to actively communicate with healthy skin cells in order to keep them acting in a healthy manner.  Studies have shown that it may keep skin healthier and younger-looking by improving collagen production and altering how skin cells function.  It is made from chains of amino acids and has the ability to penetrate the epidermis and enter the dermis layer of your skin.  It not only speeds up collagen synthesis, it can also prevent toxins from penetrating and doing harm.  It mimmicks the body&#x27;s natural communication to help cells flush out the toxins or render them inert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Young firm looking skin is not possible without collagen and the older your skin is, the less collagen it produces.  Because Palmitoyl Tripeptide-5 works from the inside out, you may experience better results faster.  It is believed that placing your skin on a regular cycle of artificial stimulation allows your body to function more efficiently.  It helps each cell maintain its health by telling it how to perform properly.  This form of communication is vital because when cells fail to communicate properly collagen production slows drastically, which in turn causes premature aging and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Studies involving Palymitoyl Tripeptide-5 are still in their early stages, so there are few reports of any serious side effects.  Some people with sensitive skin have reported such reactions as reddening of the skin, stinging at the site of application and rash.  Please note, if you experience any of these reactions, discontinue use and consult a medical professional.  However, I have extremely sensitive skin and have been using this product for over a week and I have experienced absolutely no adverse reaction.  Therefore I recommend it for all skin types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received this product at a reduced rate in exchange for my honest review**erience any of these reactions, discontinue use and consult a medical professional.

            <li> I received this product at a discounted for unbiased an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great eye firming cream. I have been using  the eye cream for a month. And I can really see results. This cream has softened my under eyes lines and bags.  It absorbs quickly into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream!  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks now, and the skin around my eyes looks and feels wonderful.  It tightens without feeling taut.  It contains ingredients familiar to those of us who have used creams -- hyaluronic acid, vitamin C, and aloe -- as well as two I&#x27;m not familiar with -- Matrixyl 3000 and Tripeptite-5.  I love that Elba uses natural ingredients from herbs, nuts, flowers, and fruits to create a less chemical-based formula than some other brands.  It contains skin tightening, skin moisturizing, and anti-oxidant ingredients, all for a gentle cream.  I&#x27;m always worried when I try a new product around my eyes since my skin there is so sensitve and prone to allergic reactions.  I had absolutely no adverse side effects from using this eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle dispense the cream via a pump, and it measures the correct amount to pat around the eye area, although you can use it elsewhere on your face.  The cream absorbs quickly, leaving no visible residue.  This Elba Naturals eye firming cream has quickly become my favorite.  Note:  I received a sample for review.</li>
            <li> Product seems fine.  Needs new container.  Cannot control dispensing.  Clogs in one day, so spews out when pumping and the clogs bursts.</li>
            <li> Nice product, creamy and moisturizing. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I got this free to try and it actually works.</li>
            <li> Really love the feel, ad it does&#x27;t get in the eyes like some eye creams. I am now on the second bottle :)</li>
            <li> This is a terrific product with wonderful ingredients.  I have sensitive skin and need products such as this.  Just a small amount makes my skin feel wonderful.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is slightly viscous and white like a lotion, but it absorbs into the skin quickly like a serum, leaving it feeling silky.  It has a pleasant vegetal fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream does an excellent job soothing and moisturizing the sensitive skin around the eyes and protecting it from loss of moisture. Regular use will reduce the appearance of fine wrinkles and improve the texture of the skin.  I am also using it on some other areas with irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container holds 30 ml (1 oz.).  The pump cap is easy to use and dispenses a large drop, which goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The peptides included in the formula are being studied to determine if they can stimulate skin regeneration when applied topically.  It also includes dozens of other mostly botanical extracts and oils along with vitamins and other ingredients that are helpful for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elba Naturals provided eye cream for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> Very nice product.  Works well.  Light, smooth, disappears quickly into the skin.  Nice moisturizer. Puffiness deduced</li>
            <li> These days of pollen, changing seasons, and itchy eyes have fared well for me during the past couple weeks while I&#x27;ve been using en: Elba Naturals Advanced firming Eye Cream even though I have certainly experienced a bountiful reaction to pollen and other allergens. I have been pleasantly surprised! My eyes look nice and feel good. I don&#x27;t know what the magic ingredient is that has provided these fine results, but whatever it is, I&#x27;m all for it. This is a nice product and one that I can recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It certainly helps to know that natural and organic ingredients are used to create en: Elba Naturals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a complimentary product to facilitate this review. Opinions are solely mine and I used the product.</li>
