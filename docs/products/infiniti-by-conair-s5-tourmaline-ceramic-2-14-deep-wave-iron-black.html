            <li>Most of the reviews seemed like this was a good product.</li>

            <li>A plus is the iron heats up nicely</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited to see all that great reviews on this</li>
            <li>So glad I purchased it, it gives just the look I was looking for! :-)</li>
            <li>This is by far the best crimping iron I&#x27;ve ever used or had.</li>
            <li>I decided to keep the waver for her. :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on my hair after using this waver.</li>
            <li>Once I receieved the iron I was able to wave my hair in about 15 minutes</li>
            <li>I am beyond pleased with this product and have recommended it to alot my family and friends already.</li>
            <li>I could not believe how light  it was!</li>
            <li>I love that I can get a \\&quot;curly\\&quot; effect (though it is more crimpy, wavy</li>
            <li>The heating elements are covered so my fingers are more protected.  </li>
            <li>This item makes my hair look fabulous!</li>
            <li>All of her friends want one :-)</li>
            <li>You will definately be satisfied with the performance of this waver.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my hair since i bought it.  </li>
            <li>its so much better then</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take long to heat up and it creates perfect waves.  </li>
            <li>since the lower ones do just great for our type of hair which is fine and straight.  </li>
            <li>Everyone says how nice, cute, fun, and</li>
            <li>It is lightweight and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It puts deep, beautiful waves in your hair.    </li>
            <li>My hair did fine with the lowest setting.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy and safe to use and the results you get from using it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>The Infiniti S5 Tourmaline Deep Wave Iron is a great product.</li>
            <li>this waver gives me amazing waves, &amp; it heats up really fast</li>
            <li>This deep wave iron has been a great investment.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I finally chose this one.</li>
            <li>The multiple heat settings provide a great option to determine the amount of desired wave.</li>
            <li>I love the look of beachy waves, but the Hot &amp; Silky waver I got from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply</li>
            <li>It is best to keep your waves in place by sleeping in a high ponytail a night and the best part is you can do your hair whole head of hair less than 15 mins because it only takes a couple of seconds to make a wave.</li>
            <li>I did not use any special products or sprays on my hair.</li>
            <li>She wanted the vidal sassoon wave iron, but this one had such good reviews, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li>It heats up to full heat in under a minute.    </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this iron if you&#x27;re looking for curls that are more unique and unified looking.</li>
            <li>So far, I have tried four different kind of wavers and of the four (Bed Head, Revlon, Hot Tools, and the Infinit Conair), this one is by far the best one!!</li>
            <li>She used it the first night and with her baby fine hair it took the curl and did not straighten out.  </li>
            <li>Also it heats up really really quick -</li>
            <li>I normally wear my hair straight and this created a great new look.  </li>
            <li>Most of the time I use a straightner to give a sleek managed appearance, but wanted to try something new.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I would suggest using a spray starch on your hair before waving each strand if your hair is fine and/or super straight.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li>Secondly, I used the default temperature setting and that did an amazing job on my hair.</li>
            <li>This was item is worth every cent I paid for it.  </li>
            <li>First off the iron heated up VERY quickly, it was ready for use in under a minute.</li>
            <li>SUPER hot.    </li>
            <li>This flat iron creates nice size waves, however frizzes my hair.</li>
            <li>The other wavers that I&#x27;ve tried are bulky and take forever to \\&quot;wave\\&quot; your hair, but this one is light, easy to hold, and gets nice waves in a short time.  </li>
            <li>The ceramic iron was VERY gentle on my hair, no pulling or snagging as I used it.</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length layered very straight hair.</li>
            <li>also like that it is entirely cased in plastic since I plan to use it more for my daughter</li>
            <li>we don&#x27;t even use the higher levels of heat</li>
            <li>This one is sooo much faster to use!  </li>
            <li>so I am skilled at using various hair tools.</li>
            <li>pretty it looks.  </li>
            <li>up.&lt;br /&gt;The best way for me with my extreemly thick hair is to add moose to dry clean hair.  </li>
            <li>It stays hot.  </li>
            <li>The Conair curls are more kinky because the wells are shallower, the temperature control is easier to set and read, and the waves last longer.</li>
            <li>Pleeeeeease, i really need this!</li>
            <li>I had a $20.00 waver that would get too hot and take forever to curl.  </li>
            <li>This waver was hot in seconds.  </li>
            <li>up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on my hair on the lowest setting (my hair is thick and course and generally curls easily) and it worked great.</li>
            <li>At first, I was hesitant to get this waver because I thought the price was a little high but with the awesome long-lasting waves that you get, it was money well spent.</li>
            <li>next morning goes faster as I comb it out and mainly re-iron the top.</li>
            <li>It did not create deep beautiful waves; rather kinky dried out looking crimps.</li>
            <li>Loved the long lasting wave.</li>
            <li>It really helps hold the wave and gives it almost another</li>
            <li>This Conair waver left my hair smooth, yet still wavy/curly.</li>
            <li>This product just really didn&#x27;t work out for me.</li>
            <li>and i can do my whole hair in like 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Very please with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I have fine long straight hair to my waist.  </li>
            <li>I will admit the waves were not as full as they had been when I initially styled it</li>
            <li>The main reason I went this item if for safety</li>
            <li>Since it can get very hot, a silicone/ heat reistant mat is essential to protect your counter tops.</li>
            <li>I highly recommended this product.</li>
            <li>It is more expensive than most, but I think it is well worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li>I was SO surprised!!</li>
            <li>My hair waved a little at the top but that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t leave reviews here on Amazon.com</li>
            <li>I pinned my hair up, wrapped a silk scarf on my head as I normally do and went to sleep....</li>
            <li>but that is normal.</li>
            <li>After I was done I sent some pics to my mom and friends to show them my new style I got TONS of compliments on it.</li>
            <li>My mom even thought I got it done professionally!</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>I tried the lowest 2 settings first and only curled for maybe 10 mins...more like 5-8 mins probably</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s because I did small sections for a more natural wavy look.</li>
            <li>So far, I have also tried three types of wavers the revlon  3 barrel waver, gold and hot waver from sally&#x27;s beauty supple, and the infiniti deep waver.</li>
            <li>Then, out of curiosity I decided to try it on my 4 year old who has very straight, thin hair (again on the lowest setting) and her hair turned out soooo adorable</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey compared to the one from Revlon, but worth every penny since it saves you so much time.  </li>
            <li>I had left my hair really frizzy.</li>
            <li>I bought this deep wave crimper 2 days ago and recieved it much faster</li>
            <li>Bought this item for my 14 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 10 year old niece for Christmas</li>
            <li>The revlon waver made dents in my hair as if I had my hair in a ponytail all day and the gold and hot waver did minor dents in my hair and it did even wave at all.</li>
            <li>It also looks nice and NOT cheap like some of the other wavers.</li>
            <li>Sometimes a small section underneth with larger sections on top</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure when I try it on freshly blow dried hair it will look a little different.</li>
            <li>I was surprise that the first two deep wavers did not work on my hair because I have very fine thin asian hair.  </li>
            <li>and it was huge and heavy!  </li>
            <li>but I have used it too since the waves are just fantastic and last a long long time.  </li>
            <li>I love that in just a few mins I can use this deep waver and get a different look!!</li>
            <li>It has four heat settings not just the typical high or low settings that I&#x27;ve seen with many other wavers.</li>
            <li>so I plugged it in and tried it out on unwashed, dry , straight hair</li>
            <li>I have to turn it back on and reset it back to my high setting.</li>
            <li>but really I shouldn&#x27;t have expected it to work for me.</li>
            <li>Then I would go back to my old style for a couple weeks</li>
            <li>However, it was so similar to how my hair naturally curls that I decided to take it back.</li>
            <li>I bought the revlon crimper first and used it a few times, but is took for ever</li>
            <li>The first few times I used this product and went to work, everyone I knew gave me a compliment on my hair.  </li>
            <li>It is much easier to clamp the waver down on my hair with this than with my triple barrel.  </li>
            <li>It provides a different hair style that still looks natural without the effort and it doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair like some irons do.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little harder to check the placement of the heating elements because they are enclosed, but I was able to improve with a little practice.  </li>

            <li> First off the iron heated up VERY quickly, it was ready for use in under a minute.</li>
            <li> SUPER hot.    </li>
            <li> This flat iron creates nice size waves, however frizzes my hair.</li>
            <li> The other wavers that I&#x27;ve tried are bulky and take forever to \\&quot;wave\\&quot; your hair, but this one is light, easy to hold, and gets nice waves in a short time.  </li>
            <li> The ceramic iron was VERY gentle on my hair, no pulling or snagging as I used it.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length layered very straight hair.</li>
            <li> also like that it is entirely cased in plastic since I plan to use it more for my daughter</li>
            <li> we don&#x27;t even use the higher levels of heat</li>
            <li> This one is sooo much faster to use!  </li>
            <li> so I am skilled at using various hair tools.</li>
            <li> pretty it looks.  </li>
            <li> up.&lt;br /&gt;The best way for me with my extreemly thick hair is to add moose to dry clean hair.  </li>
            <li> It stays hot.  </li>
            <li> The Conair curls are more kinky because the wells are shallower, the temperature control is easier to set and read, and the waves last longer.</li>
            <li> Pleeeeeease, i really need this!</li>
            <li> I had a $20.00 waver that would get too hot and take forever to curl.  </li>
            <li> This waver was hot in seconds.  </li>
            <li> up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on my hair on the lowest setting (my hair is thick and course and generally curls easily) and it worked great.</li>
            <li> At first, I was hesitant to get this waver because I thought the price was a little high but with the awesome long-lasting waves that you get, it was money well spent.</li>
            <li> next morning goes faster as I comb it out and mainly re-iron the top.</li>
            <li> It did not create deep beautiful waves; rather kinky dried out looking crimps.</li>
            <li> Loved the long lasting wave.</li>
            <li> It really helps hold the wave and gives it almost another</li>
            <li> This Conair waver left my hair smooth, yet still wavy/curly.</li>
            <li> This product just really didn&#x27;t work out for me.</li>
            <li> and i can do my whole hair in like 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> Very please with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have fine long straight hair to my waist.  </li>
            <li> I will admit the waves were not as full as they had been when I initially styled it</li>
            <li> The main reason I went this item if for safety</li>
            <li> Since it can get very hot, a silicone/ heat reistant mat is essential to protect your counter tops.</li>
            <li> I highly recommended this product.</li>
            <li> It is more expensive than most, but I think it is well worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> I was SO surprised!!</li>
            <li> My hair waved a little at the top but that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t leave reviews here on Amazon.com</li>
            <li> I pinned my hair up, wrapped a silk scarf on my head as I normally do and went to sleep....</li>
            <li> but that is normal.</li>
            <li> After I was done I sent some pics to my mom and friends to show them my new style I got TONS of compliments on it.</li>
            <li> My mom even thought I got it done professionally!</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> I tried the lowest 2 settings first and only curled for maybe 10 mins...more like 5-8 mins probably</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s because I did small sections for a more natural wavy look.</li>
            <li> So far, I have also tried three types of wavers the revlon  3 barrel waver, gold and hot waver from sally&#x27;s beauty supple, and the infiniti deep waver.</li>
            <li> Then, out of curiosity I decided to try it on my 4 year old who has very straight, thin hair (again on the lowest setting) and her hair turned out soooo adorable</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey compared to the one from Revlon, but worth every penny since it saves you so much time.  </li>
            <li> I had left my hair really frizzy.</li>
            <li> I bought this deep wave crimper 2 days ago and recieved it much faster</li>
            <li> Bought this item for my 14 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 10 year old niece for Christmas</li>
            <li> The revlon waver made dents in my hair as if I had my hair in a ponytail all day and the gold and hot waver did minor dents in my hair and it did even wave at all.</li>
            <li> It also looks nice and NOT cheap like some of the other wavers.</li>
            <li> Sometimes a small section underneth with larger sections on top</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure when I try it on freshly blow dried hair it will look a little different.</li>
            <li> I was surprise that the first two deep wavers did not work on my hair because I have very fine thin asian hair.  </li>
            <li> and it was huge and heavy!  </li>
            <li> but I have used it too since the waves are just fantastic and last a long long time.  </li>
            <li> I love that in just a few mins I can use this deep waver and get a different look!!</li>
            <li> It has four heat settings not just the typical high or low settings that I&#x27;ve seen with many other wavers.</li>
            <li> so I plugged it in and tried it out on unwashed, dry , straight hair</li>
            <li> I have to turn it back on and reset it back to my high setting.</li>
            <li> but really I shouldn&#x27;t have expected it to work for me.</li>
            <li> Then I would go back to my old style for a couple weeks</li>
            <li> However, it was so similar to how my hair naturally curls that I decided to take it back.</li>
            <li> I bought the revlon crimper first and used it a few times, but is took for ever</li>
            <li> The first few times I used this product and went to work, everyone I knew gave me a compliment on my hair.  </li>
            <li> It is much easier to clamp the waver down on my hair with this than with my triple barrel.  </li>
            <li> It provides a different hair style that still looks natural without the effort and it doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair like some irons do.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little harder to check the placement of the heating elements because they are enclosed, but I was able to improve with a little practice.  </li>
            <li> the next day it was flat</li>
            <li> However, you do get long lasting results.</li>
            <li> And it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> After flat ironing my hair</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick hair</li>
            <li> it takes so long doing it that way</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t take long to wave my hair.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this iron a try even though it was a little more expensive than the others.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed that my beautiful hairstyle was going to go to waste.</li>
            <li> Overall it is an average wave iron.</li>
            <li> In fact I did not see ONE loose strand when I was done (i.e. no hair was pulled out during use).</li>
            <li> I looked at ALOT of crimpers, wavers , and all the reviews, prices, and finally decided that I didn&#x27;t want to spend less money for a cheap waver that I am going to be unhappy with and have to buy another one.</li>
            <li> After having tried other waving irons....</li>
            <li> I have very thick shoulder length hair that has a natural wave.  </li>
            <li> My hair is about 4 inches past my shoulders and it&#x27;s thick but with a soft texture.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take forever for the Infiniti Wave Iron to heat up, it takes less than a minute.</li>
            <li> It does have a slight smell when it is heating up</li>
            <li> all the previous crimping irons I have bought before.</li>
            <li> It is amazing product and you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> but you can decide how crimpy or wavy you want it) without having to use a curling iron and twist my hair in it and wait a few minutes..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few years</li>
            <li> I did not have that with this curler, I was done in less then 10 mins!</li>
            <li> My daughter has thin long hair, and the wave stays in her hair all day and night.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say, I&#x27;m sending it back.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and I have a hard time straightening it.</li>
            <li> At least it wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> A negative is the location and sensitivity of the on/off button.</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t so thick, then it might.</li>
            <li> i was soooooooooooo disappointed when i tried to plug it in france through a voltage converter as i live in paris and its 220V here....</li>
            <li> so I was disappointed because I had one when I was younger</li>
            <li> After I use this it looks thick and shiny!</li>
            <li> My hair is overprocessed and thin.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t hold I used it at night and</li>
            <li> anyways, so i can&#x27;t use it and am very sad about it....&#x3D;</li>
            <li> I had purchased a Revlon ironer at a drugstore for about $20 and HATED it.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I thought this iron was going to be great but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t hold I used it at night and the next day it was flat the wave hadn&#x27;t held so I was disappointed because I had one when I was younger and it held for weeks.</li>
            <li> So I was researching wavers online and found this one here at Amazon. Most of the reviews seemed like this was a good product. Then while I was at Ross, I looked in the hair product section and they happened to have this waver for only $13.99, so I of course snatched it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on my hair on the lowest setting (my hair is thick and course and generally curls easily) and it worked great. However, it was so similar to how my hair naturally curls that I decided to take it back. Then, out of curiosity I decided to try it on my 4 year old who has very straight, thin hair (again on the lowest setting) and her hair turned out soooo adorable I decided to keep the waver for her. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest using a spray starch on your hair before waving each strand if your hair is fine and/or super straight. It really helps hold the wave and gives it almost another dimension.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that it is entirely cased in plastic since I plan to use it more for my daughter, I don&#x27;t want the chance of her getting burned.</li>
            <li> The Infiniti S5 Tourmaline Deep Wave Iron is a great product. It&#x27;s easy and safe to use and the results you get from using it is well worth the price. At first, I was hesitant to get this waver because I thought the price was a little high but with the awesome long-lasting waves that you get, it was money well spent. It doesn&#x27;t take forever for the Infiniti Wave Iron to heat up, it takes less than a minute. It has four heat settings not just the typical high or low settings that I&#x27;ve seen with many other wavers. The waves stay in my hair for a week and sometimes longer. But of course this depends on your hair texture so times may vary. However, you do get long lasting results. I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on my hair after using this waver. I highly recommended this product.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t leave reviews here on Amazon.com but after using the Conair Deep Wave Iron I just HAVE to rave about it.  I wanted a wavy look to my hair NOT crimped and NOT curled, I knew in my mind what I wanted but did not know how to achieve it. I did some research on the internet and figured out I needed a wave iron. After comparing between the Conair, Revlon and Bedhead I decided to give this iron a try even though it was a little more expensive than the others. My hair is about 4 inches past my shoulders and it&#x27;s thick but with a soft texture. Once I receieved the iron I was able to wave my hair in about 15 minutes and that&#x27;s because I did small sections for a more natural wavy look. First off the iron heated up VERY quickly, it was ready for use in under a minute. Secondly, I used the default temperature setting and that did an amazing job on my hair. You should probably test out the default setting before trying the next temperature level. The ceramic iron was VERY gentle on my hair, no pulling or snagging as I used it. In fact I did not see ONE loose strand when I was done (i.e. no hair was pulled out during use). After I was done I sent some pics to my mom and friends to show them my new style I got TONS of compliments on it. My mom even thought I got it done professionally! Well since I was just testing it out I waved my hair about 2 hours before I was going to bed. I was a little disappointed that my beautiful hairstyle was going to go to waste. I pinned my hair up, wrapped a silk scarf on my head as I normally do and went to sleep....woke up the next morning, pulled off the scarf, and took out the bobby pin and my hair flowed out in beautiful waves! I was SO surprised!! But it looked beautiful! I will admit the waves were not as full as they had been when I initially styled it but it was still styled. I went to work with my hair like that and got TONNNS of compliments. It&#x27;s now 3 days later and I still have waves in my hair. I am beyond pleased with this product and have recommended it to alot my family and friends already.</li>
            <li> I bought the revlon crimper first and used it a few times, but is took for ever and it was huge and heavy!  Not convientent at all!  This crimper is light weight, heats up in 60 seconds and it takes one press with the crimper and hold about 5 seconds and the wave is perfect, I got sooo many complements and the curls stay on all day!  BEST BUY  Pay the extra money and get this crimper!!! FO SHO heheheh</li>
            <li> This Item shows in stock but I have tried to order twice and both times they canceled the order!!</li>
            <li> I bought this waver at TJ Maxx recently for $20. I love the look of beachy waves, but the Hot &amp; Silky waver I got from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply I had left my hair really frizzy. This Conair waver left my hair smooth, yet still wavy/curly. I have pretty thick hair so I had to section it and it took me around 20 minutes to do my hair, unlike my the Sally&#x27;s iron which took about 45 minutes. I would definitely recommend this Conair iron!!!! Good purchase, but check around at TJ Maxx or Marshall&#x27;s to see if they still have them in stock!</li>
            <li> This product just really didn&#x27;t work out for me. It did not create deep beautiful waves; rather kinky dried out looking crimps. I actually sent it back today. If you are going for that Taylor Swift hair--wavy and beautiful, I don&#x27;t think this is the route. At least it wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> wow! this waver gives me amazing waves, &amp; it heats up really fast and i can do my whole hair in like 20 minutes. I love it!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best crimping iron I&#x27;ve ever used or had. I&#x27;ve been using this one for YEARS and it still works amazing. It gives you that curled look and not a crimped look. Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> This deep wave iron has been a great investment.  It provides a different hair style that still looks natural without the effort and it doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair like some irons do.  Highly recommend this iron if you&#x27;re looking for curls that are more unique and unified looking.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter but I have used it too since the waves are just fantastic and last a long long time.  Also it heats up really really quick - we don&#x27;t even use the higher levels of heat since the lower ones do just great for our type of hair which is fine and straight.  It is lightweight and easy to use.  We just love it and get great compliments from our friends when we do our hair.  Would definitely recommend this one!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this deep wave crimper 2 days ago and recieved it much faster then I thought! It came packaged nicely and when I took it out I could not believe how light  it was! I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it so I plugged it in and tried it out on unwashed, dry , straight hair (probably not washed in 1 day). I did not use any special products or sprays on my hair. I&#x27;m sure when I try it on freshly blow dried hair it will look a little different. It does have a slight smell when it is heating up but that is normal. I tried the lowest 2 settings first and only curled for maybe 10 mins...more like 5-8 mins probably and I love the results I got from just doing that!! I have shoulder length layered very straight hair. I love that in just a few mins I can use this deep waver and get a different look!! I am very happy with it. I looked at ALOT of crimpers, wavers , and all the reviews, prices, and finally decided that I didn&#x27;t want to spend less money for a cheap waver that I am going to be unhappy with and have to buy another one. I just went for the curler with the best reviews and even though it was a higher price, I feel that I got what I paid for and I&#x27;m very happy about that. I do not regret spending the money for this since it is a wonderful curler and I feel that I am going to use it alot. And it will last a long time. I love that I can get a \\&quot;curly\\&quot; effect (though it is more crimpy, wavy but you can decide how crimpy or wavy you want it) without having to use a curling iron and twist my hair in it and wait a few minutes..it takes so long doing it that way and my hand always hurts. I did not have that with this curler, I was done in less then 10 mins! I am looking forward to my hair growing out and seeing how it looks longer and wavy. Very please with my purchase.</li>
            <li> My triple barrel waver broke, so I decided to give this one a try.  This one is sooo much faster to use!  The heating elements are covered so my fingers are more protected.  It is much easier to clamp the waver down on my hair with this than with my triple barrel.  It&#x27;s a little harder to check the placement of the heating elements because they are enclosed, but I was able to improve with a little practice.  I like the multiple heat levels.  My hair did fine with the lowest setting.  I have fine long straight hair to my waist.  I was done waving within 20 minutes!  If you&#x27;ve never used a waver, though, plan on spending 30-45 minutes until you get the hang of it.  I give this waver two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> This flat iron creates nice size waves, however frizzes my hair. I used it on my daughters hair and she also had the same frizz effect. A plus is the iron heats up nicely and it doesn&#x27;t take long to wave my hair. A negative is the location and sensitivity of the on/off button. It bugs me because as I&#x27;m waving my hair I accidently hit the button and it turns off, so I have to turn it back on and reset it back to my high setting. Overall it is an average wave iron.</li>
            <li> My hair is overprocessed and thin. After I use this it looks thick and shiny! Loved the long lasting wave. I used the medium setting and got a beautiful wave!! Love it!</li>
            <li> i was soooooooooooo disappointed when i tried to plug it in france through a voltage converter as i live in paris and its 220V here....i called the conair customer service and they told me it doesn&#x27;t work, even with a voltage converter!! why??  anyways, so i can&#x27;t use it and am very sad about it....&#x3D;(</li>
            <li> I was really excited to see all that great reviews on this but really I shouldn&#x27;t have expected it to work for me. My hair is thick and I have a hard time straightening it. My hair doesn&#x27;t hold curl at all. If it wasn&#x27;t so thick, then it might. I thought the waver might work for me but no. My hair waved a little at the top but that&#x27;s all. Sorry to say, I&#x27;m sending it back.</li>
            <li> This item makes my hair look fabulous! Blow it straight, and then use this to create perfect waves... i love it!</li>
            <li> After having tried other waving irons.... I&#x27;m so happy I finally chose this one. Great design, great results!</li>
            <li> Bought this item for my 14 year old daughter. She wanted the vidal sassoon wave iron, but this one had such good reviews, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. It is more expensive than most, but I think it is well worth the extra cost. My daughter has thin long hair, and the wave stays in her hair all day and night. All of her friends want one :-) You will definately be satisfied with the performance of this waver. Give it a try!</li>
            <li> So far, I have tried four different kind of wavers and of the four (Bed Head, Revlon, Hot Tools, and the Infinit Conair), this one is by far the best one!! The plates produce deep big waves and the tourmaline plates make your hair look shiny.  It&#x27;s a little pricey compared to the one from Revlon, but worth every penny since it saves you so much time.  The other wavers that I&#x27;ve tried are bulky and take forever to \\&quot;wave\\&quot; your hair, but this one is light, easy to hold, and gets nice waves in a short time.  It also looks nice and NOT cheap like some of the other wavers.</li>
            <li> This worked awesome! The iron heated up well and made wonderful waves! I am very happy I picked this product</li>
            <li> I love it! The multiple heat settings provide a great option to determine the amount of desired wave. Since it can get very hot, a silicone/ heat reistant mat is essential to protect your counter tops.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few years &amp; I&#x27;m now just writing a review. I love this iron, it works great &amp; makes beautiful waves. I get compliments every time I use it.</li>
            <li> I used to be a Cosmelogist so I am skilled at using various hair tools. I have tried several \\&quot;wave irons\\&quot; and I not found one that waves instead of crimps. I have tried different section sizes, heat levels, etc. and haven&#x27;t had the results I hope for. This product is a quality product, I personally just couldn&#x27;t get it to do a wave.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product on a recommendation from a friend.  I have very thick shoulder length hair that has a natural wave.  Most of the time I use a straightner to give a sleek managed appearance, but wanted to try something new.  I experimented a couple times on the weekends to learn how to get the look I wanted. The first few times I used this product and went to work, everyone I knew gave me a compliment on my hair.  Then I would go back to my old style for a couple weeks and when I used the iron and went back to work the compliments again were all about my hair.  Everyone says how nice, cute, fun, and pretty it looks.  I find that I can do it one day and it lasts for 3 with a daily touch up.&lt;br /&gt;The best way for me with my extreemly thick hair is to add moose to dry clean hair.  Then I crimp in sections.  Sometimes a small section underneth with larger sections on top (hair can lift and get too big).  Finally I run my fingers through for the finished look.  I don&#x27;t recommend brushing or combing after because hair will get puffy and fuzzy looking.&lt;br /&gt;The next morning goes faster as I comb it out and mainly re-iron the top.</li>
            <li> My hair looks shiny &amp; wavy using this product. And the great part about this is that I did not have to get a perm, so I can wave my hair when I want to.</li>
            <li> I ordered this Iron and it works great!  I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my hair since i bought it.  Good buy!</li>
            <li> I love this iron! I normally wear my hair straight and this created a great new look.  It doesn&#x27;t take long to heat up and it creates perfect waves.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I just received my Conair wave iron today. Oh my god its so much better then all the previous crimping irons I have bought before. It gives me deep waves in my hair &amp; I don&#x27;t even need hair spay to keep it to stay. So glad I purchased it, it gives just the look I was looking for! :-)</li>
            <li> I had purchased a Revlon ironer at a drugstore for about $20 and HATED it.  I read the user reviews on this one and it&#x27;s everything everyone said it is.    It heats up to full heat in under a minute.    It stays hot.  SUPER hot.    It puts deep, beautiful waves in your hair.    They LAST all day.      It&#x27;s really a great product.  Buy it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 10 year old niece for Christmas and she loved it.  The main reason I went this item if for safety, she could hold the iron without burning herself. She used it the first night and with her baby fine hair it took the curl and did not straighten out.  Very pleased with this item.</li>
            <li> I bought this item and the Vidal Sassoon Waver, and prefer the Conair waver. The Conair curls are more kinky because the wells are shallower, the temperature control is easier to set and read, and the waves last longer. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> So far, I have also tried three types of wavers the revlon  3 barrel waver, gold and hot waver from sally&#x27;s beauty supple, and the infiniti deep waver. The revlon waver made dents in my hair as if I had my hair in a ponytail all day and the gold and hot waver did minor dents in my hair and it did even wave at all. I was surprise that the first two deep wavers did not work on my hair because I have very fine thin asian hair.  I had a picture in my mind of how I thought the waves would look like. At this point, I had given up on deep wavers.  I did not purchase the Infiniti conair deep waver on amazon but I found it at marshall&#x27;s for only 20 bucks! The Infiniti by Conair S5 Tourmaline Ceramic 2 1/4 heats up to 395 degrees Fahrenheit. It makes the perfect s shape waves like you french braided your hair and slept with it over night and if you flip the waver the opposite way and began waving your hair it would looked as if you hair had hollywood glamour curl shaped/ waves. The waves lasts about 1 to 2 days.  It is best to keep your waves in place by sleeping in a high ponytail a night and the best part is you can do your hair whole head of hair less than 15 mins because it only takes a couple of seconds to make a wave. It is amazing product and you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Pleeeeeease, i really need this! So please stock up asap....im in need!&lt;br /&gt;Loooooooove this product. Need it , asap! Thanx</li>
            <li> it works but my hair gets too curly</li>
            <li> This was item is worth every cent I paid for it.  I didn&#x27;t want to spend the extra money for it.  I am so glad I did.  I had a $20.00 waver that would get too hot and take forever to curl.  I am biracial and my hair has a mind of it&#x27;s own.  This waver was hot in seconds.  After flat ironing my hair it took  8-10 minutes to put waves in.  I recommend this product!!!!</li>
