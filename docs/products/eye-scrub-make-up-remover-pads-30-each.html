            <li>They do a great job removing eye makeup</li>
            <li>When I had an eye infection before they were a great help recovering from it.  </li>
            <li>These have proved to be very effective in cleaning the sludge out of my eyes.  </li>

            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>He recommended this product and the result are amazing.  </li>
            <li>They can be makeup removers if you would like, but I use them morning and night to just cleanse my eyes because they feel so nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used every brand (I have an eye condition that requires scrubbing every night), and these are by far the best.  </li>
            <li>I hope that they keep making these :)</li>
            <li>I went from being able to use Clinique, Prescriptives, Maybelline, etc.</li>
            <li>eye makeup removers to not being able to use ANY of them.</li>
            <li>can* use just one pad for each eye, which makes the price tag more palatable.</li>
            <li>I have used Eye Scrub for over 20 years as an eye makeup remover, but more than that as an eyelid cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I used to suffer from many eye problems, but since my eye doctor recommended this over 20 years, I have used nothing else.</li>
            <li>I have been using these eye wash pads for many years.  </li>
            <li>So, try them and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll like them as well.</li>
            <li>I am so glad to be able to buy them on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The best ever! 5 Stars definitely!</li>
            <li>love these eye wipes.  </li>
            <li>Works great on my sensitive eyes!  </li>
            <li>I can no longer ifnd them in local stores or pharmacies, so being able to order them online is great.</li>
            <li>Suds wash off easily.  </li>
            <li>And if you get in your eye the cleaning foam it creates as you use it, it won&#x27;t sting, and your eye will easily absorb it.</li>
            <li>They are awesome and not only are they very efficient at removing eye makeup, they do not upset my skin at all.</li>
            <li>and I hope you love these as much as I do!</li>
            <li>Which is funny b/c they seem to have taken them out of most drugstores.  </li>
            <li>They truly make your eyes feel fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>If you wear alot of eye makeup or eye shadow, this product takes it off quick.</li>
            <li>There are several different manufacturers of this type of eye pad but these are the best that my husband and I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Really so gentle, non-greasy, easy to apply</li>
            <li>It is exceptionally good for people with dry eyelids as it removes all matter.  </li>
            <li>They easily, but gently, remove eye make up - including mascara.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend these makeup remover pads, they are super easy to use and sterile.</li>
            <li>You just massage the package, open, and you have a sudsy, gentle cleansing pad that you hold against each eye and gently press, lightly massage, and enjoy the nice feeling for about 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li>Great product I use it everyday!</li>
            <li>Takes makeup off and better than the OTC brands at the local drug stores.  </li>
            <li>My doctor suggested hot compresses.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to buy it at my local stores, but I have found it online!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I ordered the Eye Scrub on-line.  </li>
            <li>it is well worth the money not hard on the skin nor eyes</li>
            <li>While you can buy generic brands for less, this is the best place I found for the standard product.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I first wash my face with gentle facial cleanser, then use the pads, and rinse.  </li>
            <li>These cloths are not really &amp;#34;scrubby&amp;#34;,  they are soft textured cloths impregnated with a very mild cleanser that does not sting or irritate eyes.</li>
            <li>I usually use it while in the shower, it saves more time.</li>
            <li>I think that if you have a serious eye problem they might be a good bet since they are sterile and packaged individually.  </li>
            <li>They are gentle enough even for very sensitive eyes and lids.  </li>
            <li>He said mascara gets into the pores around you eyelashes and doesn&#x27;t always clear out using mascara removers.</li>
            <li>I use them a couple of times a week when I want to be sure that any extra make-up lurks on my eyelids no more....</li>
            <li>The only thing is I live in Vegas</li>
            <li>This stuff is really expensive but it works amazingly well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, they are not cheap but worth it.  </li>
            <li>I love them and highly recommend them if you are unable to use other eye makeup removers (and even if you are-using these is like giving your eyes a bath!).</li>

            <li> a reliable eyelid cleanser - used it for years for dry eyes.  </li>
            <li> I bought a different brand of remover pads for half the price and ended up not using them.</li>
            <li> I hesitate to call them &amp;#34;scrubs&amp;#34; as that implies that they are not gentle cleansing pads.  </li>
            <li> I tried another brand and the pads were rough and scratched my eyelids.</li>
            <li> Unlike other reviewers, this product did not remove my mascara without an extreme amount of rubbing.</li>
            <li> I have less than 30 days to use a product which has 30 packets.  </li>
            <li> I believe the heat damaged the product a little</li>
            <li> It takes off heavy eye makeup well.  </li>
            <li> So the money for them are wasted.</li>
            <li> Make up comes off easily; never any burning.  </li>
            <li> I suddenly developed a sensitivity/allergy to most eye makeup removers while suffering an awful cold a few years ago.</li>
            <li> Just a little late to ship to my house.</li>
            <li> I realized that I could no longer use the usual eye makeup removers and was then on a mission to find something else I could use, when I stumbled upon the Eye Scrub pads in Walgreens.</li>
            <li> My Dr. has me use this everyday!</li>
            <li> However, they are expensive and it takes several of the pads to remove masacara which is not water-proof and eye-liner.  </li>
            <li> hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Dr said use it for an infection in my eye along with some meds .It worked,but I am still a little shy about putting stuff in and around my eye.</li>
            <li> NOT attractive.</li>
            <li> When tired and wanting to go to bed -- wam you can take off the eye makeup and shower in the am.  </li>
            <li> tad expensive though.</li>
            <li> Somewhat expensive</li>
            <li> My eyelids were inflamed some time ago (blephritis) and my eyes were really uncomfortable and even hurt.</li>
            <li> they are makeup remover not eye scrub :(</li>
            <li> I hate spending the money for shipping but the Eye Scrub is a must have!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff is really expensive but it works amazingly well.  It&#x27;s perfect for travel, cleans quickly and thoroughly.  I really like this product.</li>
            <li> These were recommended to me by my Opthamologist about 10 years ago, and I have been using them ever since.  I can no longer ifnd them in local stores or pharmacies, so being able to order them online is great.</li>
            <li> These have proved to be very effective in cleaning the sludge out of my eyes.  I have a low grade endemic skin problem which results in bleary eyes. Eye Scrubs hold in check, but of course does not cure.</li>
            <li> These are really awesome.  I&#x27;ve been trying to find these for two years in the local CVS/Walgreens, but no luck.  Thought to look on Amazon and here they are!  Really so gentle, non-greasy, easy to apply and they lather very nicely!  I hope that they keep making these :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anna</li>
            <li> Great eye makeup remover pads. They do the best job of any product I&#x27;ve ever used and are gentle.&lt;br /&gt;A tad expensive though.</li>
            <li> This is the best eye makeup remover i can find out there. If you wear alot of eye makeup or eye shadow, this product takes it off quick. I usually use it while in the shower, it saves more time.</li>
            <li> I suddenly developed a sensitivity/allergy to most eye makeup removers while suffering an awful cold a few years ago. I went from being able to use Clinique, Prescriptives, Maybelline, etc. eye makeup removers to not being able to use ANY of them. One day...it all changed. I had been using Prescriptives but one day realized I was out and used some Maybelline (or was it Cover Girl?) eye makeup remover. My eyes proceeded to get puffy, swollen and red. NOT attractive. I realized that I could no longer use the usual eye makeup removers and was then on a mission to find something else I could use, when I stumbled upon the Eye Scrub pads in Walgreens. I have been using them ever since. They are awesome and not only are they very efficient at removing eye makeup, they do not upset my skin at all. I love them and highly recommend them if you are unable to use other eye makeup removers (and even if you are-using these is like giving your eyes a bath!). As another reviewer mentioned-you *can* use just one pad for each eye, which makes the price tag more palatable. Good luck and I hope you love these as much as I do!</li>
            <li> wonderful product. hard to find in stores. it is well worth the money not hard on the skin nor eyes</li>
            <li> I have used Eye Scrub for over 20 years as an eye makeup remover, but more than that as an eyelid cleanser.  It is exceptionally good for people with dry eyelids as it removes all matter.  I cannot say enough about this product.  I used to suffer from many eye problems, but since my eye doctor recommended this over 20 years, I have used nothing else.</li>
            <li> The best eyelid cleaner I have ever used.  It;s the softest eyelid cleaner too.  Somewhat expensive but it&#x27;s work the price.</li>
            <li> they are makeup remover not eye scrub :( if you are looking for makeup  remover then go for it. but i was looking for actual eye scrub which they are not.</li>
            <li> The items and package are very good. Just a little late to ship to my house.</li>
            <li> Works great on my sensitive eyes!  Takes makeup off and better than the OTC brands at the local drug stores.  Would recommend this to take off make up at night.  My opthamologist recommended.</li>
            <li> These do not irritate my eyes at all. I even use them to remove makeup on my face because other makeup remover wipes cause a lot of irritation on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Been using these eye scrub pads for years.  They are gentle enough even for very sensitive eyes and lids.  Make up comes off easily; never any burning.  Suds wash off easily.  These were recommended to me by my ophthalmologist.</li>
            <li> My Dr. has me use this everyday!</li>
            <li> Love this product! I have used it every day since 2009. I hope now that it has been they don&#x27;t change it one bit. It is great as is.</li>
            <li> They are sterile and did not irritate my eyes.  However, they are expensive and it takes several of the pads to remove masacara which is not water-proof and eye-liner.  I think that if you have a serious eye problem they might be a good bet since they are sterile and packaged individually.  BUt they did not suit my purpose which Is why I gave them 3***s.</li>
            <li> Unlike other reviewers, this product did not remove my mascara without an extreme amount of rubbing. I thought this product would be great for travel.</li>
            <li> a reliable eyelid cleanser - used it for years for dry eyes.  Very pleased with product .</li>
            <li> My eye Dr said use it for an infection in my eye along with some meds .It worked,but I am still a little shy about putting stuff in and around my eye.</li>
            <li> My eyelids were inflamed some time ago (blephritis) and my eyes were really uncomfortable and even hurt. My doctor suggested hot compresses. I poked around online and found that these eyelid scrubs are also recommended for blephritis. I tried them and noticed that the redness and eye discomfort disappeared. These cloths are not really &amp;#34;scrubby&amp;#34;,  they are soft textured cloths impregnated with a very mild cleanser that does not sting or irritate eyes. It is better than baby shampoo and is perfect for eye make up removal. Also really good for removing debris and allergens.</li>
            <li> I have been using these eye wash pads for many years.  I hesitate to call them &amp;#34;scrubs&amp;#34; as that implies that they are not gentle cleansing pads.  They truly make your eyes feel fresh and clean.  You just massage the package, open, and you have a sudsy, gentle cleansing pad that you hold against each eye and gently press, lightly massage, and enjoy the nice feeling for about 30 seconds.  I guarantee you will feel the difference between this and just washing with soap.  I first wash my face with gentle facial cleanser, then use the pads, and rinse.  They can be makeup removers if you would like, but I use them morning and night to just cleanse my eyes because they feel so nice.</li>
            <li> There are several different manufacturers of this type of eye pad but these are the best that my husband and I have tried.  I use them to remove make-up and he uses them for an eye condition he has that needs cleansing daily.  So, try them and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll like them as well.</li>
            <li> I always thought my mascara remover worked great until I went to the eye doctor. He said mascara gets into the pores around you eyelashes and doesn&#x27;t always clear out using mascara removers. He recommended this product and the result are amazing.  Walgreen&#x27;s used to sell this product, however, now I have to buy them on the internet.</li>
            <li> Well known product at a good price. My wife wanted the standard product. While you can buy generic brands for less, this is the best place I found for the standard product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used every brand (I have an eye condition that requires scrubbing every night), and these are by far the best.  Which is funny b/c they seem to have taken them out of most drugstores.  I am so glad to be able to buy them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The best ever! 5 Stars definitely! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</li>
            <li> The only eye makeup remover I will use and it works too!! I have not been able to buy it at my local stores, but I have found it online! I highly recommend these makeup remover pads, they are super easy to use and sterile.</li>
            <li> My mother&#x27;s optometrist recommended these, and I decided to try them, too. Not only do they take off make-up residue, they&#x27;re also antiseptic. And if you get in your eye the cleaning foam it creates as you use it, it won&#x27;t sting, and your eye will easily absorb it. I use them a couple of times a week when I want to be sure that any extra make-up lurks on my eyelids no more....</li>
            <li> Great product I use it everyday! The only thing is I live in Vegas it&#x27;s over 100 degrees outside I believe the heat damaged the product a little and  the box arrived damaged as well.</li>
            <li> It takes off heavy eye makeup well.  It delivers its claim.  When tired and wanting to go to bed -- wam you can take off the eye makeup and shower in the am.  It works.</li>
            <li> These pads are great!  They easily, but gently, remove eye make up - including mascara.  The scent is pleasant, the formula non-irritating.  They are especially handy for traveling.</li>
            <li> Eye Scrubs are the BEST for removing mascara without stinging my eye. I tried another brand and the pads were rough and scratched my eyelids. Good price, too.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I ordered the Eye Scrub on-line.  They ship me a packet of 30 individual wrapped pads. However,  I ordered on september 1,2012. I received the order on september 4, 2012.  The expiration date of the product  is October 2012. I have less than 30 days to use a product which has 30 packets.  Is this cheating or what?  Why would they ship me a product whih has such a short shelf life?</li>
            <li> Love this product! I hate spending the money for shipping but the Eye Scrub is a must have!!! Stores use to sell it</li>
            <li> This review is for the Eye Scrub Make Up Remover Pads - 30 each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these eye wipes.  They do a great job removing eye makeup but I&#x27;m using it to recover from an eye infection.  They were recommended to me by an eye doctor.  When I had an eye infection before they were a great help recovering from it.  Rather than using a washcloth I used these morning and night to thoroughly wash the eye lids.  I will always have these on hand and once I no longer have the eye infection and can wear eye makeup I will use these to take it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, they are not cheap but worth it.  I bought a different brand of remover pads for half the price and ended up not using them. So the money for them are wasted.</li>
