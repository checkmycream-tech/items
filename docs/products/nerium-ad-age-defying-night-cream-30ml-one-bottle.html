            <li>My skin has lost the uneveness, lines are greatly improved.</li>

            <li>My friends are all happy with their results as well.</li>
            <li>LOL.</li>
            <li>I was under the care of an esthetician for 20 years with great results from microdermabrasions and salicytic and glycolic peels when she joined this group.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for 3 months and have experienced none of the reported benefits.  </li>
            <li>However, every area on my face and neck that I&#x27;ve used it, I&#x27;ve been happy.</li>
            <li>But I got great results.</li>
            <li>I love the results I&#x27;m seeing!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for months now, and the results are phenomenal!!</li>
            <li>I have tried this product &amp; it seems very effective.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t help but try to offer a very honest evaluation.</li>
            <li>Amazing results on acne though!</li>
            <li>The before and afters are amazing!  </li>
            <li>but the difference in my skin is truly amazing!</li>
            <li>It also smells amazing!</li>
            <li>AMAZING product!  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing and scienticfically proven to give results of %30 improvement in 30 days!</li>
            <li>Nerium is amazing!</li>
            <li>DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this wonderful product.</li>
            <li>I was loving my skin to the point I didn&#x27;t have to use any makeup!</li>
            <li>** to start your own \\&quot;business\\&quot; when you buy on Amazon!</li>
            <li>, she showed me the makers of Nerium have their own NON TOXIC OLEANDER farm!</li>
            <li>I had to be honest!  </li>
            <li>But I did successfully cancel my auto ship going forward.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>I did, however, give it my best shot for 6 months before deciding that I had better stop the bleeding (spending over $100 a month on my product and website, etc.).I reviewed the procedures for returning product and accessories, including my starter kit, and proceeded as is spelled out on the Nerium website.  </li>
            <li>DIDNT ASK HOW SUCCESSFUL WE HAD BEEN, HOW NERIUM HELPED US, HOW IT CHANGED OUR LIVES.</li>
            <li>(:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since that day, my mom has become successful at Nerium, she can pay for my brothers treatment AND GOT A LEXUS AND IPAD JUST LIKE THE COMPANY</li>
            <li>(:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since that day, my mom has become successful at Nerium, she can pay for my brothers treatment AND GOT A LEXUS AND IPAD JUST LIKE THE COMPANY</li>
            <li>I should also let you know that I have been very successful in another network marketing business, top of the company, earned the trips, jewels and the car, but that company changed a lot</li>
            <li>I can feel that could be a problem, but just like anywhere else, there are people that just don&#x27;t know how to give a great costumer service, however this product is amazing and the people that I know and use it are extremely happy with it.  </li>
            <li>This is probably the most successful anti aging product I have used!  </li>
            <li>This was a great deal of money and did not measure up to the advertisement that promised amazing results.</li>
            <li>, I look bright</li>
            <li>This is probably also the reason I haven&#x27;t experienced amazing results.  </li>
            <li>My month pictures looked good.  </li>
            <li>Good product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good luck</li>
            <li>Loved the opportunity to buy it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Which makes perfectly good sense.  </li>
            <li>I happen to think my product is superior however,</li>
            <li>let&#x27;s be fair.</li>
            <li>45 never looked so good.</li>
            <li>I can relate to spending a good amount of money on products with the hope of receiving the outcome I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had good skin in my life.</li>
            <li>The product was as described, of good quality and delivered on time.</li>
            <li>Good quality age defying treatment.</li>
            <li>Nerium is a one step product, diminished my 11 lines between my eyes, gives me a glow &amp; makes my face look good.</li>
            <li>In that case, it&#x27;s quite good.</li>
            <li>Feels good when you put it on.</li>
            <li>Good delivery</li>
            <li>This product is also a  moisterizer which wasn&#x27;t good for my oily</li>
            <li>Good God - how does the FDA even let them market this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Good Product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping it keeps up with these good results</li>
            <li>The cream is doing a good job on my skin .</li>
            <li>skin was feeling so good.  </li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s all the good I can say about it.</li>
            <li>If this product was truly as magnificent as it claims to be it would be available in stores.</li>
            <li>and the pharmacist said to me, \\&quot;you look really good...</li>
            <li>I have been doing a ton of research on it and can find nothing good about it.</li>
            <li>So when a good friend of mine gave me a bottle I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>I wish that I could give it a good review, but I cannot tell a lie.  </li>
            <li>It seems that I had some improvement on my  skin.&lt;br /&gt;The good thing about it</li>
            <li>so you get a product it is good</li>
            <li>Nothing good, of course.</li>
            <li>this I sa good product for night-time use.</li>
            <li>I have a cousin who says it has been a good for her.</li>
            <li>The way brand partners sell their product is not a scam to me because I love this product and it works with my skin incredibly.</li>
            <li>My skin looks good.</li>
            <li>Nerium delivers a night cream that leaves your face looking good when you wake up.</li>
            <li>I was told that this would be the product that changed my face for the good forever.</li>
            <li>this stuff did nothing good for me.  </li>
            <li>and that is a good sign.</li>
            <li>The Nerium Ad is a good night cream.</li>
            <li>Good company.</li>
            <li>Good purchase.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having the mindset of, &amp;#34;it&#x27;s too good to be true,&amp;#34</li>
            <li>/&gt;the product is good.</li>
            <li>My face feels good after using this product.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t feel good.</li>
            <li>It also didn&#x27;t smell good at all.</li>
            <li>Ordering this from a good friend (working her way they college)</li>
            <li>good luck</li>
            <li>Nerium is a good product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my good deed for the day.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li>I also had my good friend who is a renowned organic chemist look at the science</li>
            <li>In good health and in fact, while I have my share of wrinkles, I have fairly good skin.  </li>
            <li>This seems to capture the good results again.  </li>
            <li>This was a good price compared to what I have paid from the distributor.  </li>
            <li>A Good review-</li>
            <li>Good that you put it on at bedtime.</li>
            <li>and so many people tell me I have beautiful skin.</li>
            <li>One thing about the pyramid sales, the people at the top make really good money, but the bottom feeders have to make the sales to keep everyone happy.</li>
            <li>but  I am happy with it and glad to have gotten it</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the results this product has to offer.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>The smell was very interesting to me.</li>
            <li>Be sure to use it every night no matter what because it will take awhile to work, but the end results are great.</li>
            <li>Instead, wash your face, apply sunscreen when in the sun, eat healthier foods, get more exercise, stop smoking, be happy.</li>
            <li>my skin color is great my crows feet around eyes are better</li>
            <li>I have pretty flawless skin already so for me, this product ruined my already good skin</li>
            <li>but I am very glad that I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so very pleased I tried it and recommend that others try and see for themselves.</li>
            <li>and yet they were able to get great results.</li>
            <li>Very convincing pictures and enthusiasm.</li>
            <li>The seller was great, it was packaged great and it came in a quick manner.</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked better and Its an amazing product and great company.</li>

            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just amazing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what those people used to obtain their amazing results, but it was not this product.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over a month and have seen amazing results.  </li>
            <li>This is used sparingly and the results are amazing  immediately.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing, I&#x27;ve read some reviewers stated they did not think it improved their skin in anyway</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t bother to do that and am content to enjoy the effects of this great product.</li>
            <li>but I have seen amazing results</li>
            <li>fantastic product have used for 2 years with great results.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing product.</li>
            <li>: The product works, the company is AMAZING and it changed my familys</li>
            <li>: The product works, the company is AMAZING and it changed my familys</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t till I took a look at my own before and after pictures that I realized just how amazing my results were.</li>
            <li>My skin was amazing through my teens and twenties, but once I hit 30</li>
            <li>My jaw is firming up so nice</li>
            <li>Here is my honest review.</li>
            <li>It looked liked</li>
            <li>Seems to be helping my skin, reducing wrinkles and pores, loving the product</li>
            <li>The Nerium&#x27;s customer serivice is really nice.  </li>
            <li>After two weeks, I ordered my own bottle and have shared my results with others.</li>
            <li>but the jury is still out on how effective it is.  </li>
            <li>Everyone in life needs to learn their own lessons and at their own pace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Excellent, i really like product it is helping with my skin discoloration.</li>
            <li>The after pictures had perfect lighting and were very flattering.  </li>
            <li>Kinda liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Buy at your own risk with this distributor.</li>
            <li>my make up would not apply nicely and just looked blah.</li>
            <li>My honest opinion.</li>
            <li>I am honest and transparent with people</li>
            <li>what kind of plant?</li>
            <li>And yes, she used her own money to make us all brand</li>
            <li>And yes, she used her own money to make us all brand</li>
            <li>but not the toxic kind.</li>
            <li>Age spots much fainter and skin tone excellent.</li>
            <li>would comment on how nice my skin looks</li>
            <li>the morning I rinse my face and neck with warm water and then pat dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>What kind of joke is this</li>
            <li>I then rinse with a wash cloth and warm water.</li>
            <li>It is pricey, and I feel like I have kind of plateaued</li>
            <li>Sometimes we can&#x27;t notice changes on our own face.</li>
            <li>I got used to the smell and even started to kind of like it.  </li>
            <li>There are ZERO facts presented honestly about this.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know why so many people did not have good results.  </li>
            <li>I liked it, I saw a difference after just 1 night of using it.</li>
            <li>This company is all about integrity so if someone is selling it on here, they&#x27;re not being honest.</li>
            <li>have my own before and after pics if you want to see them.</li>
            <li>; If you have ever worked or even started your own business you will know you have to apply yourself 100% to receive results</li>
            <li>You call her honest?</li>
            <li>I really liked this product.</li>
            <li>And I agree that those I know using R&amp;F products have had nice improvement also.</li>
            <li>Honestly.</li>
            <li>i purchased this product because i heard all the buzz and reviews going around for it, including mentions from friends; so my expectations were there.&lt;br /&gt;the packaging and bottle is nice, and the cream smells and feels delightful.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>the morning he rinses his face ,puts on the daycream ,and I love on myself , my skin feels better and looks better!!</li>
            <li>I even excitedly took my before pictures, hoping to show everyone how great it worked on me.  </li>
            <li>Its worth a try!!!</li>
            <li>The best result I&#x27;ve had is thst my skin is a bit brighter more consistently.  </li>
            <li>Very happy with this product and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>then it&#x27;s probably too good to be true!</li>
            <li>Nerium is the new best friend I have.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t so great but its made w all natural product that is why it doesn&#x27;t smell great.</li>
            <li>It is awesome Ty so much :)</li>
            <li>Jumped right in as Brand Partner &amp; know for a fact that this is truly an amazing company with great people, support, compensation &amp; opportunity.</li>
            <li>I also know someone else who experienced a side effect at first, but rode it out and is so glad she did!</li>
            <li>I got in touch with the company and they were very kind and quick to give me a refund.  </li>
            <li>Great product, fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>and the stink of old underwear, Nerium is a delightful indulgence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Whatever good you have heard about this product is accurate.</li>
            <li>And for a young person it was surprising how it seemed as though she had had Botox!!!!!</li>
            <li>This by far is my best face product.  </li>
            <li>This has been the best cream I have tried so far (in my budget).  </li>
            <li>They had tremendous wrinkles sagging and acne issues and the results for them were definitely more pronounced than what I have personally experienced.  </li>
            <li>It might still be a good deal for some, but the structure is not designed to be good for large percentages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product ..makes your skin feel wonderful .only used it for a week so far</li>
            <li>Then it spreads nicely, absorbs well, and feels awesome (as well as make the product go a lot further).  </li>
            <li>and I generally avoid the sun as best</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even considered becoming one of their Brand Partners because this product is so amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Beware!  if it sounds too good to be true</li>
            <li>The people I work with are wonderful  hard working people that are excited about our wonderful  products.</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly &amp; was in good condition.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t say my skin is perfect, but it&#x27;s never looked as glowing and smooth, and been this soft ever!</li>
            <li>I have very fair and sensitive skin but the two friends of mine that this works for have skin with more oil, it may be my skin type.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>:)  P.S.</li>
            <li>I love this product and would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>Love it love</li>
            <li>It love how it feels and</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say with conviction that the appearance of my crows feet have been reduced, but I have noticed that the wrinkles on my neck look much better.  </li>
            <li>One star is too many.</li>
            <li>So glad I didn&#x27;t get caught up in it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE Nerium.</li>
            <li>My lines were minimized, my skin was softer and smoother, and it had a healthy glow to it.  </li>
            <li>Everyone has called it a pyramid scheme, well let me ask you this, are you ever going to make more than your boss?</li>
            <li>I know many people doing it.</li>
            <li>my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>I have been using Nerium for and love it.</li>
            <li>I love the product and recommend it to anyone that is considering botox.</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>and I wanted to be supportive.  </li>
            <li>Save yourself some money go to Walgreens and get some Olay better results.</li>
            <li>Many men and women</li>
            <li>The most wonderful thing is that it corrects issues above and beneath the surface, giving people the look they vie for while diminishing their insecurities and building their confidence.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nerium has done the trick to keep my skin healthy.  </li>
            <li>I may update after I finish two more bottles.  </li>
            <li>Mine lasts more than a month.  </li>
            <li>Glad to find it on Amazon</li>
            <li>Having used this product before  it&#x27;s not any better than others on the marlet</li>
            <li>/&gt;You have to ask yourself why so many of these are for sale on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I am sure they must have an answer for this, but I don&#x27;t recall what it is.  </li>
            <li>Encourage them to learn more and pose questions for them.  </li>
            <li>#34;I&#x27;m thinking it wasn&#x27;t the Nerium, surely it was something else...</li>
            <li>There is no such guarantee when you buy through Amazon; 3) When you order through Nerium you can be assured that you are getting the best product from the Company.</li>
            <li>Make sure you get these from a brand partner.</li>
            <li>So many of my friends wanted to know what I was using and wanted some that I decided to sell it.  </li>
            <li>I intend to order more.</li>
            <li>a two to three weeks with my skin being more even toned and fading of age spots.</li>
            <li>It smooths and tightens my skin better after shaving.</li>
            <li>Others have told me that my skin looks much better and more even toned.  </li>
            <li>Love the product,  i receive compliments on my skin, which i account to the product,  Nerium.</li>
            <li>I had many headaches while using this but didn&#x27;t know of</li>
            <li>; so I automatically take better care of my skin because I wash my face every night to use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use it :)</li>
            <li>and I would love to tighten and shrink my pores.</li>
            <li>I was getting a better deal than ordering it through a Nerium agent, however the cream ran out within 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>Glad I am using this product.</li>
            <li>I have used Nerium AD before, and I love it.</li>
            <li>this product is over hyped without the results that are claimed - save your money and look for something better</li>
            <li>Love the Nerium Night Cream.</li>
            <li>MY SKIN DID NOT FEEL OR LOOK ANY BETTER....</li>
            <li>I have noticed a change for the better.  </li>
            <li>Nerium is over-selling its effectiveness to be sure.</li>
            <li>But after that, I didn&#x27;t notice any more</li>
            <li>Many people ask me what I am using.</li>
            <li>I love love love it</li>
            <li>I will continue to use Nerium and look forward to better and better skin.  </li>
            <li>She gave me a whole bottle as my sample which I thought was great.</li>
            <li>I am in my forties now and have been a sun worshiper most of my life.  </li>
            <li>and if I see any more results, (which I doubt) I will do an update.</li>
            <li>i have not tried it yet, but can see the difference on the sun spots and the tone  is better.</li>
            <li>Yes they send you more than you need a month.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a shame when brand partners focus more on the money rather than customer expectations.&lt;br</li>
            <li>received many compliments from friends and family.</li>
            <li>It works fantastic!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for 3 months and my skin just keeps getting better.</li>
            <li>I have been using Nerium for over a year and absolutely LOVE the results.</li>
            <li>My friends all love it too.</li>
            <li>I sure wish I would have listened to the reviews and took others advice.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Sure, they&#x27;ll say it&#x27;s counterfeit since the company prohibits amazon and ebay sales, but</li>
            <li>We are thoroughly enjoying the improved appearance of our skin.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely works best when followed by a moisturizer that night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin feels more taut and just looks brighter.  </li>
            <li>It makes me feel more radiant.  </li>
            <li>i Love this product..</li>
            <li>My skin feels and looks better</li>
            <li>So glad I have been using a sample, and that I&#x27;m not any money.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this night cream.</li>
            <li>Retin A works much better for me.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not terrible, either.  </li>
            <li>Find a BP and buy it from them. :)</li>
            <li>This company is nothing more than trash</li>
            <li>Considering they claim they do not need FDA approval for something derived from a poison, they sure do promote and post before and after pics with differentiating lighting, over</li>
            <li>product itself, I love</li>
            <li>Nerium seems to be a company much more focused on selling the benefits of distribution than selling the product.</li>
            <li>Getting kidnapped into sitting through presentations - a friend of my wife invited us to a &amp;#34;housewarming.&amp;#34; We were surrounded by what I thought were her friends and family, but most of them turned out to be Nerium Brand Partners.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In case you haven&#x27;t noticed, the top sales directors talk about having been in &amp;#34;relationship marketing&amp;#34; for years.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure this Nerium thingie is a side venture for them.  </li>
            <li>I switched to a 20% Vitamin C serum and it worked great at a much lower price.  </li>
            <li>I sometimes apply more water to&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li>, I get better results with the Neutrogena Ageless Intensives line.</li>
            <li>and it is mostly water</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve known her for many years I trusted her.  </li>
            <li>I tried so many lines, I lost count.  </li>
            <li>When I mentioned the burning I too was told to use more water.</li>
            <li>If you want some before and after pics or more info, just let me know.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>, I was glad that was not the case with me.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>But I love the products and they sale and do what they advertise.</li>
            <li>Glad for the ones that like it, but not for me.</li>
            <li>I love this nerium products.</li>
            <li>In fact most of neriums b4 and after pics look like plastic surgery b4 and after...</li>
            <li>My Sisters love it one is selling it.</li>
            <li>Now thou my face is getting more wrinkles and they swear it helps them</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m sure there might be people whose skin it legitimately irritates.</li>
            <li>Added a smoother appearance on my face and made the shade on my face a more even tone.</li>
            <li>But my skin looks SO much better</li>
            <li>and it even feels better.</li>
            <li>and I did notice a difference, mostly the crapeiness on my throat.</li>
            <li>but i don&#x27;t know for sure about the wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I have bought this product from the company and have enjoyed it.  </li>
            <li>but I will go back to buying it from the company because the product is great!</li>
            <li>I have bought this from a person who sells it not on amazon and it worked great, this one not so much.</li>
            <li>Using it was interesting.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I am a Mary Kay user and I do love MK too.</li>
            <li>Great product, I really do see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>mostly it has minimized the redness and made my skin more even.</li>
            <li>I add my moisturizer &amp; eye cream on top after 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li>It has done more then any name brands I have ever bought over the counter.</li>
            <li>I am still are hoping for even better results, we will see.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still trying to see if using longer will result in more benefits</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I hope others have better luck.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure this product is for me.</li>
            <li>Love the botanical smell, the tightening feel and most of all I love that I am seeing results.</li>
            <li>this is the fastest I&#x27;ve seen results. :)</li>
            <li>I will buy more of it when I run out.</li>
            <li>The sooner one uses this product the better it will work .</li>
            <li>I love Nerium night cream .</li>
            <li>I have some medical issues concerning my skin and this product helps my skin be the best it can be.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more in about a month.</li>
            <li>How many products do we buy and end up throwing away because they do not work.  </li>
            <li>But then it started to get better and better.  </li>
            <li>Then Google if it&#x27;s safe and read something to the contrary.</li>
            <li>I would compare it top</li>
            <li>About the cream, my skin tone is more even.</li>
            <li>But did you know that ozone is even more poisonous</li>
            <li>Skin texture better.  </li>
            <li>Skin color better.</li>
            <li>I hesitated putting it on my face, but my curiosity got the better of me.</li>
            <li>Make sure you purchase from an authorized Nerium Brand Partner.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion - I really think it works great.</li>
            <li>and I still love it.</li>
            <li>and it seems like you should get a bit more.</li>
            <li>I have had so many people tell me about this product that I had to try it for myself.</li>
            <li>I love Nerium Ad.</li>
            <li>I even love the smell now.</li>
            <li>I am so glad some told me about this product.</li>
            <li>My skin has improved more in a couple weeks then in years.</li>
            <li>You owe it to yourself to try it if you want more radiant, smother skin.</li>
            <li>but I ran out wanted to order more</li>
            <li>I love the feel of it and the effects seem to be working.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 63 and still had breakouts around my chin mostly.  </li>
            <li>It has helped give my skin a better texture.</li>
            <li>Love the product just not this bottle.</li>
            <li>While they have done well slowing the signs of aging, they haven&#x27;t been able to reverse the signs...</li>
            <li>so you can use the cream for 7 days and if you would like to use it longer and buy it on their website, make sure to let them know that you wouldn&#x27;t like to keep it on the 29th day</li>
            <li>Three weeks in I saw that my skin had started to look better.</li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Just ordered more and am trying the day cream too.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference and was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Another thing I love is that it is one product for all problems.</li>
            <li>It doesnt smell or feel healthy at all</li>
            <li>If you buy from an honest partner, they will help you get your Nerium Free.  </li>
            <li>That much better than getting your product at a cheaper cost hoping you are not getting an altered product.</li>
            <li>My pores are even showing more.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t get any more out.</li>
            <li>Interesting how Nerium showed a minimum of 30% improvement for EVERYONE IN EACH STUDY but not you?</li>
            <li>Those that are ignorant about an issue should educate themselves more before making a fool of themselves on the internet.</li>
            <li>the  breakouts are almost gone, I&#x27;m sure if I didn&#x27;t eat chocolate and seafood, the two things that trigger my Rosacea</li>
            <li>I would be even better</li>
            <li>The Nerium company uses a patented process to extract the safe portion of the oleander plant so all these folks saying the plant is posion do not understand this.</li>
            <li>Yes, if you eat an oleander leaf that isn&#x27;t safe.  </li>
            <li>but I do suggest you go to a reputable Nerium distributor.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>It works better than I was expecting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay if you don&#x27;t like it, it&#x27;s not for everyone.</li>
            <li>Love what it does for the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>you will get cheap!</li>
            <li>Within a week, the skin on my face felt more supple and that continued to improve.  </li>
            <li>Truth is truth, and I will not exaggerate for love or money.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looks more \\&quot;moist\\&quot; and \\&quot;dewy\\&quot; and \\&quot;alive.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>After 4 weeks of use the love affair started to end, I just didn’t know it yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Nerium for over a year now and am pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>My &amp;#34;turkey neck&amp;#34; has shrunk noticeably but is still gobbling more than I wish.</li>
            <li>The cost (more than Nerium) and time commitment</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with what I have seen and will continue to use it until something better comes along.</li>
            <li>Ok, so a friend gave me a bottle to try.</li>
            <li>Some lines, like the ones on the top of my lips were gone.</li>
            <li>If you want to contact me for more info go to my web page and enter your email.</li>
            <li>Hives on top of hives.</li>
            <li>I was told that since more than thirty days had elapsed since I bought it, there was nothing they could do.</li>
            <li>the truth is, i didn&#x27;t notice any difference on my skin for the better if anything compared to over-the-counter creams</li>
            <li>and I feel i get more benefit from that) .</li>
            <li>I hope this answers some of the questions HOW Nerium AD it scientifically reduce wrinkles and promote skin health for a more youthful appearance.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve paid big money to skin aestheticians to do that and never had this kind of good result before!</li>
            <li>My first bottle lasted over 2 months!!!  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY REMCOMMEND!!!!!</li>
            <li>But so far so good!</li>
            <li>Utilizing this biotechnology research and breakthrough technology, NBI continues to harness the unique and effective properties of nature’s botanical compounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and hey we all get older why not be proud)</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really convinced after the first 30 days, but I still continued to use it and ended up being very happy.</li>
            <li>If the product was so great it would be sold in stores and by high end companies.  </li>
            <li>I can relate with the struggle of finding that perfect product that makes a long term difference; that is reliable.</li>
            <li>But it is a pretty good product</li>
            <li>My first review was good.  </li>
            <li>Both are pretty good products.</li>
            <li>mom became fairly successful at her business, but what really matters, is THE CEO&#x27;S DAUGHTER AND SON</li>
            <li>First, if you are purchasing Nerium  products on this site, good luck.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Buyer Beware&amp;#34; is a good statement to people who don&#x27;t buy the real thing!</li>
            <li>Most surprising was the improvement in the large pores on my nose.</li>
            <li>So excited!</li>
            <li>I was so excited by the presentation I went to, I jumped in to being a brand partner without even trying the product!</li>
            <li>In an MLM set up, you can easily make more than your upline.</li>
            <li>Makeup goes on more smoothly and I just look better.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews, saw the pics on the Internet, and thought it sounded too good to be true, but a friend reported great results so after months finally caved and tried it.  </li>
            <li>It does however give me a very clean soft complection and feels great.</li>
            <li>Yes, my results aren&#x27;t significant, but they are better than before and my skin feels better.  </li>
            <li>if you are thinking about this product, you are probably someone who is not horrified at the thought of spending this kind of money for face cream in the first place!</li>
            <li>The product has made a difference but not as remarkable as claimed and the cost is a bit high</li>
            <li>not deep pit scars, the redness that occurs on very fair skinned people that doesn&#x27;t seem to go away....</li>
            <li>I thought 8 months was giving it more than a chance to prove the claims for the product were genuine, and after that period of time I cancelled the monthly auto-delivery without issue.</li>
            <li>I would recommend buy from a rep the 1st time and get a free sample to make sure that it doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin.</li>
            <li>I have taken great care of my skin and do look somewhat young for my age.  </li>
            <li>she is a happy user so far.</li>
            <li>I have spent twice the norm on foundation to try to cover them up best</li>
            <li>It has Oleander Leaf Extract (poisonous plant) as a primary ingredient, and from what I understand, there is more than one type of Oleander.</li>
            <li>And remember, the most important thing is if you are going to sell this stuff, pls don&#x27;t involve your friends and family in to it...</li>
            <li>and I am really happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li>for the first time since before puberty i feel ok in my own skin, not worrying about sleeping over the boyfriends and not wanting to wash my face because i am embarrassed of my skin.</li>
            <li>Keeps skin more youthful, smooth, and wrinkles</li>
            <li>and therefore I will not be trying this product or becoming a part of a Ponzi</li>
            <li>And being able to earn the Night cream for free through the customer loyalty program with a Brand Partner is the way to go.</li>
            <li>do offer a customer incentive that if you refer three people you get yours free which was appealing to me at the time)  </li>
            <li>but I have seen incredible results on others that I personally know.</li>
            <li>I was able to try this for free.</li>
            <li>We began using it for burns and our family now refers to it as &amp;#34;Gold&amp;#34;  Nothing we have ever had works as fast and as good on burns etc.</li>
            <li>The powerful wrinkle fighters and antioxidants in Nerium AD help combat and reverse time&#x27;s effect on your skin because it helps PRODUCE your OWN collagen, PROMOTE elasticity, and PENETRATES moisture at the deepest layers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair complected, allergic to many things, have dry skin and am a smoker.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love that I&#x27;ve seen a difference without much effort!!!</li>
            <li>so I gave her my 1/2 used bottle and another full size bottle!</li>
            <li>Nerium is the best product I have ever spent $ on!</li>
            <li>The product is easy to apply and it&#x27;s been a ritual for me.</li>
            <li>From then on all I ever heard from my mom was how great the company is, how great the product works (even though I never noticed a difference, and my boyfriend always complained of the smell), and how she believes in the product.</li>
            <li>and she started seeing the amazing results, and knows why we love the product so much.</li>
            <li>but I get stressed out easily</li>
            <li>it goes away very quickly after applying.</li>
            <li>My up-line, for whom I have the greatest respect and affection, is surely embarrassed by this, I&#x27;m sure, and since she is relatively elevated within the organization&#x27;s ranks, I&#x27;m sure this will cause some reverberating action at the highest levels.  </li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s begin my saying most of us brand partners use our own photos from our real customers</li>
            <li>Use going to bed, easy to apply and no odor.</li>
            <li>Ordered this for my mom, arrived very quickly, and she loves it.</li>
            <li>You can easily do that without having to go to Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and it works quite well on my chest where I wrinkle easily.  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it to anyone, regardless of age.</li>
            <li>really upset me the most, is that not one person I talked to or emailed expressed any comment or concern about my allergic reaction, or even what kind of allergic reaction I had.</li>
            <li>I know it is too strong for some people and may cause a rash</li>
            <li>So you have to ask yourself the question -- if they are using their own product why don&#x27;t they look as good as their before and after photos look on the various Nerium advertising websites?  </li>
            <li>It also had a strong, unattractive smell to it.</li>
            <li>At first, using the product seemed AMAZING</li>
            <li>At first I really liked my results but over time Nerium clogged my pores around my chin.  </li>
            <li>But Nerium is one bottle full of magic.</li>
            <li>this &amp;#34;quick meeting&amp;#34; was a sales pitch on trying to get people to become brand partners with promises of ipads, Lexus, and even being able to quit your full time job.</li>
            <li>I first learned about Nerium because I noticed that my 75 year old Mother was looking more beautiful every time I saw her (which is about once or twice a month).</li>
            <li>Then I use a cotton-round moistened with warm water to remove the make-up first, then the eye make-up.</li>
            <li>Reading the comments here, this is definitely true:)</li>
            <li>It was nice when it was first applied but after 1 minute it would get sticky feeling.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best face cream I’ve ever used.</li>
            <li>It did nothing for any fine lines or wrinkles either.</li>
            <li>I still see the fine lines around my eyes and mouth.</li>
            <li>Evens skin tone, shrinks pores, gets rid of fine lines.</li>
            <li>The product had no effect on my fine lines, texture or firmness, as it claimed it would do.</li>
            <li>skin was fine and luminous, but a friend of mine insisted I give it a try, she is a Brand</li>
            <li>This product has been known to cause rashes, and the Oleander plant has way too many side effects (most including hospitalization or death) for me to be remotely interested in purchases, or working for this &amp;#34;business&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I noticed my skin filling out, fine lines disapearred.</li>
            <li>parents have used the product to reduce lines and sun spots and minimized the appearance of fine lines.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smooths condition of skin…reduces fine lines.</li>
            <li>It has cleared my complexion and is minimizing my fine lines.</li>
            <li>and I have not seen a difference with fine lines.</li>
            <li>and you will be fine.</li>
            <li>(It is fine, by the way:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I can see improvement in the fine ines and wrinkles on my forehead.</li>
            <li>The appearance of fine lines has diminished.  </li>
            <li>Some people may be fine with this product but for those of you that have an allergic reaction, look out.  </li>
            <li>Smells fine.</li>
            <li>Another thing I figured out was that you don&#x27;t need 4 pumps like they recommend because 2 pumps works just fine.</li>
            <li>and I have bags under my eyes and on my chin and have NEVER had the fine lines I have since using this product.  </li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t need to worry about fine lines and wrinkles just yet.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this works wonders for many people, but unfortunately I&#x27;m not one of them.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>This product is for helping reduce fine lines etc ...</li>
            <li>so i was woW pleasantly</li>
            <li>Amazing changes, and a hugely positive group.</li>
            <li>Ive noticed an improvement in my skin..especially helping smooth out fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li>What I have seen is that realistic people are very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>We know that good genes and a good nutrition help alot and a little botox here and there.</li>
            <li>Huge bonus...</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about 2weeks now and have noticed a huge improvement to face ,neck ,and chest.</li>
            <li>I can tell a huge difference in my skin when I tried to change from it.</li>
            <li>The results I am seeing from friends that are using it are being told by their reps what a huge difference it&#x27;s making when it&#x27;s literally nothing.  </li>
            <li>I even used it on my décolletage and notice a huge improvement with the wrinkles and look of it.</li>
            <li>Well after 3 weeks and huge sores, itchy rashed up skin</li>
            <li>, I sell Nerium on line which completely takes away your wrinkles and is the best cream ever made, may I ask how old you are</li>
            <li>and I have seen a huge difference in my face just after one week of using this product.</li>
            <li>sister in law had these huge bags under her eyes.?  </li>
            <li>I have been on it for just 30 days and see HUGE results.</li>
            <li>I even saw a huge difference in the brown spots on my face in the one application</li>
            <li>but I saw immediate and huge improvements.  </li>
            <li>My husband had a huge age spot on his cheek</li>
            <li>I do have a reaction to the day cream where if I use more than 3 pumps and no water my skin burns and turns bright red.</li>
            <li>If you actually follow the directions and use it correctly you will have great results.  </li>
            <li>A great preventative maintenance for younger people.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product for women who want to smooth their skin.</li>
            <li>Use a spray bottle to lightly mist your forehead and eyes.</li>
            <li>I had tons of product as they give you free product every time you turn around,  </li>
            <li>I received this product as a free trial</li>
            <li>the next day I look great.</li>
            <li>I will just use it when I go out for something important.</li>
            <li>and she asked to meet with me to give me a free sample of the Age Defying Night Cream.</li>
            <li>I got a sample of this item free from my sister-in-law.  </li>
            <li>I am sure these ingredients are absorbed through the skin.  </li>
            <li>Still seeing if this stuff works, but people are telling me I look younger and how great my skin looks.  </li>
            <li>I have earned my free Lexus within a year.</li>
            <li>I get my product for free every month.</li>
            <li>Also it is extremely important to take before and after photos</li>
            <li>Immediately I was bombarded by 3 people sending me private messages telling me how great this skin care product was and that I should try it myself and that I could make a career out of it.</li>
            <li>so looks are important in my career (Cosmetology).</li>
            <li>I found I was putting on the product incorrectly but found a distributor with Nerium and got fantastic results after 30 days because they taught me how to use the product correctly</li>
            <li>You get one free product for every person you bring in.</li>
            <li>Every person gets one free product for every person they bring in.</li>
            <li>My skin is firmer and my age spots are disappearing and my skin feels fabulous.  </li>
            <li>took before pictures, did a free 5 day trial, and noticed a difference already.</li>
            <li>I feels light and tightening.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see how you can sell this so cheap when the price to get it as a rep is $80.00.  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say that this product works, so much so that I decided to get into the business because it did what it said it would do.</li>
            <li>I am looking forward to the same great results that she has received.</li>
            <li>AMAZING, this really works, and I have tried everything...</li>
            <li>They gave me a free bottle</li>
            <li>My face hasn&#x27;t been this smooth since I was pre-pubescent.</li>
            <li>2) take makeup free photos before and after 30, 60, 90 days?    </li>
            <li>It is important for people to know that this product can be life threatening.</li>
            <li>product does seem to smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>I swear my 3 day tester from a representative did fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Use it to smooth out acne scars.</li>
            <li>I was given a free trial bottle to try for one week.&lt;br /&gt;From</li>
            <li>My skin is now flawless and even though I have not lost weight my face appears thinner because m skin is toned again and is firm with no sagging.  </li>
            <li>I had also at the same time experienced allergies (outdoor - mold/pollen) and had been taking allergy medicine.  </li>
            <li>and he confirmed my conclusion.</li>
            <li>you do not get the company guarentee and it has been discovered that products not sold by a brand partner have been altered even bottles filled with immation products.  </li>
            <li>The quote &amp;#34;your on Fire&amp;#34; actually works great on her agenda.</li>
            <li>You want to go cheap</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t be guaranteed that this product is the genuine thing because your buying it from a non brand partner.</li>
            <li>I can get my product for free if I buy from a brand partner?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>An ultrasound confirmed I now have thyroiditis.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on day 5 of a free trial of this product.</li>
            <li>Some deep ones around my chin were greatly diminished and the bags under my eyes were gone.</li>
            <li>It is a different way of distribution,  The good companies spend more money on product development and paying the distributors instead of warehousing and advertising.</li>
            <li>At 40 years old I want to look as good as I can</li>
            <li>What nerium is best for, for me, is smoothing upper lip lines very well.</li>
            <li>I , with good conscious , could not recommend anyone using this product.</li>
            <li>, how good does it work, how has it worked for others and if others like it as far as reviews go.</li>
            <li>&quot; in fact, I love her results so much that I got online today to find out more about the product that she is using.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I did not notice any significant difference in fine lines or wrinkles on my neck.  </li>
            <li>Go to WWW.Nerium.com for the real deal!!!</li>
            <li>and she told me that&#x27;s very rare</li>
            <li>so I feel for as much exposure as I get they look pretty good.</li>
            <li>So glad to be able to use a simple system, totally natural and botanical product with great results.</li>
            <li>I was then told that the special would no longer be available to me if I interrupted the auto delivery.</li>
            <li>So I decided to try the free for life special they had going.  </li>
            <li>This special was if you preorder the $80 night cream for 3 months you will receive their day cream free forever.  </li>
            <li>Entire family uses it, absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>The first week I noticed better texture.</li>
            <li>This miraculous product, in fact, was originally made to cure cancer.</li>
            <li>Aloe Vera extracts from the Nerium oleander plant, collecting both plants unique qualities to make NAE-8 extract.</li>
            <li>The first morning, I noticed that my face looked more youthful.  </li>
            <li>I was excited by these results</li>
            <li>My original plan was to try this for 5 days</li>
            <li>, I am pretty sure this cream is the culprit.</li>
            <li>I had some hormonal acne, which is why I originally started using Nerium.</li>
            <li>While I didn&#x27;t see a significant change in wrinkles</li>
            <li>After 1 week of treatment I saw a significant improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to try it.  </li>
            <li>but this gives me motivation that I&#x27;ll look better when that&#x27;s accomplished!  </li>
            <li>So it is obvious they are disgruntled because they weren&#x27;t successful.</li>
            <li>Another thing, if you aren&#x27;t using the product properly you will not have successful results.</li>
            <li>People have told me that I am glowing, they love my sparkle, my complexion looks so pretty.</li>
            <li>/&gt;NOT WORTH WHAT THEY CHARGE!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure the rash is some sort of fungal rash.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I was excited to use it</li>
            <li>she seemed really friendly talking about the sunglasses</li>
            <li>It is worth the money!</li>
            <li>Gotten so many compliments is not even funny.</li>
            <li>My wrinkles were significantly reduced.</li>
            <li>and yes it also takes time to build enough to be able to spend more quality time with your family!</li>
            <li>One order from a warehouse not the original product and it would not dispense.</li>
            <li>First of all I want people to realize there are many &amp;#34;Multi-Level Marketing Anti-Aging Cream Wars&amp;#34</li>
            <li>nothing they weren&#x27;t more than willing to accommodate and rectify once communication was established.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product</li>
            <li>It claims to be able to make fine lines and wrinkles disappear but doesn&#x27;t really help.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t allow the hardness of others to prevent you from experiencing a possibly great product that might work for you and make you feel a little better about yourself.  </li>
            <li>Most importantly, my oil is to a very minimum and dryness is under control.</li>
            <li>After I applied the day cream this morning, I ended up with a huge bright red rash covering my neck.  </li>
            <li>I felt more comfortable buying it straight from the source.</li>
            <li>but I love the day cream, it is a nice moisturizer without being greasy and it helps even out my skin tone, I have tried lots of skin care products and this has actually made a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>Honestly, my face feels much better after I wash it with a simple exfoliate.</li>
            <li>It feels so good when you put it on and, it really does do absolute wonders for your skin.</li>
            <li>pleasant to use, however so I did use it regularly</li>
            <li>Well one day I purchased this product because so many people around me was using it and everyone had nothing but positive things to say about it</li>
            <li>I have noticed positive changes, mostly in the décolleté area.</li>
            <li>There are many skin care products on the market suggested for certain purposes and conditions.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t sell this, so I&#x27;m writing this review purely because I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>AND THERE IS NOTHING SPECIAL ABOUT</li>
            <li>Yea, right!  </li>
            <li>but if you have achne it clears you RIGHT UP!</li>
            <li>exaggerate the outcome (especially considering the amazon reviews I have read), and perpetuate a happy lifestyle with magazines, conferences, ads, word of mouth praise, social networking advertising among friends and family, etc, when in fact something like this is not going to make someone more happy than they were before, and as such is an illusion portrayed by the media moguls and marketing cons like Jeff Olson, CEO of Nerium Int.</li>
            <li>The get rich quick nature of these schemes.</li>
            <li>rich quickly schemes</li>
            <li>Her face was swollen, her eyes were swollen shut, there were watery bags underneath her eyes and her skin was bright red!  </li>
            <li>Made my face turn bright red and the product burned after applying.  </li>
            <li>There are better things out there that really does work.</li>
            <li>I feel like the skin looks good enough to go without!</li>
            <li>My own experiences allow me to express with complete honesty the miraculous outcomes of using Nerium Ad.</li>
            <li>I used it faithfully for one full year.  </li>
            <li>I also love that my nightly routine is much shorter.</li>
            <li>,ll go back to my daily routine, honestly there are great products out there, mine is Skinmedica, but Neutrogena, Aveeno or Murad are amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>I gave it a fair shake and used it for 2 months back in August of 2012.  </li>
            <li>I began to have full blown cystic acne.  </li>
            <li>I would consider your own skin, whether it is sensitive, prone to acne, etc.</li>
            <li>This product works well when left on for 30-45 minutes and then add your moisturizer (really good one).</li>
            <li>It made perfect sense, I also told her I too found the negative review on the oleander plant</li>
            <li>I used the cream religiously every night after taking a shower from November 2011 all the way until May of 2013 (a good 18+ months).</li>
            <li>I decided to stop drinking sodas and Arizona Iced Teas, which are FULL of sugar.</li>
            <li>No way I would spend that much money on this product, it is toxic and it&#x27;s all about making money for the people at the top.</li>
            <li>While this may be true, think about what it entails and how it affects the people that are the underdogs in the business.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see what will change after using this product for a full year.</li>
            <li>I had no idea that Amazon was selling this product - I came to see it that was indeed true.</li>
            <li>It is a full on allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li>Returning it today for my full refund.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it works for others, but having used it 2 full months, correctly, no results were visible what-so-ever.</li>
            <li>After one full bottle there were no visible results.</li>
            <li>I gave the product a full 30 days to evaluate.  </li>
            <li>I have good skin and look younger than I am but do experience tone issues.  </li>
            <li>You can return the product for a full refund.</li>
            <li>and the cool thing is....</li>
            <li>and the cool thing is....</li>
            <li>so I decided to give it a full 30 day try.</li>
            <li>Many woman want to see results NOW, but don&#x27;t want to take the time to take care of the real problem.</li>
            <li>This product on my 67 year old skin that has seen many seasons of LOTS of sun, is really doing a nice job.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t drink the cool aid kids.</li>
            <li>My husband and children however have told me I look much better even though I don&#x27;t see it as much.</li>
            <li>This cream was more like a very drying mask.</li>
            <li>The full bottle I received from Blue Bell through Amazon lasted me a good 2 months.  </li>
            <li>it was exciting she was excited she showed me pics that I knew could not be changed by product alone.</li>
            <li>This to me in the end is just another marketing / get rich quick program more than a break through new</li>
            <li>My favorite night cream ever that I cannot live without!</li>
            <li>Ultimately, nothing has made me more satisfied than Nerium Ad.</li>
            <li>The effect has only gotten better and my skin looks more even-toned and &amp;#34;glowey.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>It is ok but way to much money for a months worth of product.</li>
            <li>so i noticed a change quickly.</li>
            <li>Luckily she told me to cancel my subscription because she couldn&#x27;t keep up with her account, my brother&#x27;s account, and both of my grandma&#x27;s accounts.</li>
            <li>Luckily she told me to cancel my subscription because she couldn&#x27;t keep up with her account, my brother&#x27;s account, and both of my grandma&#x27;s accounts.</li>
            <li>Also like how quickly the mask dries when I put it on at night.</li>
            <li>The product was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I did get it quickly</li>
            <li>My &amp;#34;friend&amp;#34; invited me to dinner and said she had to stop by a quick meeting for Nerium and asked if I minded coming along.</li>
            <li>The simplest thing is the quick start program.</li>
            <li>The pressure to get people signed up quickly.</li>
            <li>and if someone tries to sell you that &amp;#34;I love making my own hours and working when I want to</li>
            <li>This product is extraordinary.</li>
            <li>My favorite facial product! :)</li>
            <li>I had tremendous results.</li>
            <li>I was intimidated by the pressure to have parties and market the product without really seeing much improvement in my own skin after 2 months.</li>
            <li>Arrives quickly and never disappoints.</li>
            <li>At first it was love at first site.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Hoping to get more better result later...</li>
            <li>I love the products, my steadily growing business and the people I work with in the business.  </li>
            <li>And the other ones after reading them sound too good to be true.</li>
            <li>but we&#x27;re into being healthy and using organic, high quality products and foods.</li>
            <li>Like another reviewer said, Neutrogena&#x27;s Ageless line is better - and if you want to go a price point down from that, Walmart&#x27;s Equate line is pretty darn good too.</li>
            <li>I have stopped getting Botox because my wrinkles have improved so much I would recommend you try this quick and easy solution to your aging skin needs.......</li>
            <li>I am so happy to know that other people are noticing a difference!</li>
            <li>I am however very sensetive to strong perfume</li>
            <li>the fact they didn&#x27;t talk much about the science of the product, which my boyfriend was more interested in.</li>
            <li>(he is 18 and easily Googled some REAL information), and found that the product was made from a poisonous plant, and how it can affect your skin when the toxin is applied.</li>
            <li>overall pretty good product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easier to use than the skin care I normally use and is more cost effective than current product.  </li>
            <li>REALLY!!</li>
            <li>I feel foolish for not educating myself first, before putting it on my face!</li>
            <li>I was excited to try Nerium at first.  </li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Nerium for several months and love it, it truly works wonders!</li>
            <li>My first bottle lasted three months!</li>
            <li>but I must say that I saw immediate results after the first day!  </li>
            <li>When I received it, I used it the first night and could not use it again, because the pump on the bottle would not work!  </li>
            <li>It does make your skin feel very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really have any lines to smooth, but I do like the way it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t explain exactly, but it was like my skin looked firmer and more full, like it was in my early 20s.  </li>
            <li>How cheap the product really is when you subtract all the commissions and bonuses for all the layers of people within the MLM organization.</li>
            <li>The incredible number of negative reviews on Amazon about this product.</li>
            <li>Of course everybody is different and not everything works for everybody, but this stuff has truly been amazing.  </li>
            <li>So much for the free for life..........</li>
            <li>Do they offer that kind of money back guarantee in the salon or in the cosmetic section of the department stores?  </li>
            <li>am so glad that I am trying a sample and did not waste my money, just wish I had not tried it at all.</li>
            <li>From my own personal experience?...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth a try</li>
            <li>If you are going to seminars and they are telling you to push up good reviews and telling you your bottles are your employees to sign up more people to become agents for the company then just step back from that and think about it for a second.  </li>
            <li>This Night cream does miracles, smooth&#x27;s out my pours, relaxes the wrinkles, lightens some age spots :) makes me feel younger.</li>
            <li>(these were on my body, rarely ever my face where the cream was being applied) went away after 2 days.  </li>
            <li>Use on freshly cleaned face.  </li>
            <li>He is called the &amp;#34;millionaire-maker&amp;#34; and the money comes directly from those most in need of funds and goes to himself and his 1% in the &amp;#34;Nerium family&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Not all skin products are for everyone but this one is worth trying.</li>
            <li>I recently did some research and have learned that oleander, an ingredient in Nerium AD, is a toxic substance that can kill skin cells and it is being studied to see if it can effectively kill cancer cells.  </li>
            <li>34 year old son is also enjoying the shaving experience improved with fewer ingrown</li>
            <li>wow - I love it.  </li>
            <li>So one lady said she had over 3 months worth of product and called to complain to Nerium about her issue</li>
            <li>the success he was experiencing</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s totally worth the price</li>
            <li>I am actually 54 yrs old (lol)</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li>Protect yourself from aging with this powerful cream.</li>
            <li>I spent thousands of dollars on aestheticians trying to get my skin looking good</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products, professional products.</li>
            <li>now has skin that glows and makes her look much more alive.</li>
            <li>skin looks a lot better than some people I know who are in their early 40&#x27;s!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It honestly looked like she had been injected with red jelly all over her face!</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth a try for anyone.</li>
            <li>(smile)</li>
            <li>Worth a try.</li>
            <li>and it said it was safe for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>All these things (and there are more natural things that can go on your face like chamomile and aloe vera)</li>
            <li>I took before and after photos (after photos 14 days later) and honestly there was NO difference.  </li>
            <li>I just used finished using Nerium for 7 days and my friends at work, my husband, and my 13 and 16 year old sons said my skin looks better.  </li>
            <li>Better to go directly through Nerium.</li>
            <li>The pictures were taken on my own iPhone and never left my possession</li>
            <li>This allows you to get 6-8 weeks worth versus just 4.  </li>
            <li>I recommended it to my 76 year old mother who has many wrinkles from years of smoking.</li>
            <li>(only laser does that effectively)</li>
            <li>and I think this product is worth you giving it a try.  </li>
            <li>One thing is for sure you can tell it is a natural product</li>
            <li>It is not what I was hoping for but still the tightness and increase in skin elasticity is better than anything I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>In fact, hyaluronic acid has been promoted as a &amp;#34;fountain of youth.&amp;#34; Its the only known ingredient to man that will hold up to 1000 times its own weight in water....</li>
            <li>-IN-LAW came down to visit my mom AT OUR HOUSE, BEFORE she became successful or knew her story, to help build her business.</li>
            <li>The only people that got rich were those at the top of the pyramid.  </li>
            <li>Super fast shipping (to Guam)!</li>
            <li>This company chooses the relationship marketing for this product for that very reason and if I was the founder of this amazing product I would have it no other way.  </li>
            <li>This was not exactly what I wanted, but it is good.</li>
            <li>night I cleanse my face with neutrogena original bar soap and gently exfoliate with a washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shipped fast, sealed in original container</li>
            <li>This company sends too much product and is not user friendly.</li>
            <li>helps with wrinkle, but you have to keep using it every night to have it work right</li>
            <li>I was given a bottle of Nerium AD Age Defying Night Cream and used it and could tell right off that it wasn&#x27;t going to work for me.</li>
            <li>Right off the bat</li>
            <li>The head brand partner looked like she had a bunch of botox done on her, and I knew right away that this was a pyramid scheme by the way they were presenting the rewards program and</li>
            <li>We were pressured right then and there to sign up, and my mom paid for us to sign up</li>
            <li>I canceled the order right away.  </li>
            <li>Right now all I can say is</li>
            <li>I eagerly await a civil response to my efforts to recoup my investment, and hope they can find a way to do the right thing.</li>
            <li>you can feel it working right after you put it on.</li>
            <li>So that right there tells me</li>
            <li>Your price was right for me.  </li>
            <li>Just normal ageing skin, including the fine lines and loss of elasticity.</li>
            <li>she barely looks in her early 30&#x27;s, although she&#x27;s taken good care of her skin for decades (she just turned 48).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m proud to say I have minimal fine line wrinkles at the corner of my left eye and none on my right.</li>
            <li>I used it for 5 days as a free trial last month and didn&#x27;t really notice much but liked the way it felt on my face.</li>
            <li>For sure iis not worthy the 157 $, Product for sure do not deliver what promised by seller.</li>
            <li>but my skin looks smooth and nice with less notice</li>
            <li>Not only I, but many friends as well, have seen tremendous results using this product.</li>
            <li>Taking the risk to look past the skepticism of the marketing side of the product was a wonderful decision, as I found that the claims, of Nerium Ad doing miracles far beyond its guarantee, were very much true.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I still have laugh lines, which I don&#x27;t really mind yet, but my skin CRAVES nerium!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why there is all this negativity posted, it&#x27;s great stuff.</li>
            <li>The sales representative takes these &amp;#34;before/after&amp;#34; pictures that show remarkable results in just a few weeks.</li>
            <li>Report them to their attorney general of their state and better business bureau.</li>
            <li>That isn&#x27;t true really.  </li>
            <li>Almost all of the dark areas are gone now and my skin looks really good.  </li>
            <li>Our new anti aging product for the brain EHT is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I did not jump right into selling it because I had to see results first and truly believe in it 100% before I could sell it...</li>
            <li>No single thing is THAT much better than anything</li>
            <li>know two people that received their Lexus vehicles plus bonus (Nerium incentives) and host many parties at their house, mainly to help out brand partners sign up new customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have good skin, but it is sensitive and prone to breakouts (especially on my forehead).  </li>
            <li>much and don&#x27;t deliver the same kind of results this product does.</li>
            <li>Although this helped smooth out my skin and help with some blackheads, I have a feeling that&#x27;s because I was being more careful about my face washing.</li>
            <li>Renee is the co-owner and their website says, \\&quot;her generous and compassionate heart is appreciated by all who work with her.\\&quot; I can tell you straight up that this is a huge lie.</li>
            <li>Half loved it</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s been in the hot sun, if it&#x27;s full, or if it&#x27;s the real deal.  </li>
            <li>I read most of the reviews, negatives and positives, it really sucks that this amazing product didn&#x27;t work on them.  </li>
            <li>and yes I do have sensitive skin, However there should be a strong warning for anyone using this product.  </li>
            <li>The wrinkles are very much still here.</li>
            <li>I like it very much and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>The MLM network - the way that this company works is to maximize savings in advertising by promising anyone willing to do the yee old pyramid scheme style marketing act that they can somehow make a decent and quick buck, perhaps alot more.</li>
            <li>Let me tell you something really quick, this product works and the only people I know that haven&#x27;t liked it, are people who expect every wrinkle to vanish, but lets also be clear, this isn&#x27;t botox</li>
            <li>fine wrinkles on my 59 year old face and neck.</li>
            <li>When I first tried the product it left me skin very smooth.</li>
            <li>It was really quite funny!  </li>
            <li>A little over priced, but it lasts a good while.</li>
            <li>But in all honesty, it is better to order from a Brand Partner to ensure you receive a Guaranteed 30 Day Money Back Guarantee.</li>
            <li>I was told to give it more time and not only did they swear it would work, but the auto-delivery discount would kick in</li>
            <li>Followed the instructions exactly and as suggested, took photographs every month to document my progress...</li>
            <li>I did a cleanse after that, and am glad I didn&#x27;t spend all the money to buy the actual product.  </li>
            <li>The first ingredient in their product is Oleander, a 100% poisonous plant.  </li>
            <li>should have done my research first, but it was coming from a friend</li>
            <li>Someone could easily empty it out and replace it with another kind of skin lotion.</li>
            <li>(I used way too much product in the beginning!</li>
            <li>;) Now I know better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>With avid studies, researchers, including Dr. Robert A. Newman, found ways to produce this miraculous product safely allowing the use of it topically and assuring no harm if accidentally ingested.</li>
            <li>Love your friends and family even if they annoy you by constantly trying to get you to sign up as a company agent.  </li>
            <li>For the first time in 33 years, I have clear, smooth skin-</li>
            <li>Really, really works!</li>
            <li>Besides the smell, my burning and itching eyes and the POISONOUS ingredients, it also costs WAY more money than I would EVER spend on facial products.</li>
            <li>I would definitely order more when this is finished.</li>
            <li>If I had actually had the product for more than 4 days, even up to 30 days and had goneover the time limit for the money back guarantee, sure, by all means, hold up the policy.</li>
            <li>It has definitely made my skin look better and reduced winkles.</li>
            <li>saw a difference after the first use.</li>
            <li>When I first started using Nerium</li>
            <li>After 4 months I began having pretty severe bags under my eyes along with some swelling around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>The change didn&#x27;t happen over night, just like no product but the first week I saw progress and about 4 months</li>
            <li>My first bottle of Nerium was purchased from a partner seller from Nerium</li>
            <li>Skin is smooth (but my old moisturizer did that too).  </li>
            <li>I used consistently for a while</li>
            <li>Im not even remotely interested in the business end of it, or the pryamid part of it.</li>
            <li>When you wash it off in the morning, your face is smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>The first morning after applying the cream I woke with my face feeling like it had plastic wrap pressed to it.</li>
            <li>they are pleased with enough to keep purchasing.  </li>
            <li>30 day money back guarantee, we felt confident in giving it a try.  </li>
            <li>I am confident all 250 five stars reviews were left by marketing reps</li>
            <li>rare for any real product...</li>
            <li>I hope this review helps some worried first timer.  </li>
            <li>I love the way my face feels the next morning after I rinse off the mask.  </li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t willing to properly research and will believe the first thing your eyes ponder upon, its no wonder so many people are so mislead.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t love it after 25 days, call nerium and tell them youwant your money back!</li>
            <li>I am not an avid review-writer, but have to share my Nerium experience.</li>
            <li>I noticed the last two days that my skin was feeling pretty warm after application, but didn&#x27;t really think much of it.  </li>
            <li>, I just want to look in the mirror and feel like my entire face is more nourished looking and lines aren&#x27;t so noticeable.</li>
            <li>I only started a week ago but already fell in love with this.</li>
            <li>at first her rosacea flared up, and all she could think was &amp;</li>
            <li>I believe in nerium, for me personally it has evened out my skin tone, shrank my pores, and has given my skin a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t like the smell at first but got use to it.</li>
            <li>The product seems to be working pretty good so far although I haven&#x27;t been using it for long.</li>
            <li>Skin appears younger and more radiant.</li>
            <li>and my skin tone is much more even with smaller pores.  </li>
            <li>It is quite funny to me that there are two kinds of reviews on here about this product.</li>
            <li>It could simply be that I&#x27;m taking better care of my skin now -- I was never in the habit of washing my face before bed before I started using Nerium.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough about this product! :)</li>
            <li>first use</li>
            <li>, what exactly it was.</li>
            <li>Many have posted of such occurances yet the company will always hold its motto of user friendliness.</li>
            <li>I wish I could retract my first review.</li>
            <li>If anyone out there knows of something that REALLY works, please advise!  </li>
            <li>it looked like i had been scalded with hot water</li>
            <li>Now, first of all if you do get involved</li>
            <li>Funny, these people say they have time freedom but want you on calls and events every week on evenings and weekends,...</li>
            <li>the first time i got this item</li>
            <li>i felt it was great thick.  </li>
            <li>Most of my friends spend about the same price on facials, nails, hair, etc.</li>
            <li>the shake smells EXACTLY like this product.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sure you won&#x27;t go back!</li>
            <li>Within first month of using Nerium 80% of my issues cleared up.</li>
            <li>my 21 year old...doesn&#x27;t use it consistently.  </li>
            <li>but I recommend it to anyone even slightly interested.</li>
            <li>(perhaps the results that she has seen have occurred over time, and with consistent use).</li>
            <li>Smells funny?</li>
            <li>At first I did see changes in my skin, got rid of a lot of Sun damage.</li>
            <li>prompt response product exactly what specified.</li>
            <li>Please make sure you have the correct instructions/information prior to posting a review.    </li>
            <li>This really works!</li>
            <li>I started using it the first week of January.</li>
            <li>I dampen face &amp; hands first with water, then one pump of product spreads on face &amp; neck, remaining on hands and arms.  </li>
            <li>these photos are not fake.</li>
            <li>The owners are millionaires who think that the world revolves around them and are willing to trample on and chew up anyone who comes in their way.</li>
            <li>I was really hopeful!  </li>
            <li>Cleared my breakouts and overall texture was better.</li>
            <li>This is the first bottle I purchased of the night cream.  </li>
            <li>When I first started the night cream, I did not like the scent and my skin</li>
            <li>I was made aware of it from a friend who bought into this</li>
            <li>I literally could not leave this on my face for more than ten minutes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been taught to recognize a pyramid scheme - and this is exactly how it works.</li>
            <li>I am still on my first one.</li>
            <li>It feels very healing!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s most likely a scam.</li>
            <li>It burned the first time I wiped it on.  </li>
            <li>I saw the results on the person I bought it from first.</li>
            <li>I planned to stop using it at the first sign of redness.</li>
            <li>they are REAL caring people and WANT to meet you!</li>
            <li>they are REAL caring people and WANT to meet you!</li>
            <li>so I know they are the real deal!</li>
            <li>Going back to what I have used for 8 years and LOVE...</li>
            <li>and I havnt noticed a visible improvement after consistent use.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the day cream in about 2 weeks because I forgot to order more, and my skin just doesn&#x27;t look the same.</li>
            <li>It arrived as sceduled and it was exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>I am 74 and did not think anything would help me at this age, but this is the first product I have tried that does help.</li>
            <li>Why go and listen to a person who obviously didn&#x27;t apply themselves and has to put blame somewhere else to feel better about themselves.</li>
            <li>Wow and if your still thinking cheap?</li>
            <li>I gave it to her and told her to try it first and not spend her money on it.  </li>
            <li>I think we all hope that we have found something that finally is able to help us look younger.</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews but after reading so much nonsense</li>
            <li>(Please...ladies let&#x27;s be real!)  </li>
            <li>I know many people currently using the product and those that have tried it for a shorter time and not one has shared the outrage I read here.</li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s skin is different and there may be a lot of folks who took better care of their skin than I did.</li>
            <li>and it was pretty pricey.  </li>
            <li>a few days ago I have really good skin,</li>
            <li>some good AHA (alpha hydroxy acid) cream to speed up sloughing of dead skins cells and brown spots.   </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t see results in that first 30 days you have to \\&quot;keep using it, give it a chance, it will work!!\\&quot;  The VAST majority of people will be able to achieve similar results with a good over the counter cream at a fraction of the price...especially those who do not regularly use a face cream right now.  </li>
            <li>I read so many reviews and just didn&#x27;t get enough positive feed back to feel confident in what it would do.</li>
            <li>Then mist our cheeks, chin and neck, administer one more pump and swiftly smooth it on the lower half of your face and neck.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, however, I will most likely purchase another bottle of Nerium in the hopes of seeing positive results.  </li>
            <li>Any BP who receives their kit in the mail is surely going to open these items and look at them, especially since they&#x27;re excited about going into business!  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for a few year and my skin looks great for a 72 year old!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t sell this stuff, nor am I interested in marketing, I just want to give my positive unbiased feedback.</li>
            <li>The first week I noticed positive results.</li>
            <li>My skin was bright red and burning almost instantly.</li>
            <li>Though, can you imagine tackling most issues with one product; one product that actually makes a real difference?</li>
            <li>those of you unaware Nerium is the latest economic evolution of multi-level marketing (MLM).</li>
            <li>Thanks recent San Jose &#x27;leadership weekend&#x27; designed to get more punters in the MLM downline.  </li>
            <li>I have read so many negative reviews, most come from</li>
            <li>I am in my mid 60&#x27;s but have had cosmetic surgery and look a good 10 to 12 years younger than I am</li>
            <li>Also noticed on some of the pictures of before and after, the people after, have their necks stretched up higher than the before pictures, would account for the neck looking better.</li>
            <li>I became a Brand Partner back in June of last year at the urging of a good friend of mine, who lives in California.  </li>
            <li>very drying to my wife&#x27;s skin, actually seemed  more wrinkled, though did tend to decrease brown spots.</li>
            <li>Beware the positive reviews are written by</li>
            <li>Get positive comments all the time.</li>
            <li>I have dark spots from sun damage and they are noticeably fading and my skin feels amazing.  </li>
            <li>Nerium works for me by fading minor sunspots (including on the top of my hands)</li>
            <li>That being said, playing devil&#x27;s advocate, even if the product were to work exactly as advertised there is no mistake in its business model and the real company&#x27;s goals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>First of all it&#x27;s a bunch of pushy multi-level marketing fools that have zero clue about skin care trying to make a fast buck.</li>
            <li>the counterfeit is probably at least as effective as Nerium so who cares!  </li>
            <li>really like it  interested in another order</li>
            <li>Fast forward to today, a month since I have used Nerium and my neck, shoulders, arms and torso are all still covered with a very itchy rash!</li>
            <li>I have been using a year now &amp; all my issues are pretty much gone.</li>
            <li>I have found several other products that work great.</li>
            <li>It seems to be old and the bottle does not appear to be full.</li>
            <li>I have been using Nerium  for approximately 6 months - it has been good to my 59 yr old face :)</li>
            <li>I can say that while it is on, your face feels tight and looks better ( but you wouldn&#x27;t wear it out!).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different lines of both high end and drugstore products.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This prompted me to do some more research, and I found many other people that had similar symptoms.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many other creams, most have numerous \\&quot;steps\\&quot; (serum, toner, cream, something for eyes...) &amp; cost hundreds of dollars.</li>
            <li>This product was okay, I have used  other products that were similar in price for better results for my combination skin.</li>
            <li>Daily sun screen, hydration, healthy diet, and other modalities (laser, peels, Botox) work better.</li>
            <li>I am very excited to confess that Nerium Ad has not only tackled those main concerns, but I also almost never get severe breakouts.</li>
            <li>But imagine all the free advertising they get from you posting on FB and social media.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping it would reduce my pore size, get rid of my mild adult acne and diminish the hyper pigmentation on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>Also, the trick to using it - make sure your skin is still damp when you put it on or it won&#x27;t work at all except to dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>The carriers selling this product on sites like Amazon and the like might be trying to exploit certain loop-holes to make a profit on direct-selling to customers.</li>
            <li>I certainly don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m too smart to believe that sales pitch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!!  </li>
            <li>I read so many reviews here thinking I can get an idea in which I could get this product for cheaper and only found comments that made it clear I have to buy from a brand partner to get the real thing!</li>
            <li>Would love a new bottle or money back!!</li>
            <li>This cream has definitely shrunk my pores and has diminished my fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve had scars from acne for years and this product is the first one that is making them get smaller, so it&#x27;s totally worth it for me!</li>
            <li>I wanted to use to help fight against my fine lines and pores and not only did it help minimize that</li>
            <li>sure the money sounded so appealing but seeing those dollar signs first before you actually see any results will get you into so much trouble if you don&#x27;t believe in it whole heartedly.  </li>
            <li>A friend recommended it the same week i started to see fine lines in my skin .</li>
            <li>I started seeing my skin going back to the fine lines</li>
            <li>Again I was mad at my son when he first approached me with this product, but it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used on my skin!  </li>
            <li>The Journal articles are mainly on how to treat POISONINGS from this plant!</li>
            <li>The $700 serum I tried broke me out and did nothing to improve the look of my skin and this came from a very high end (sold in exclusive spas) brand.  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say, I became a brand partner a little over a year ago.</li>
            <li>got my clean skin back ;)</li>
            <li>I went to a Nerium party, and saw before and after pictures of real live people, who were at the party.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a lot of corporation hype that comes with this product, like they just found out being nice to each other was a new thing</li>
            <li>and he told me that in some people it WILL work great for a LIMITED time due to the fact that the oleander tends to cause inflammation.</li>
            <li>I started using it, took a night or two to get used to the smell, but it&#x27;s been a few months and my skin looks and feels amazing.</li>
            <li>Personally, I couldn&#x27;t tell a huge difference when I was using the Day Cream too.</li>
            <li>My pores seem to look cleaner and smaller which is huge plus.  </li>
            <li>Happy I only wasted $100.00</li>
            <li>; You want to see real results, but don&#x27;t want to make the real commitment to buying the real thing.</li>
            <li>It has not erased my wrinkles around my eyes, but let&#x27;s be real there is no miracle cream that does that.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Bottles don&#x27;t have as much cream as they did two years ago</li>
            <li>I use BB Cream and find that the day cream and bb cream combo is just too much moisture for my skin type.</li>
            <li>Nothing has changed really</li>
            <li>Over priced network marketing company representatives selling their free supplies to get back their investment because it does not work as advertised.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see much difference on wrinkles</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really have any wrinkles to begin with.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- Wash your face before bed with a gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li>(I did wash my face because it gets very oily</li>
            <li>Not sit on my couch and hope the whole world just comes to me to buy this product.</li>
            <li>I used the whole bottle as directed and just did not see the results that everyone else had.</li>
            <li>Hips, Breast, and Butt were smooth as butter  prior to Nerium AD/FIRM usage</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so so not that much in the bottle</li>
            <li>I also did my research intensely as YOU should.</li>
            <li>I was very concerned about Oleander being \\&quot;toxic\\&quot;</li>
            <li>; someone who wants a Lexus.</li>
            <li>Just since starting with this product, I have become comfortable not putting makeup on immediately after I wash my face.</li>
            <li>Probably wouldn&#x27;t be worth the money if not what it does to clear up my acne by using it each night.</li>
            <li>so I can order when I am ready rather than pile up extras on a subscription with a company rep.</li>
            <li>I have been using Nerium AD for eight months now and really like it.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and will&lt;br /&gt;continue</li>
            <li>I really like this product and see the difference in my skin....</li>
            <li>I was really hoping it would help with my &amp;#34;turkey neck&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to share my story because there isn&#x27;t much on the internet regarding this product and latex allergies/sensitivities.  </li>
            <li>If you are having an allergic reaction and are using this product, you really should stop using it and everything else that might have come in contact with it.</li>
            <li>As to my &amp;#34;results&amp;#34; the lines around my nose and mouth are not as noticeable, but the rest of my face really shows no improvement.</li>
            <li>to which I told her my skin has never broken out and I have tried hundreds of products.</li>
            <li>I definitely saw improvement in the texture of my skin after 10 days--which is the time frame they allow you a free trial.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to believe in the product and sell the product.  </li>
            <li>but it did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING for me...</li>
            <li>The real money is in the &amp;#34;brand partner&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>She said it&#x27;s very bio reactive</li>
            <li>I really wanted the results everyone else got.</li>
            <li>I have never found any creme that really worked.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very disappoint and distress by all this.</li>
            <li>To pay off my vehicle and credit card much faster.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>What turned me off to this product isn&#x27;t even the product itself, which is lackluster and disappointing at best.  </li>
            <li>waaaaaay too much make up on.</li>
            <li>you can see i am a real person...</li>
            <li>, why would a company invest so much money using a plant that is completly toxic.</li>
            <li>if you want to purchase from a real Brand partner and not one from Amazon go to [...].</li>
            <li>Haven seen much results yet.&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
            <li>I am a whole hearted believer in this product.</li>
            <li>The REAL reviews with 1-2 stars that show that this product is ineffective and 2)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just a customer that is very satisfy with the results</li>
            <li>I tried it as directed for two weeks straight and saw no difference, and I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore.  </li>
            <li>I asked a friend who kept promoting Nerium and posting how much he was making money and</li>
            <li>It just isn&#x27;t ethical if you think about it.</li>
            <li>and Prepaid Legal (it may ring a bell).&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>but I won&#x27;t be buying stock in said company if they ever to decide to become a real one.</li>
            <li>very pasty didn&#x27;t absorb well.</li>
            <li>Bottom line, if they really cared about their relationships with people, they wouldn&#x27;t push this stuff on others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The anti-aging claim - really can&#x27;t be proven.</li>
            <li>So, during the fast start qualifying program, one product is being given away for every person who signs on to buy the product.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t have wrinkles)</li>
            <li>and I said really????</li>
            <li>I really expected much more for the price</li>
            <li>I really wanted it to work.  </li>
            <li>Also, the product smells very offensive.  </li>
            <li>I really wish people would realize not every product out on the market will work for them.</li>
            <li>is that it spreads really well</li>
            <li>and it dries up really fast.</li>
            <li>I really like this night cream, if you have not used this cream you need to try it</li>
            <li>Very upset I got the bottle today</li>
            <li>She was raving about it so much that I wanted to believe her and give it a try.  </li>
            <li>Hahaha...</li>
            <li>Really does work.</li>
            <li>Nerium is only legally available through a representative in the Nerium Company.  </li>
            <li>Hyaluronic Acid (although it sounds intense) is a proven agent in decreasing the lines and texture of your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>none of this was really promised</li>
            <li>not that much.  </li>
            <li>I was fortunate enough to buy from amazon for about 60.00, Used the product for about two months, nothing!</li>
            <li>I think the stuff really works...</li>
            <li>I use it every night and you can really tell the difference after a week or so.</li>
            <li>You should look at why MLMs can never equalize into profitability the way companies in the real world can, so that the result will be that the organization as a whole cannot, even in theory, be profitable.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see much change.</li>
            <li>Stinky and very drying  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin, it has helped soooo much.</li>
            <li>The last week of January I went to a meeting and one of my friends said, \\&quot;your face is so light</li>
            <li>and I really like it and can tell a difference ,</li>
            <li>Anyway, that aside I just don&#x27;t see any real results.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t dislike the smell although it is unusual.</li>
            <li>And then...well,  I don&#x27;t really encourage anyone to expect results from it.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and price was resonable compared to what it sells for through a distributor.  </li>
            <li>and it looked promising.  </li>
            <li>However, my wife and I both tried it and had absolutely zero results.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the stickiness of this and really couldn&#x27;t tell that it made much difference.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was very upset because Amazon allow this happen and fool customers.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>If you want something very moisturizing this probably isn&#x27;t for you</li>
            <li>I only tried it because a friend of mine is a brand partner and gave me a bottle for free.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll continue to try to find it for as cheap as possible and use it!  </li>
            <li>I do not see much on my vertical lip lines or crows feet yet</li>
            <li>It is very drying and makes my skin look dehydrated.  </li>
            <li>It really works.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really did nothing for me.</li>
            <li>and my neck is much firmer since using this.</li>
            <li>I really did.  </li>
            <li>but I really was hoping to get rid of age spots.</li>
            <li>I found this very coercive.</li>
            <li>I started using this because a friend of my daughter&#x27;s was really bragging about it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very concentrated</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>THE DAY CREAM REALLY DO TAKE 10 YEARS OFF YOUR FACE IN A YEAR.</li>
            <li>It gives real results to real people like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can do research yourself on how the antioxidant is removed from the plant and all the legal documents on it being a scientifically proven antioxidant, you can even do research on the oleander farms and visit them!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a healthy pink now.</li>
            <li>I get my day cream and night cream for free because several of my friends are using it now as well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very drying  </li>
            <li>I also believe it is a pyramid scheme as my esthetician wants me to sell it.  </li>
            <li>I used it for two weeks straight even though I dreaded it every night, but then the pump stopped working</li>
            <li>and I absolutely did not believe the product would work.  </li>
            <li>Now thanks to Nerium</li>
            <li>i wish i could get use to the smell to see how well it worked, but it&#x27;s just to much.  </li>
            <li>it has a very industrial stench.</li>
            <li>Maybe the product did stop working for her, well then just state the real facts.</li>
            <li>I have to ask did she really use it every night and day?</li>
            <li>&#x27;s be straight here</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like going to China and buying the off brand instead of going to Macy&#x27;s and buying the real thing.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t buy the real thing how can you place judgement on any product that you haven&#x27;t given a real chance to?</li>
            <li>I was really hoping after all of the reviews that this would be the answer.</li>
            <li>My friend who was still selling nerium, and doing very well</li>
            <li>I used this for a month and really saw nothing.</li>
            <li>It worked really well for me.</li>
            <li>This product really works shrinks pores, softens skin etc.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>and she has been using it very sparingly (2 pumps instead of the recommended 5) for 5 months.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really want to use it, but when she asked, I opened it and applied it.</li>
            <li>(in short free radicals cause oxidative damage)</li>
            <li>My friend lent me this product to try for a few days and after 3 days I decided to purchase my own.  </li>
            <li>Cant say anything about the wrinkles - did not have many before, and it seems the same now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oleander has been used in natural medicine for centuries, throughout the world.</li>
            <li>asked to speak to a supervisor, still waiting for him to call me back, it&#x27;s been more than 5.5 hours so far, and it&#x27;s after 5 pm, so</li>
            <li>DO NOT waste your money, PLEASE!!!</li>
            <li>But I think the early improvement is better than what you get with most skin creams and about the same as with other alpha-hydroxy acids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t seem right, and I wondered if it was old.</li>
            <li>To make matters worse, have you noticed that most of the Nerium users have inflamed and irritated looking eyes!!   </li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and smooth, those fine lines and wrinkles are definitely less defined</li>
            <li>Making sure your face and hands are damp, apply 3 pumps to face, neck, and chest (or any other problem areas).</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Brand Partners\\&quot; if anyone has ever been familiar with Amway this is about the same.</li>
            <li>While there are other products out there that work just as well, I am pleased with the results of this product.  </li>
            <li>No side affects which I have experiences with many other products.</li>
            <li>My skin has been looking pretty good the last few days.  </li>
            <li>Cost - there are many other skin care products that will satisfy skin condition without being over 100 dollars a month.</li>
            <li>I use the extra on my arms at night and the crepiness has reduced significantly.  </li>
            <li>Just like so many other things in life.</li>
            <li>I feel people should have realistic expectations when embarking on a product that entails of dishing out some real money &amp;#62;50$.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Before my face was red and bumpy now it is a normal color and smooth.</li>
            <li>I am a Prime member and decided to pay extra money to get this and after waiting for a full whole day was told that it isn&#x27;t going to arrive.</li>
            <li>Mainly because the first ones I read were negative and that just wasn&#x27;t what I had experienced personally.</li>
            <li>and now I look like hot mess for supporting a friend, as we continue to work undoing the damage supernaturally, by God’s grace, as nothing seems to be working since applying Nerium to my skin on 10/18/2014!!!!</li>
            <li>I actually fell in love with the product so much that I became a brandpartner, so I could get the product for free (80$ a month is a little steep for a college-girl)</li>
            <li>Ok, why not right?</li>
            <li>We trust ourselves and if we have created our own mess by signing on the dotted line, then we will deceive ourselves that it is still a good deal far after we have realized deep down that it isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Not sure who is getting amazing results?</li>
            <li>This product is truly indefensible in my opinion and not worth the price for vanity.wanted to be supportive.  </li>
            <li>I am 58 with pretty youthful skin(I&#x27;ve stayed out of the sun since I was in my early 20&#x27;s)</li>
            <li>After my testimony of my own experiences, my observation of others, and factual information I have provided, it should be clear that such a skin care is, in fact, possible.</li>
            <li>Honestly, after 10 days it gets no better.  </li>
            <li>First off, I do not sell this product nor will I ever because I am one busy ass photojournalist.  </li>
            <li>I am 61 years old and this product smoothed away wrinkles exactly like the advertisement said.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried probably most brands out there that claims to fade dark spots.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really funny that people like sillygirl asks a &amp;#34;doctor&amp;#34; who does &amp;#34;botox&amp;#34; for advice on a natural cream.</li>
            <li>Many people try to scrimp on product and it&#x27;s just not worth it.  </li>
            <li>I presume at this point and its a get rich quick scheme based on 1000&#x27;s of little underdogs selling it to friends or family, etc etc.</li>
            <li>What I&#x27;m not willing to accept is being told that, because my original UNUSED Brand Partner kit had the plastic shrink-wrap removed, none of this would be eligible for any refund!  </li>
            <li>I do think you have to be careful to put on a good moisturizer after you wash this product off, it leaves your face very dry.</li>
            <li>What a waste of my money, PLUS more new wrinkles!!</li>
            <li>I think there are better items for the little amount for to much with no results.</li>
            <li>It really does live up to its hype.</li>
            <li>However after a couple days of use and using absolutely nothing new</li>
            <li>I notice some slight reduction in wrinkles, but believe I will see more.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure their rave reviews are slightly slanted.</li>
            <li>everything I&#x27;ve tried previously over the years had, so surely this would too.  </li>
            <li>FYI, one of the main ingredients is Oleander Leaf Extract which is poisonous to humans.</li>
            <li>It is a skin cream and people should be realistic with their expectations.  </li>
            <li>My sun skin discoloration disappeared for the first 2 weeks using the creams, after that they came back, those first 2 weeks</li>
            <li>/&gt;After running out of friends and family to sign up, she has constantly been going to Nerium meet-ups, and most recently, a convention of sorts.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After running out of friends and family to sign up, she has constantly been going to Nerium meet-ups, and most recently, a convention of sorts.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t have to be older to use this product, you can start now.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re all getting older and will eventually die, but appeal to our vanity</li>
            <li>I have used many, many name brand cremes over the years&lt;br /&gt;and have never experienced the results I have from Nerium!</li>
            <li>I also noticed that after a couple days my face, particularly around my eyes, appeared puffy.</li>
            <li>we all so super postivive changes, just in different ways.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure why, but she kept looking younger and younger.</li>
            <li>for sure I noticed smaller pores, and just younger looking skin.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of skin products and this one does make your skin look better, younger (for me), smaller pores.</li>
            <li>I went a month with my skin starting to get red and yucky again and have just ordered more.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any one particular product that I use to &amp;#34;stay young&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>About a year later, I noticed my skin was starting to breakout a lot more</li>
            <li>realistically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 52 and had moderate sagging around my mouth neck eyes and mild sun damage resulting in crow&#x27;s feet and scaly cheeks.</li>
            <li>That kind of death causes inflammation and wide variety of cellular stresses such as UV and ionizing radiation and heat</li>
            <li>It is a HUGE red flag when there are nearly as many 5 stars as there are 1 stars, and very little in between.</li>
            <li>Had done absolutely nothing for my fine lines or any other type of wrinkling.</li>
            <li>i kind of liked my LONG expensive routine..</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It was so high pressure for a product I had used for 7 days.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend avoiding it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to improve their skin.</li>
            <li>High prices and feels like you are putting on a mask.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend that you give it a try and see for yourself what Nerium can do for you...</li>
            <li>High pressure sales, no thank you.</li>
            <li>My skin has always been high priority to me</li>
            <li>I can also say that it has replaced my high priced clutter of a 20min.</li>
            <li>This product is highly advertised to remove or improve lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>Internet research shows this is derived from the oleander plant, which is highly toxic.</li>
            <li>By May of 2013, I got tired of using the cream because I wasn&#x27;t seeing any &amp;#34;real results.&amp;#34; I decided that there must be some other reasons why my skin was not the best it could be.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think anyone will die by using this cream that actually hasn&#x27;t been FDA approved, but there&#x27;s reason to do your own due diligence in case anyone decides they might want to try it.</li>
            <li>– I’m a healthy 32 year old woman with no skin allergies or skin issues (other than the beginnings of aging).</li>
            <li>The first bottle of night cream that came in the mail was a darker color and didn&#x27;t dry right.  </li>
            <li>The product is a little costly, however, when it comes to your face you should pay top dollar for an item that brings results.</li>
            <li>I need a little more time to check it out.</li>
            <li>You can only get the real Nerium AD from a Brand Partner!!</li>
            <li>Just because a 100 dollar product works for me does not mean it will work for everyone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also read complaints about it being sticky but that is because you have to apply it to damp skin (or make sure your hands are a little damp).  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money!!  </li>
            <li>I eat clean and drink water AND consulted a medical professional.</li>
            <li>In the first few months I notice the fine lines disappearing and my skin tightening which is a miracle at age 52.  </li>
            <li>My wife used Nerium for three weeks so far, and the improvement is very noticable.</li>
            <li>So far I have used product for almost a month and really like it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised nobody is taking this Nerium AD to a legal court.</li>
            <li>(At my age, I really don&#x27;t think it was the three year old dress</li>
            <li>I always laugh when I see the commercial about the &amp;#34;graveyard of face creams&amp;#34; cuz I&#x27;m that woman.</li>
            <li>The firm cream is nothing more than lotion.</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying that I have a normal skin care regimen and am no stranger to spending money on my face creams.  </li>
            <li>I normally avoid latex gloves and condom because they can irritate me, but I&#x27;ve never had swelling or hives because of it.  </li>
            <li>I was told this is normal because it&#x27;s cleaning out my pores.  </li>
            <li>EKG was normal.  </li>
            <li>i am just a normal amazon shopper i review the products i use ...</li>
            <li>A few individuals at the top are making A LOT OF MONEY while their &amp;#34;minions&amp;#34; build &amp;#34;teams&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Its either people giving it 5 stars promoting it because they need more people under them selling it to make money, or its people giving it 1 star because it dried out their skin, puffed up their eyes, gave them a rash or acne, or did nothing.</li>
            <li>There just isn&#x27;t reason to spend so much on skin care anyways, our country has gotten out of control in what satisfies them or others, it just isn&#x27;t worth the cost in the long run.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I think I need to voice my opinion because so many women out there will try this product and spend what I spend ($130 for both) and feel like they wasted their money like I do.  </li>
            <li>I used to make these green healthy shakes where I blend celery spinach carrots and kale</li>
            <li>And everyday my skin is getting prettier and better.</li>
            <li>Why do people agree to let marketers display them in a way they wouldn&#x27;t want their friends and co-workers to see on a normal day???</li>
            <li>Two of my good friends love this so probably worth trying but for me, I hated the texture and smell of this</li>
            <li>I normally use La Mer, I&#x27;ll be sticking with that.  </li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t post reviews</li>
            <li>Overall, this product is worth the money.</li>
            <li>one more round</li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing after almost 6 months of consistent, regular use.  </li>
            <li>My hormones and electrolytes were normal.</li>
            <li>my thyroid function is normal my thyroid was enlarged.</li>
            <li>Ive been using Nerium for a few years now and love it.  </li>
            <li>I took a good look at the science behind Nerium</li>
            <li>Although, if you live and die on others negative opinions and not try anything on your own then</li>
            <li>Used entire bottle and nothing but what appeared to be more lines and dry skin.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I can get the same results using a low-medium level retin-A product which costs a lot less.  </li>
            <li>i experience a purging period in my skin, its normal, our skin is acclimating to a new product, any skin care expert will tell you that.</li>
            <li>People dont pay $80-$110, monthly, for a single product.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe on alcohol, dinner, video games, private gyms because in our minds we get more for our money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So my hunch was right this product seems like one of those total scam things.</li>
            <li>Your absolutely right every product isn&#x27;t for everyone, but it is for someone obviously!</li>
            <li>By the 3rd day, I was starting to notice that my skin looked a little brighter and more smooth.  </li>
            <li>If I continue being happily surprised with this, I might look in to becoming a rep to get it for cheaper and help other people discover it.</li>
            <li>my pores were becoming less visible and my skin softer, so I decided to try it for a while.</li>
            <li>The true beauty about it, though, is that my grandma, I, and those other Nerium AD users I know appear so much healthier.</li>
            <li>You want to blame others for your failure of your own judgement.</li>
            <li>There are always a special few who have these huge networks, while the vast majority of people at the bottom make nothing.</li>
            <li>This is the only product I have ever used that actually improves my fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I have two major concern with my face which is brown age spots on both sides of my cheeks plus large pores.  </li>
            <li>This is not sour grapes, I really wanted the business to work.  </li>
            <li>if, in 90 days, you can get 39 Brand Partners (sales rep) in your downline at $500-1000 per Rep, plus a minimum or three preferred customers who automatically buy a minimum of $80 per month, you qualify for a free bottle of product, an iPad, a $500 car payment and up to $2500 in other bonuses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I was looking for a new home.  </li>
            <li>I did like the new texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li>invest about 6 hours a week marketing Nerium to new people.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is a pyramid sceem and relies on bringing in new partners to make any money.</li>
            <li>it will give you a new Lease on Life...</li>
            <li>Unsure as to the end results of this new product</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>So when I got home I looked up this snake oil on line &amp;#34;waste of money ofcourse&amp;#34; then I looked up where her and her husband live.</li>
            <li>Also, I didn&#x27;t like that they wanted to send me new bottle every month when the bottle lasts 6 weeks.  </li>
            <li>I live on the East  coast, and this is part of the reason the Nerium business did not work out as I had hoped for.  </li>
            <li>Seller shipped the item promptly and the item was new as described.  </li>
            <li>I sometimes have adverse reactions to new lotions and soaps.</li>
            <li>but if you are lucky enough to get half of what I did...it is well worth the money!</li>
            <li>Truth - Many of the claims Nerium has made simply are mask&#x27;s or partial truths.</li>
            <li>Anyway, my friend asked me to take before pictures to prove that it&#x27;s working in the same light and same location.  </li>
            <li>she said it was such a great product and went and grabbed your phone then another lady came up behind her and started talking about thIs skin product Nerium</li>
            <li>Nae8 inhibits activation of NF-KB plays a key role in regulating the immune response to infection (κ light chains are critical components of immunoglobulins)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used it for a over a year without any problems, however i do not recommend using it if the bottle isn&#x27;t reasonably new, certainly not past 3 or 4 months.  </li>
            <li>...why can&#x27;t they understand that about something that goes on your face?), it makes your skin tight and feels terrible on, and quite frankly doesn&#x27;t work in our 2 month &amp;#34;trying to be a believer opinion&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nerium has incredible marketing and packaging and their CEO is a great leader.  </li>
            <li>The answer is very clear -</li>
            <li>Makes your face very soft.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised to see a difference almost immediately.  </li>
            <li>I gave in, and paid what I thought to be a high cost, for a product I was trusting to clear my acne and improve my skin.  </li>
            <li>I mean really you could ask away so many questions.</li>
            <li>Wake up America, things are not as important as the media and hype makes it out to be, there is no need to fall into some trap and start handing your hard earned dollars over to some company that see&#x27;s fit to overmarket something and essentially pretend that it is a miracle drug (does the 20&#x27;s ring</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally, this product is priced way above what I&#x27;m willing to spend and I didn&#x27;t see any results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am not exactly sure as to why so many people bash the science on this product?</li>
            <li>I am posting this review because only 30 minutes ago I just tried this for the first time and my face has been</li>
            <li>I am a 54 year old woman with normal aging skin...</li>
            <li>My rep said &amp;#34;it&#x27;s only a small amount of Oleander&amp;#34;, but it&#x27;s still the first ingredient, which means there&#x27;s more Oleander in this product than anything else.</li>
            <li>Thereis a unique story along with a key ingredient that makes this product so different from others.</li>
            <li>It should have been a light cream color, but it is dark tan.  </li>
            <li>The quality is the same as the first bottle I received from the representative.</li>
            <li>How exactly is that a &amp;#34;30 day money back guarantee&amp;#34; when the customer doesn&#x27;t have the product in-hand to try for 30 days?</li>
            <li>While everything seems on the up-and-up, independent research has consistently shown that 99% of people that get involved as distributors in MLM&#x27;s do not break even on their investment.</li>
            <li>People think I&#x27;m in my early 40s and tell me my skin glows!</li>
            <li>The only unique ingredient in here is Oleandar which irritates some peoples skin just enough to plump it up a bit and mask wrinkles temporarily.  </li>
            <li>people say Wow!</li>
            <li>You also may get some that is completely out of date!</li>
            <li>I washed it off immediately, but my neck is still red, hot, and burns.  </li>
            <li>I was first invited to a party by one of my students (totally inappropriate to solicit this way) and I declined.</li>
            <li>At first my skin didn&#x27;t react for about 4 or 5 days then suddenly on my face</li>
            <li>Funny, because I can find similar stories all over online.  </li>
            <li>I only wish I had read all the information on it before I used it in the first place.  </li>
            <li>I suppose if you have plenty of friends who don&#x27;t mind paying nearly $100 per month whether they need it or not, and who don&#x27;t mind providing an income for their &amp;#34;friends&amp;#34;, this just might be the business opportunity for you!</li>
            <li>Before and after photos were exactly the same.</li>
            <li>but by two months you will see your skin begin to have less defined pores and fine lines will be gone.</li>
            <li>would recommend this product for those who can actually afford it and be willing to dish out the money to take a chance on it.</li>
            <li>I am a regular consumer like many other people here.</li>
            <li>I fully am aware of multi-level marketing/pyramids and don&#x27;t understand why the American people still buy into this stuff.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am nervous after reading the reviews about customers&#x27;s eyes becoming droopy or dried out though.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I can say as a licensed professional, I have never had results like this!</li>
            <li>Anyone who tells you Nerium is safe is a dishonest person looking for a sale or completely uneducated about Nerium and the real side effects.</li>
            <li>My face became red and hot to the touch and swollen.</li>
            <li>have used nerium for 3 months and have seen a marked difference in my skin!</li>
            <li>Fine lines were less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>The texture and pore size seem about the same as the first week.  </li>
            <li>Reduces fine lines and wrinkles and makes sun spots/age spots less visable  </li>
            <li>Then the weeks go by &amp; you look exactly the same.</li>
            <li>I have used Nerium for several months and I can tell you first hand,</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin stay away from this product!</li>
            <li>The first bottle of night cream (one that she gave me) actually made my skin softer in appearance and my eyes seemed brighter/lifted.  </li>
            <li>It was thicker and went on like putty which was different than my first experience.  </li>
            <li>i compared this bottle and cream to the same exact one i ordered from nerium.</li>
            <li>I gave the product to a friend of mine, and she had the exact same thing happen.  </li>
            <li>I have only been using Nerium for two weeks and my face is sagging for the first time in my life</li>
            <li>Going Direct to Nerium!</li>
            <li>the first 30 day trial costs $150.00 USD), to find out what I already knew from viewing photos of actual people whom were using the product.  </li>
            <li>Another bent is that some people possibly weren&#x27;t aware it was MLM and feel ripped off or scammed upon the discovery never having been exposed to that world as some of us have.</li>
            <li>I can understand that but to annihilate the product and try to destroy the credibility of this company having something that genuinely works is completely out of line ethically and</li>
            <li>I used this on the backs of my hands for the first time last night.</li>
            <li>My face is no longer sagging, the wrinkles on my forehead are very minimal, my crows feet are gone and the texture of my skin is soft, smooth and glowing.</li>
            <li>I am truly sorry to have to post this kind of negativity which is surely going to grow into a massive headache for Nerium International.  </li>
            <li>I knew I was (very) mildly sensitive to latex but have never had too many problems with it, especially when it came to lotions and other beauty products.  </li>
            <li>Not counting all the bonuses, the $80 retail price has been cut in half by the free giveaways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>By six months deeper winkles smooth out and are less defined.  </li>
            <li>After I used my first bottle, I found a less expensive way to buy it that signing up through a partner, so I bought another bottle and continued to feel like my skin was looking and feeling better and better.  </li>
            <li>I am still young, but my skin is very sensitive and it seems like I never stop breaking out.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a huge change in my skin, with tone, texture, uneven color, pigment and fine lines which are less noticable.</li>
            <li>I was totally skeptical at first, but I love it so much.</li>
            <li>This product, for $90, should provide results quickly instead of obviously not working for the majority of the actual users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 529 reviews as I write this, and there are 70% 3 or below.  </li>
            <li>The overseeing marketers make the decent buck while the lessers harrass everyone they know or might know in an attempt to spread the hype about said product, essentially creating something that would not ordinarily exist considering normal marketing and advertising.</li>
            <li>You can also get the Day cream for FREE FOR LIFE for a limited time with Brand Partners and you have a 30 day money back guaranty.</li>
            <li>Founders of Nerium Ad guarantees correction in fine lines and wrinkles, hyperpigmentation, uneven skin texture, enlarged pores, aging skin, and sun damaged skin.</li>
            <li>Rather than coming here on Amazon to purchase this, Which is more expensive, and untrust worthy, go directly to the site and purchase your product.</li>
            <li>Lately, I&#x27;ve noticed a little more signs of aging - duller skin and fine lines.  </li>
            <li>Thankfully I was smart enough not to offer it to my friends (see sentence one).&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>/&gt; I still believe in the Nerium International program, and certainly appreciate the products they market, but I CAN NOT BELIEVE THEY WOULD HAVE THE NERVE TO DENY MY CLAIM FOR A REIMBURSEMENT FOR ITEMS I NEVER USED, AND RETURNED UNSCATHED</li>
            <li>I, personally ,have seen a difference in my forehead lines, minimizing of the large pores in the &amp;#34;T zone&amp;#34; on my face.  </li>
            <li>Skin aging is what normally happens to people as they get older, especially if you sunbath alot etc.</li>
            <li>My forehead had less noticeable lines, and I was excited.  </li>
            <li>, when you look in the mirror everyday you yourself cant see the changes as much, the before and after photos is your proof that this product really does work!!</li>
            <li>I tried so many things only to get little results.</li>
            <li>With so many age defying products on the market it is hard to determine what works.  </li>
            <li>I notice my skin start to look more dull and my hormonal acne starts to kick in again ...</li>
            <li>actual users (think not being paid to promote it) say its bad, then its probably not your best option for skincare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After I stopped using the product my skin began to clear up.  </li>
            <li>and it is clearly inaccurate.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s somewhat helping to clear my skin up.  </li>
            <li>My dermatologist told me to use this instead of proactiv to clear my skin.</li>
            <li>The product clearly says that it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyone with sensitive skin should not be surprised to find out that his/her skin is sensitive to some things that are put on it.</li>
            <li>I notice a lot of reviews and comments written by people who clearly have not used it or can&#x27;t follow direction...</li>
            <li>I am 42 years old and have been using Nerium AD day and night cream for 3 months...</li>
            <li>Everyone in my families using it whether it&#x27;s my 16 year old niece or my 85 year old mother.</li>
            <li>I have incredibly sensitive skin and this product WORKS even on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Nerium Int&#x27;l does NOT allow the sale of Nerium products in any of these venues and the people selling the product are completely out of compliance.</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in the appearance of lines or sun blotches</li>
            <li>I received frequent compliments.</li>
            <li>bought it directly from Nerium and there was an invoice in a shipment package</li>
            <li>A Slightly Different Take on This Whole</li>
            <li>Since I started using Nerium AD 8 weeks ago, my skin has completely changed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 38 years old</li>
            <li>Honestly I am surprised they are still around.    </li>
            <li>My face was too sensitive for this product.</li>
            <li>Do you really want to buy facial product from someone who is untrustworthy?</li>
            <li>Take the safest option and order from an authorized brand partner or directly from the company&#x27;s website.  </li>
            <li>so I am assuming it&#x27;s old product.</li>
            <li>So far I would recommend it.  </li>
            <li>so if your looking for complete disappearance of lines and wrinkles get a face lift.</li>
            <li>I was surprised with the results.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t consider myself as having sensitive skin</li>
            <li>but it also completely took away my acne.</li>
            <li>Very botanical and reminiscent of Yves Rocher of Paris.  </li>
            <li>From Perricone to Avon to Mary Kay and to Maybelline to Chanel, this is the only product that really made a difference.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very embarrassing to go out in public or work.  </li>
            <li>Im incredibily scent sensitive</li>
            <li>so Im surprised i have no problem with the smell.</li>
            <li>To clarify, I have never had a problem with acne but do have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Clearly, for sensitive skin it doesn&#x27;t.    </li>
            <li>My representative told me that was because it was &#x27;all natural plant extracts without any chemicals or perfumes&#x27;.</li>
            <li>This is a total ponzi scheme and I really hope people read these reviews before they decide to purchase, and I hope the reps will get out of the pyramid and save their souls...</li>
            <li>It glows in that young skin kinda way.  </li>
            <li>As far as the smell I don&#x27;t notice anything???  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>Also, acne is near obsolete.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m caucasian; she&#x27;s in her early 50s</li>
            <li>It has not dried my skin out.  </li>
            <li>NEVER, no matter how much anyone could possibly explain that studies were done etc etc.</li>
            <li>so I said well how old do you think I am</li>
            <li>WOW $400,000 mini mansion with 3 car garage...</li>
            <li>Bottom line is never ever ask someone how old they are....</li>
            <li>I like it but an associate for Nerium said that to notice a marked difference</li>
            <li>So I decided to purchase one bottle with her promise that she would stop the next order until I was ready....</li>
            <li>It does nothing for my crow&#x27;s feet/under eye bags as you can&#x27;t apply near eyes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised after reading the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have meticulously taken care of my skin since I was 14 years old</li>
            <li>As far as I know, Nerium is sold through distributors.</li>
            <li>I am 44 years old, four kids, and tortured my skin in AZ (childhood) and in Florida for 12 years.</li>
            <li>To early to tell if this item is working or not.</li>
            <li>and as far as scars.?  </li>
            <li>I have been using the product for about 8 months now and it truly has completely changed my skin.</li>
            <li>Some pictures they even changed the lips, nose and ear of the person in the attempt to make her look young.</li>
            <li>I hoped to at least see a more even complexion with</li>
            <li>I guess some people would rather complain about the non-perfumy smell then actually give it a real try.</li>
            <li>I am 20 years old and see results of redness in my face disappearing and pores on my nose shrinking.</li>
            <li>Wondering if it is old.</li>
            <li>her eyes were swollen shut and her whole entire face was swollen.</li>
            <li>Beware my old customers are having rash breakouts and burning of their skin</li>
            <li>I thought, &amp;#34;great, this product actually might really make a difference.&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I only gave it a four star rating because it hasn&#x27;t lessened my wrinkles as much as I thought it would  </li>
            <li>and I am nearly out.</li>
            <li>I also continue to wake up looking very puffy, especially around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Oh, I&#x27;m a 61 year old guy.</li>
            <li>I am 30 years old and have combination skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin so before I used the product I looked at all the material</li>
            <li>I do have somewhat sensitive skin</li>
            <li>but so far I &#x27;think&#x27; it is working</li>
            <li>and they just completely disregarded that we were trying to get away from them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My redness completely went away.  </li>
            <li>I am 53 years old and have used every product on the market.</li>
            <li>WHERE around this product is there any sort of scientific evidence that it works, or published results from experimental trials.</li>
            <li>you want to look young forever, try this ladies:</li>
            <li>If the bottle is defected and the pump doesn&#x27;t work, they do not replace your product if it is over 30 days old.</li>
            <li>I feel like I have baby soft skin</li>
            <li>to do only wash your face apply cream at nite and was in morning that is real convenient as well</li>
            <li>I am 46 years old and have been using this now for 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>I had developed Peri-oral dermatitis which I have NEVER had in my 40 years on this earth before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 27 years old and have no skin issues</li>
            <li>The biggest change for me has been the end of my bouts with adult acne.  </li>
            <li>but she finally stopped the automatic order but wants me to share my story with the company.  </li>
            <li>so far nothing.  </li>
            <li>Very flustrated with this bottle as I have had several with out this problem.</li>
            <li>In the morning my skin feels so soft.  </li>
            <li>AM A 21 YEAR OLD WOMAN, LIVING IN TEXAS,</li>
            <li>It is totally against Compliance &amp; you have no idea if you are getting the REAL thing.</li>
            <li>I travel internationally frequently and sometimes miss a day here and there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m liking it so far.</li>
            <li>So far after 1 mo.</li>
            <li>I detest multi level marketing and don&#x27;t know how so many can do it with all the negative product reviews.</li>
            <li>I swear by this product - I have been using it for 60 days now and have seen a considerable change in my face and neck.  </li>
            <li>Complete scam.</li>
            <li>I am 72 years old.  </li>
            <li>and, well -- old</li>
            <li>(BTW, I buy it from Amazon because I can use my points - which reduces the cash outlay considerably).    </li>
            <li>, adult acne I was told.  </li>
            <li>You will see real and actual results.    </li>
            <li>and I would not be surprised at all</li>
            <li>They have always been professional and apologetic.</li>
            <li>Yes, I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>it naturally hydrates the skin.and holds the moisture.</li>
            <li>but what it actually did was clear up my everyday acne and all my hormonal acne which I&#x27;ve never been able to get rid of ........</li>
            <li>My husband who rarely comments about such finally asked, &amp;#34;what is that smell?&amp;#34;  I continued to use the day cream but saw no results</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see so many negative reviews on the Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Sometimes friends that are harsh critics actually make it more difficult for loved ones to get out of them and accept the mistake they made in signing up for one.  </li>
            <li>After telling her I wasn&#x27;t interested she KEPT calling me to try and get my money and to have me attend seminars featuring a 26 year old female who apparently is making $25,000 a MONTH.</li>
            <li>Oleander is poisonous to those that do not know, and I for one would NEVER put something on my precious skin that came from such a deadly plant.</li>
            <li>I hate to see a wonderful product not being given the credit</li>
            <li>I have always liked the product, am confused as to why I got two defective products.  </li>
            <li>I think this product plays a major role in that!!  </li>
            <li>I can bash all sorts of skin products left and right about how it didn&#x27;t work as suggested, but I don&#x27;t because not all skin types are the same.  </li>
            <li>As I read other reviews I can just tell most to if not all of them have not actually taken time with this with an open mind.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who takes care of their skin and just needs that little bit more boost, without Botox or any other such more extreme methods.  </li>
            <li>It actually does something, unlike many other products out there that claim similar results.</li>
            <li>Nerium Ad was created at the MD Anderson cancer research center at the University of Texas when they found that the product has multiple unique effects.  </li>
            <li>, there were a couple of other ladies waiting in line, after paying for my Clinique and getting my free April give away gift I strolled over the the swim wear since we are going on vacation next month.</li>
            <li>My bathroom is full of half used containers.</li>
            <li>Day Cream fumes caused eyes to burn, the night cream caused nose to burn, and FIRM caused a major rash that has turned into a mix of welts/bumps that have yet to heal so guessing this product kills more than cells and wrinkles as I am still seeing a Dermatologist using 2nd batch of prescriptions to treat skin reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I Have been using Nerium Night and Day for a little over month and a half and all I can tell you is that i Absolutly Love the product!  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to be as fresh or new as the previous ones I have used.</li>
            <li>The company was smart enough to market and patent the product with a new business- NERIUM INTERNATIONAL- to help fund their research at NERIUM BIOTECHNOLOGY.</li>
            <li>Her retaliation was that all of the other companies were &amp;#34;haters&amp;#34; and were &amp;#34;jealous of the success of the company&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Since we know the sales reps are going to write great reviews about the product they&#x27;re selling, that leaves us with a surprisingly high and troubling number of bad reviews.</li>
            <li>but I use a small amount of water and it is fine.  </li>
            <li>I also have small fine lines under my eyes now that weren&#x27;t there before.</li>
            <li>I go to school for nutrition, I know first hand not all things react to bodies the same because bodies are all different.</li>
            <li>Also with this supplier you are pre-ordering ,so be aware that the ship date doesn&#x27;t get pushed back a month later than estimated.</li>
            <li>and I actually felt confident going to work with no makeup the past 3 days.</li>
            <li>I have had this product in the past, and love the product, but will not buy from this vendor again or recommend unless I can get a  replacement or my money back.</li>
            <li>My cheeks usually are red and they look much better after about 5 days of using this product.</li>
            <li>This is not the same as what I got from Nerium, funny smell and different color.</li>
            <li>My pores are pretty big and they were much smaller after using the product.</li>
            <li>After six months of product use, I personally have seen decent results from something that comes out of a bottle without having to do anything else but wash and apply.</li>
            <li>so maybe this is not a typical reaction.</li>
            <li>Because I had 4 bottles, I continued using the product one squirt every night on very wet skin and after one year, still like it better than any other product I have or have tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 66-year-old professional Customer Service Manager with a major US corporation.  </li>
            <li>and neither of us have ever had major issues with acne and are both in the 30-40 yr old range.  </li>
            <li>The price is right too as I have used other products that cost two or three times&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe the product worked for other people but it wasn&#x27;t the right match for me.</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes.  </li>
            <li>So I can&#x27;t understand the massive amount of slamming and am highly suspicious now.</li>
            <li>I have high hopes for further improvement.</li>
            <li>I bought Firm on a special in the beginning.  </li>
            <li>A week later she was back to her normal self!!    </li>
            <li>it did what lasor would do with no down time...</li>
            <li>I use less than is recommended: only one pump which I smooth on with water.  </li>
            <li>Steer clear of this organization and MLM cults in general.</li>
            <li>This product is to be used long term to see the real results.</li>
            <li>I had been plagued with since my early twenties that my makeup barely covered.</li>
            <li>The puckers around my mouth diminished considerably as I continued to use the night cream, and the brown spots have softened to be barely discernible.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a regularly user of this cream and normally purchased through a Nerium Representative.  </li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s not for everyone, but I really am surprised at most of the negative reviews because I&#x27;ve never had a skin product actually work and do what it says it does.</li>
            <li>and my skin is back to normal.</li>
            <li>My pores seemed to get larger, my sun spots got darker, my skin was even dryer than normal would &amp;#34;Not&amp;#34; recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>but before I could apply the night cream on the 3rd day, my lips, tongue and feet began to swell and by the morning I was covered head to toe in large red hives.  </li>
            <li>so I probably work a little harder than most grandmothers do at my age.</li>
            <li>It will make you look refreshed, your skin will look healthy, and help your skin look a little tighter for minimal wrinkles and sagging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know deep down if you have been doing this for very long you know better than I the truth.  </li>
            <li>When I did, I found that Nerium Ad does not only live up to its expectations, but it goes beyond its guarantee.</li>
            <li>Open a new bottle.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>This was a new revolutionary product that would help your skin and make you look younger.  </li>
            <li>New skin products will/can make skin red.</li>
            <li>Not only did  wrinkles not improve, NEW wrinkles were created as my skin lost all hydration.  </li>
            <li>Nerium exasperated my Rosacea, so I sent the new delivery of unopened product back for a refund ($120.00), keeping the used bottles and giving them to my friend.  </li>
            <li>a messaged me several times pushing me to commit &amp;#34; it would change my financial future&amp;#34; promising a Lexus as a 90 day bonus if I signed 3 partners who also signed 3 partners.</li>
            <li>I only wish this product were a bit cheaper, although it is much cheaper on Amazon than the local Nerium sales-gal...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only twenty, and obviously not concerned about wrinkles, but this product shrunk my pores, and really evened out my complexion.</li>
            <li>Only things such as Accutane for people with acne  are really needed.</li>
            <li>B00I0N24TY Vitamin C Serum such as this one]] to maintain soft and even textures across the complete surface of your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After that I will go back to my regular routine and not spend so much money.</li>
            <li>I have to give it a few good pumps before anything comes out and when it does its clumpy and spits out thick.</li>
            <li>It was thick and orange and gooey and smells like a strong smelling putty or clay.</li>
            <li>and tighter!I know there are different opinions in this forum,but dont let these people full you,most of these bad reviews are selling other products ,notice what they do now,so as a custumer for Nerium it gas done great for me and</li>
            <li>Secondly, I won&#x27;t deny I already look very young for my age and am not disciplined about skincare.</li>
            <li>i do want to make you AWARE OF, Do not buy product from THIS or ANY other sites on the internet</li>
            <li>I saw no other changes in my skin.  </li>
            <li>no other products at all.</li>
            <li>My skin is SO soft, dark blemish spots are almost completely disappeared, makeup goes on so much easier, oily spots are controlled.</li>
            <li>Major breakouts.....</li>
            <li>I convinced 2 friends to try it and within 2 weeks one had a major reaction that lasted 4 weeks.</li>
            <li>Nerium does work for over a million people as evidenced by the fact that the company had the largest growth in their first year than any other company of its kind.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>No one that I am aware, including other sellers, has seen any noticeable change in the condition of their skin.</li>
            <li>NO other products that I have dumped tons of money into have worked like NERIUM.  </li>
            <li>i opened a new bottle which had been sitting on the shelf for a few months, and it was like brown water when i pumped it the first time -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure to get a few comments here about how I&#x27;m wrong, and don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m talking about, and then they&#x27;ll link you to neriums website to \\&quot;find out for yourself\\&quot; using their personal link to amass more sales and hopefully talking you into joining them.</li>
            <li>I think it is a bit pricey compared to drug store options, BUT I have spent as much or more on products from the med spa and department stores that have given me similar or less results.</li>
            <li>worth the money for how much is in it or either i got a half empty bottle</li>
            <li>After using it exactly as instructed, not only did I not see any positive benefits, my face broke out in tiny little bumps everywhere.</li>
            <li>I have all but begged them to please give this issue some serious thought, as I am sure they will want to avoid further escalation on my part.  </li>
            <li>Yes it is expensive, but most high end skin care is.</li>
            <li>I used to get mild laser peels regularly and was due for one before starting Nerium</li>
            <li>When I compared the photos I was shocked at the great result.</li>
            <li>Not only did it clear up my acne</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve stopped using the product and it has taken my skin about another 5 months to clear up with the proper treatment and products.</li>
            <li>My overall skin tone was much healthier and I lost that grey color to my skin.</li>
            <li>I am a licensed Esthetician who was curious about Nerium since there seemed to be so much buzz about it.</li>
            <li>I used the Night Cream every night until the bottle was empty, about a month, and did not notice much of a difference.</li>
            <li>In the morning, you only need to rinse with water, but I recommend washing if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this product for 1.5 months so still early</li>
            <li>apparently this product also gave a brow lift, and improved frown lines?</li>
            <li>I went back to it and it does make my face have reduced lines even this old.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 32 year old male and have been using this product for almost a year and will continue to use it because IT WORKS y&#x27;all.</li>
            <li>I thought they only did direct sales and never sell it to distributors.  </li>
            <li>it appears that the natural oils are back...</li>
            <li>Plus, there&#x27;s barely any product.</li>
            <li>One issue though, Nerium is not approved to be sold from retailers like Amazon, only directly from their brandpartners&#x27; website ( As an example, mine is [...] )</li>
            <li>So far I have noticed a difference with the neck area and it seems to work as well as my current skin care</li>
            <li>what but the bottle I ordered directly through a Nerium agent last over 2 months compared to 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it produced a smoother look for my 50 year old skin.  </li>
            <li>After two months of on and off eye swelling I developed a rash at the corners of my mouth and back on the eyes.  </li>
            <li>This extract is in it&#x27;s infancy as far as research goes, and personally I recommend caution.</li>
            <li>As I careen toward my 51st birthday and often have people tell me I don&#x27;t look old enough to have grown children,</li>
            <li>I TRY to use only natural products so after researching, I knew I had to try it.</li>
            <li>I myself am 53 years old and a former model who is looking for a \\&quot;needleless\\&quot; way to preserve my face and skin, and I can&#x27;t wait to use this product!!!!</li>
            <li>Perhaps it takes longer than one month to see results, especially if you are over 60 years old.</li>
            <li>I felt that it might have been an old bottle because it didnt feel like the one I had used from a local dealer.</li>
            <li>Our 28 year old daughter started using it back in September 2012.</li>
            <li>I may feel old, but my face looks 20 years younger.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast and it showed up as expected.</li>
            <li>But the overall appearance of my skin has been markedly improved.  </li>
            <li>In fact, by the third day, I had developed an itchy, sore rash all over my face.</li>
            <li>She also blamed my nausea on poor diet, even though my diet hadn&#x27;t changed and I felt 100% better after stopping it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My poor brother, who has a bunch of acne scars, was even more bombarded.</li>
            <li>Silly girls is a nice alias...</li>
            <li>i kinda really liked them until they became too complicated to keep up with...</li>
            <li>You honestly will never know if you are too skeptical.</li>
            <li>so most of or all reviews you see are from brand partners its the way the game works there is no honesty in this industry along with over priced products and promotion.</li>
            <li>seven, small bumps are full on rash all over my cheeks.  </li>
            <li>I am 65 and really did not expect a dramatic effect but finally decided any improvement would be fine.</li>
            <li>but I think the harsh stuff some people are saying is more about the marketing and less about the product.</li>
            <li>There is a limited market for ALL high priced beauty products.</li>
            <li>The claims that are made, including the positive reviewers on this page, merely generate money for the promoter and are not meant to accurately reflect its benefits.  </li>
            <li>Most people who have \\&quot;amazing\\&quot; results are the same people trying to sell it to you and to sign you up under them, and the before/afters are either literally unbelievable or obviously done under different lighting at slightly different angles.</li>
            <li>No product is for everyone, if it doesn&#x27;t work for you it doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not a fabulous product, but for this girl my skin has truly NEVER looked better!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not interested in selling any MLM stuff myself, but I really like the product and will continue to use it and buy from my friend.  </li>
            <li>And $80 a bottle isn&#x27;t that much considering what I&#x27;ve paid for other skin care &amp;#34;systems&amp;#34; that didn&#x27;t work this well.</li>
            <li>So - for me this is a terrific product and, while a little pricey, worth it.  </li>
            <li>I decided to purchase 2 of the night cream on amazon and the last bottle, half way through the cream changed to a dark golden color and turned very liquidly.  </li>
            <li>The first time I put it on, my face tingled and began to feel tight.</li>
            <li>Different products are developed to tackle a specific issue.</li>
            <li>The only place you should order Nerium is directly from an authorized Nerium Brand Partner for the following reasons: 1)</li>
            <li>I do not have the worst skin problems in the world nor do I have the best, but I will say thus far using the product for 2 weeks</li>
            <li>You must use at least 4 healthy pumps on wet skin before bed.</li>
            <li>I was very skeptical at first, but I fell in love after using it.</li>
            <li>Be wise and steer clear of this stuff,  this rash is embaressing, i&#x27;ts painful</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how many times to the meetings with very ridiculous ladies giving us testimony of this heavenly product.</li>
            <li>Over time, I built up a tolerance (just as you would to a medication you take daily) and the swelling decreased more and more...showing the wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It is lighter in color and it does not dry the same.&lt;br /&gt;No results with this cream.  </li>
            <li>All these crazy reviews, but only one good thing came from this.</li>
            <li>aka I&#x27;m not into pyramid schemes) and she threw major fits and arguments stating how I never do anything for her and how this is for my future.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m willing to swallow that little bit of BS.  </li>
            <li>The first couple of days my complexion seemed a little &amp;#34;brighter&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>little background first</li>
            <li>It is mathematically and physically impossible for everyone that gets involved in these practices to be successful.</li>
            <li>He has a large scar on his neck &amp; his skeptical hair dresser noticed improvement in appearance &amp; she&#x27;s been cutting his hair for more than 10 years!&lt;br /&gt;Nerium FIRM is also AMAZING!  </li>
            <li>It smells funny, makes your face feel tight and dry, and as far as I am concerned I have not seem results-</li>
            <li>Not only have I been positively impacted by this age defying skin care however, my observations of other Nerium Ad users have proven the reliability of this product to serve for multiple purposes.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t crazy about jumping into a pyramid scheme, but I did it because she was very sure about her results and others.  </li>
            <li>Not worth the high price tag!  </li>
            <li>I will have to say that apparently it works differently on people.  </li>
            <li>and I have used Estee lauder, Mary kay, merit norman, bare minetals, capita international products,</li>
            <li>I only used the bare minimum, as I know</li>
            <li>Apoptosis, on the other hand, is relatively civil, even though it may not sound so at first -- when a cell dies from apoptosis, the cleanup is much easier.</li>
            <li>Having exhausted my options to work this out with Nerium International and being met with a simple &amp;#34;sorry, we will not issue a refund&amp;#34;, I have filed a claim with the Better Business Bureau.</li>
            <li>Within the first few days I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>every so often so I don&#x27;t build up an immunity, so I am using the hot weather as my time to lay off for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li>I got a few pimples at first (they do say that can happen)</li>
            <li>I did get a noticeable difference within the first few days.  </li>
            <li>So I am giving this product 5 stars to help counteract the ridiculous reviews although for me personally it is a 3 and a half to 4 star based on cost and my own results.</li>
            <li>My age spots are significantly lighter, my wrinkles on my eyes and chest are much improved (not perfect--</li>
            <li>Obviously if they did half a billion dollars in their first 3 years without your approval, they won&#x27;t need it in the future either.</li>
            <li>With beauty being a major focus in our society today, people invest into several skin care products to satisfy simply one goal: to get the look their hoping for.</li>
            <li>After a few days I noticed my skin, which hasn&#x27;t been acne prone for maybe 10 years since I was in high school, completely break out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Botox and fillers in the past, and have been very loyal to several high end skin care lines in the past.  </li>
            <li>Is this just another very overpriced cream that really doesn&#x27;t do more than any other less expensive product?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But like all other things, it probably doesn&#x27;t help everyone, but I would highly recommend trying it for yourself.</li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I do have dry, sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It gave me inflamed red bumps all over my face after the first few times applying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a nice product but expensive and seems to take a long time to get rid of age spots.</li>
            <li>I used the product for several weeks and not only did I have major breakouts all over my face, but my skin actually hurt to touch.</li>
            <li>, couldn&#x27;t breath thought I was going to throw up , I was like putting and egg on your face , I took it off as fast as I could get it on , made my shin very dry , didn&#x27;t like it at all !!!</li>
            <li>Paid  a little more from the company and this was  a little dry</li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t red anymore, but my under eye wrinkles have worsened and my skin is extremely dry and sensitive now.  </li>
            <li>It certainly did nothing for me and was a waste of money.</li>
            <li>I really like it, however it does smell a little like hay</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a little pricey but after 6 weeks there is a very noticible difference.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You&#x27;ll spend a few hundred dollars and find it does very little for your skin, unless you want to approach every single woman in your path to tell them &#x27;How excited you are about your new career!&#x27;  </li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t tried any other new product and I broke out everywhere</li>
            <li>My pores are large and I am starting to get a few lines around my mouth and eyes.</li>
            <li>In other words, they have been building a personal downline network and they just keep finding a new pyramid scheme to get into and bring their network with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bad companies (and there are a lot of them out there) are just ripoffs, selling something, anything to make a profit and have a get rich quick mentality.  </li>
            <li>I have read the good reviews and the bad ones.  </li>

            <li> Proudly, I can say, after using the product, my enlarged pores shrunk.</li>

            <li> In my world, parties are for sharing your joy and hospitality with friends-as opposed to profiting from them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> LOL.</li>
            <li> I was under the care of an esthetician for 20 years with great results from microdermabrasions and salicytic and glycolic peels when she joined this group.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for 3 months and have experienced none of the reported benefits.  </li>
            <li> However, every area on my face and neck that I&#x27;ve used it, I&#x27;ve been happy.</li>
            <li> But I got great results.</li>
            <li> I love the results I&#x27;m seeing!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for months now, and the results are phenomenal!!</li>
            <li> I have tried this product &amp; it seems very effective.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t help but try to offer a very honest evaluation.</li>
            <li> Amazing results on acne though!</li>
            <li> The before and afters are amazing!  </li>
            <li> but the difference in my skin is truly amazing!</li>
            <li> It also smells amazing!</li>
            <li> AMAZING product!  </li>
            <li> This product is amazing and scienticfically proven to give results of %30 improvement in 30 days!</li>
            <li> Nerium is amazing!</li>
            <li> DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I was loving my skin to the point I didn&#x27;t have to use any makeup!</li>
            <li> ** to start your own \\&quot;business\\&quot; when you buy on Amazon!</li>
            <li> , she showed me the makers of Nerium have their own NON TOXIC OLEANDER farm!</li>
            <li> I had to be honest!  </li>
            <li> But I did successfully cancel my auto ship going forward.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> I did, however, give it my best shot for 6 months before deciding that I had better stop the bleeding (spending over $100 a month on my product and website, etc.).I reviewed the procedures for returning product and accessories, including my starter kit, and proceeded as is spelled out on the Nerium website.  </li>
            <li> DIDNT ASK HOW SUCCESSFUL WE HAD BEEN, HOW NERIUM HELPED US, HOW IT CHANGED OUR LIVES.</li>
            <li> (:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since that day, my mom has become successful at Nerium, she can pay for my brothers treatment AND GOT A LEXUS AND IPAD JUST LIKE THE COMPANY</li>
            <li> (:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since that day, my mom has become successful at Nerium, she can pay for my brothers treatment AND GOT A LEXUS AND IPAD JUST LIKE THE COMPANY</li>
            <li> I should also let you know that I have been very successful in another network marketing business, top of the company, earned the trips, jewels and the car, but that company changed a lot</li>
            <li> I can feel that could be a problem, but just like anywhere else, there are people that just don&#x27;t know how to give a great costumer service, however this product is amazing and the people that I know and use it are extremely happy with it.  </li>
            <li> This is probably the most successful anti aging product I have used!  </li>
            <li> This was a great deal of money and did not measure up to the advertisement that promised amazing results.</li>
            <li> , I look bright</li>
            <li> This is probably also the reason I haven&#x27;t experienced amazing results.  </li>
            <li> My month pictures looked good.  </li>
            <li> Good product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good luck</li>
            <li> Loved the opportunity to buy it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Which makes perfectly good sense.  </li>
            <li> I happen to think my product is superior however,</li>
            <li> let&#x27;s be fair.</li>
            <li> 45 never looked so good.</li>
            <li> I can relate to spending a good amount of money on products with the hope of receiving the outcome I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had good skin in my life.</li>
            <li> The product was as described, of good quality and delivered on time.</li>
            <li> Good quality age defying treatment.</li>
            <li> Nerium is a one step product, diminished my 11 lines between my eyes, gives me a glow &amp; makes my face look good.</li>
            <li> In that case, it&#x27;s quite good.</li>
            <li> Feels good when you put it on.</li>
            <li> Good delivery</li>
            <li> This product is also a  moisterizer which wasn&#x27;t good for my oily</li>
            <li> Good God - how does the FDA even let them market this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Good Product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping it keeps up with these good results</li>
            <li> The cream is doing a good job on my skin .</li>
            <li> skin was feeling so good.  </li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s all the good I can say about it.</li>
            <li> If this product was truly as magnificent as it claims to be it would be available in stores.</li>
            <li> and the pharmacist said to me, \\&quot;you look really good...</li>
            <li> I have been doing a ton of research on it and can find nothing good about it.</li>
            <li> So when a good friend of mine gave me a bottle I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> I wish that I could give it a good review, but I cannot tell a lie.  </li>
            <li> It seems that I had some improvement on my  skin.&lt;br /&gt;The good thing about it</li>
            <li> so you get a product it is good</li>
            <li> Nothing good, of course.</li>
            <li> this I sa good product for night-time use.</li>
            <li> I have a cousin who says it has been a good for her.</li>
            <li> The way brand partners sell their product is not a scam to me because I love this product and it works with my skin incredibly.</li>
            <li> My skin looks good.</li>
            <li> Nerium delivers a night cream that leaves your face looking good when you wake up.</li>
            <li> I was told that this would be the product that changed my face for the good forever.</li>
            <li> this stuff did nothing good for me.  </li>
            <li> and that is a good sign.</li>
            <li> The Nerium Ad is a good night cream.</li>
            <li> Good company.</li>
            <li> Good purchase.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having the mindset of, &amp;#34;it&#x27;s too good to be true,&amp;#34</li>
            <li> /&gt;the product is good.</li>
            <li> My face feels good after using this product.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t feel good.</li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t smell good at all.</li>
            <li> Ordering this from a good friend (working her way they college)</li>
            <li> good luck</li>
            <li> Nerium is a good product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my good deed for the day.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li> I also had my good friend who is a renowned organic chemist look at the science</li>
            <li> In good health and in fact, while I have my share of wrinkles, I have fairly good skin.  </li>
            <li> This seems to capture the good results again.  </li>
            <li> This was a good price compared to what I have paid from the distributor.  </li>
            <li> A Good review-</li>
            <li> Good that you put it on at bedtime.</li>
            <li> and so many people tell me I have beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> One thing about the pyramid sales, the people at the top make really good money, but the bottom feeders have to make the sales to keep everyone happy.</li>
            <li> but  I am happy with it and glad to have gotten it</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the results this product has to offer.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> The smell was very interesting to me.</li>
            <li> Be sure to use it every night no matter what because it will take awhile to work, but the end results are great.</li>
            <li> Instead, wash your face, apply sunscreen when in the sun, eat healthier foods, get more exercise, stop smoking, be happy.</li>
            <li> my skin color is great my crows feet around eyes are better</li>
            <li> I have pretty flawless skin already so for me, this product ruined my already good skin</li>
            <li> but I am very glad that I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so very pleased I tried it and recommend that others try and see for themselves.</li>
            <li> and yet they were able to get great results.</li>
            <li> Very convincing pictures and enthusiasm.</li>
            <li> The seller was great, it was packaged great and it came in a quick manner.</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better and Its an amazing product and great company.</li>
            <li> There are many competitors in the skin product market that aren&#x27;t happy to see that Nerium has a product that is so amazing.</li>

            <li> She made it sound so great.  </li>
            <li> She made it sound so great.  </li>
            <li> This product is so amazing I am going to become</li>
            <li> This product is truly amazing.</li>
            <li> I took my photo before and now and the results are amazing.  </li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just amazing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what those people used to obtain their amazing results, but it was not this product.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a month and have seen amazing results.  </li>
            <li> This is used sparingly and the results are amazing  immediately.  </li>
            <li> This product is amazing, I&#x27;ve read some reviewers stated they did not think it improved their skin in anyway</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t bother to do that and am content to enjoy the effects of this great product.</li>
            <li> but I have seen amazing results</li>
            <li> fantastic product have used for 2 years with great results.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing product.</li>
            <li> : The product works, the company is AMAZING and it changed my familys</li>
            <li> : The product works, the company is AMAZING and it changed my familys</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t till I took a look at my own before and after pictures that I realized just how amazing my results were.</li>
            <li> My skin was amazing through my teens and twenties, but once I hit 30</li>
            <li> My jaw is firming up so nice</li>
            <li> Here is my honest review.</li>
            <li> It looked liked</li>
            <li> Seems to be helping my skin, reducing wrinkles and pores, loving the product</li>
            <li> The Nerium&#x27;s customer serivice is really nice.  </li>
            <li> After two weeks, I ordered my own bottle and have shared my results with others.</li>
            <li> but the jury is still out on how effective it is.  </li>
            <li> Everyone in life needs to learn their own lessons and at their own pace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Excellent, i really like product it is helping with my skin discoloration.</li>
            <li> The after pictures had perfect lighting and were very flattering.  </li>
            <li> Kinda liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Buy at your own risk with this distributor.</li>
            <li> my make up would not apply nicely and just looked blah.</li>
            <li> My honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I am honest and transparent with people</li>
            <li> what kind of plant?</li>
            <li> And yes, she used her own money to make us all brand</li>
            <li> And yes, she used her own money to make us all brand</li>
            <li> but not the toxic kind.</li>
            <li> Age spots much fainter and skin tone excellent.</li>
            <li> would comment on how nice my skin looks</li>
            <li> the morning I rinse my face and neck with warm water and then pat dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> What kind of joke is this</li>
            <li> I then rinse with a wash cloth and warm water.</li>
            <li> It is pricey, and I feel like I have kind of plateaued</li>
            <li> Sometimes we can&#x27;t notice changes on our own face.</li>
            <li> I got used to the smell and even started to kind of like it.  </li>
            <li> There are ZERO facts presented honestly about this.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why so many people did not have good results.  </li>
            <li> I liked it, I saw a difference after just 1 night of using it.</li>
            <li> This company is all about integrity so if someone is selling it on here, they&#x27;re not being honest.</li>
            <li> have my own before and after pics if you want to see them.</li>
            <li> ; If you have ever worked or even started your own business you will know you have to apply yourself 100% to receive results</li>
            <li> You call her honest?</li>
            <li> I really liked this product.</li>
            <li> And I agree that those I know using R&amp;F products have had nice improvement also.</li>
            <li> Honestly.</li>
            <li> i purchased this product because i heard all the buzz and reviews going around for it, including mentions from friends; so my expectations were there.&lt;br /&gt;the packaging and bottle is nice, and the cream smells and feels delightful.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> the morning he rinses his face ,puts on the daycream ,and I love on myself , my skin feels better and looks better!!</li>
            <li> I even excitedly took my before pictures, hoping to show everyone how great it worked on me.  </li>
            <li> Its worth a try!!!</li>
            <li> The best result I&#x27;ve had is thst my skin is a bit brighter more consistently.  </li>
            <li> Very happy with this product and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> then it&#x27;s probably too good to be true!</li>
            <li> Nerium is the new best friend I have.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t so great but its made w all natural product that is why it doesn&#x27;t smell great.</li>
            <li> It is awesome Ty so much :)</li>
            <li> Jumped right in as Brand Partner &amp; know for a fact that this is truly an amazing company with great people, support, compensation &amp; opportunity.</li>
            <li> I also know someone else who experienced a side effect at first, but rode it out and is so glad she did!</li>
            <li> I got in touch with the company and they were very kind and quick to give me a refund.  </li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> and the stink of old underwear, Nerium is a delightful indulgence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Whatever good you have heard about this product is accurate.</li>
            <li> And for a young person it was surprising how it seemed as though she had had Botox!!!!!</li>
            <li> This by far is my best face product.  </li>
            <li> This has been the best cream I have tried so far (in my budget).  </li>
            <li> They had tremendous wrinkles sagging and acne issues and the results for them were definitely more pronounced than what I have personally experienced.  </li>
            <li> It might still be a good deal for some, but the structure is not designed to be good for large percentages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product ..makes your skin feel wonderful .only used it for a week so far</li>
            <li> Then it spreads nicely, absorbs well, and feels awesome (as well as make the product go a lot further).  </li>
            <li> and I generally avoid the sun as best</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even considered becoming one of their Brand Partners because this product is so amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Beware!  if it sounds too good to be true</li>
            <li> The people I work with are wonderful  hard working people that are excited about our wonderful  products.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly &amp; was in good condition.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say my skin is perfect, but it&#x27;s never looked as glowing and smooth, and been this soft ever!</li>
            <li> I have very fair and sensitive skin but the two friends of mine that this works for have skin with more oil, it may be my skin type.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> :)  P.S.</li>
            <li> I love this product and would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love it love</li>
            <li> It love how it feels and</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say with conviction that the appearance of my crows feet have been reduced, but I have noticed that the wrinkles on my neck look much better.  </li>
            <li> One star is too many.</li>
            <li> So glad I didn&#x27;t get caught up in it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE Nerium.</li>
            <li> My lines were minimized, my skin was softer and smoother, and it had a healthy glow to it.  </li>
            <li> Everyone has called it a pyramid scheme, well let me ask you this, are you ever going to make more than your boss?</li>
            <li> I know many people doing it.</li>
            <li> my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nerium for and love it.</li>
            <li> I love the product and recommend it to anyone that is considering botox.</li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> and I wanted to be supportive.  </li>
            <li> Save yourself some money go to Walgreens and get some Olay better results.</li>
            <li> Many men and women</li>
            <li> The most wonderful thing is that it corrects issues above and beneath the surface, giving people the look they vie for while diminishing their insecurities and building their confidence.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nerium has done the trick to keep my skin healthy.  </li>
            <li> I may update after I finish two more bottles.  </li>
            <li> Mine lasts more than a month.  </li>
            <li> Glad to find it on Amazon</li>
            <li> Having used this product before  it&#x27;s not any better than others on the marlet</li>
            <li> /&gt;You have to ask yourself why so many of these are for sale on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I am sure they must have an answer for this, but I don&#x27;t recall what it is.  </li>
            <li> Encourage them to learn more and pose questions for them.  </li>
            <li> #34;I&#x27;m thinking it wasn&#x27;t the Nerium, surely it was something else...</li>
            <li> There is no such guarantee when you buy through Amazon; 3) When you order through Nerium you can be assured that you are getting the best product from the Company.</li>
            <li> Make sure you get these from a brand partner.</li>
            <li> So many of my friends wanted to know what I was using and wanted some that I decided to sell it.  </li>
            <li> I intend to order more.</li>
            <li> a two to three weeks with my skin being more even toned and fading of age spots.</li>
            <li> It smooths and tightens my skin better after shaving.</li>
            <li> Others have told me that my skin looks much better and more even toned.  </li>
            <li> Love the product,  i receive compliments on my skin, which i account to the product,  Nerium.</li>
            <li> I had many headaches while using this but didn&#x27;t know of</li>
            <li> ; so I automatically take better care of my skin because I wash my face every night to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use it :)</li>
            <li> and I would love to tighten and shrink my pores.</li>
            <li> I was getting a better deal than ordering it through a Nerium agent, however the cream ran out within 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Glad I am using this product.</li>
            <li> I have used Nerium AD before, and I love it.</li>
            <li> this product is over hyped without the results that are claimed - save your money and look for something better</li>
            <li> Love the Nerium Night Cream.</li>
            <li> MY SKIN DID NOT FEEL OR LOOK ANY BETTER....</li>
            <li> I have noticed a change for the better.  </li>
            <li> Nerium is over-selling its effectiveness to be sure.</li>
            <li> But after that, I didn&#x27;t notice any more</li>
            <li> Many people ask me what I am using.</li>
            <li> I love love love it</li>
            <li> I will continue to use Nerium and look forward to better and better skin.  </li>
            <li> She gave me a whole bottle as my sample which I thought was great.</li>
            <li> I am in my forties now and have been a sun worshiper most of my life.  </li>
            <li> and if I see any more results, (which I doubt) I will do an update.</li>
            <li> i have not tried it yet, but can see the difference on the sun spots and the tone  is better.</li>
            <li> Yes they send you more than you need a month.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a shame when brand partners focus more on the money rather than customer expectations.&lt;br</li>
            <li> received many compliments from friends and family.</li>
            <li> It works fantastic!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 months and my skin just keeps getting better.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nerium for over a year and absolutely LOVE the results.</li>
            <li> My friends all love it too.</li>
            <li> I sure wish I would have listened to the reviews and took others advice.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Sure, they&#x27;ll say it&#x27;s counterfeit since the company prohibits amazon and ebay sales, but</li>
            <li> We are thoroughly enjoying the improved appearance of our skin.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely works best when followed by a moisturizer that night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin feels more taut and just looks brighter.  </li>
            <li> It makes me feel more radiant.  </li>
            <li> i Love this product..</li>
            <li> My skin feels and looks better</li>
            <li> So glad I have been using a sample, and that I&#x27;m not any money.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this night cream.</li>
            <li> Retin A works much better for me.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not terrible, either.  </li>
            <li> Find a BP and buy it from them. :)</li>
            <li> This company is nothing more than trash</li>
            <li> Considering they claim they do not need FDA approval for something derived from a poison, they sure do promote and post before and after pics with differentiating lighting, over</li>
            <li> product itself, I love</li>
            <li> Nerium seems to be a company much more focused on selling the benefits of distribution than selling the product.</li>
            <li> Getting kidnapped into sitting through presentations - a friend of my wife invited us to a &amp;#34;housewarming.&amp;#34; We were surrounded by what I thought were her friends and family, but most of them turned out to be Nerium Brand Partners.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In case you haven&#x27;t noticed, the top sales directors talk about having been in &amp;#34;relationship marketing&amp;#34; for years.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure this Nerium thingie is a side venture for them.  </li>
            <li> I switched to a 20% Vitamin C serum and it worked great at a much lower price.  </li>
            <li> I sometimes apply more water to&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li> , I get better results with the Neutrogena Ageless Intensives line.</li>
            <li> and it is mostly water</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve known her for many years I trusted her.  </li>
            <li> I tried so many lines, I lost count.  </li>
            <li> When I mentioned the burning I too was told to use more water.</li>
            <li> If you want some before and after pics or more info, just let me know.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> , I was glad that was not the case with me.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> But I love the products and they sale and do what they advertise.</li>
            <li> Glad for the ones that like it, but not for me.</li>
            <li> I love this nerium products.</li>
            <li> In fact most of neriums b4 and after pics look like plastic surgery b4 and after...</li>
            <li> My Sisters love it one is selling it.</li>
            <li> Now thou my face is getting more wrinkles and they swear it helps them</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m sure there might be people whose skin it legitimately irritates.</li>
            <li> Added a smoother appearance on my face and made the shade on my face a more even tone.</li>
            <li> But my skin looks SO much better</li>
            <li> and it even feels better.</li>
            <li> and I did notice a difference, mostly the crapeiness on my throat.</li>
            <li> but i don&#x27;t know for sure about the wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I have bought this product from the company and have enjoyed it.  </li>
            <li> but I will go back to buying it from the company because the product is great!</li>
            <li> I have bought this from a person who sells it not on amazon and it worked great, this one not so much.</li>
            <li> Using it was interesting.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I am a Mary Kay user and I do love MK too.</li>
            <li> Great product, I really do see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> mostly it has minimized the redness and made my skin more even.</li>
            <li> I add my moisturizer &amp; eye cream on top after 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> It has done more then any name brands I have ever bought over the counter.</li>
            <li> I am still are hoping for even better results, we will see.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still trying to see if using longer will result in more benefits</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I hope others have better luck.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure this product is for me.</li>
            <li> Love the botanical smell, the tightening feel and most of all I love that I am seeing results.</li>
            <li> this is the fastest I&#x27;ve seen results. :)</li>
            <li> I will buy more of it when I run out.</li>
            <li> The sooner one uses this product the better it will work .</li>
            <li> I love Nerium night cream .</li>
            <li> I have some medical issues concerning my skin and this product helps my skin be the best it can be.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying more in about a month.</li>
            <li> How many products do we buy and end up throwing away because they do not work.  </li>
            <li> But then it started to get better and better.  </li>
            <li> Then Google if it&#x27;s safe and read something to the contrary.</li>
            <li> I would compare it top</li>
            <li> About the cream, my skin tone is more even.</li>
            <li> But did you know that ozone is even more poisonous</li>
            <li> Skin texture better.  </li>
            <li> Skin color better.</li>
            <li> I hesitated putting it on my face, but my curiosity got the better of me.</li>
            <li> Make sure you purchase from an authorized Nerium Brand Partner.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion - I really think it works great.</li>
            <li> and I still love it.</li>
            <li> and it seems like you should get a bit more.</li>
            <li> I have had so many people tell me about this product that I had to try it for myself.</li>
            <li> I love Nerium Ad.</li>
            <li> I even love the smell now.</li>
            <li> I am so glad some told me about this product.</li>
            <li> My skin has improved more in a couple weeks then in years.</li>
            <li> You owe it to yourself to try it if you want more radiant, smother skin.</li>
            <li> but I ran out wanted to order more</li>
            <li> I love the feel of it and the effects seem to be working.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 63 and still had breakouts around my chin mostly.  </li>
            <li> It has helped give my skin a better texture.</li>
            <li> Love the product just not this bottle.</li>
            <li> While they have done well slowing the signs of aging, they haven&#x27;t been able to reverse the signs...</li>
            <li> so you can use the cream for 7 days and if you would like to use it longer and buy it on their website, make sure to let them know that you wouldn&#x27;t like to keep it on the 29th day</li>
            <li> Three weeks in I saw that my skin had started to look better.</li>
            <li> I love the product.</li>
            <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Just ordered more and am trying the day cream too.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference and was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Another thing I love is that it is one product for all problems.</li>
            <li> It doesnt smell or feel healthy at all</li>
            <li> If you buy from an honest partner, they will help you get your Nerium Free.  </li>
            <li> That much better than getting your product at a cheaper cost hoping you are not getting an altered product.</li>
            <li> My pores are even showing more.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t get any more out.</li>
            <li> Interesting how Nerium showed a minimum of 30% improvement for EVERYONE IN EACH STUDY but not you?</li>
            <li> Those that are ignorant about an issue should educate themselves more before making a fool of themselves on the internet.</li>
            <li> the  breakouts are almost gone, I&#x27;m sure if I didn&#x27;t eat chocolate and seafood, the two things that trigger my Rosacea</li>
            <li> I would be even better</li>
            <li> The Nerium company uses a patented process to extract the safe portion of the oleander plant so all these folks saying the plant is posion do not understand this.</li>
            <li> Yes, if you eat an oleander leaf that isn&#x27;t safe.  </li>
            <li> but I do suggest you go to a reputable Nerium distributor.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> It works better than I was expecting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay if you don&#x27;t like it, it&#x27;s not for everyone.</li>
            <li> Love what it does for the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> you will get cheap!</li>
            <li> Within a week, the skin on my face felt more supple and that continued to improve.  </li>
            <li> Truth is truth, and I will not exaggerate for love or money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looks more \\&quot;moist\\&quot; and \\&quot;dewy\\&quot; and \\&quot;alive.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> After 4 weeks of use the love affair started to end, I just didn’t know it yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Nerium for over a year now and am pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> My &amp;#34;turkey neck&amp;#34; has shrunk noticeably but is still gobbling more than I wish.</li>
            <li> The cost (more than Nerium) and time commitment</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with what I have seen and will continue to use it until something better comes along.</li>
            <li> Ok, so a friend gave me a bottle to try.</li>
            <li> Some lines, like the ones on the top of my lips were gone.</li>
            <li> If you want to contact me for more info go to my web page and enter your email.</li>
            <li> Hives on top of hives.</li>
            <li> I was told that since more than thirty days had elapsed since I bought it, there was nothing they could do.</li>
            <li> the truth is, i didn&#x27;t notice any difference on my skin for the better if anything compared to over-the-counter creams</li>
            <li> and I feel i get more benefit from that) .</li>
            <li> I hope this answers some of the questions HOW Nerium AD it scientifically reduce wrinkles and promote skin health for a more youthful appearance.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid big money to skin aestheticians to do that and never had this kind of good result before!</li>
            <li> My first bottle lasted over 2 months!!!  </li>
            <li> HIGHLY REMCOMMEND!!!!!</li>
            <li> But so far so good!</li>
            <li> Utilizing this biotechnology research and breakthrough technology, NBI continues to harness the unique and effective properties of nature’s botanical compounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and hey we all get older why not be proud)</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really convinced after the first 30 days, but I still continued to use it and ended up being very happy.</li>
            <li> If the product was so great it would be sold in stores and by high end companies.  </li>
            <li> I can relate with the struggle of finding that perfect product that makes a long term difference; that is reliable.</li>
            <li> But it is a pretty good product</li>
            <li> My first review was good.  </li>
            <li> Both are pretty good products.</li>
            <li> mom became fairly successful at her business, but what really matters, is THE CEO&#x27;S DAUGHTER AND SON</li>
            <li> First, if you are purchasing Nerium  products on this site, good luck.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Buyer Beware&amp;#34; is a good statement to people who don&#x27;t buy the real thing!</li>
            <li> Most surprising was the improvement in the large pores on my nose.</li>
            <li> So excited!</li>
            <li> I was so excited by the presentation I went to, I jumped in to being a brand partner without even trying the product!</li>
            <li> In an MLM set up, you can easily make more than your upline.</li>
            <li> Makeup goes on more smoothly and I just look better.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews, saw the pics on the Internet, and thought it sounded too good to be true, but a friend reported great results so after months finally caved and tried it.  </li>
            <li> It does however give me a very clean soft complection and feels great.</li>
            <li> Yes, my results aren&#x27;t significant, but they are better than before and my skin feels better.  </li>
            <li> if you are thinking about this product, you are probably someone who is not horrified at the thought of spending this kind of money for face cream in the first place!</li>
            <li> The product has made a difference but not as remarkable as claimed and the cost is a bit high</li>
            <li> not deep pit scars, the redness that occurs on very fair skinned people that doesn&#x27;t seem to go away....</li>
            <li> I thought 8 months was giving it more than a chance to prove the claims for the product were genuine, and after that period of time I cancelled the monthly auto-delivery without issue.</li>
            <li> I would recommend buy from a rep the 1st time and get a free sample to make sure that it doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin.</li>
            <li> I have taken great care of my skin and do look somewhat young for my age.  </li>
            <li> she is a happy user so far.</li>
            <li> I have spent twice the norm on foundation to try to cover them up best</li>
            <li> It has Oleander Leaf Extract (poisonous plant) as a primary ingredient, and from what I understand, there is more than one type of Oleander.</li>
            <li> And remember, the most important thing is if you are going to sell this stuff, pls don&#x27;t involve your friends and family in to it...</li>
            <li> and I am really happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li> for the first time since before puberty i feel ok in my own skin, not worrying about sleeping over the boyfriends and not wanting to wash my face because i am embarrassed of my skin.</li>
            <li> Keeps skin more youthful, smooth, and wrinkles</li>
            <li> and therefore I will not be trying this product or becoming a part of a Ponzi</li>
            <li> And being able to earn the Night cream for free through the customer loyalty program with a Brand Partner is the way to go.</li>
            <li> do offer a customer incentive that if you refer three people you get yours free which was appealing to me at the time)  </li>
            <li> but I have seen incredible results on others that I personally know.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this for free.</li>
            <li> We began using it for burns and our family now refers to it as &amp;#34;Gold&amp;#34;  Nothing we have ever had works as fast and as good on burns etc.</li>
            <li> The powerful wrinkle fighters and antioxidants in Nerium AD help combat and reverse time&#x27;s effect on your skin because it helps PRODUCE your OWN collagen, PROMOTE elasticity, and PENETRATES moisture at the deepest layers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair complected, allergic to many things, have dry skin and am a smoker.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love that I&#x27;ve seen a difference without much effort!!!</li>
            <li> so I gave her my 1/2 used bottle and another full size bottle!</li>
            <li> Nerium is the best product I have ever spent $ on!</li>
            <li> The product is easy to apply and it&#x27;s been a ritual for me.</li>
            <li> From then on all I ever heard from my mom was how great the company is, how great the product works (even though I never noticed a difference, and my boyfriend always complained of the smell), and how she believes in the product.</li>
            <li> and she started seeing the amazing results, and knows why we love the product so much.</li>
            <li> but I get stressed out easily</li>
            <li> it goes away very quickly after applying.</li>
            <li> My up-line, for whom I have the greatest respect and affection, is surely embarrassed by this, I&#x27;m sure, and since she is relatively elevated within the organization&#x27;s ranks, I&#x27;m sure this will cause some reverberating action at the highest levels.  </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s begin my saying most of us brand partners use our own photos from our real customers</li>
            <li> Use going to bed, easy to apply and no odor.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my mom, arrived very quickly, and she loves it.</li>
            <li> You can easily do that without having to go to Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it works quite well on my chest where I wrinkle easily.  </li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it to anyone, regardless of age.</li>
            <li> really upset me the most, is that not one person I talked to or emailed expressed any comment or concern about my allergic reaction, or even what kind of allergic reaction I had.</li>
            <li> I know it is too strong for some people and may cause a rash</li>
            <li> So you have to ask yourself the question -- if they are using their own product why don&#x27;t they look as good as their before and after photos look on the various Nerium advertising websites?  </li>
            <li> It also had a strong, unattractive smell to it.</li>
            <li> At first, using the product seemed AMAZING</li>
            <li> At first I really liked my results but over time Nerium clogged my pores around my chin.  </li>
            <li> But Nerium is one bottle full of magic.</li>
            <li> this &amp;#34;quick meeting&amp;#34; was a sales pitch on trying to get people to become brand partners with promises of ipads, Lexus, and even being able to quit your full time job.</li>
            <li> I first learned about Nerium because I noticed that my 75 year old Mother was looking more beautiful every time I saw her (which is about once or twice a month).</li>
            <li> Then I use a cotton-round moistened with warm water to remove the make-up first, then the eye make-up.</li>
            <li> Reading the comments here, this is definitely true:)</li>
            <li> It was nice when it was first applied but after 1 minute it would get sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best face cream I’ve ever used.</li>
            <li> It did nothing for any fine lines or wrinkles either.</li>
            <li> I still see the fine lines around my eyes and mouth.</li>
            <li> Evens skin tone, shrinks pores, gets rid of fine lines.</li>
            <li> The product had no effect on my fine lines, texture or firmness, as it claimed it would do.</li>
            <li> skin was fine and luminous, but a friend of mine insisted I give it a try, she is a Brand</li>
            <li> This product has been known to cause rashes, and the Oleander plant has way too many side effects (most including hospitalization or death) for me to be remotely interested in purchases, or working for this &amp;#34;business&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I noticed my skin filling out, fine lines disapearred.</li>
            <li> parents have used the product to reduce lines and sun spots and minimized the appearance of fine lines.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smooths condition of skin…reduces fine lines.</li>
            <li> It has cleared my complexion and is minimizing my fine lines.</li>
            <li> and I have not seen a difference with fine lines.</li>
            <li> and you will be fine.</li>
            <li> (It is fine, by the way:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I can see improvement in the fine ines and wrinkles on my forehead.</li>
            <li> The appearance of fine lines has diminished.  </li>
            <li> Some people may be fine with this product but for those of you that have an allergic reaction, look out.  </li>
            <li> Smells fine.</li>
            <li> Another thing I figured out was that you don&#x27;t need 4 pumps like they recommend because 2 pumps works just fine.</li>
            <li> and I have bags under my eyes and on my chin and have NEVER had the fine lines I have since using this product.  </li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t need to worry about fine lines and wrinkles just yet.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this works wonders for many people, but unfortunately I&#x27;m not one of them.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> This product is for helping reduce fine lines etc ...</li>
            <li> so i was woW pleasantly</li>
            <li> Amazing changes, and a hugely positive group.</li>
            <li> Ive noticed an improvement in my skin..especially helping smooth out fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li> What I have seen is that realistic people are very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> We know that good genes and a good nutrition help alot and a little botox here and there.</li>
            <li> Huge bonus...</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2weeks now and have noticed a huge improvement to face ,neck ,and chest.</li>
            <li> I can tell a huge difference in my skin when I tried to change from it.</li>
            <li> The results I am seeing from friends that are using it are being told by their reps what a huge difference it&#x27;s making when it&#x27;s literally nothing.  </li>
            <li> I even used it on my décolletage and notice a huge improvement with the wrinkles and look of it.</li>
            <li> Well after 3 weeks and huge sores, itchy rashed up skin</li>
            <li> , I sell Nerium on line which completely takes away your wrinkles and is the best cream ever made, may I ask how old you are</li>
            <li> and I have seen a huge difference in my face just after one week of using this product.</li>
            <li> sister in law had these huge bags under her eyes.?  </li>
            <li> I have been on it for just 30 days and see HUGE results.</li>
            <li> I even saw a huge difference in the brown spots on my face in the one application</li>
            <li> but I saw immediate and huge improvements.  </li>
            <li> My husband had a huge age spot on his cheek</li>
            <li> I do have a reaction to the day cream where if I use more than 3 pumps and no water my skin burns and turns bright red.</li>
            <li> If you actually follow the directions and use it correctly you will have great results.  </li>
            <li> A great preventative maintenance for younger people.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for women who want to smooth their skin.</li>
            <li> Use a spray bottle to lightly mist your forehead and eyes.</li>
            <li> I had tons of product as they give you free product every time you turn around,  </li>
            <li> I received this product as a free trial</li>
            <li> the next day I look great.</li>
            <li> I will just use it when I go out for something important.</li>
            <li> and she asked to meet with me to give me a free sample of the Age Defying Night Cream.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this item free from my sister-in-law.  </li>
            <li> I am sure these ingredients are absorbed through the skin.  </li>
            <li> Still seeing if this stuff works, but people are telling me I look younger and how great my skin looks.  </li>
            <li> I have earned my free Lexus within a year.</li>
            <li> I get my product for free every month.</li>
            <li> Also it is extremely important to take before and after photos</li>
            <li> Immediately I was bombarded by 3 people sending me private messages telling me how great this skin care product was and that I should try it myself and that I could make a career out of it.</li>
            <li> so looks are important in my career (Cosmetology).</li>
            <li> I found I was putting on the product incorrectly but found a distributor with Nerium and got fantastic results after 30 days because they taught me how to use the product correctly</li>
            <li> You get one free product for every person you bring in.</li>
            <li> Every person gets one free product for every person they bring in.</li>
            <li> My skin is firmer and my age spots are disappearing and my skin feels fabulous.  </li>
            <li> took before pictures, did a free 5 day trial, and noticed a difference already.</li>
            <li> I feels light and tightening.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see how you can sell this so cheap when the price to get it as a rep is $80.00.  </li>
            <li> I can honestly say that this product works, so much so that I decided to get into the business because it did what it said it would do.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to the same great results that she has received.</li>
            <li> AMAZING, this really works, and I have tried everything...</li>
            <li> They gave me a free bottle</li>
            <li> My face hasn&#x27;t been this smooth since I was pre-pubescent.</li>
            <li> 2) take makeup free photos before and after 30, 60, 90 days?    </li>
            <li> It is important for people to know that this product can be life threatening.</li>
            <li> product does seem to smooth skin.  </li>
            <li> I swear my 3 day tester from a representative did fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Use it to smooth out acne scars.</li>
            <li> I was given a free trial bottle to try for one week.&lt;br /&gt;From</li>
            <li> My skin is now flawless and even though I have not lost weight my face appears thinner because m skin is toned again and is firm with no sagging.  </li>
            <li> I had also at the same time experienced allergies (outdoor - mold/pollen) and had been taking allergy medicine.  </li>
            <li> and he confirmed my conclusion.</li>
            <li> you do not get the company guarentee and it has been discovered that products not sold by a brand partner have been altered even bottles filled with immation products.  </li>
            <li> The quote &amp;#34;your on Fire&amp;#34; actually works great on her agenda.</li>
            <li> You want to go cheap</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t be guaranteed that this product is the genuine thing because your buying it from a non brand partner.</li>
            <li> I can get my product for free if I buy from a brand partner?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> An ultrasound confirmed I now have thyroiditis.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on day 5 of a free trial of this product.</li>
            <li> Some deep ones around my chin were greatly diminished and the bags under my eyes were gone.</li>
            <li> It is a different way of distribution,  The good companies spend more money on product development and paying the distributors instead of warehousing and advertising.</li>
            <li> At 40 years old I want to look as good as I can</li>
            <li> What nerium is best for, for me, is smoothing upper lip lines very well.</li>
            <li> I , with good conscious , could not recommend anyone using this product.</li>
            <li> , how good does it work, how has it worked for others and if others like it as far as reviews go.</li>
            <li> &quot; in fact, I love her results so much that I got online today to find out more about the product that she is using.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I did not notice any significant difference in fine lines or wrinkles on my neck.  </li>
            <li> Go to WWW.Nerium.com for the real deal!!!</li>
            <li> and she told me that&#x27;s very rare</li>
            <li> so I feel for as much exposure as I get they look pretty good.</li>
            <li> So glad to be able to use a simple system, totally natural and botanical product with great results.</li>
            <li> I was then told that the special would no longer be available to me if I interrupted the auto delivery.</li>
            <li> So I decided to try the free for life special they had going.  </li>
            <li> This special was if you preorder the $80 night cream for 3 months you will receive their day cream free forever.  </li>
            <li> Entire family uses it, absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> The first week I noticed better texture.</li>
            <li> This miraculous product, in fact, was originally made to cure cancer.</li>
            <li> Aloe Vera extracts from the Nerium oleander plant, collecting both plants unique qualities to make NAE-8 extract.</li>
            <li> The first morning, I noticed that my face looked more youthful.  </li>
            <li> I was excited by these results</li>
            <li> My original plan was to try this for 5 days</li>
            <li> , I am pretty sure this cream is the culprit.</li>
            <li> I had some hormonal acne, which is why I originally started using Nerium.</li>
            <li> While I didn&#x27;t see a significant change in wrinkles</li>
            <li> After 1 week of treatment I saw a significant improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to try it.  </li>
            <li> but this gives me motivation that I&#x27;ll look better when that&#x27;s accomplished!  </li>
            <li> So it is obvious they are disgruntled because they weren&#x27;t successful.</li>
            <li> Another thing, if you aren&#x27;t using the product properly you will not have successful results.</li>
            <li> People have told me that I am glowing, they love my sparkle, my complexion looks so pretty.</li>
            <li> /&gt;NOT WORTH WHAT THEY CHARGE!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure the rash is some sort of fungal rash.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I was excited to use it</li>
            <li> she seemed really friendly talking about the sunglasses</li>
            <li> It is worth the money!</li>
            <li> Gotten so many compliments is not even funny.</li>
            <li> My wrinkles were significantly reduced.</li>
            <li> and yes it also takes time to build enough to be able to spend more quality time with your family!</li>
            <li> One order from a warehouse not the original product and it would not dispense.</li>
            <li> First of all I want people to realize there are many &amp;#34;Multi-Level Marketing Anti-Aging Cream Wars&amp;#34</li>
            <li> nothing they weren&#x27;t more than willing to accommodate and rectify once communication was established.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product</li>
            <li> It claims to be able to make fine lines and wrinkles disappear but doesn&#x27;t really help.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t allow the hardness of others to prevent you from experiencing a possibly great product that might work for you and make you feel a little better about yourself.  </li>
            <li> Most importantly, my oil is to a very minimum and dryness is under control.</li>
            <li> After I applied the day cream this morning, I ended up with a huge bright red rash covering my neck.  </li>
            <li> I felt more comfortable buying it straight from the source.</li>
            <li> but I love the day cream, it is a nice moisturizer without being greasy and it helps even out my skin tone, I have tried lots of skin care products and this has actually made a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> Honestly, my face feels much better after I wash it with a simple exfoliate.</li>
            <li> It feels so good when you put it on and, it really does do absolute wonders for your skin.</li>
            <li> pleasant to use, however so I did use it regularly</li>
            <li> Well one day I purchased this product because so many people around me was using it and everyone had nothing but positive things to say about it</li>
            <li> I have noticed positive changes, mostly in the décolleté area.</li>
            <li> There are many skin care products on the market suggested for certain purposes and conditions.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t sell this, so I&#x27;m writing this review purely because I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li> AND THERE IS NOTHING SPECIAL ABOUT</li>
            <li> Yea, right!  </li>
            <li> but if you have achne it clears you RIGHT UP!</li>
            <li> exaggerate the outcome (especially considering the amazon reviews I have read), and perpetuate a happy lifestyle with magazines, conferences, ads, word of mouth praise, social networking advertising among friends and family, etc, when in fact something like this is not going to make someone more happy than they were before, and as such is an illusion portrayed by the media moguls and marketing cons like Jeff Olson, CEO of Nerium Int.</li>
            <li> The get rich quick nature of these schemes.</li>
            <li> rich quickly schemes</li>
            <li> Her face was swollen, her eyes were swollen shut, there were watery bags underneath her eyes and her skin was bright red!  </li>
            <li> Made my face turn bright red and the product burned after applying.  </li>
            <li> There are better things out there that really does work.</li>
            <li> I feel like the skin looks good enough to go without!</li>
            <li> My own experiences allow me to express with complete honesty the miraculous outcomes of using Nerium Ad.</li>
            <li> I used it faithfully for one full year.  </li>
            <li> I also love that my nightly routine is much shorter.</li>
            <li> ,ll go back to my daily routine, honestly there are great products out there, mine is Skinmedica, but Neutrogena, Aveeno or Murad are amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> I gave it a fair shake and used it for 2 months back in August of 2012.  </li>
            <li> I began to have full blown cystic acne.  </li>
            <li> I would consider your own skin, whether it is sensitive, prone to acne, etc.</li>
            <li> This product works well when left on for 30-45 minutes and then add your moisturizer (really good one).</li>
            <li> It made perfect sense, I also told her I too found the negative review on the oleander plant</li>
            <li> I used the cream religiously every night after taking a shower from November 2011 all the way until May of 2013 (a good 18+ months).</li>
            <li> I decided to stop drinking sodas and Arizona Iced Teas, which are FULL of sugar.</li>
            <li> No way I would spend that much money on this product, it is toxic and it&#x27;s all about making money for the people at the top.</li>
            <li> While this may be true, think about what it entails and how it affects the people that are the underdogs in the business.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see what will change after using this product for a full year.</li>
            <li> I had no idea that Amazon was selling this product - I came to see it that was indeed true.</li>
            <li> It is a full on allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li> Returning it today for my full refund.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it works for others, but having used it 2 full months, correctly, no results were visible what-so-ever.</li>
            <li> After one full bottle there were no visible results.</li>
            <li> I gave the product a full 30 days to evaluate.  </li>
            <li> I have good skin and look younger than I am but do experience tone issues.  </li>
            <li> You can return the product for a full refund.</li>
            <li> and the cool thing is....</li>
            <li> and the cool thing is....</li>
            <li> so I decided to give it a full 30 day try.</li>
            <li> Many woman want to see results NOW, but don&#x27;t want to take the time to take care of the real problem.</li>
            <li> This product on my 67 year old skin that has seen many seasons of LOTS of sun, is really doing a nice job.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t drink the cool aid kids.</li>
            <li> My husband and children however have told me I look much better even though I don&#x27;t see it as much.</li>
            <li> This cream was more like a very drying mask.</li>
            <li> The full bottle I received from Blue Bell through Amazon lasted me a good 2 months.  </li>
            <li> it was exciting she was excited she showed me pics that I knew could not be changed by product alone.</li>
            <li> This to me in the end is just another marketing / get rich quick program more than a break through new</li>
            <li> My favorite night cream ever that I cannot live without!</li>
            <li> Ultimately, nothing has made me more satisfied than Nerium Ad.</li>
            <li> The effect has only gotten better and my skin looks more even-toned and &amp;#34;glowey.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> It is ok but way to much money for a months worth of product.</li>
            <li> so i noticed a change quickly.</li>
            <li> Luckily she told me to cancel my subscription because she couldn&#x27;t keep up with her account, my brother&#x27;s account, and both of my grandma&#x27;s accounts.</li>
            <li> Luckily she told me to cancel my subscription because she couldn&#x27;t keep up with her account, my brother&#x27;s account, and both of my grandma&#x27;s accounts.</li>
            <li> Also like how quickly the mask dries when I put it on at night.</li>
            <li> The product was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I did get it quickly</li>
            <li> My &amp;#34;friend&amp;#34; invited me to dinner and said she had to stop by a quick meeting for Nerium and asked if I minded coming along.</li>
            <li> The simplest thing is the quick start program.</li>
            <li> The pressure to get people signed up quickly.</li>
            <li> and if someone tries to sell you that &amp;#34;I love making my own hours and working when I want to</li>
            <li> This product is extraordinary.</li>
            <li> My favorite facial product! :)</li>
            <li> I had tremendous results.</li>
            <li> I was intimidated by the pressure to have parties and market the product without really seeing much improvement in my own skin after 2 months.</li>
            <li> Arrives quickly and never disappoints.</li>
            <li> At first it was love at first site.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Hoping to get more better result later...</li>
            <li> I love the products, my steadily growing business and the people I work with in the business.  </li>
            <li> And the other ones after reading them sound too good to be true.</li>
            <li> but we&#x27;re into being healthy and using organic, high quality products and foods.</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer said, Neutrogena&#x27;s Ageless line is better - and if you want to go a price point down from that, Walmart&#x27;s Equate line is pretty darn good too.</li>
            <li> I have stopped getting Botox because my wrinkles have improved so much I would recommend you try this quick and easy solution to your aging skin needs.......</li>
            <li> I am so happy to know that other people are noticing a difference!</li>
            <li> I am however very sensetive to strong perfume</li>
            <li> the fact they didn&#x27;t talk much about the science of the product, which my boyfriend was more interested in.</li>
            <li> (he is 18 and easily Googled some REAL information), and found that the product was made from a poisonous plant, and how it can affect your skin when the toxin is applied.</li>
            <li> overall pretty good product.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easier to use than the skin care I normally use and is more cost effective than current product.  </li>
            <li> REALLY!!</li>
            <li> I feel foolish for not educating myself first, before putting it on my face!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try Nerium at first.  </li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nerium for several months and love it, it truly works wonders!</li>
            <li> My first bottle lasted three months!</li>
            <li> but I must say that I saw immediate results after the first day!  </li>
            <li> When I received it, I used it the first night and could not use it again, because the pump on the bottle would not work!  </li>
            <li> It does make your skin feel very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really have any lines to smooth, but I do like the way it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t explain exactly, but it was like my skin looked firmer and more full, like it was in my early 20s.  </li>
            <li> How cheap the product really is when you subtract all the commissions and bonuses for all the layers of people within the MLM organization.</li>
            <li> The incredible number of negative reviews on Amazon about this product.</li>
            <li> Of course everybody is different and not everything works for everybody, but this stuff has truly been amazing.  </li>
            <li> So much for the free for life..........</li>
            <li> Do they offer that kind of money back guarantee in the salon or in the cosmetic section of the department stores?  </li>
            <li> am so glad that I am trying a sample and did not waste my money, just wish I had not tried it at all.</li>
            <li> From my own personal experience?...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth a try</li>
            <li> If you are going to seminars and they are telling you to push up good reviews and telling you your bottles are your employees to sign up more people to become agents for the company then just step back from that and think about it for a second.  </li>
            <li> This Night cream does miracles, smooth&#x27;s out my pours, relaxes the wrinkles, lightens some age spots :) makes me feel younger.</li>
            <li> (these were on my body, rarely ever my face where the cream was being applied) went away after 2 days.  </li>
            <li> Use on freshly cleaned face.  </li>
            <li> He is called the &amp;#34;millionaire-maker&amp;#34; and the money comes directly from those most in need of funds and goes to himself and his 1% in the &amp;#34;Nerium family&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Not all skin products are for everyone but this one is worth trying.</li>
            <li> I recently did some research and have learned that oleander, an ingredient in Nerium AD, is a toxic substance that can kill skin cells and it is being studied to see if it can effectively kill cancer cells.  </li>
            <li> 34 year old son is also enjoying the shaving experience improved with fewer ingrown</li>
            <li> wow - I love it.  </li>
            <li> So one lady said she had over 3 months worth of product and called to complain to Nerium about her issue</li>
            <li> the success he was experiencing</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s totally worth the price</li>
            <li> I am actually 54 yrs old (lol)</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li> Protect yourself from aging with this powerful cream.</li>
            <li> I spent thousands of dollars on aestheticians trying to get my skin looking good</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products, professional products.</li>
            <li> now has skin that glows and makes her look much more alive.</li>
            <li> skin looks a lot better than some people I know who are in their early 40&#x27;s!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It honestly looked like she had been injected with red jelly all over her face!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s worth a try for anyone.</li>
            <li> (smile)</li>
            <li> Worth a try.</li>
            <li> and it said it was safe for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> All these things (and there are more natural things that can go on your face like chamomile and aloe vera)</li>
            <li> I took before and after photos (after photos 14 days later) and honestly there was NO difference.  </li>
            <li> I just used finished using Nerium for 7 days and my friends at work, my husband, and my 13 and 16 year old sons said my skin looks better.  </li>
            <li> Better to go directly through Nerium.</li>
            <li> The pictures were taken on my own iPhone and never left my possession</li>
            <li> This allows you to get 6-8 weeks worth versus just 4.  </li>
            <li> I recommended it to my 76 year old mother who has many wrinkles from years of smoking.</li>
            <li> (only laser does that effectively)</li>
            <li> and I think this product is worth you giving it a try.  </li>
            <li> One thing is for sure you can tell it is a natural product</li>
            <li> It is not what I was hoping for but still the tightness and increase in skin elasticity is better than anything I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> In fact, hyaluronic acid has been promoted as a &amp;#34;fountain of youth.&amp;#34; Its the only known ingredient to man that will hold up to 1000 times its own weight in water....</li>
            <li> -IN-LAW came down to visit my mom AT OUR HOUSE, BEFORE she became successful or knew her story, to help build her business.</li>
            <li> The only people that got rich were those at the top of the pyramid.  </li>
            <li> Super fast shipping (to Guam)!</li>
            <li> This company chooses the relationship marketing for this product for that very reason and if I was the founder of this amazing product I would have it no other way.  </li>
            <li> This was not exactly what I wanted, but it is good.</li>
            <li> night I cleanse my face with neutrogena original bar soap and gently exfoliate with a washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shipped fast, sealed in original container</li>
            <li> This company sends too much product and is not user friendly.</li>
            <li> helps with wrinkle, but you have to keep using it every night to have it work right</li>
            <li> I was given a bottle of Nerium AD Age Defying Night Cream and used it and could tell right off that it wasn&#x27;t going to work for me.</li>
            <li> Right off the bat</li>
            <li> The head brand partner looked like she had a bunch of botox done on her, and I knew right away that this was a pyramid scheme by the way they were presenting the rewards program and</li>
            <li> We were pressured right then and there to sign up, and my mom paid for us to sign up</li>
            <li> I canceled the order right away.  </li>
            <li> Right now all I can say is</li>
            <li> I eagerly await a civil response to my efforts to recoup my investment, and hope they can find a way to do the right thing.</li>
            <li> you can feel it working right after you put it on.</li>
            <li> So that right there tells me</li>
            <li> Your price was right for me.  </li>
            <li> Just normal ageing skin, including the fine lines and loss of elasticity.</li>
            <li> she barely looks in her early 30&#x27;s, although she&#x27;s taken good care of her skin for decades (she just turned 48).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m proud to say I have minimal fine line wrinkles at the corner of my left eye and none on my right.</li>
            <li> I used it for 5 days as a free trial last month and didn&#x27;t really notice much but liked the way it felt on my face.</li>
            <li> For sure iis not worthy the 157 $, Product for sure do not deliver what promised by seller.</li>
            <li> but my skin looks smooth and nice with less notice</li>
            <li> Not only I, but many friends as well, have seen tremendous results using this product.</li>
            <li> Taking the risk to look past the skepticism of the marketing side of the product was a wonderful decision, as I found that the claims, of Nerium Ad doing miracles far beyond its guarantee, were very much true.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I still have laugh lines, which I don&#x27;t really mind yet, but my skin CRAVES nerium!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why there is all this negativity posted, it&#x27;s great stuff.</li>
            <li> The sales representative takes these &amp;#34;before/after&amp;#34; pictures that show remarkable results in just a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Report them to their attorney general of their state and better business bureau.</li>
            <li> That isn&#x27;t true really.  </li>
            <li> Almost all of the dark areas are gone now and my skin looks really good.  </li>
            <li> Our new anti aging product for the brain EHT is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I did not jump right into selling it because I had to see results first and truly believe in it 100% before I could sell it...</li>
            <li> No single thing is THAT much better than anything</li>
            <li> know two people that received their Lexus vehicles plus bonus (Nerium incentives) and host many parties at their house, mainly to help out brand partners sign up new customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have good skin, but it is sensitive and prone to breakouts (especially on my forehead).  </li>
            <li> much and don&#x27;t deliver the same kind of results this product does.</li>
            <li> Although this helped smooth out my skin and help with some blackheads, I have a feeling that&#x27;s because I was being more careful about my face washing.</li>
            <li> Renee is the co-owner and their website says, \\&quot;her generous and compassionate heart is appreciated by all who work with her.\\&quot; I can tell you straight up that this is a huge lie.</li>
            <li> Half loved it</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s been in the hot sun, if it&#x27;s full, or if it&#x27;s the real deal.  </li>
            <li> I read most of the reviews, negatives and positives, it really sucks that this amazing product didn&#x27;t work on them.  </li>
            <li> and yes I do have sensitive skin, However there should be a strong warning for anyone using this product.  </li>
            <li> The wrinkles are very much still here.</li>
            <li> I like it very much and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> The MLM network - the way that this company works is to maximize savings in advertising by promising anyone willing to do the yee old pyramid scheme style marketing act that they can somehow make a decent and quick buck, perhaps alot more.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you something really quick, this product works and the only people I know that haven&#x27;t liked it, are people who expect every wrinkle to vanish, but lets also be clear, this isn&#x27;t botox</li>
            <li> fine wrinkles on my 59 year old face and neck.</li>
            <li> When I first tried the product it left me skin very smooth.</li>
            <li> It was really quite funny!  </li>
            <li> A little over priced, but it lasts a good while.</li>
            <li> But in all honesty, it is better to order from a Brand Partner to ensure you receive a Guaranteed 30 Day Money Back Guarantee.</li>
            <li> I was told to give it more time and not only did they swear it would work, but the auto-delivery discount would kick in</li>
            <li> Followed the instructions exactly and as suggested, took photographs every month to document my progress...</li>
            <li> I did a cleanse after that, and am glad I didn&#x27;t spend all the money to buy the actual product.  </li>
            <li> The first ingredient in their product is Oleander, a 100% poisonous plant.  </li>
            <li> should have done my research first, but it was coming from a friend</li>
            <li> Someone could easily empty it out and replace it with another kind of skin lotion.</li>
            <li> (I used way too much product in the beginning!</li>
            <li> ;) Now I know better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> With avid studies, researchers, including Dr. Robert A. Newman, found ways to produce this miraculous product safely allowing the use of it topically and assuring no harm if accidentally ingested.</li>
            <li> Love your friends and family even if they annoy you by constantly trying to get you to sign up as a company agent.  </li>
            <li> For the first time in 33 years, I have clear, smooth skin-</li>
            <li> Really, really works!</li>
            <li> Besides the smell, my burning and itching eyes and the POISONOUS ingredients, it also costs WAY more money than I would EVER spend on facial products.</li>
            <li> I would definitely order more when this is finished.</li>
            <li> If I had actually had the product for more than 4 days, even up to 30 days and had goneover the time limit for the money back guarantee, sure, by all means, hold up the policy.</li>
            <li> It has definitely made my skin look better and reduced winkles.</li>
            <li> saw a difference after the first use.</li>
            <li> When I first started using Nerium</li>
            <li> After 4 months I began having pretty severe bags under my eyes along with some swelling around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> The change didn&#x27;t happen over night, just like no product but the first week I saw progress and about 4 months</li>
            <li> My first bottle of Nerium was purchased from a partner seller from Nerium</li>
            <li> Skin is smooth (but my old moisturizer did that too).  </li>
            <li> I used consistently for a while</li>
            <li> Im not even remotely interested in the business end of it, or the pryamid part of it.</li>
            <li> When you wash it off in the morning, your face is smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> The first morning after applying the cream I woke with my face feeling like it had plastic wrap pressed to it.</li>
            <li> they are pleased with enough to keep purchasing.  </li>
            <li> 30 day money back guarantee, we felt confident in giving it a try.  </li>
            <li> I am confident all 250 five stars reviews were left by marketing reps</li>
            <li> rare for any real product...</li>
            <li> I hope this review helps some worried first timer.  </li>
            <li> I love the way my face feels the next morning after I rinse off the mask.  </li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t willing to properly research and will believe the first thing your eyes ponder upon, its no wonder so many people are so mislead.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t love it after 25 days, call nerium and tell them youwant your money back!</li>
            <li> I am not an avid review-writer, but have to share my Nerium experience.</li>
            <li> I noticed the last two days that my skin was feeling pretty warm after application, but didn&#x27;t really think much of it.  </li>
            <li> , I just want to look in the mirror and feel like my entire face is more nourished looking and lines aren&#x27;t so noticeable.</li>
            <li> I only started a week ago but already fell in love with this.</li>
            <li> at first her rosacea flared up, and all she could think was &amp;</li>
            <li> I believe in nerium, for me personally it has evened out my skin tone, shrank my pores, and has given my skin a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell at first but got use to it.</li>
            <li> The product seems to be working pretty good so far although I haven&#x27;t been using it for long.</li>
            <li> Skin appears younger and more radiant.</li>
            <li> and my skin tone is much more even with smaller pores.  </li>
            <li> It is quite funny to me that there are two kinds of reviews on here about this product.</li>
            <li> It could simply be that I&#x27;m taking better care of my skin now -- I was never in the habit of washing my face before bed before I started using Nerium.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this product! :)</li>
            <li> first use</li>
            <li> , what exactly it was.</li>
            <li> Many have posted of such occurances yet the company will always hold its motto of user friendliness.</li>
            <li> I wish I could retract my first review.</li>
            <li> If anyone out there knows of something that REALLY works, please advise!  </li>
            <li> it looked like i had been scalded with hot water</li>
            <li> Now, first of all if you do get involved</li>
            <li> Funny, these people say they have time freedom but want you on calls and events every week on evenings and weekends,...</li>
            <li> the first time i got this item</li>
            <li> i felt it was great thick.  </li>
            <li> Most of my friends spend about the same price on facials, nails, hair, etc.</li>
            <li> the shake smells EXACTLY like this product.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty sure you won&#x27;t go back!</li>
            <li> Within first month of using Nerium 80% of my issues cleared up.</li>
            <li> my 21 year old...doesn&#x27;t use it consistently.  </li>
            <li> but I recommend it to anyone even slightly interested.</li>
            <li> (perhaps the results that she has seen have occurred over time, and with consistent use).</li>
            <li> Smells funny?</li>
            <li> At first I did see changes in my skin, got rid of a lot of Sun damage.</li>
            <li> prompt response product exactly what specified.</li>
            <li> Please make sure you have the correct instructions/information prior to posting a review.    </li>
            <li> This really works!</li>
            <li> I started using it the first week of January.</li>
            <li> I dampen face &amp; hands first with water, then one pump of product spreads on face &amp; neck, remaining on hands and arms.  </li>
            <li> these photos are not fake.</li>
            <li> The owners are millionaires who think that the world revolves around them and are willing to trample on and chew up anyone who comes in their way.</li>
            <li> I was really hopeful!  </li>
            <li> Cleared my breakouts and overall texture was better.</li>
            <li> This is the first bottle I purchased of the night cream.  </li>
            <li> When I first started the night cream, I did not like the scent and my skin</li>
            <li> I was made aware of it from a friend who bought into this</li>
            <li> I literally could not leave this on my face for more than ten minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taught to recognize a pyramid scheme - and this is exactly how it works.</li>
            <li> I am still on my first one.</li>
            <li> It feels very healing!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s most likely a scam.</li>
            <li> It burned the first time I wiped it on.  </li>
            <li> I saw the results on the person I bought it from first.</li>
            <li> I planned to stop using it at the first sign of redness.</li>
            <li> they are REAL caring people and WANT to meet you!</li>
            <li> they are REAL caring people and WANT to meet you!</li>
            <li> so I know they are the real deal!</li>
            <li> Going back to what I have used for 8 years and LOVE...</li>
            <li> and I havnt noticed a visible improvement after consistent use.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the day cream in about 2 weeks because I forgot to order more, and my skin just doesn&#x27;t look the same.</li>
            <li> It arrived as sceduled and it was exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> I am 74 and did not think anything would help me at this age, but this is the first product I have tried that does help.</li>
            <li> Why go and listen to a person who obviously didn&#x27;t apply themselves and has to put blame somewhere else to feel better about themselves.</li>
            <li> Wow and if your still thinking cheap?</li>
            <li> I gave it to her and told her to try it first and not spend her money on it.  </li>
            <li> I think we all hope that we have found something that finally is able to help us look younger.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews but after reading so much nonsense</li>
            <li> (Please...ladies let&#x27;s be real!)  </li>
            <li> I know many people currently using the product and those that have tried it for a shorter time and not one has shared the outrage I read here.</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s skin is different and there may be a lot of folks who took better care of their skin than I did.</li>
            <li> and it was pretty pricey.  </li>
            <li> a few days ago I have really good skin,</li>
            <li> some good AHA (alpha hydroxy acid) cream to speed up sloughing of dead skins cells and brown spots.   </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t see results in that first 30 days you have to \\&quot;keep using it, give it a chance, it will work!!\\&quot;  The VAST majority of people will be able to achieve similar results with a good over the counter cream at a fraction of the price...especially those who do not regularly use a face cream right now.  </li>
            <li> I read so many reviews and just didn&#x27;t get enough positive feed back to feel confident in what it would do.</li>
            <li> Then mist our cheeks, chin and neck, administer one more pump and swiftly smooth it on the lower half of your face and neck.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, however, I will most likely purchase another bottle of Nerium in the hopes of seeing positive results.  </li>
            <li> Any BP who receives their kit in the mail is surely going to open these items and look at them, especially since they&#x27;re excited about going into business!  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few year and my skin looks great for a 72 year old!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t sell this stuff, nor am I interested in marketing, I just want to give my positive unbiased feedback.</li>
            <li> The first week I noticed positive results.</li>
            <li> My skin was bright red and burning almost instantly.</li>
            <li> Though, can you imagine tackling most issues with one product; one product that actually makes a real difference?</li>
            <li> those of you unaware Nerium is the latest economic evolution of multi-level marketing (MLM).</li>
            <li> Thanks recent San Jose &#x27;leadership weekend&#x27; designed to get more punters in the MLM downline.  </li>
            <li> I have read so many negative reviews, most come from</li>
            <li> I am in my mid 60&#x27;s but have had cosmetic surgery and look a good 10 to 12 years younger than I am</li>
            <li> Also noticed on some of the pictures of before and after, the people after, have their necks stretched up higher than the before pictures, would account for the neck looking better.</li>
            <li> I became a Brand Partner back in June of last year at the urging of a good friend of mine, who lives in California.  </li>
            <li> very drying to my wife&#x27;s skin, actually seemed  more wrinkled, though did tend to decrease brown spots.</li>
            <li> Beware the positive reviews are written by</li>
            <li> Get positive comments all the time.</li>
            <li> I have dark spots from sun damage and they are noticeably fading and my skin feels amazing.  </li>
            <li> Nerium works for me by fading minor sunspots (including on the top of my hands)</li>
            <li> That being said, playing devil&#x27;s advocate, even if the product were to work exactly as advertised there is no mistake in its business model and the real company&#x27;s goals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> First of all it&#x27;s a bunch of pushy multi-level marketing fools that have zero clue about skin care trying to make a fast buck.</li>
            <li> the counterfeit is probably at least as effective as Nerium so who cares!  </li>
            <li> really like it  interested in another order</li>
            <li> Fast forward to today, a month since I have used Nerium and my neck, shoulders, arms and torso are all still covered with a very itchy rash!</li>
            <li> I have been using a year now &amp; all my issues are pretty much gone.</li>
            <li> I have found several other products that work great.</li>
            <li> It seems to be old and the bottle does not appear to be full.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nerium  for approximately 6 months - it has been good to my 59 yr old face :)</li>
            <li> I can say that while it is on, your face feels tight and looks better ( but you wouldn&#x27;t wear it out!).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different lines of both high end and drugstore products.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This prompted me to do some more research, and I found many other people that had similar symptoms.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many other creams, most have numerous \\&quot;steps\\&quot; (serum, toner, cream, something for eyes...) &amp; cost hundreds of dollars.</li>
            <li> This product was okay, I have used  other products that were similar in price for better results for my combination skin.</li>
            <li> Daily sun screen, hydration, healthy diet, and other modalities (laser, peels, Botox) work better.</li>
            <li> I am very excited to confess that Nerium Ad has not only tackled those main concerns, but I also almost never get severe breakouts.</li>
            <li> But imagine all the free advertising they get from you posting on FB and social media.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping it would reduce my pore size, get rid of my mild adult acne and diminish the hyper pigmentation on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> Also, the trick to using it - make sure your skin is still damp when you put it on or it won&#x27;t work at all except to dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> The carriers selling this product on sites like Amazon and the like might be trying to exploit certain loop-holes to make a profit on direct-selling to customers.</li>
            <li> I certainly don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too smart to believe that sales pitch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!!  </li>
            <li> I read so many reviews here thinking I can get an idea in which I could get this product for cheaper and only found comments that made it clear I have to buy from a brand partner to get the real thing!</li>
            <li> Would love a new bottle or money back!!</li>
            <li> This cream has definitely shrunk my pores and has diminished my fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve had scars from acne for years and this product is the first one that is making them get smaller, so it&#x27;s totally worth it for me!</li>
            <li> I wanted to use to help fight against my fine lines and pores and not only did it help minimize that</li>
            <li> sure the money sounded so appealing but seeing those dollar signs first before you actually see any results will get you into so much trouble if you don&#x27;t believe in it whole heartedly.  </li>
            <li> A friend recommended it the same week i started to see fine lines in my skin .</li>
            <li> I started seeing my skin going back to the fine lines</li>
            <li> Again I was mad at my son when he first approached me with this product, but it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used on my skin!  </li>
            <li> The Journal articles are mainly on how to treat POISONINGS from this plant!</li>
            <li> The $700 serum I tried broke me out and did nothing to improve the look of my skin and this came from a very high end (sold in exclusive spas) brand.  </li>
            <li> I can honestly say, I became a brand partner a little over a year ago.</li>
            <li> got my clean skin back ;)</li>
            <li> I went to a Nerium party, and saw before and after pictures of real live people, who were at the party.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a lot of corporation hype that comes with this product, like they just found out being nice to each other was a new thing</li>
            <li> and he told me that in some people it WILL work great for a LIMITED time due to the fact that the oleander tends to cause inflammation.</li>
            <li> I started using it, took a night or two to get used to the smell, but it&#x27;s been a few months and my skin looks and feels amazing.</li>
            <li> Personally, I couldn&#x27;t tell a huge difference when I was using the Day Cream too.</li>
            <li> My pores seem to look cleaner and smaller which is huge plus.  </li>
            <li> Happy I only wasted $100.00</li>
            <li> ; You want to see real results, but don&#x27;t want to make the real commitment to buying the real thing.</li>
            <li> It has not erased my wrinkles around my eyes, but let&#x27;s be real there is no miracle cream that does that.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Bottles don&#x27;t have as much cream as they did two years ago</li>
            <li> I use BB Cream and find that the day cream and bb cream combo is just too much moisture for my skin type.</li>
            <li> Nothing has changed really</li>
            <li> Over priced network marketing company representatives selling their free supplies to get back their investment because it does not work as advertised.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much difference on wrinkles</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really have any wrinkles to begin with.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- Wash your face before bed with a gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li> (I did wash my face because it gets very oily</li>
            <li> Not sit on my couch and hope the whole world just comes to me to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I used the whole bottle as directed and just did not see the results that everyone else had.</li>
            <li> Hips, Breast, and Butt were smooth as butter  prior to Nerium AD/FIRM usage</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so so not that much in the bottle</li>
            <li> I also did my research intensely as YOU should.</li>
            <li> I was very concerned about Oleander being \\&quot;toxic\\&quot;</li>
            <li> ; someone who wants a Lexus.</li>
            <li> Just since starting with this product, I have become comfortable not putting makeup on immediately after I wash my face.</li>
            <li> Probably wouldn&#x27;t be worth the money if not what it does to clear up my acne by using it each night.</li>
            <li> so I can order when I am ready rather than pile up extras on a subscription with a company rep.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nerium AD for eight months now and really like it.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and will&lt;br /&gt;continue</li>
            <li> I really like this product and see the difference in my skin....</li>
            <li> I was really hoping it would help with my &amp;#34;turkey neck&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to share my story because there isn&#x27;t much on the internet regarding this product and latex allergies/sensitivities.  </li>
            <li> If you are having an allergic reaction and are using this product, you really should stop using it and everything else that might have come in contact with it.</li>
            <li> As to my &amp;#34;results&amp;#34; the lines around my nose and mouth are not as noticeable, but the rest of my face really shows no improvement.</li>
            <li> to which I told her my skin has never broken out and I have tried hundreds of products.</li>
            <li> I definitely saw improvement in the texture of my skin after 10 days--which is the time frame they allow you a free trial.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to believe in the product and sell the product.  </li>
            <li> but it did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING for me...</li>
            <li> The real money is in the &amp;#34;brand partner&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> She said it&#x27;s very bio reactive</li>
            <li> I really wanted the results everyone else got.</li>
            <li> I have never found any creme that really worked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappoint and distress by all this.</li>
            <li> To pay off my vehicle and credit card much faster.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> What turned me off to this product isn&#x27;t even the product itself, which is lackluster and disappointing at best.  </li>
            <li> waaaaaay too much make up on.</li>
            <li> you can see i am a real person...</li>
            <li> , why would a company invest so much money using a plant that is completly toxic.</li>
            <li> if you want to purchase from a real Brand partner and not one from Amazon go to [...].</li>
            <li> Haven seen much results yet.&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
            <li> I am a whole hearted believer in this product.</li>
            <li> The REAL reviews with 1-2 stars that show that this product is ineffective and 2)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just a customer that is very satisfy with the results</li>
            <li> I tried it as directed for two weeks straight and saw no difference, and I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore.  </li>
            <li> I asked a friend who kept promoting Nerium and posting how much he was making money and</li>
            <li> It just isn&#x27;t ethical if you think about it.</li>
            <li> and Prepaid Legal (it may ring a bell).&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> but I won&#x27;t be buying stock in said company if they ever to decide to become a real one.</li>
            <li> very pasty didn&#x27;t absorb well.</li>
            <li> Bottom line, if they really cared about their relationships with people, they wouldn&#x27;t push this stuff on others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The anti-aging claim - really can&#x27;t be proven.</li>
            <li> So, during the fast start qualifying program, one product is being given away for every person who signs on to buy the product.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t have wrinkles)</li>
            <li> and I said really????</li>
            <li> I really expected much more for the price</li>
            <li> I really wanted it to work.  </li>
            <li> Also, the product smells very offensive.  </li>
            <li> I really wish people would realize not every product out on the market will work for them.</li>
            <li> is that it spreads really well</li>
            <li> and it dries up really fast.</li>
            <li> I really like this night cream, if you have not used this cream you need to try it</li>
            <li> Very upset I got the bottle today</li>
            <li> She was raving about it so much that I wanted to believe her and give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Hahaha...</li>
            <li> Really does work.</li>
            <li> Nerium is only legally available through a representative in the Nerium Company.  </li>
            <li> Hyaluronic Acid (although it sounds intense) is a proven agent in decreasing the lines and texture of your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> none of this was really promised</li>
            <li> not that much.  </li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to buy from amazon for about 60.00, Used the product for about two months, nothing!</li>
            <li> I think the stuff really works...</li>
            <li> I use it every night and you can really tell the difference after a week or so.</li>
            <li> You should look at why MLMs can never equalize into profitability the way companies in the real world can, so that the result will be that the organization as a whole cannot, even in theory, be profitable.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much change.</li>
            <li> Stinky and very drying  </li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, it has helped soooo much.</li>
            <li> The last week of January I went to a meeting and one of my friends said, \\&quot;your face is so light</li>
            <li> and I really like it and can tell a difference ,</li>
            <li> Anyway, that aside I just don&#x27;t see any real results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t dislike the smell although it is unusual.</li>
            <li> And then...well,  I don&#x27;t really encourage anyone to expect results from it.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and price was resonable compared to what it sells for through a distributor.  </li>
            <li> and it looked promising.  </li>
            <li> However, my wife and I both tried it and had absolutely zero results.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the stickiness of this and really couldn&#x27;t tell that it made much difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was very upset because Amazon allow this happen and fool customers.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> If you want something very moisturizing this probably isn&#x27;t for you</li>
            <li> I only tried it because a friend of mine is a brand partner and gave me a bottle for free.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll continue to try to find it for as cheap as possible and use it!  </li>
            <li> I do not see much on my vertical lip lines or crows feet yet</li>
            <li> It is very drying and makes my skin look dehydrated.  </li>
            <li> It really works.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> and my neck is much firmer since using this.</li>
            <li> I really did.  </li>
            <li> but I really was hoping to get rid of age spots.</li>
            <li> I found this very coercive.</li>
            <li> I started using this because a friend of my daughter&#x27;s was really bragging about it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very concentrated</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> THE DAY CREAM REALLY DO TAKE 10 YEARS OFF YOUR FACE IN A YEAR.</li>
            <li> It gives real results to real people like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can do research yourself on how the antioxidant is removed from the plant and all the legal documents on it being a scientifically proven antioxidant, you can even do research on the oleander farms and visit them!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a healthy pink now.</li>
            <li> I get my day cream and night cream for free because several of my friends are using it now as well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very drying  </li>
            <li> I also believe it is a pyramid scheme as my esthetician wants me to sell it.  </li>
            <li> I used it for two weeks straight even though I dreaded it every night, but then the pump stopped working</li>
            <li> and I absolutely did not believe the product would work.  </li>
            <li> Now thanks to Nerium</li>
            <li> i wish i could get use to the smell to see how well it worked, but it&#x27;s just to much.  </li>
            <li> it has a very industrial stench.</li>
            <li> Maybe the product did stop working for her, well then just state the real facts.</li>
            <li> I have to ask did she really use it every night and day?</li>
            <li> &#x27;s be straight here</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like going to China and buying the off brand instead of going to Macy&#x27;s and buying the real thing.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t buy the real thing how can you place judgement on any product that you haven&#x27;t given a real chance to?</li>
            <li> I was really hoping after all of the reviews that this would be the answer.</li>
            <li> My friend who was still selling nerium, and doing very well</li>
            <li> I used this for a month and really saw nothing.</li>
            <li> It worked really well for me.</li>
            <li> This product really works shrinks pores, softens skin etc.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> and she has been using it very sparingly (2 pumps instead of the recommended 5) for 5 months.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really want to use it, but when she asked, I opened it and applied it.</li>
            <li> (in short free radicals cause oxidative damage)</li>
            <li> My friend lent me this product to try for a few days and after 3 days I decided to purchase my own.  </li>
            <li> Cant say anything about the wrinkles - did not have many before, and it seems the same now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oleander has been used in natural medicine for centuries, throughout the world.</li>
            <li> asked to speak to a supervisor, still waiting for him to call me back, it&#x27;s been more than 5.5 hours so far, and it&#x27;s after 5 pm, so</li>
            <li> DO NOT waste your money, PLEASE!!!</li>
            <li> But I think the early improvement is better than what you get with most skin creams and about the same as with other alpha-hydroxy acids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem right, and I wondered if it was old.</li>
            <li> To make matters worse, have you noticed that most of the Nerium users have inflamed and irritated looking eyes!!   </li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and smooth, those fine lines and wrinkles are definitely less defined</li>
            <li> Making sure your face and hands are damp, apply 3 pumps to face, neck, and chest (or any other problem areas).</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Brand Partners\\&quot; if anyone has ever been familiar with Amway this is about the same.</li>
            <li> While there are other products out there that work just as well, I am pleased with the results of this product.  </li>
            <li> No side affects which I have experiences with many other products.</li>
            <li> My skin has been looking pretty good the last few days.  </li>
            <li> Cost - there are many other skin care products that will satisfy skin condition without being over 100 dollars a month.</li>
            <li> I use the extra on my arms at night and the crepiness has reduced significantly.  </li>
            <li> Just like so many other things in life.</li>
            <li> I feel people should have realistic expectations when embarking on a product that entails of dishing out some real money &amp;#62;50$.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Before my face was red and bumpy now it is a normal color and smooth.</li>
            <li> I am a Prime member and decided to pay extra money to get this and after waiting for a full whole day was told that it isn&#x27;t going to arrive.</li>
            <li> Mainly because the first ones I read were negative and that just wasn&#x27;t what I had experienced personally.</li>
            <li> and now I look like hot mess for supporting a friend, as we continue to work undoing the damage supernaturally, by God’s grace, as nothing seems to be working since applying Nerium to my skin on 10/18/2014!!!!</li>
            <li> I actually fell in love with the product so much that I became a brandpartner, so I could get the product for free (80$ a month is a little steep for a college-girl)</li>
            <li> Ok, why not right?</li>
            <li> We trust ourselves and if we have created our own mess by signing on the dotted line, then we will deceive ourselves that it is still a good deal far after we have realized deep down that it isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Not sure who is getting amazing results?</li>
            <li> This product is truly indefensible in my opinion and not worth the price for vanity.wanted to be supportive.  </li>
            <li> I am 58 with pretty youthful skin(I&#x27;ve stayed out of the sun since I was in my early 20&#x27;s)</li>
            <li> After my testimony of my own experiences, my observation of others, and factual information I have provided, it should be clear that such a skin care is, in fact, possible.</li>
            <li> Honestly, after 10 days it gets no better.  </li>
            <li> First off, I do not sell this product nor will I ever because I am one busy ass photojournalist.  </li>
            <li> I am 61 years old and this product smoothed away wrinkles exactly like the advertisement said.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried probably most brands out there that claims to fade dark spots.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really funny that people like sillygirl asks a &amp;#34;doctor&amp;#34; who does &amp;#34;botox&amp;#34; for advice on a natural cream.</li>
            <li> Many people try to scrimp on product and it&#x27;s just not worth it.  </li>
            <li> I presume at this point and its a get rich quick scheme based on 1000&#x27;s of little underdogs selling it to friends or family, etc etc.</li>
            <li> What I&#x27;m not willing to accept is being told that, because my original UNUSED Brand Partner kit had the plastic shrink-wrap removed, none of this would be eligible for any refund!  </li>
            <li> I do think you have to be careful to put on a good moisturizer after you wash this product off, it leaves your face very dry.</li>
            <li> What a waste of my money, PLUS more new wrinkles!!</li>
            <li> I think there are better items for the little amount for to much with no results.</li>
            <li> It really does live up to its hype.</li>
            <li> However after a couple days of use and using absolutely nothing new</li>
            <li> I notice some slight reduction in wrinkles, but believe I will see more.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure their rave reviews are slightly slanted.</li>
            <li> everything I&#x27;ve tried previously over the years had, so surely this would too.  </li>
            <li> FYI, one of the main ingredients is Oleander Leaf Extract which is poisonous to humans.</li>
            <li> It is a skin cream and people should be realistic with their expectations.  </li>
            <li> My sun skin discoloration disappeared for the first 2 weeks using the creams, after that they came back, those first 2 weeks</li>
            <li> /&gt;After running out of friends and family to sign up, she has constantly been going to Nerium meet-ups, and most recently, a convention of sorts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After running out of friends and family to sign up, she has constantly been going to Nerium meet-ups, and most recently, a convention of sorts.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have to be older to use this product, you can start now.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re all getting older and will eventually die, but appeal to our vanity</li>
            <li> I have used many, many name brand cremes over the years&lt;br /&gt;and have never experienced the results I have from Nerium!</li>
            <li> I also noticed that after a couple days my face, particularly around my eyes, appeared puffy.</li>
            <li> we all so super postivive changes, just in different ways.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure why, but she kept looking younger and younger.</li>
            <li> for sure I noticed smaller pores, and just younger looking skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of skin products and this one does make your skin look better, younger (for me), smaller pores.</li>
            <li> I went a month with my skin starting to get red and yucky again and have just ordered more.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any one particular product that I use to &amp;#34;stay young&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> About a year later, I noticed my skin was starting to breakout a lot more</li>
            <li> realistically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 52 and had moderate sagging around my mouth neck eyes and mild sun damage resulting in crow&#x27;s feet and scaly cheeks.</li>
            <li> That kind of death causes inflammation and wide variety of cellular stresses such as UV and ionizing radiation and heat</li>
            <li> It is a HUGE red flag when there are nearly as many 5 stars as there are 1 stars, and very little in between.</li>
            <li> Had done absolutely nothing for my fine lines or any other type of wrinkling.</li>
            <li> i kind of liked my LONG expensive routine..</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It was so high pressure for a product I had used for 7 days.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend avoiding it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to improve their skin.</li>
            <li> High prices and feels like you are putting on a mask.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend that you give it a try and see for yourself what Nerium can do for you...</li>
            <li> High pressure sales, no thank you.</li>
            <li> My skin has always been high priority to me</li>
            <li> I can also say that it has replaced my high priced clutter of a 20min.</li>
            <li> This product is highly advertised to remove or improve lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Internet research shows this is derived from the oleander plant, which is highly toxic.</li>
            <li> By May of 2013, I got tired of using the cream because I wasn&#x27;t seeing any &amp;#34;real results.&amp;#34; I decided that there must be some other reasons why my skin was not the best it could be.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think anyone will die by using this cream that actually hasn&#x27;t been FDA approved, but there&#x27;s reason to do your own due diligence in case anyone decides they might want to try it.</li>
            <li> – I’m a healthy 32 year old woman with no skin allergies or skin issues (other than the beginnings of aging).</li>
            <li> The first bottle of night cream that came in the mail was a darker color and didn&#x27;t dry right.  </li>
            <li> The product is a little costly, however, when it comes to your face you should pay top dollar for an item that brings results.</li>
            <li> I need a little more time to check it out.</li>
            <li> You can only get the real Nerium AD from a Brand Partner!!</li>
            <li> Just because a 100 dollar product works for me does not mean it will work for everyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also read complaints about it being sticky but that is because you have to apply it to damp skin (or make sure your hands are a little damp).  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money!!  </li>
            <li> I eat clean and drink water AND consulted a medical professional.</li>
            <li> In the first few months I notice the fine lines disappearing and my skin tightening which is a miracle at age 52.  </li>
            <li> My wife used Nerium for three weeks so far, and the improvement is very noticable.</li>
            <li> So far I have used product for almost a month and really like it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised nobody is taking this Nerium AD to a legal court.</li>
            <li> (At my age, I really don&#x27;t think it was the three year old dress</li>
            <li> I always laugh when I see the commercial about the &amp;#34;graveyard of face creams&amp;#34; cuz I&#x27;m that woman.</li>
            <li> The firm cream is nothing more than lotion.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I have a normal skin care regimen and am no stranger to spending money on my face creams.  </li>
            <li> I normally avoid latex gloves and condom because they can irritate me, but I&#x27;ve never had swelling or hives because of it.  </li>
            <li> I was told this is normal because it&#x27;s cleaning out my pores.  </li>
            <li> EKG was normal.  </li>
            <li> i am just a normal amazon shopper i review the products i use ...</li>
            <li> A few individuals at the top are making A LOT OF MONEY while their &amp;#34;minions&amp;#34; build &amp;#34;teams&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Its either people giving it 5 stars promoting it because they need more people under them selling it to make money, or its people giving it 1 star because it dried out their skin, puffed up their eyes, gave them a rash or acne, or did nothing.</li>
            <li> There just isn&#x27;t reason to spend so much on skin care anyways, our country has gotten out of control in what satisfies them or others, it just isn&#x27;t worth the cost in the long run.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I think I need to voice my opinion because so many women out there will try this product and spend what I spend ($130 for both) and feel like they wasted their money like I do.  </li>
            <li> I used to make these green healthy shakes where I blend celery spinach carrots and kale</li>
            <li> And everyday my skin is getting prettier and better.</li>
            <li> Why do people agree to let marketers display them in a way they wouldn&#x27;t want their friends and co-workers to see on a normal day???</li>
            <li> Two of my good friends love this so probably worth trying but for me, I hated the texture and smell of this</li>
            <li> I normally use La Mer, I&#x27;ll be sticking with that.  </li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t post reviews</li>
            <li> Overall, this product is worth the money.</li>
            <li> one more round</li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing after almost 6 months of consistent, regular use.  </li>
            <li> My hormones and electrolytes were normal.</li>
            <li> my thyroid function is normal my thyroid was enlarged.</li>
            <li> Ive been using Nerium for a few years now and love it.  </li>
            <li> I took a good look at the science behind Nerium</li>
            <li> Although, if you live and die on others negative opinions and not try anything on your own then</li>
            <li> Used entire bottle and nothing but what appeared to be more lines and dry skin.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I can get the same results using a low-medium level retin-A product which costs a lot less.  </li>
            <li> i experience a purging period in my skin, its normal, our skin is acclimating to a new product, any skin care expert will tell you that.</li>
            <li> People dont pay $80-$110, monthly, for a single product.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe on alcohol, dinner, video games, private gyms because in our minds we get more for our money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So my hunch was right this product seems like one of those total scam things.</li>
            <li> Your absolutely right every product isn&#x27;t for everyone, but it is for someone obviously!</li>
            <li> By the 3rd day, I was starting to notice that my skin looked a little brighter and more smooth.  </li>
            <li> If I continue being happily surprised with this, I might look in to becoming a rep to get it for cheaper and help other people discover it.</li>
            <li> my pores were becoming less visible and my skin softer, so I decided to try it for a while.</li>
            <li> The true beauty about it, though, is that my grandma, I, and those other Nerium AD users I know appear so much healthier.</li>
            <li> You want to blame others for your failure of your own judgement.</li>
            <li> There are always a special few who have these huge networks, while the vast majority of people at the bottom make nothing.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I have ever used that actually improves my fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I have two major concern with my face which is brown age spots on both sides of my cheeks plus large pores.  </li>
            <li> This is not sour grapes, I really wanted the business to work.  </li>
            <li> if, in 90 days, you can get 39 Brand Partners (sales rep) in your downline at $500-1000 per Rep, plus a minimum or three preferred customers who automatically buy a minimum of $80 per month, you qualify for a free bottle of product, an iPad, a $500 car payment and up to $2500 in other bonuses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I was looking for a new home.  </li>
            <li> I did like the new texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li> invest about 6 hours a week marketing Nerium to new people.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is a pyramid sceem and relies on bringing in new partners to make any money.</li>
            <li> it will give you a new Lease on Life...</li>
            <li> Unsure as to the end results of this new product</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> So when I got home I looked up this snake oil on line &amp;#34;waste of money ofcourse&amp;#34; then I looked up where her and her husband live.</li>
            <li> Also, I didn&#x27;t like that they wanted to send me new bottle every month when the bottle lasts 6 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I live on the East  coast, and this is part of the reason the Nerium business did not work out as I had hoped for.  </li>
            <li> Seller shipped the item promptly and the item was new as described.  </li>
            <li> I sometimes have adverse reactions to new lotions and soaps.</li>
            <li> but if you are lucky enough to get half of what I did...it is well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Truth - Many of the claims Nerium has made simply are mask&#x27;s or partial truths.</li>
            <li> Anyway, my friend asked me to take before pictures to prove that it&#x27;s working in the same light and same location.  </li>
            <li> she said it was such a great product and went and grabbed your phone then another lady came up behind her and started talking about thIs skin product Nerium</li>
            <li> Nae8 inhibits activation of NF-KB plays a key role in regulating the immune response to infection (κ light chains are critical components of immunoglobulins)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it for a over a year without any problems, however i do not recommend using it if the bottle isn&#x27;t reasonably new, certainly not past 3 or 4 months.  </li>
            <li> ...why can&#x27;t they understand that about something that goes on your face?), it makes your skin tight and feels terrible on, and quite frankly doesn&#x27;t work in our 2 month &amp;#34;trying to be a believer opinion&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nerium has incredible marketing and packaging and their CEO is a great leader.  </li>
            <li> The answer is very clear -</li>
            <li> Makes your face very soft.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised to see a difference almost immediately.  </li>
            <li> I gave in, and paid what I thought to be a high cost, for a product I was trusting to clear my acne and improve my skin.  </li>
            <li> I mean really you could ask away so many questions.</li>
            <li> Wake up America, things are not as important as the media and hype makes it out to be, there is no need to fall into some trap and start handing your hard earned dollars over to some company that see&#x27;s fit to overmarket something and essentially pretend that it is a miracle drug (does the 20&#x27;s ring</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally, this product is priced way above what I&#x27;m willing to spend and I didn&#x27;t see any results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not exactly sure as to why so many people bash the science on this product?</li>
            <li> I am posting this review because only 30 minutes ago I just tried this for the first time and my face has been</li>
            <li> I am a 54 year old woman with normal aging skin...</li>
            <li> My rep said &amp;#34;it&#x27;s only a small amount of Oleander&amp;#34;, but it&#x27;s still the first ingredient, which means there&#x27;s more Oleander in this product than anything else.</li>
            <li> Thereis a unique story along with a key ingredient that makes this product so different from others.</li>
            <li> It should have been a light cream color, but it is dark tan.  </li>
            <li> The quality is the same as the first bottle I received from the representative.</li>
            <li> How exactly is that a &amp;#34;30 day money back guarantee&amp;#34; when the customer doesn&#x27;t have the product in-hand to try for 30 days?</li>
            <li> While everything seems on the up-and-up, independent research has consistently shown that 99% of people that get involved as distributors in MLM&#x27;s do not break even on their investment.</li>
            <li> People think I&#x27;m in my early 40s and tell me my skin glows!</li>
            <li> The only unique ingredient in here is Oleandar which irritates some peoples skin just enough to plump it up a bit and mask wrinkles temporarily.  </li>
            <li> people say Wow!</li>
            <li> You also may get some that is completely out of date!</li>
            <li> I washed it off immediately, but my neck is still red, hot, and burns.  </li>
            <li> I was first invited to a party by one of my students (totally inappropriate to solicit this way) and I declined.</li>
            <li> At first my skin didn&#x27;t react for about 4 or 5 days then suddenly on my face</li>
            <li> Funny, because I can find similar stories all over online.  </li>
            <li> I only wish I had read all the information on it before I used it in the first place.  </li>
            <li> I suppose if you have plenty of friends who don&#x27;t mind paying nearly $100 per month whether they need it or not, and who don&#x27;t mind providing an income for their &amp;#34;friends&amp;#34;, this just might be the business opportunity for you!</li>
            <li> Before and after photos were exactly the same.</li>
            <li> but by two months you will see your skin begin to have less defined pores and fine lines will be gone.</li>
            <li> would recommend this product for those who can actually afford it and be willing to dish out the money to take a chance on it.</li>
            <li> I am a regular consumer like many other people here.</li>
            <li> I fully am aware of multi-level marketing/pyramids and don&#x27;t understand why the American people still buy into this stuff.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am nervous after reading the reviews about customers&#x27;s eyes becoming droopy or dried out though.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I can say as a licensed professional, I have never had results like this!</li>
            <li> Anyone who tells you Nerium is safe is a dishonest person looking for a sale or completely uneducated about Nerium and the real side effects.</li>
            <li> My face became red and hot to the touch and swollen.</li>
            <li> have used nerium for 3 months and have seen a marked difference in my skin!</li>
            <li> Fine lines were less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> The texture and pore size seem about the same as the first week.  </li>
            <li> Reduces fine lines and wrinkles and makes sun spots/age spots less visable  </li>
            <li> Then the weeks go by &amp; you look exactly the same.</li>
            <li> I have used Nerium for several months and I can tell you first hand,</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin stay away from this product!</li>
            <li> The first bottle of night cream (one that she gave me) actually made my skin softer in appearance and my eyes seemed brighter/lifted.  </li>
            <li> It was thicker and went on like putty which was different than my first experience.  </li>
            <li> i compared this bottle and cream to the same exact one i ordered from nerium.</li>
            <li> I gave the product to a friend of mine, and she had the exact same thing happen.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using Nerium for two weeks and my face is sagging for the first time in my life</li>
            <li> Going Direct to Nerium!</li>
            <li> the first 30 day trial costs $150.00 USD), to find out what I already knew from viewing photos of actual people whom were using the product.  </li>
            <li> Another bent is that some people possibly weren&#x27;t aware it was MLM and feel ripped off or scammed upon the discovery never having been exposed to that world as some of us have.</li>
            <li> I can understand that but to annihilate the product and try to destroy the credibility of this company having something that genuinely works is completely out of line ethically and</li>
            <li> I used this on the backs of my hands for the first time last night.</li>
            <li> My face is no longer sagging, the wrinkles on my forehead are very minimal, my crows feet are gone and the texture of my skin is soft, smooth and glowing.</li>
            <li> I am truly sorry to have to post this kind of negativity which is surely going to grow into a massive headache for Nerium International.  </li>
            <li> I knew I was (very) mildly sensitive to latex but have never had too many problems with it, especially when it came to lotions and other beauty products.  </li>
            <li> Not counting all the bonuses, the $80 retail price has been cut in half by the free giveaways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> By six months deeper winkles smooth out and are less defined.  </li>
            <li> After I used my first bottle, I found a less expensive way to buy it that signing up through a partner, so I bought another bottle and continued to feel like my skin was looking and feeling better and better.  </li>
            <li> I am still young, but my skin is very sensitive and it seems like I never stop breaking out.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a huge change in my skin, with tone, texture, uneven color, pigment and fine lines which are less noticable.</li>
            <li> I was totally skeptical at first, but I love it so much.</li>
            <li> This product, for $90, should provide results quickly instead of obviously not working for the majority of the actual users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 529 reviews as I write this, and there are 70% 3 or below.  </li>
            <li> The overseeing marketers make the decent buck while the lessers harrass everyone they know or might know in an attempt to spread the hype about said product, essentially creating something that would not ordinarily exist considering normal marketing and advertising.</li>
            <li> You can also get the Day cream for FREE FOR LIFE for a limited time with Brand Partners and you have a 30 day money back guaranty.</li>
            <li> Founders of Nerium Ad guarantees correction in fine lines and wrinkles, hyperpigmentation, uneven skin texture, enlarged pores, aging skin, and sun damaged skin.</li>
            <li> Rather than coming here on Amazon to purchase this, Which is more expensive, and untrust worthy, go directly to the site and purchase your product.</li>
            <li> Lately, I&#x27;ve noticed a little more signs of aging - duller skin and fine lines.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully I was smart enough not to offer it to my friends (see sentence one).&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> /&gt; I still believe in the Nerium International program, and certainly appreciate the products they market, but I CAN NOT BELIEVE THEY WOULD HAVE THE NERVE TO DENY MY CLAIM FOR A REIMBURSEMENT FOR ITEMS I NEVER USED, AND RETURNED UNSCATHED</li>
            <li> I, personally ,have seen a difference in my forehead lines, minimizing of the large pores in the &amp;#34;T zone&amp;#34; on my face.  </li>
            <li> Skin aging is what normally happens to people as they get older, especially if you sunbath alot etc.</li>
            <li> My forehead had less noticeable lines, and I was excited.  </li>
            <li> , when you look in the mirror everyday you yourself cant see the changes as much, the before and after photos is your proof that this product really does work!!</li>
            <li> I tried so many things only to get little results.</li>
            <li> With so many age defying products on the market it is hard to determine what works.  </li>
            <li> I notice my skin start to look more dull and my hormonal acne starts to kick in again ...</li>
            <li> actual users (think not being paid to promote it) say its bad, then its probably not your best option for skincare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After I stopped using the product my skin began to clear up.  </li>
            <li> and it is clearly inaccurate.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s somewhat helping to clear my skin up.  </li>
            <li> My dermatologist told me to use this instead of proactiv to clear my skin.</li>
            <li> The product clearly says that it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyone with sensitive skin should not be surprised to find out that his/her skin is sensitive to some things that are put on it.</li>
            <li> I notice a lot of reviews and comments written by people who clearly have not used it or can&#x27;t follow direction...</li>
            <li> I am 42 years old and have been using Nerium AD day and night cream for 3 months...</li>
            <li> Everyone in my families using it whether it&#x27;s my 16 year old niece or my 85 year old mother.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly sensitive skin and this product WORKS even on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Nerium Int&#x27;l does NOT allow the sale of Nerium products in any of these venues and the people selling the product are completely out of compliance.</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in the appearance of lines or sun blotches</li>
            <li> I received frequent compliments.</li>
            <li> bought it directly from Nerium and there was an invoice in a shipment package</li>
            <li> A Slightly Different Take on This Whole</li>
            <li> Since I started using Nerium AD 8 weeks ago, my skin has completely changed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 38 years old</li>
            <li> Honestly I am surprised they are still around.    </li>
            <li> My face was too sensitive for this product.</li>
            <li> Do you really want to buy facial product from someone who is untrustworthy?</li>
            <li> Take the safest option and order from an authorized brand partner or directly from the company&#x27;s website.  </li>
            <li> so I am assuming it&#x27;s old product.</li>
            <li> So far I would recommend it.  </li>
            <li> so if your looking for complete disappearance of lines and wrinkles get a face lift.</li>
            <li> I was surprised with the results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t consider myself as having sensitive skin</li>
            <li> but it also completely took away my acne.</li>
            <li> Very botanical and reminiscent of Yves Rocher of Paris.  </li>
            <li> From Perricone to Avon to Mary Kay and to Maybelline to Chanel, this is the only product that really made a difference.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very embarrassing to go out in public or work.  </li>
            <li> Im incredibily scent sensitive</li>
            <li> so Im surprised i have no problem with the smell.</li>
            <li> To clarify, I have never had a problem with acne but do have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Clearly, for sensitive skin it doesn&#x27;t.    </li>
            <li> My representative told me that was because it was &#x27;all natural plant extracts without any chemicals or perfumes&#x27;.</li>
            <li> This is a total ponzi scheme and I really hope people read these reviews before they decide to purchase, and I hope the reps will get out of the pyramid and save their souls...</li>
            <li> It glows in that young skin kinda way.  </li>
            <li> As far as the smell I don&#x27;t notice anything???  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> Also, acne is near obsolete.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m caucasian; she&#x27;s in her early 50s</li>
            <li> It has not dried my skin out.  </li>
            <li> NEVER, no matter how much anyone could possibly explain that studies were done etc etc.</li>
            <li> so I said well how old do you think I am</li>
            <li> WOW $400,000 mini mansion with 3 car garage...</li>
            <li> Bottom line is never ever ask someone how old they are....</li>
            <li> I like it but an associate for Nerium said that to notice a marked difference</li>
            <li> So I decided to purchase one bottle with her promise that she would stop the next order until I was ready....</li>
            <li> It does nothing for my crow&#x27;s feet/under eye bags as you can&#x27;t apply near eyes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised after reading the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have meticulously taken care of my skin since I was 14 years old</li>
            <li> As far as I know, Nerium is sold through distributors.</li>
            <li> I am 44 years old, four kids, and tortured my skin in AZ (childhood) and in Florida for 12 years.</li>
            <li> To early to tell if this item is working or not.</li>
            <li> and as far as scars.?  </li>
            <li> I have been using the product for about 8 months now and it truly has completely changed my skin.</li>
            <li> Some pictures they even changed the lips, nose and ear of the person in the attempt to make her look young.</li>
            <li> I hoped to at least see a more even complexion with</li>
            <li> I guess some people would rather complain about the non-perfumy smell then actually give it a real try.</li>
            <li> I am 20 years old and see results of redness in my face disappearing and pores on my nose shrinking.</li>
            <li> Wondering if it is old.</li>
            <li> her eyes were swollen shut and her whole entire face was swollen.</li>
            <li> Beware my old customers are having rash breakouts and burning of their skin</li>
            <li> I thought, &amp;#34;great, this product actually might really make a difference.&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I only gave it a four star rating because it hasn&#x27;t lessened my wrinkles as much as I thought it would  </li>
            <li> and I am nearly out.</li>
            <li> I also continue to wake up looking very puffy, especially around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Oh, I&#x27;m a 61 year old guy.</li>
            <li> I am 30 years old and have combination skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin so before I used the product I looked at all the material</li>
            <li> I do have somewhat sensitive skin</li>
            <li> but so far I &#x27;think&#x27; it is working</li>
            <li> and they just completely disregarded that we were trying to get away from them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My redness completely went away.  </li>
            <li> I am 53 years old and have used every product on the market.</li>
            <li> WHERE around this product is there any sort of scientific evidence that it works, or published results from experimental trials.</li>
            <li> you want to look young forever, try this ladies:</li>
            <li> If the bottle is defected and the pump doesn&#x27;t work, they do not replace your product if it is over 30 days old.</li>
            <li> I feel like I have baby soft skin</li>
            <li> to do only wash your face apply cream at nite and was in morning that is real convenient as well</li>
            <li> I am 46 years old and have been using this now for 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I had developed Peri-oral dermatitis which I have NEVER had in my 40 years on this earth before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 27 years old and have no skin issues</li>
            <li> The biggest change for me has been the end of my bouts with adult acne.  </li>
            <li> but she finally stopped the automatic order but wants me to share my story with the company.  </li>
            <li> so far nothing.  </li>
            <li> Very flustrated with this bottle as I have had several with out this problem.</li>
            <li> In the morning my skin feels so soft.  </li>
            <li> AM A 21 YEAR OLD WOMAN, LIVING IN TEXAS,</li>
            <li> It is totally against Compliance &amp; you have no idea if you are getting the REAL thing.</li>
            <li> I travel internationally frequently and sometimes miss a day here and there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m liking it so far.</li>
            <li> So far after 1 mo.</li>
            <li> I detest multi level marketing and don&#x27;t know how so many can do it with all the negative product reviews.</li>
            <li> I swear by this product - I have been using it for 60 days now and have seen a considerable change in my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> Complete scam.</li>
            <li> I am 72 years old.  </li>
            <li> and, well -- old</li>
            <li> (BTW, I buy it from Amazon because I can use my points - which reduces the cash outlay considerably).    </li>
            <li> , adult acne I was told.  </li>
            <li> You will see real and actual results.    </li>
            <li> and I would not be surprised at all</li>
            <li> They have always been professional and apologetic.</li>
            <li> Yes, I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> it naturally hydrates the skin.and holds the moisture.</li>
            <li> but what it actually did was clear up my everyday acne and all my hormonal acne which I&#x27;ve never been able to get rid of ........</li>
            <li> My husband who rarely comments about such finally asked, &amp;#34;what is that smell?&amp;#34;  I continued to use the day cream but saw no results</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see so many negative reviews on the Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Sometimes friends that are harsh critics actually make it more difficult for loved ones to get out of them and accept the mistake they made in signing up for one.  </li>
            <li> After telling her I wasn&#x27;t interested she KEPT calling me to try and get my money and to have me attend seminars featuring a 26 year old female who apparently is making $25,000 a MONTH.</li>
            <li> Oleander is poisonous to those that do not know, and I for one would NEVER put something on my precious skin that came from such a deadly plant.</li>
            <li> I hate to see a wonderful product not being given the credit</li>
            <li> I have always liked the product, am confused as to why I got two defective products.  </li>
            <li> I think this product plays a major role in that!!  </li>
            <li> I can bash all sorts of skin products left and right about how it didn&#x27;t work as suggested, but I don&#x27;t because not all skin types are the same.  </li>
            <li> As I read other reviews I can just tell most to if not all of them have not actually taken time with this with an open mind.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who takes care of their skin and just needs that little bit more boost, without Botox or any other such more extreme methods.  </li>
            <li> It actually does something, unlike many other products out there that claim similar results.</li>
            <li> Nerium Ad was created at the MD Anderson cancer research center at the University of Texas when they found that the product has multiple unique effects.  </li>
            <li> , there were a couple of other ladies waiting in line, after paying for my Clinique and getting my free April give away gift I strolled over the the swim wear since we are going on vacation next month.</li>
            <li> My bathroom is full of half used containers.</li>
            <li> Day Cream fumes caused eyes to burn, the night cream caused nose to burn, and FIRM caused a major rash that has turned into a mix of welts/bumps that have yet to heal so guessing this product kills more than cells and wrinkles as I am still seeing a Dermatologist using 2nd batch of prescriptions to treat skin reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I Have been using Nerium Night and Day for a little over month and a half and all I can tell you is that i Absolutly Love the product!  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to be as fresh or new as the previous ones I have used.</li>
            <li> The company was smart enough to market and patent the product with a new business- NERIUM INTERNATIONAL- to help fund their research at NERIUM BIOTECHNOLOGY.</li>
            <li> Her retaliation was that all of the other companies were &amp;#34;haters&amp;#34; and were &amp;#34;jealous of the success of the company&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Since we know the sales reps are going to write great reviews about the product they&#x27;re selling, that leaves us with a surprisingly high and troubling number of bad reviews.</li>
            <li> but I use a small amount of water and it is fine.  </li>
            <li> I also have small fine lines under my eyes now that weren&#x27;t there before.</li>
            <li> I go to school for nutrition, I know first hand not all things react to bodies the same because bodies are all different.</li>
            <li> Also with this supplier you are pre-ordering ,so be aware that the ship date doesn&#x27;t get pushed back a month later than estimated.</li>
            <li> and I actually felt confident going to work with no makeup the past 3 days.</li>
            <li> I have had this product in the past, and love the product, but will not buy from this vendor again or recommend unless I can get a  replacement or my money back.</li>
            <li> My cheeks usually are red and they look much better after about 5 days of using this product.</li>
            <li> This is not the same as what I got from Nerium, funny smell and different color.</li>
            <li> My pores are pretty big and they were much smaller after using the product.</li>
            <li> After six months of product use, I personally have seen decent results from something that comes out of a bottle without having to do anything else but wash and apply.</li>
            <li> so maybe this is not a typical reaction.</li>
            <li> Because I had 4 bottles, I continued using the product one squirt every night on very wet skin and after one year, still like it better than any other product I have or have tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 66-year-old professional Customer Service Manager with a major US corporation.  </li>
            <li> and neither of us have ever had major issues with acne and are both in the 30-40 yr old range.  </li>
            <li> The price is right too as I have used other products that cost two or three times&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe the product worked for other people but it wasn&#x27;t the right match for me.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes.  </li>
            <li> So I can&#x27;t understand the massive amount of slamming and am highly suspicious now.</li>
            <li> I have high hopes for further improvement.</li>
            <li> I bought Firm on a special in the beginning.  </li>
            <li> A week later she was back to her normal self!!    </li>
            <li> it did what lasor would do with no down time...</li>
            <li> I use less than is recommended: only one pump which I smooth on with water.  </li>
            <li> Steer clear of this organization and MLM cults in general.</li>
            <li> This product is to be used long term to see the real results.</li>
            <li> I had been plagued with since my early twenties that my makeup barely covered.</li>
            <li> The puckers around my mouth diminished considerably as I continued to use the night cream, and the brown spots have softened to be barely discernible.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a regularly user of this cream and normally purchased through a Nerium Representative.  </li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s not for everyone, but I really am surprised at most of the negative reviews because I&#x27;ve never had a skin product actually work and do what it says it does.</li>
            <li> and my skin is back to normal.</li>
            <li> My pores seemed to get larger, my sun spots got darker, my skin was even dryer than normal would &amp;#34;Not&amp;#34; recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> but before I could apply the night cream on the 3rd day, my lips, tongue and feet began to swell and by the morning I was covered head to toe in large red hives.  </li>
            <li> so I probably work a little harder than most grandmothers do at my age.</li>
            <li> It will make you look refreshed, your skin will look healthy, and help your skin look a little tighter for minimal wrinkles and sagging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know deep down if you have been doing this for very long you know better than I the truth.  </li>
            <li> When I did, I found that Nerium Ad does not only live up to its expectations, but it goes beyond its guarantee.</li>
            <li> Open a new bottle.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> This was a new revolutionary product that would help your skin and make you look younger.  </li>
            <li> New skin products will/can make skin red.</li>
            <li> Not only did  wrinkles not improve, NEW wrinkles were created as my skin lost all hydration.  </li>
            <li> Nerium exasperated my Rosacea, so I sent the new delivery of unopened product back for a refund ($120.00), keeping the used bottles and giving them to my friend.  </li>
            <li> a messaged me several times pushing me to commit &amp;#34; it would change my financial future&amp;#34; promising a Lexus as a 90 day bonus if I signed 3 partners who also signed 3 partners.</li>
            <li> I only wish this product were a bit cheaper, although it is much cheaper on Amazon than the local Nerium sales-gal...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only twenty, and obviously not concerned about wrinkles, but this product shrunk my pores, and really evened out my complexion.</li>
            <li> Only things such as Accutane for people with acne  are really needed.</li>
            <li> B00I0N24TY Vitamin C Serum such as this one]] to maintain soft and even textures across the complete surface of your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After that I will go back to my regular routine and not spend so much money.</li>
            <li> I have to give it a few good pumps before anything comes out and when it does its clumpy and spits out thick.</li>
            <li> It was thick and orange and gooey and smells like a strong smelling putty or clay.</li>
            <li> and tighter!I know there are different opinions in this forum,but dont let these people full you,most of these bad reviews are selling other products ,notice what they do now,so as a custumer for Nerium it gas done great for me and</li>
            <li> Secondly, I won&#x27;t deny I already look very young for my age and am not disciplined about skincare.</li>
            <li> i do want to make you AWARE OF, Do not buy product from THIS or ANY other sites on the internet</li>
            <li> I saw no other changes in my skin.  </li>
            <li> no other products at all.</li>
            <li> My skin is SO soft, dark blemish spots are almost completely disappeared, makeup goes on so much easier, oily spots are controlled.</li>
            <li> Major breakouts.....</li>
            <li> I convinced 2 friends to try it and within 2 weeks one had a major reaction that lasted 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> Nerium does work for over a million people as evidenced by the fact that the company had the largest growth in their first year than any other company of its kind.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> No one that I am aware, including other sellers, has seen any noticeable change in the condition of their skin.</li>
            <li> NO other products that I have dumped tons of money into have worked like NERIUM.  </li>
            <li> i opened a new bottle which had been sitting on the shelf for a few months, and it was like brown water when i pumped it the first time -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure to get a few comments here about how I&#x27;m wrong, and don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m talking about, and then they&#x27;ll link you to neriums website to \\&quot;find out for yourself\\&quot; using their personal link to amass more sales and hopefully talking you into joining them.</li>
            <li> I think it is a bit pricey compared to drug store options, BUT I have spent as much or more on products from the med spa and department stores that have given me similar or less results.</li>
            <li> worth the money for how much is in it or either i got a half empty bottle</li>
            <li> After using it exactly as instructed, not only did I not see any positive benefits, my face broke out in tiny little bumps everywhere.</li>
            <li> I have all but begged them to please give this issue some serious thought, as I am sure they will want to avoid further escalation on my part.  </li>
            <li> Yes it is expensive, but most high end skin care is.</li>
            <li> I used to get mild laser peels regularly and was due for one before starting Nerium</li>
            <li> When I compared the photos I was shocked at the great result.</li>
            <li> Not only did it clear up my acne</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve stopped using the product and it has taken my skin about another 5 months to clear up with the proper treatment and products.</li>
            <li> My overall skin tone was much healthier and I lost that grey color to my skin.</li>
            <li> I am a licensed Esthetician who was curious about Nerium since there seemed to be so much buzz about it.</li>
            <li> I used the Night Cream every night until the bottle was empty, about a month, and did not notice much of a difference.</li>
            <li> In the morning, you only need to rinse with water, but I recommend washing if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for 1.5 months so still early</li>
            <li> apparently this product also gave a brow lift, and improved frown lines?</li>
            <li> I went back to it and it does make my face have reduced lines even this old.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 32 year old male and have been using this product for almost a year and will continue to use it because IT WORKS y&#x27;all.</li>
            <li> I thought they only did direct sales and never sell it to distributors.  </li>
            <li> it appears that the natural oils are back...</li>
            <li> Plus, there&#x27;s barely any product.</li>
            <li> One issue though, Nerium is not approved to be sold from retailers like Amazon, only directly from their brandpartners&#x27; website ( As an example, mine is [...] )</li>
            <li> So far I have noticed a difference with the neck area and it seems to work as well as my current skin care</li>
            <li> what but the bottle I ordered directly through a Nerium agent last over 2 months compared to 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it produced a smoother look for my 50 year old skin.  </li>
            <li> After two months of on and off eye swelling I developed a rash at the corners of my mouth and back on the eyes.  </li>
            <li> This extract is in it&#x27;s infancy as far as research goes, and personally I recommend caution.</li>
            <li> As I careen toward my 51st birthday and often have people tell me I don&#x27;t look old enough to have grown children,</li>
            <li> I TRY to use only natural products so after researching, I knew I had to try it.</li>
            <li> I myself am 53 years old and a former model who is looking for a \\&quot;needleless\\&quot; way to preserve my face and skin, and I can&#x27;t wait to use this product!!!!</li>
            <li> Perhaps it takes longer than one month to see results, especially if you are over 60 years old.</li>
            <li> I felt that it might have been an old bottle because it didnt feel like the one I had used from a local dealer.</li>
            <li> Our 28 year old daughter started using it back in September 2012.</li>
            <li> I may feel old, but my face looks 20 years younger.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and it showed up as expected.</li>
            <li> But the overall appearance of my skin has been markedly improved.  </li>
            <li> In fact, by the third day, I had developed an itchy, sore rash all over my face.</li>
            <li> She also blamed my nausea on poor diet, even though my diet hadn&#x27;t changed and I felt 100% better after stopping it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My poor brother, who has a bunch of acne scars, was even more bombarded.</li>
            <li> Silly girls is a nice alias...</li>
            <li> i kinda really liked them until they became too complicated to keep up with...</li>
            <li> You honestly will never know if you are too skeptical.</li>
            <li> so most of or all reviews you see are from brand partners its the way the game works there is no honesty in this industry along with over priced products and promotion.</li>
            <li> seven, small bumps are full on rash all over my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> I am 65 and really did not expect a dramatic effect but finally decided any improvement would be fine.</li>
            <li> but I think the harsh stuff some people are saying is more about the marketing and less about the product.</li>
            <li> There is a limited market for ALL high priced beauty products.</li>
            <li> The claims that are made, including the positive reviewers on this page, merely generate money for the promoter and are not meant to accurately reflect its benefits.  </li>
            <li> Most people who have \\&quot;amazing\\&quot; results are the same people trying to sell it to you and to sign you up under them, and the before/afters are either literally unbelievable or obviously done under different lighting at slightly different angles.</li>
            <li> No product is for everyone, if it doesn&#x27;t work for you it doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not a fabulous product, but for this girl my skin has truly NEVER looked better!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not interested in selling any MLM stuff myself, but I really like the product and will continue to use it and buy from my friend.  </li>
            <li> And $80 a bottle isn&#x27;t that much considering what I&#x27;ve paid for other skin care &amp;#34;systems&amp;#34; that didn&#x27;t work this well.</li>
            <li> So - for me this is a terrific product and, while a little pricey, worth it.  </li>
            <li> I decided to purchase 2 of the night cream on amazon and the last bottle, half way through the cream changed to a dark golden color and turned very liquidly.  </li>
            <li> The first time I put it on, my face tingled and began to feel tight.</li>
            <li> Different products are developed to tackle a specific issue.</li>
            <li> The only place you should order Nerium is directly from an authorized Nerium Brand Partner for the following reasons: 1)</li>
            <li> I do not have the worst skin problems in the world nor do I have the best, but I will say thus far using the product for 2 weeks</li>
            <li> You must use at least 4 healthy pumps on wet skin before bed.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at first, but I fell in love after using it.</li>
            <li> Be wise and steer clear of this stuff,  this rash is embaressing, i&#x27;ts painful</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how many times to the meetings with very ridiculous ladies giving us testimony of this heavenly product.</li>
            <li> Over time, I built up a tolerance (just as you would to a medication you take daily) and the swelling decreased more and more...showing the wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It is lighter in color and it does not dry the same.&lt;br /&gt;No results with this cream.  </li>
            <li> All these crazy reviews, but only one good thing came from this.</li>
            <li> aka I&#x27;m not into pyramid schemes) and she threw major fits and arguments stating how I never do anything for her and how this is for my future.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m willing to swallow that little bit of BS.  </li>
            <li> The first couple of days my complexion seemed a little &amp;#34;brighter&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> little background first</li>
            <li> It is mathematically and physically impossible for everyone that gets involved in these practices to be successful.</li>
            <li> He has a large scar on his neck &amp; his skeptical hair dresser noticed improvement in appearance &amp; she&#x27;s been cutting his hair for more than 10 years!&lt;br /&gt;Nerium FIRM is also AMAZING!  </li>
            <li> It smells funny, makes your face feel tight and dry, and as far as I am concerned I have not seem results-</li>
            <li> Not only have I been positively impacted by this age defying skin care however, my observations of other Nerium Ad users have proven the reliability of this product to serve for multiple purposes.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t crazy about jumping into a pyramid scheme, but I did it because she was very sure about her results and others.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the high price tag!  </li>
            <li> I will have to say that apparently it works differently on people.  </li>
            <li> and I have used Estee lauder, Mary kay, merit norman, bare minetals, capita international products,</li>
            <li> I only used the bare minimum, as I know</li>
            <li> Apoptosis, on the other hand, is relatively civil, even though it may not sound so at first -- when a cell dies from apoptosis, the cleanup is much easier.</li>
            <li> Having exhausted my options to work this out with Nerium International and being met with a simple &amp;#34;sorry, we will not issue a refund&amp;#34;, I have filed a claim with the Better Business Bureau.</li>
            <li> Within the first few days I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> every so often so I don&#x27;t build up an immunity, so I am using the hot weather as my time to lay off for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I got a few pimples at first (they do say that can happen)</li>
            <li> I did get a noticeable difference within the first few days.  </li>
            <li> So I am giving this product 5 stars to help counteract the ridiculous reviews although for me personally it is a 3 and a half to 4 star based on cost and my own results.</li>
            <li> My age spots are significantly lighter, my wrinkles on my eyes and chest are much improved (not perfect--</li>
            <li> Obviously if they did half a billion dollars in their first 3 years without your approval, they won&#x27;t need it in the future either.</li>
            <li> With beauty being a major focus in our society today, people invest into several skin care products to satisfy simply one goal: to get the look their hoping for.</li>
            <li> After a few days I noticed my skin, which hasn&#x27;t been acne prone for maybe 10 years since I was in high school, completely break out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Botox and fillers in the past, and have been very loyal to several high end skin care lines in the past.  </li>
            <li> Is this just another very overpriced cream that really doesn&#x27;t do more than any other less expensive product?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But like all other things, it probably doesn&#x27;t help everyone, but I would highly recommend trying it for yourself.</li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I do have dry, sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It gave me inflamed red bumps all over my face after the first few times applying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a nice product but expensive and seems to take a long time to get rid of age spots.</li>
            <li> I used the product for several weeks and not only did I have major breakouts all over my face, but my skin actually hurt to touch.</li>
            <li> , couldn&#x27;t breath thought I was going to throw up , I was like putting and egg on your face , I took it off as fast as I could get it on , made my shin very dry , didn&#x27;t like it at all !!!</li>
            <li> Paid  a little more from the company and this was  a little dry</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t red anymore, but my under eye wrinkles have worsened and my skin is extremely dry and sensitive now.  </li>
            <li> It certainly did nothing for me and was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I really like it, however it does smell a little like hay</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a little pricey but after 6 weeks there is a very noticible difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You&#x27;ll spend a few hundred dollars and find it does very little for your skin, unless you want to approach every single woman in your path to tell them &#x27;How excited you are about your new career!&#x27;  </li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t tried any other new product and I broke out everywhere</li>
            <li> My pores are large and I am starting to get a few lines around my mouth and eyes.</li>
            <li> In other words, they have been building a personal downline network and they just keep finding a new pyramid scheme to get into and bring their network with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bad companies (and there are a lot of them out there) are just ripoffs, selling something, anything to make a profit and have a get rich quick mentality.  </li>
            <li> I have read the good reviews and the bad ones.  </li>
            <li> Nerium Ad has left as much of a positive impact on others, if not more, as it did me.</li>
            <li> If you are purchasing your NERIUM product from Amazon or any other means outside of directly from a Nerium Brand Partners website, you are putting yourself at risk.</li>
            <li> A specific extraction process known as NBio-PL is used to extract the plants unique and beneficial properties, leaving the poison behind.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t surprised to see the latest lawsuit filed because Nerium is using fake before and after pictures of Ray Liotta, when he has never even heard of the product!</li>
            <li> Your flushing your money down the drain or you are funding a new Lexus automobile for a Nerium distributor.    </li>
            <li> My grandmother has hyperpigmentation, aging skin, and other natural concerns that come along with aging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why so many people have such negative comments -</li>
            <li> a couple tan-colored discolorations on my face, which are completely gone!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had no sensitivity problems; I have no desire to try any other product (and believe me</li>
            <li> At first I just thought it was some kind of weird seasonal allergy-which I had NEVER experienced before.</li>
            <li> I am a 62 year old Black female that has purchased several facial products that did not work for me, this one does.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey but not as high as others that work this well.</li>
            <li> its cheaper, natural and diminishes my dark marks and scars, unlike internet hoaxes made public via multilevel marketing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The 1oz bottle didn&#x27;t last long enough to know if it was working</li>
            <li> Topical aloe appears to inhibit infection and promote healing of minor burns and wounds, frostbite, as well as in skin affected by diseases such as psoriasis and seborrheic</li>
            <li> My skin was feeling thinner, I was getting the puckers around my mouth, and my family has the brown spots develop as we get older, to mention a few.  </li>
            <li> Wake up people don&#x27;t let the negative world convince you that it&#x27;s wrong to form your own decisions!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 49 and have always spent way to much time in the sun and way too little care with my skin, so I have a lot of issues such as wrinkles around my eyes and lips, sun spots and some red tones on my face, my chest also has sun damage.</li>
            <li> but I have very delicate skin and have had no bad side effects.</li>
            <li> Use about 2-4 pumps (depends on how fast you want to see results), and with both hands apply it with a sweeping motion from the bottom of the neck all the way up to the hairline.&lt;br /&gt;TIP: It is completely normal for your face to feel very tight once the cream has dried.</li>
            <li> with any product, some will have more dramatic results than others, but I just can&#x27;t believe how well it worked for me!  </li>
            <li> It wasn’t every single day, it was every second or third day.</li>
            <li> I did take the before pics but that wasn&#x27;t really my concern to nit pick every small change on my face</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too hot to wear otherwise ... at least in L.A.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 50&#x27;s and had dark areas in the skin on my face from a lot of sun damage.  </li>
            <li> thinks its not the real product that she has used in the past???</li>
            <li> and I could not bare the smell.  </li>
            <li> I recommend hair and beauty products all day long because I paid money to become educated in this profession and when you have a product that falls within this category that is the only way it should be sold.  </li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t used this product long enough to warrant results</li>
            <li> Pretty much wasted $80 other than it moisturizing my face.</li>
            <li> Skin - Why is something that is natural looked down upon in our society today?</li>
            <li> While interesting, this is common in these type of items and may overall mean that the majority of people see no results at all.</li>
            <li> if researched we would find that a large portion of negative reviews here are biased in some manner towards Nerium through  competitors such as these.</li>
            <li> the other half didn&#x27;t see much in the way of results.</li>
            <li> I saw a very dramatic improvement and am so pleased with what Nerium is doing for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took me a few days to get used to the feel and smell of this, but now I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> I used the day cream, night cream and the new Firm lotion.  </li>
            <li> I also developed a slight rash around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Then my face just looks red and dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it 5 stars for all these reasons, and because it&#x27;s easy to use, but taking away a star because it is still expensive, even on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have Rosacea and after menopause my skin became painfully dry especially on my face.</li>
            <li> I later found an article online on the CBS affiliate&#x27;s website in San Francisco that quoted Dr. Vic Narurkar, the head of Dermatology at California Pacific Medical Center concerning the before and after pictures.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I am 55 years old and have spent a lot of time in the sun, this product feels like it is reversing the effects of age and lifelong sunbathing.</li>
            <li> NO ONE KNOWS how oleander will affect skin conditions in the long run as this product has only been out 3 years and they may not be long enough.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of use my skin was red and I developed acne along my jaw and hair line and my neck.</li>
            <li> What a mess, I was on auto direct for 4 months, loved the product until I had a horrible rash happen, went to my doctor and ruled out everything except the product because it was the only thing new I had tried in the last year.</li>
            <li> As for wrinkles and lines, I&#x27;m 68 and have had other work done on my face that reduced the deep lines, but I think I see minor improvement from Nerium; not enough that people tell me I look 10 years younger!</li>
            <li> The day cream does not stink, but can&#x27;t say anything positive or negative about it at this time.  </li>
            <li> Little tight on skin when first put on.</li>
            <li> The sample was given to me by a close friend who has, in a month of selling this schlock to the odd old school friend, become a strange Nerium drone.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s even worse, is that for as long as I can remember she is SUPER against pyramid schemes, so I have no idea</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I did not see any changes in my skin or fine lines.  </li>
            <li> I know that I can relate, along with many other people, to the shameful insecurities of having flawed skin.</li>
            <li> i was patient, becuase when starting Other skin care lines similar things have happened...</li>
            <li> Right away I was skeptical, as this seemed strange for something to apparently be sold in such a fashion as to mimic a pyramid scheme.</li>
            <li> so far seeing a little improvement to my complextion.</li>
            <li> After three days I had hard waxy gunk coming out of my pores and at the end of 1 week my skin was so much smoother because my pores had been cleaned out.</li>
            <li> I found their MLM/pyramid scheme and worship of their founder a bit weird too, they sound like a cult.  </li>
            <li> I found their MLM/pyramid scheme and worship of their founder a bit weird too, they sound like a cult.  </li>
            <li> After 3 months of going cold turkey on sodas and sugar drinks and then using an exfoliater, my skin is now better than it ever was while using Nerium.</li>
            <li> I am writing because of all the negative reviews on a product that really worked for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late fifties, blonde with normal skin.</li>
            <li> Aloe&#x27;s small molecular structure helps penetrate moisture at the cellular level all the way to the last layers of the skin (Epidermis, Hypodermis) and acts as a natural cleansing agent.</li>
            <li> so will consider the next purchase carefully</li>
            <li> The product delivered minor fading of brown spots.</li>
            <li> MINOR.</li>
            <li> So, I signed up for autoship under my friend and will continue to use it as long as I see the results.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it was the Nerium because I had used it for so long with no problems.  </li>
            <li> lets see how long the refund takes.....</li>
            <li> Nerium is a complete scam and a waste of your money.</li>
            <li> Have used for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just because I have really sensitive skin, but after a few days, I started to break out.  </li>
            <li> The studies were HOWEVER not conclusive on LONG TERM effects of applying said chemical to one&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> not even minor ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They did not offer me money back for the $120 I spent.</li>
            <li> but then started getting skin burns after long periods of use and remember this is  mlm  </li>
            <li> I used this product only a couple of times and now is empty.</li>
            <li> Hope to continue it for a long time.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t  know how long this product has been sitting on the shelf or if it has been exposed to sun and heat.</li>
            <li> How long did it take for you to damage your skin?</li>
            <li> Well think how long could it take to repair it.</li>
            <li> The before and after photos that Nerium and all of their distributors use on their websites are fraudulent, they are not real, they are pictures which have been digitally enhanced.</li>
            <li> I have had minor problems with ordering through the website and cancelling items but</li>
            <li> This has been,  by far, my most disappointing skin/cosmetic purchase ever!</li>
            <li> actually got worse for the first 4 or 5 days.  </li>
            <li> When this inevitable destiny occurs, the only money to be made is not from the product or service but from the losses of people lower down in the organization.</li>
            <li> 90 days later I have spent over $300 and my skin is a red, acne prone (never was prior) mess.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t take before and after photos for granted, they are taken at different times under different lighting and could even be subject to Photoshop.</li>
            <li> I have had numerous people compliment me on my face saying it looks different or that I am glowing (no I am not pregnant), so it is the cream.</li>
            <li> The bottom line is last week I gave away my last half bottle to a friend who had been approached by a distributer.  </li>
            <li> I mean how do you know if you got the real thing from Amazon?  </li>
            <li> You have to remember to wet your hands first or its very dry and hard to use.</li>
            <li> My skin was dry due to the cold weather, so most days I was using my regular Philosophy moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s priced  too high and would like to see the company come down a little in it&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> Everyone has different skin, this product isn&#x27;t for my skin though I know it works for other people&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> There are only a couple of things that do that, one is Botox and the other is a surgical brow lift.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> I know and have talked with several other people regarding their Nerium Ad experience.</li>
            <li> Why are all the before pictures extremely focused and in detail, and all the after pictures are all softened, off focus, and with different lighting?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works the same as any other age defying cream on the market.</li>
            <li> In the long run after I&#x27;ve been through the Avon Age defying stuff, I have come out cheaper using Nerium!</li>
            <li> I knew it would take longer coming from over seas but never has anything taken this long!</li>
            <li> It seems like a long time to wait for results!</li>
            <li> In fact I actually prefer the earthy smell to the other perfumy smelling lotions I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was told by a friend that is was a miracle cream, excuse me, but that&#x27;s a crock !  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little expensive and most people can not afford it.</li>
            <li> I like this product, but for the $$ I think I&#x27;ll switch back to other nite creams.</li>
            <li> I love the science behind this product!!</li>
            <li> My skin is not exactly like yours -- or yours - or yours - I don&#x27;t care what the tests in the laboratories have \\&quot;proven\\&quot; -- The bottom line is I am saying that based on the results I personally had, I gave it 5 stars</li>
            <li> Some of the minor lines are gone completely and a few deeper ones are much less deep.</li>
            <li> I would say each company has a decent enough product that you should be somewhat satisfied if you use it long enough and don&#x27;t have outrageous expectations.</li>
            <li> But, if your company actually says one thing that is understood by the general public to mean one thing</li>
            <li> The second week I woke up each day with several new blemishes culminating in a complexion worse than when I&lt;br /&gt;was</li>
            <li> but my skin is dry dry dry.</li>
            <li> I keep trying to dry them out with cleansers and products and nothing is working.  </li>
            <li> My skin didn&#x27;t feel dry or peeling...</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin, so I do use a moisturizer over this product.</li>
            <li> Tingly, crunchy, dry, and itchy.</li>
            <li> I had 2 dry patches beneath the corners of my mouth - gone.</li>
            <li> Also dramatic reduction in smile lines at edges of my mouth.</li>
            <li> Let it dry, go to sleep.</li>
            <li> almost four months later I am left with dead, dry skin.</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but I feel its worth a 3 month trial before I make my final decision.</li>
            <li> As a skin care junkie I can honestly say this is worthless not to mention potentially poisonous.</li>
            <li> but as I am getting a little older it was beginning to dry out a little.  </li>
            <li> every night we realized that we didn&#x27;t have a single change in our skin that could show the benefit of the product.</li>
            <li> My dark dpots became lighter and I actually had people come up to me and ssk me what I&#x27;m using?  </li>
            <li> I did not notice an improvement with fading dark spots, but it definitely firms.  </li>
            <li> And maybe people only spend on average 4 hrs a week selling it.  </li>
            <li> The dark spots I had is gone and my pores are way smaller.</li>
            <li> It does work if used properly and it is a shame that the negative comments could have been avoided if only the proper guidelines were followed and skin issues addressed.</li>
            <li> Be careful with long term use of Nerium.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle cream, not approved by the FDA, and long term effects are unknown.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no difference to crow&#x27;s feet, wrinkles (although minor), age spots (biggest issue), and sun damage.</li>
            <li> Wonder what kind of damage has already been done to my skin. :(</li>
            <li> Honestly, don&#x27;t see any difference from a month ago. :(  </li>
            <li> Products show miraculous results, but they tell you they can&#x27;t make an actual health claim or the FDA will jump down their throats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It shrunk my pores down to nothing, took the red out of my complexion and evened out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> The down side is that after awhile it stops working, so I go off of it for a month or two and then come back.  </li>
            <li> Now six weeks in, my former classmates noticed at an annual reunion (we like each other, go figure!).</li>
            <li> Smell is a little strong,have not used long enough to determine results.</li>
            <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t try it long enough, but I was expecting to see some, even a little, improvement.  </li>
            <li> Jeff Olson mentioned in his book &amp;#34;The Slight Edge&amp;#34; that people will tell their positive experience to 3 people, negative to 33 people.</li>
            <li> DO YOUR RESEARCH, smells bad and for the money you could buy several other products that work better.</li>
            <li> I went through an entire bottle in less than a month.</li>
            <li> Another Nerium person told me it wasnt possible as less than 1% of people had a reaction to...</li>
            <li> but my skin texture is smoother, my pores are less noticeable and I feel like my overall complexion has improved dramatically.</li>
            <li> them suddenly I noticed open blisters, and small bumps all over my cheeks.</li>
            <li> In less than 24 hrs, I was covered in bumps, lumps, hives and red blotches for two weeks!</li>
            <li> The skin is smoth, the lines less deep, not sags under the eyes.</li>
            <li> but I definitely have a smoother and less visible pores.</li>
            <li> So, here they&#x27;re telling me that the $500 I invested is a total loss, non-refundable, and not worthy of respect within their company</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t dry or empty, the pump was broke,  I scraped it and put it in a jar to use .  </li>
            <li> This product seemed starting working, then the bottle was finished in less than a month.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No bacteria was present, and I was not/am not pregnant.</li>
            <li> an attorney I fully expect to see a products liability case in the next few years when people start seeing the long term side effects.</li>
            <li> I heard about the company 2 years ago and was super skeptical.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed with the day cream but the night cream has changed my skin texture tremendously on my face, neck and chest.</li>
            <li> It is very dry and has cracks around my nose.</li>
            <li> This stuff SERIOUSLY works, I still think the price is way too high.</li>
            <li> After Nerium AD night cream it is now a red, bumpy, acne prone mess.</li>
            <li> I noticed most of these reviews were just biased and full of stupid false accusations, so I hope this review, based solely on facts, helps someone in their decision.</li>
            <li> bottle is a little vague on application and since this stuff isn&#x27;t cheap, here is my advise: Wash and dry your face.</li>
            <li> I went home and reflected on what I had done differently in the last few weeks and narrowed it down to Nerium.  </li>
            <li> was curious about the fancy product container and took it part to find an inner little bottle that was  cleverly disguised to hold a very small amount of product.  </li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling tight and I did not see any improvement.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I noticed was my skin felt sticky and tight upon application</li>
            <li> However, after reading the reviews (and being very surprised by the myriad of bad reviews listed), I felt compelled to leave my two cents worth.    </li>
            <li> If you applied yourself as hard in your business as the anger of writing this review perhaps you would achieve in building something bigger and better!</li>
            <li> I looked at the negative reviews through the filter that separates negative reviews from positive, the negative reviews are largely from \\&quot;Unverified</li>
            <li> It gave me blackheads, zits, and little white bumps called Millia (which is hardened oil underneath the skin) that wouldn&#x27;t pop.  </li>
            <li> I have only had it for one month and have seen no significant improvement.  </li>
            <li> I have been using one squirt of Nerium AD, moistened with a little water and massaging it into my face, neck, and upper chest.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> No other product that I&#x27;ve used in the past have given me these results.</li>
            <li> Sometimes we are way too critical and notice every little flaw.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be finishing the week trial, my skin, looks dull and I developed a rash.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When I bought it from you the bottle won&#x27;t pump, it gets hard and it seems like it is old.</li>
            <li> I know that the bad ones are mostly from people who are jealous or against mlm companies.  </li>
            <li> Most of the comments where about the bad costumer service and</li>
            <li> I read so many negative reviews, and the common complaint is that people felt pressured, cheated, or the product &amp;#34;failed&amp;#34; to achieve miracle results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not able to even go be outside without covering myself in long sleeves in fear</li>
            <li> But I still gave it a chance and kept on reading and realized the only reviews about this product are really shorty or overly exaggerated 5 star.</li>
            <li> I just spent over an hour trying to submit a ticket</li>
            <li> With MiNIMAL  to zero results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It stops working if you stop using it, but a couple of pumps on a wet face each night can erase years in about two weeks.</li>
            <li> After doing a lot of digging on the internet, I found a few people who had similar reactions.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money and possibly your health.</li>
            <li> I use one or two pumps and rub it on my wet palms and apply with upward and outward strokes to face, neck and chest.  </li>
            <li> The MD Anderson Cancer Center has already distanced itself from the findings at Nerium Biotechnology and the FDA has not approved this product (Of course its cosmetic in nature).</li>
            <li> I went home and at night I followed the instructions she gave me of 2-3 pumps applied to a wet face.</li>
            <li> No real difference.  </li>
            <li> Needs your skin to be wet when you apply and it goes on like paste.  </li>
            <li> , it feels like it&#x27;s empty.</li>
            <li> I have used it a couple of times and now it seems to be empty.</li>
            <li> all similar schemes...profit off your friends, I am not available to attend the party.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Spent quite a bit of money because I got both day and night products (</li>
            <li> Please be so careful of this stuff.  </li>
            <li> No real antiaging properties to it.  </li>
            <li> TOTAL waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a month and there is not much change in my skin.</li>
            <li> Your skin is tighter after the creme drys, pores are closed and wrinkles are diminshed.</li>
            <li> it was empty.  </li>
            <li> Mr. Turner, btw ended up in jail for defrauding people out of thousands of dollars.  </li>
            <li> Spent about 10 years trying to get rid of my Rosacea &amp; sun damage.</li>
            <li> i feel i&#x27;m missing out on the 25 minutes of playing over the sink with various products.  </li>
            <li> After a few morning hours you&#x27;ll notice the imperfections are back!</li>
            <li> Just be careful whose advise you seek in anything you&#x27;re buying.</li>
            <li> When I received this item the bottle was empty.</li>
            <li> It was just what I expected.</li>
            <li> ordered this one to replace the one that had arrived either empty or non functioning pump.</li>
            <li> I have applied it to wet skin.</li>
            <li> Your face must be wet when you put in.</li>
            <li> I spent $350.</li>
            <li> After using it for 2 and 1/2 months now, I&#x27;m not really sold on effects against &amp;#34;ageing&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have spent 1000&#x27;s on trying to find a wrinkle cure</li>
            <li> The smell is HORRID and never goes away, there is no way I can sleep with it on, I had to rinse it off a few hours later.  </li>
            <li> a total waste of money..don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> I had a few red splotches that are gone.  </li>
            <li> Be careful and take the time to a) read what&#x27;s in it and</li>
            <li> but I was curious to what this is because it&#x27;s something that sounds like one of those scams.</li>
            <li> You apply it too a wet face and it turns paste</li>
            <li> My goodness, take a picture before the use then another a few weeks later.</li>
            <li> She has eczema and a has tried just about everything to diminish the rough patches on her face.</li>
            <li> Retinol is harsh stuff and almost every &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; product has it as a key ingredient.</li>
            <li> Not really.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent thousands of dollars on laser skin treatments with minimal results.</li>
            <li> Rating this prouct 3 stars because I&#x27;m just not seeing results that I expected within 30 days.  </li>
            <li> Save up all that money you would have spent on any anti-aging products and get a facelift or even a Co2 Laser Peel.</li>
            <li> Her instructions were, leave your face dripping wet when you apply 4 pumps of the treatment.</li>
            <li> Not everyone who has sampled the products has purchased it, but that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> But, please be careful if you have kids.</li>
            <li> ; 2) Nerium stands behind its products and offers a 30-day money back guarantee.</li>
            <li> My eyes are far worse than prior to using Nerium AD.</li>
            <li> company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The immediate red flag that popped up for me was that the &amp;#34;magical ingredient&amp;#34; is derived from one of the most violently poisonous plants on the planet.</li>
            <li> and I am still burnt around my eyes and down the left side of my face.&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, embrace your wrinkles the pain is not worth it.</li>
            <li> Nerium leaves a bad taste on the mouth for those savy enough to admit they are such prowlers in the nature of business, but then again who knows really, right?</li>
            <li> The stuff doesn&#x27;t work - plain and simple.</li>
            <li> My crows feet have diminished very slightly but I am in the  desert sun constantly</li>
            <li> Certain foods gift me with break outs (coffee, pasta) but no cream has ever done anything this dramatic to me.   </li>
            <li> you may get the wrong product or a half full bottle or a completely empty bottle all together!</li>
            <li> I have ordered this from the actual company and this bottle lasted me less than half the time the bottle from Nerium lasted</li>
            <li> After using these evil creams for 3 weeks, my face started swelling and becoming very itchy...</li>
            <li> I had some problems with small, deep pimples during the month.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if you all know what that means, but you cannot simply just get a patent.</li>
            <li> In other words, its a fraud.</li>
            <li> When I was first introduced to Nerium Ad, I was a bit skeptical due to the fact that it is a product of multi-level marketing.</li>
            <li> However, after hearing testimonies of other Nerium Ad users, I was tempted to try.</li>
            <li> That is not to say that other products never work.</li>
            <li> and I am anxious to see the difference after the next 90 days.</li>
            <li> Careful!</li>
            <li> I do not use any other rigorous skincare treatments.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spoken to several dermatologist and &amp;#34; There&#x27;s no magic lotion for wrinkles&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Roc and TNS and other products in between those two price points.  </li>
            <li> I stopped using my other product to try this out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Like other reviews have stated, my boyfriend and I were invited to a &amp;#34;party&amp;#34;, which turned out to be a Nerium party.</li>
            <li> Its expensive and my first purchase of a product like this</li>
            <li> I can feel it working after it dries and see a small improvement in my skin overall.</li>
            <li> I was not that disappointed as most of these products seem to be just a profit maker for the companies.</li>
            <li> and I will continue to use Nerium AD and recommend this product to other people.</li>
            <li> I had to share my story so other people can learn from my experience with this product.  </li>
            <li> For some people the chemicals in the face product might cause a break out or other issues, that is a chance everyone takes when  you start something new.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am never going to purchase any other creme again.</li>
            <li> it is due.</li>
            <li> I became extremely concerned when I felt my lips begin to swell.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t afford no 100.00 shipment a month ( this is pushy, but other companies do this also).</li>
            <li> the morning, I have no routine other than to just apply my make</li>
            <li> Now trying products to get rid of the rash and switching back to my usual Neutrogena products.  </li>
            <li> That said, the reps probably account for the other 30% to make the product rating of 3.5.  </li>
            <li> So, FDA is as sketchy of a resource as any other.</li>
            <li> Can buy it for $80 with other benefits.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was even using bleaching cream on my face lots of other product on my skin.</li>
            <li> Pretty goodroduct, a liitle expensive though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product &#x27;NERIUM&#x27; was an ACCIDENTAL discovery by a company called NERIUM BIOTECHNOLOGY in search of a skin cancer treatment and other treatments.</li>
            <li> I read where some people complained about Nerium shipping it to them every 30 days which was apparently too soon for them.</li>
            <li> The other had no improvement</li>
            <li> It may fit/work for you -- on the other hand, it may not.  </li>
            <li> In other words, move on to find another product that will do for you what this one did for me.  </li>
            <li> I would be EXTREMELY nauseous during the day but would vomit at night.</li>
            <li> I suspect the inflammation in my thyroid is also due to NeriumAD.</li>
            <li> This product is no different from any other age defying products I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> It is sold by multi-level marketers who make money from recruiting other sellers.  </li>
            <li> and yup, a couple small zits (not acne or breakouts) returned and in different spots.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really dont care how good a product is if the company and the people behind it are terrible.</li>
            <li> Day three, my skin seemed a little dry.  </li>
            <li> I am very careful about what products I will use on my skin.</li>
            <li> There is no water in the formula and your face and neck must be very wet.</li>
            <li> No significant bags under my eyes but still not normal.  </li>
            <li> Seal broken but seemed new.</li>
            <li> the bottle was half empty  </li>
            <li> I have had absolutely no reactions and neither has my Mother-in -law who loves the product and would rate it at 4 and a half to 5 stars.</li>
            <li> So in conclusion, instead of making a bunch of uneducated false accusations on a product that actually does work, whether you like it or not, just look at it with an open mind.</li>
            <li> No positive results BUT started to to develop these tiny hard bumps on my face.</li>
            <li> WOW, talk about feeling dumb for rubbing poison on my face.</li>
            <li> I can accomplish that same result with diligent moisturizing using a far less expensive product that I can purchase at the drug store.  </li>
            <li> I did receive - and it appears to be empty - the pump seems to work - but only a very small amount came out.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product faithfully for a little over a week and have taken before and after pics and see absolutely no difference.  </li>
            <li> * Remember to have your face a little wet when you apply it.</li>
            <li> It should not contain retinols or salicylic acid as they can break down the active ingredient in Nerium AD.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> My main concern is my uneven skin texture and enlarged pores along with the frustrating problem of combination skin.</li>
            <li> After going to my dermatologist and discussing the reaction and product with them they said they would never recommend using the product they gave other product recommendations that were also half the cost and didn&#x27;t cause my face to swell.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t think it passed other products that you would pay less for.</li>
            <li> But, it still made it hard to move my face and left the residue.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Back to the saleslady, who gave me a hard time and said</li>
            <li> But my crazy 11&#x27;s are gone and so are my laugh lines.</li>
            <li> For me?...the product did not work and was not worth the $150.00/month cost.</li>
            <li> This product is truly indefensible in my opinion and not worth the price for vanity.</li>
            <li> I did not work on fading my dark spots.  </li>
            <li> it was not worth it at all.</li>
            <li> No, you don&#x27;t get a 30 day guarantee when you buy it here, but at least you&#x27;re not being harassed by fanatical tin foil hat and soon to be former friends, put on autoship, or</li>
            <li> This product is not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> It also helped my boyfriend with his dark circles.</li>
            <li> the run around I have received is not worth it,  </li>
            <li> Its not worth the price though.</li>
            <li> Color of the cream is dark brown and it should be beige.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t help but wonder if the negative reviews did the following:    1) use the night cream with a damp face?  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money</li>
            <li> Not just in wrinkles around the eyes but also the texture of my skin, dark spots faded.</li>
            <li> I have had dark spots on the side of my face for quite some time.</li>
            <li> The only negative is the smell.</li>
            <li> Was not worth the money..... did not see any results</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly it is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I did not age over night nor get dark spots overnight; however, been using products for over 2 months and seeing gradual results each month.  </li>
            <li> not worth the money.</li>
            <li> So please keep that in mind everyone when reading through the massive negative one star reviews posted here.</li>
            <li> From my experience, it&#x27;s not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Vitamin A helps in smoothing out the skin and combined with Nae8 works to reduce dark spots&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know because I too had the same issue, \\&quot;it smells, its thick</li>
            <li> I used it everyday for two months and there was absolutely no change.  </li>
            <li> Oh and if you HATE network marketing &amp;#34;catch phrases&amp;#34; like &amp;#34;you&#x27;re on FIRE&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;You don&#x27;t want to miss this ride!&amp;#34; you will want to beat all of them senseless :)</li>
            <li> (I knew only because of the before and after pictures because the change is slow.)    </li>
            <li> to the person who said not to trust Nerium Labs, because they ARE the product, that is inaccurate at the most base level.</li>
            <li> Can definitely see a change slow change but still getting lighter</li>
            <li> Just because it&#x27;s expensive does not mean it works!  </li>
            <li> Put just one pump of product in your hand and swiftly massage onto your moist face from forehead down to cheeks.</li>
            <li> They did however go down after a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> the texture of the product which felt watered down</li>
            <li> and I needed to water it down a bit.  </li>
            <li> Nerium is trying to shut these sources down.</li>
            <li> How can Nerium give a &amp;#34;30 day money back guarantee&amp;#34; when they actually mean 30 days from the date of purchase and NOT the date the customer receives the product to try?</li>
            <li> and you actually mean something entirely different</li>
            <li> When I say religiously, I mean RELIGIOUSLY.</li>
            <li> However this bottle ran out in less than a month</li>
            <li> Nerium has not done half a billion dollars in revenue in 3 years on a faulty product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product for a week and a half.</li>
            <li> I am finding that I am using less make up.</li>
            <li> My mom gave me a half used bottle of Nerium to try.</li>
            <li> Way less wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard that people who ordered from Amazon have received bottles that exploded during shipment or the cream had turned black.</li>
            <li> The CEO of Nerium, one Jeff Olson, has connections with previous MLM practices and self-written help books as a lure to suck the uninitiated in.</li>
            <li> Such expectation is ridiculous to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> (30 day trial is a joke, used it for 2 and a half weeks</li>
            <li> Our necks and jowls are lifting and wrinkles are much less.  </li>
            <li> Treatments need to be typically followed by a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s used it for less time than me</li>
            <li> much less grandkids</li>
            <li> It also has an odd smell to it that my family kept complaining to me that they didn&#x27;t like how I smelled at night.  </li>
            <li> My aesthetition started me on it, and I continued through Amazon, because I could get it for less.  </li>
            <li> I also did not use any other products other than my usual face wash along with it.  </li>
            <li> or credit card because i use less than the recommended amount.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for about three weeks and can see a slight change.</li>
            <li> She can fake it to those on the outside, but get close enough and she will bite.</li>
            <li> and there is a slight offensive odor to the product</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get half way through with this bottle.  </li>
            <li> The product took some getting used to as it isn&#x27;t like a typical night cream.  </li>
            <li> Not enough a subtle difference.  </li>
            <li> They saw a difference from the previous year.</li>
            <li> 400 BOTTLES to even get slightly nauseous.</li>
            <li> Nerium works for me.marketing and less about the product.</li>
            <li> Within 1 month those places were half faded.</li>
            <li> for it was the third time I have ordered this product and it is expensive to only get a half bottle.</li>
            <li> but I like the non greasy feel and slight tightness</li>
            <li> I was out of this product in less than a couple of weeks or so.</li>
            <li> I feel it is making my skin tighter and wrinkles show less.  </li>
            <li> My opinion is a few less wrinkles is not worth $80.00/month.</li>
            <li> it instantly went through my mind that I should make an appointment with my cosmetic surgeon, this was not good.....</li>
            <li> people say to NOT use an acidic moisturizer with this product, but it is simply not true.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it on my face but continued using the Firm body lotion from my neck down.</li>
            <li> I broke down and bought a few months supply (you have to sign up for a subscription) because my friends were all pushing it.  </li>
            <li> It gave me a tight feeling face(and</li>
            <li> It feels tight on your skin.</li>
            <li> Makes your face feel like you are wearing a tight mask..</li>
            <li> I can only imagine will cause many grief and disappointment, but so be it, if they continue to hold to their current decision regarding my refund.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It could have been tampered with, kept in poor conditions, or old and past its shelf life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m freaking out now that I&#x27;ve put his stuff on my face for months much less thinking about the money I wasted on it.  </li>
            <li> It has diminish my dark spots faster than anything else i have ever used!</li>
            <li> Not worth it!  </li>
            <li> there has been no significant change or improvement at all.</li>
            <li> And I have a little glow again....</li>
            <li> A little bit of improvement for a LOT of money.</li>
            <li> I read through these reviews before I purchased and had to say I was a little nervous to try this.  </li>
            <li> I did feel a little tingling and tightness, but not dryness.</li>
            <li> I dug a little and found that the studies done on this product found little harm to the skin from the oleander extract it harbors.</li>
            <li> Also if it Kills cancer cells, that should be a red flag warning, skin is delicate!</li>
            <li> a little damp and apply an amount the size of an eraser on the tip of a pencil.</li>
            <li> It seemed to help a little but nothing miraculous.</li>
            <li> maybe my skin felt a little smoother.  </li>
            <li> Guess a little air brushing would work too.</li>
            <li> I am beginning to see a little difference in my wrinkles around eyes and lips.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my neck for a little over a year now.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy it for a little longer and see</li>
            <li> etc, so I found it on Amazon a little cheaper, and will probably not stop using it ever again.</li>
            <li> I have seen some improvement by using Nerium AD but not a significant change.  </li>
            <li> Not even a little bit.</li>
            <li> I see a little difference after two months.</li>
            <li> Product definitely not worth it !</li>
            <li> I tried it for 5 days and saw a little improvement</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over 3 weeks</li>
            <li> A little over 6 weeks ago.</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t have minded the stuff making my face hard to move if it had worked even a little bit, but I saw absolutely no difference</li>
            <li> Nerium websites!!,these bottles are either used ,expired,or tampered with other products !!</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about the daycream was the weird smell-kind of like wet Velveeta cheese, not a good smell!</li>
            <li> Seeing these bad comments are making me laugh.</li>
            <li> I have the Firm product as well, but the verdict is out on that.  </li>
            <li> The company even stands behind their product with a 30-day money back guarantee.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, this 52 year old put a stop to that nonsense.</li>
            <li> waste of money.</li>
            <li> Give it a few weeks</li>
            <li> Within a few weeks of using Nerium, \\&quot;beyond its guarantee\\&quot; became an understatement.</li>
            <li> I am 29 and started having trouble with acne along my jaw line this year.</li>
            <li> A few of my friends started using it and when I saw their results, I was blown away.</li>
            <li> It turned out to be a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand what others say about the smell which fades once it is on and dried.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a scam try for three months waste of money</li>
            <li> I knew Nerium was expensive, but i saw pictures of ( she lives far away from me) of her after taking this creme and i was stunned.</li>
            <li> It seems Nerium sellers are trained to willfully deny that their cream is a poor product comprised of a poisonous plant plus standard OTC drug store ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Heavy pressure sales.</li>
            <li> I found that it actually dried out my skin and didn&#x27;t deliver promised results at all.  </li>
            <li> and I skipped a few nights</li>
            <li> She said her skin had improved everyday</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now</li>
            <li> I have noticed that the few winkles I had under my eyes are gone.</li>
            <li> the sun will only make it hurt worse.  </li>
            <li> The testimonials of a few people how got in at the start of the pyramid.</li>
            <li> i re-ordered and it was thin out not the same product</li>
            <li> Clinique, Lancome, Neutrogena, just to name a few.  </li>
            <li> I used on damp skin (otherwise it doesn&#x27;t spread evenly, gets cakey, wastes product, etc.).</li>
            <li> I use alphahydrox a few times a week to remove dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> If you get a lot of sun exposure, this is a must.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few methodologies that people employ to protect themselves from aging.</li>
            <li> am i missing.?  </li>
            <li> Safety seal was missing on the box.</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> My skin was firmer and today my skin tone and uneven skin texture is evening out.</li>
            <li> It did break my face out a few times, because I was using it with my prescribed acne medicine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if my bottle is broken, but i have to take the entire thing apart to get any product out.</li>
            <li> Think of how it would be to sleep with a dried up face mask on</li>
            <li> This dried my skin out.  </li>
            <li> However, it is completely compensation driven not product driven and that&#x27;s unfortunate.  </li>
            <li> So, I hope to see results in a few weeks</li>
            <li> I like this product and have used it for a few months.</li>
            <li> It smelled like a mix of burnt rubber, and sun dried rotten cactus.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews on Amazon and found that more people hated the cream and did not see the results they were hoping for</li>
            <li> /&gt;really can see a noticeable difference in a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> After a few friends have been posting using this product on their Facebook page I decided to give it a try in hopes of reducing pore size.</li>
            <li> I took before pictures as instructed and after a few weeks</li>
            <li> Either just purchase the product and be firm about your intentions, or jump into a business venture.  </li>
            <li> Something sorely missing in this day and age.</li>
            <li> and I used it everyday.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a waste.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard that can destroy the effectiveness of the product.</li>
            <li> It is my thinking that just like medicine, exercise, diet, (and even bathing suits), etc., when it comes to skin care products -- ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL.  </li>
            <li> I tried using this product for a few weeks with no results.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my skin within a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> an when cells die from necrosis, it&#x27;sa rather messy affair.</li>
            <li> a controlled, predictable routine.&lt;br /&gt;  Oleander releases cytochrome C, its used as a model protein for molecular evolution improving cell health.</li>
            <li> Bottom line...if a product is good like La Mer you don&#x27;t need a lame pyramid scheme to sell this crap.</li>
            <li> Right off the bat, I was shocked at the smell.  </li>
            <li> and I was using less pumps!</li>
            <li> All the other ingredients are common in all beauty products.</li>
            <li> will Change your life...notice the ppl giving negative reviews have Not reviewed any other product on amazon BUT nerium..</li>
            <li> The cream had dried to a peculiar, powdery film that required two washes of my raw, organic face wash.  </li>
            <li> I would say that the deep lines I hated so much are about half as noticeable to me as before.</li>
            <li> could notice a dramatic difference in my pore size and smoothness of my skin...not only on my face, but neck and hands as well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy.</li>
            <li> But I justed wanted folks to take the reviews seriously, don&#x27;t pay attention to unverified purchase reviews, anyone can write whatever propaganda they want</li>
            <li> The bottle was not full!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it hard, in the past, to get out of a monthly plan with other products (not with this company though).</li>
            <li> It is supposed to make your skin tight when you put it on at night!</li>
            <li> (I feel pretty bad</li>
            <li> The only downside to me is that it is a little expensive.</li>
            <li> If they just stop promising people impossible results maybe people would be happier.  </li>
            <li> only thing I&#x27;ve learned about this product is that there is an entire cult of people behind it that are only looking to suck your entire wallet out of you through their disgusting lucrative schemes.</li>
            <li> It made my skin dry, almost making wrinkles seem worse.  </li>
            <li> It sounds impossible considering the fact that it&#x27;s hard to find a reliable product in the first place.</li>
            <li> The bottle did not work proper, very hard to come out!</li>
            <li> The first few days were no big deal but after a week of using another product, my skin looked and felt awful -</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t have a plug in top, very disappointed</li>
            <li> I have very little sun damage</li>
            <li> He hated the &amp;#34;regime&amp;#34; and all the time it took twice daily to use but has to admit we did see decent results with their product as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe how someone with pasty dead looking skin (and I&#x27;m not going to name her)</li>
            <li> This was a total disappointment, the bottle was almost empty, it only lasted a week an a half and did not see any difference on my skin, sorry!</li>
            <li> Absolute junk that smells as bad as it works.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately you are speaking from a perspective that is different from someone still in a pyramid selling scheme.  </li>
            <li> The swelling and hives were usually responsive to 1 or 2 Benadryl</li>
            <li> so I stopped using it and no more burning and itching eyes.</li>
            <li> #34;money back guarantee&amp;#34; with the blatant disrespect I was shown.</li>
            <li> no more..</li>
            <li> I have no doubt that a small, SMALLLL percentage of people have some result</li>
            <li> Usually problems are going to show up within that time.  </li>
            <li> insane there are just as many one stars...</li>
            <li> , i cant wait to go back in there and prove them wrong.</li>
            <li> so I ordered a bottle doesn&#x27;t work as well and for the money I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> I have now been using the product every day for the past 3 weeks and would not give it up.  </li>
            <li> Big fancy hi-gloss magazine---you can guess why the product is so expensive because it has to fund all that hype</li>
            <li> i was spending 1,000 on the LINE of epicureaon, 110 on a small bottle of Osmosis, pericone. )</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it&#x27;s the miracle in the bottle it claims to be</li>
            <li> Still waiting for results after 1 month of use .maybe a small amount of improvement on a scale of 1 to 10 .</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a slick move....</li>
            <li> the stated its no more than vitamins and anti-oxidants and lotion that is overpriced, that&#x27;s all part of the mlm industry</li>
            <li> The bottle arrived empty or the dispenser was broken.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I see any change on my neck</li>
            <li> My family member was unfortunate enough to work for them.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if it&#x27;s the product or not.  </li>
            <li> Not sure I would re-purchase this item.</li>
            <li> This is not your usual night cream.</li>
            <li> What a waste!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the wrinkle relief, but it does make my skin feel tighter.</li>
            <li> I failed to open and test it.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased Nerium AD from a licensed Nerium distributor for the past year .</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it is empty or the pump is broken.  </li>
            <li> My skin burned and in the morning I woke up with small welps as if it were burned skinned.  </li>
            <li> waste of money!</li>
            <li> These so called (partners), where too lazy to go out and sell the product.</li>
            <li> It has a natural botanical scent to it and not some artificial perfume smell.</li>
            <li> Im not sure about this product yet.  </li>
            <li> no visible results, small rash...</li>
            <li> but I have not had to get one since using this as my skin tone has evened out and improved very nicely (No more scales).</li>
            <li> I mean, dead stop.</li>
            <li> and they are very preachy about it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel very heavy either.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is expensive, however, so are a multitude of other products that do less.  </li>
            <li> This product is too harsh for delicate skin but could work for thick and undamaged skin.</li>
            <li> , you will find they have a strict warning not to ingest Oleander even in small doses because it could cause a variety of negative health issues, including death.</li>
            <li> Low and behold, it&#x27;s done nothing  but make my skin significantly worse, and given me three uncomfortable nights trying to sleep with a stinky dried face mask on.</li>
            <li> Used this for a month and can&#x27;t really tell any difference:-(</li>
            <li> About half way through, the lotion got really, really thin.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work and way too expensive, I used with a nerium day cream, didn&#x27;t see any result, and made my skin dry and itchy</li>
            <li> That they can process my refund on Tuesday and that I would get a measly 1 month extra on my Prime membership!</li>
            <li> I put it on, it made it hard to move my face.</li>
            <li> They pushed hard for .e to be a partner and invest $500 after 7 days of use.</li>
            <li> Now I wonder how hard it will be to get out of the program.</li>
            <li> I ordered on-line because I didn&#x27;t want to sign up for the monthly orders since it is hard to stop monthly orders once you sign up.  </li>
            <li> The company make it really hard to return these creams.</li>
            <li> The company is hard to get a hold of and when you want to stop the product you keep getting transferred on hold lines to wait for someone to fax you a termination contract which you never get.</li>
            <li> Hard working</li>
            <li> And, you have to follow the instructions (I learned this the hard way, too).</li>
            <li> no nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Had a hard time returning it</li>
            <li> so I could give it to my friend, but the customer service person told me that they discard returned unopened product (I find that hard</li>
            <li> But this large of a company isn&#x27;t stupid.</li>
            <li> IT SMELLS SOOOOOOO BAD LIKE ITS OLD OR SOMETHING</li>
            <li> I have read s lot of the negative reviews and don&#x27;t understand them.  </li>
            <li> Do not leave a negative opinion when you did nothing to get there or do not understand the business.</li>
            <li> I hope this helps those that are conflicted about buying based on some negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> have not been sensitive to day or night creams in the past, so I was disappointed that I could not use the product.</li>
            <li> all you negative users there are no miracle creams out there</li>
            <li> If a brand partner is pushy and rude, put them in their place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a badass edgy haircut and everywhere</li>
            <li> Come on people have common sense</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m in my late 30s.  </li>
            <li> I would say that it smells a lot like soured laundry.  </li>
            <li> Not nice.</li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve had people at work tell me my face looks brighter.  </li>
            <li> This stuff stinks made my skin red and irritated  for days .So</li>
            <li> Everyone involved essentially loses their soul to this pyramid scheme.</li>
            <li> Just it was one day too late to return bc</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m stunned that there are negative ones on here.</li>
            <li> One of my friends became brand partner and asked if I would at least give it a try.</li>
            <li> I asked how late and was told that it isn&#x27;t going to arrive at all.</li>
            <li> Caused swelling of my eyes, made my eyes watery and just wasn&#x27;t seeing the results after purchasing this in late November 2013.</li>
            <li> I had seen some negative reviews on here</li>
            <li> Regarding negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> I am a sucker it appears.</li>
            <li> I guess there is always a negative, still this product does deliver</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s commonly used for suicide in places like Sri Lanka, where it grows.</li>
            <li> Nerium gives so much product away because it is WORTHLESS.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re forced to trust your zombie friends and family who are pushing the program on you.</li>
            <li> I am seeing results, slow of course</li>
            <li> the blemishes that I had are slowly going away</li>
            <li> I was the biggest cynic regarding Nerium and had to be forced by my daughter to even try it.</li>
            <li> I wear Nerium at night and have noticed my wrinkles slowly fading.  </li>
            <li> I slowly discontinued use (for me</li>
            <li> By the way, all the other ingredients in Nerium are laughable and common and found in EVERY OTC moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have used other products and seen smoother skin, tighter pores, but with this one, I am not impressed</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive and I have found other things that work for me....</li>
            <li> I also know that what works for one person doesn&#x27;t mean it will work for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also no stranger to other expensive products.  </li>
            <li> So furious because i wasted my time!!</li>
            <li> You do not have to be mean about it.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical of purchasing this product, but my daughter was pushing me so hard to sign up for it that I finally caved.</li>
            <li> My main concern is that this cream contains a violent toxin in it that I&#x27;ve read by some accounts has made people quite sick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There has been one highly-cited third-party clinical study with a very small group of people.</li>
            <li> Seriously, thank god it was from a sample</li>
            <li> I have melasma and my current skin product Obagi is difficult to find online, expensive and five steps.</li>
            <li> I have serious allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> Seriously, why would you tell me that?  </li>
            <li> My friends didn&#x27;t all scream &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; the day after, but I can see a subtle difference.  </li>
            <li> I am not immune to the subtle manipulation that comes from knowing someone in a multi level marketing scheme.</li>
            <li> (less expensive -  I use Aveeno night cream</li>
            <li> Sorry, that&#x27;s just not true.</li>
            <li> and it made my face feel tight and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> The product is expensive and has little to no data to support the claims.  </li>
            <li> Two well known skin doctors in beverly hills that a customer of mine met wtih explained that there is no research of this product and that oleander is poisonous and coming in contact in any way over period of time can cause skin reactions and swelling and bad reactions and was experimented with killing cancer cells and how can it do the opposite ?</li>
            <li> That has never happened to me in my 45 years of life so obviously the product was bad news for me.</li>
            <li> If I use water (which they only say to use water with the night cream) with the day cream it is not as bad.</li>
            <li> to the critics that are angry at the company and harshly attack it every aspect.  </li>
            <li> Smells really weird and dried out my skin.  </li>
            <li> NOT A GOOD PRODUC FOR ME.</li>
            <li> I had break outs and a painful red rash.  </li>
            <li> My crows feet were awful, the frown line and laugh lines deeper, so I asked my friend who signed me up</li>
            <li> The poor suckers who purchased the skin care products were also duped out of thousands of dollars as well.  </li>
            <li> There must have been a Nerium convention in St. Louis last week, because while waiting for my flight home it was non stop bombardment by people in Nerium shirts with before and after photos on their iPads and giving out their cards and making ridiculous claims...and every single one of the sales reps&#x27; skin looked awful with</li>
            <li> I can only give a review for the way it smells and makes me sick to my stomach and my eyes water</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will not buy it again due to my disappointment.</li>
            <li> That is a hard combo to find!</li>
            <li> My daughter posted on FB telling others about my horrible experience, and I get a call from the company telling me the post was sent to their legal department, talk about rude.</li>
            <li> By the third morning I had broken out in painful cystic acne.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line, use common sense!</li>
            <li> Firstly, the cream has a horrible odor.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve purchased my last two bottles on Amazon and have NOT been disappointed.</li>
            <li> Negative sells!</li>
            <li> Really bad, in fact, and it also made skin feel too dry during the time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost impossible to get it onto your skin when it&#x27;s wet because the product is so slimy.</li>
            <li> Also, for the gal who stated she was told it was her tough luck</li>
            <li> starting asking me what was wrong with my skin!!</li>
            <li> waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> Which Makes it less expensive!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m going to bash the company for my failure and disappointments!</li>
            <li> If you are not happy with your results from the product after ordering it from Amazon, it may be because the bottle had been tampered with, or diluted out.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;e ever played a game of &amp;#34;telephone&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;grape-vine&amp;#34; you can see how this approach can be misleading.</li>
            <li> Alas, you cannot fix a system that is fundamentally broken.</li>
            <li> The fact that he&#x27;s selling a product as well is what they call in the mafia game &amp;</li>
            <li> This took care of the rash and the bags under my eyes decreased.  </li>
            <li> I have rosacea and this product made it much worse.</li>
            <li> The cream smells so awful and does absolutely NOTHING.</li>
            <li> I waited a week, and things got much worse.</li>
            <li> Poor product, worse company.</li>
            <li> is a pyramid scheme and a poor product.</li>
            <li> I have years of education behind me.</li>
            <li> Each time my review is getting worse.</li>
            <li> I immediately called her and with the worse attitude</li>
            <li> but there are MUCH worse products.</li>
            <li> My face and neck swelled like crazy and having trouble breathing.</li>
            <li> and now I am broken out again.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I&#x27;ve even thought I looked worse.</li>
            <li> I scrubbed this crap off and put it back in the box.</li>
            <li> I hated the feel and the smell and quit using it even though it was 100 bucks, nearly.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this order, pump doesn&#x27;t work, can&#x27;t get cream to come out.</li>
            <li> However, after another two days my skin started to peel and the redness just got worse.  </li>
            <li> Decreased expectations of product</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the worst product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Wondering if some of these comments are coming from angry competitors that can&#x27;t get their hands on our patented ingredient (until at least 2029).</li>
            <li> My pore size has definitely decreased but not disappeared</li>
            <li> I finally tired it.</li>
            <li> If Nerium truly stood behind their product, they wouldn&#x27;t have to hide behind false claims.</li>
            <li> , that is FALSE ADVERTISING.</li>
            <li> It is very expensive and I just threw the money down the drain.</li>
            <li> It was very expensive and it just kept arriving once a month, even if iIhad not used up the previous bottle.  </li>
            <li> Ridiculous!</li>
            <li> Ridiculous!  </li>
            <li> I gave up on the product not only because of the lack of results, but also because I could not get past its horrible scent.  </li>
            <li> Her hidden agenda is I&#x27;m mad because I failed myself</li>
            <li> All the promo ads show men/women with dramatic improvement to their skin.  </li>
            <li> What do all the failed Nerium reps and people bamboozled into buying it do when they&#x27;re left with all this worthless product?  </li>
            <li> horrible saying mean things acting like it was my fault</li>
            <li> After 30 days, money wasted, bad smell in our face</li>
            <li> This is blatant dishonesty and a poor business practice.</li>
            <li> I have not tried this product, I just wanted to share my experience at the airport because I believe it was a clear give away of this disgusting marketing scheme.</li>
            <li> I hated this product, she reexplained to me about how to use it properly!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about using it after reading the reviews and thought I had wasted my money again on yet another expensive product.  </li>
            <li> If you go on any of the Nerium distributors websites or Nerium convention photos, you will see tons and tons of people  who have horrible, old looking, sagging, skin with brown spots, wrinkles, and turkey necks.</li>
            <li> Common Sense!!</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t like to do reviews if I have to give it a bad rating</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this was a freak reaction, however this was our experience with this so called miracle serum!!!</li>
            <li> The pump is crap, it makes your face so tight</li>
            <li> Weird chalky-looking texture on my skin, gone.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t just fake those numbers.</li>
            <li> Useless and expensive multi-level marketing razzle dazzle.  </li>
            <li> I tried this, not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I think my friendship with this Nerium rep has run its course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I think my friendship with this Nerium rep has run its course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I feel they bordered on illegal.</li>
            <li> You know, the silly &amp;#34;more must be better&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive</li>
            <li> and they just kept telling me i was doing it wrong.  </li>
            <li> Besides the awful smell and tightening/dry feeling the lotion gave me, I continued to use it because I wanted to see if it would actually make a difference.  </li>
            <li> After that I thought it would be to expensive to continue using so didn&#x27;t order it again.</li>
            <li> WAY too expensive for what it does</li>
            <li> I WAS DISAPOINTED WITH THIS EXPENSIVE PURCHASE............</li>
            <li> MLM itself is what pyramid schemes have become since they were made illegal.</li>
            <li> If you want to take, I would have to say 5 years off your skin and can afford this expensive cream, go for it.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical as I am not a fan of pyramid schemes but said I would try the product.</li>
            <li> Overpriced marginal product and fake &amp;#34;business opportunity&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> Save your money and feed the hungry or something, don&#x27;t waste it on a bottle of this crap.</li>
            <li> so sad what people do for money.</li>
            <li> what they said or did to get her to become involved in this, or the fact that she is obsessed with youth and beauty that made her want to be a part of this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was shocked to see all the negative reviews..</li>
            <li> i know a women who is a skin care expert and wanted to prove nerium wrong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m calling BS on this product, ridiculously expensive and misleading before and after photos.</li>
            <li> Too expensive and after a month of use</li>
            <li> and she said OMG I am sooo sorry...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it was not the product for me.</li>
            <li> I have had random people at work</li>
            <li> The product is expensive and I do not want anyone to be ill-advised.  </li>
            <li> and when i woke up the next morning i had the worst rash all over my face and under my eyes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m floored by how expensive it is though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Get informed before you write silly stuff.</li>
            <li> Could this be a fake?</li>
            <li> Results, price point, simplicity and the fact that they give back to solutions for all these terrible diseases out there!</li>
            <li> it sounds Silly, but now what will i play with.!!&lt;br /&gt;120 for 2 bottles.?  </li>
            <li> sorry.</li>
            <li> so I figured she wouldn&#x27;t steer me wrong.  </li>
            <li> , sorry that&#x27;s just a reality.</li>
            <li> I secretly suspected that she was getting botox, but I also know that my Mom is deathly afraid of anything to do with needles.    </li>
            <li> Weird texture?</li>
            <li> I thought it was to expensive my husband</li>
            <li> It is sad to hear how uncaring, scamming(ignoring cancellations), not doing returns the Co. has been according to these reviews.</li>
            <li> wrong.  </li>
            <li> I know what it means to fail to meet/</li>
            <li> Too expensive for what you get.</li>
            <li> I tried this product just to prove my friend wrong and within 7 days</li>
            <li> It is also extremely uncomfortable at night.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about Nerium, however, there is a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have always had horrible skin and now at 39 I not only have redness and bumps all the time</li>
            <li> Something is wrong with the bottle I received.</li>
            <li> I immediately was skeptical; however it warranted a try..</li>
            <li> I am about as skeptical as they come.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, neither of us would recommend this product to customers.</li>
            <li> Ray Liotta is suing the company for using a fake before and after picture of him.  </li>
            <li> Weird.</li>
            <li> If you have ANY interest in buying this product find a brand partner NOT from a random stranger off of AMAZON.</li>
            <li> it is too expensive).</li>
            <li> For now, I am not impressed yet and do not have the luminous skin</li>
            <li> Nerium didn&#x27;t fail you, you failed yourself!&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Think about all that nasty stuff that the product has to get rid of from not taking care of your face properly.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical and decided at the age of 29</li>
            <li> Nerium is an expensive product, but so is Lancome and Clinque and Murad.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I had tried Murad prior to ordering Nerium and that was terrible.  </li>
            <li> , all skin products are not alike and what works for me may not work for you, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s a bad product.  </li>
            <li> It really is ridiculous and shameful that they behave so badly.</li>
            <li> I seriously felt sick to my stomach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s uncomfortable to sleep, it stinks, it&#x27;s expensive, &amp; it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> A little on their skin or God forbid in their mouths could be very bad.</li>
            <li> After reading the ingredients I was really afraid to use this product wished I could of returned it but could not.......was totally not very happy with return policy.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s call it what she really is Angry and Selfish!</li>
            <li> This world is depressing how people let money drive their lives.</li>
            <li> After I apply it on, it flakes like crazy.</li>
            <li> Really, it stinks.</li>
            <li> there are the customers that get the cold shoulder when it comes to returning the product or has a problem with customer service.</li>
            <li> ; Disappointing.</li>
            <li> How dare and how dirty of this lady know my situation....</li>
            <li> Smells like really dirty feet.</li>
            <li> She did not have a reaction, but stopped using it after two weeks because it dried out her skin terribly.</li>
            <li> If you think a cream gave these results you are crazy.</li>
            <li> I swear people are crazy.</li>
            <li> the product stinks.</li>
            <li> Overpriced and dangerous.  </li>
            <li> After reading this depressing review how the person had to bash the Nerium company because they fell apart when</li>
            <li> I have reported these results to friends of the R&amp;F side they were incensed and tried desperately to persuade me that I am going to die from poisoning myself with Oleander.</li>
            <li> Bottom line to any one looking to buy; Please don&#x27;t be afraid to try it.</li>
            <li> worse, she told me that for every bottle of this crap I buy, SHE gets a &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; bottle to give out for people to sample.  </li>
            <li> but so expensive!</li>
            <li> this was a fake product!</li>
            <li> Product is very expensive</li>
            <li> The texture of this is terrible, its really thick and when it dries</li>
            <li> I feel badly for my friend because she is gung-ho for this product and invested as a brand partner.  </li>
            <li> it has a bad smell to it</li>
            <li> ITS REALLY BAD be carful</li>
            <li> and I feel bad for the people getting involved with it.</li>
            <li> The smell is bad</li>
            <li> Too bad its an MLM product</li>
            <li> and my face reacts to it badly.</li>
            <li> This produce smells so bad</li>
            <li> BAD BAD BAD LADY...</li>
            <li> #34;could have been a bad batch.</li>
            <li> I feel like a bad person for calling out a company I&#x27;ve been affiliated with</li>
            <li> The economy is bad, people are out of work, but yet, there are those barricuda&#x27;s out there who still prey on the meek.  </li>
            <li> Meh this stuff doesn&#x27;t seem too bad to me.</li>
            <li> It looks really bad.</li>
            <li> Plus, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad like some others.</li>
            <li> The texture is not too bad either, just like putting on makeup.</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked so bad.</li>
            <li> However, it does SMELL bad..</li>
            <li> ; isn&#x27;t a bad thing.</li>
            <li> BAD idea...</li>
            <li> The problem that I see with these bad reviews are the misunderstanding with the costumer on how the guarantee works and on how to use the product.</li>
            <li> I went to bed with it on one night and it smelled so bad</li>
            <li> And my husband has really bad sun-damaged skin.</li>
            <li> Why did my skin get a bad rash?</li>
            <li> People complain of tightness and smell, but in actuality the tightness is what I want and the smell isn&#x27;t bad and after a couple days you don&#x27;t even notice the plant smell at all.  </li>
            <li> , it was actually painful</li>
            <li> I was shocked.</li>
            <li> My rep was shocked and said he had never heard of this reaction before.</li>
            <li> it is making me sick.</li>
            <li> OMG I felt sick....</li>
            <li> sick of these multilevel get</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> disappointed</li>
            <li> Overprice and it did not deliver any of the claims, I will never purchase again. :-(</li>
            <li> I am disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I cannot express how disappointed I am with Nerium.</li>
            <li> I was terribly disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t going to sell something that&#x27;s dangerous!  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed that Amazon is allowing just anyone to put a review on here.  </li>
            <li> If your disappointed with what you bought, maybe ask yourself &amp;#34; Why am so cheap?&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> After a very awkward meeting at a friends house I felt pressured to buy it.</li>
            <li> This was very disappointing when you consider the cost of the product.</li>
            <li> I have to figure out how to fix my skin after this crap that I have used for eight months.</li>
            <li> Worthless product</li>
            <li> Ask a plastic surgeon about it and he will tell you what a joke this crap is.</li>
            <li> but really hate how it feels on my face and won&#x27;t be getting another bottle.</li>
            <li> and I would hate to think of what i would do without Nerium.</li>
            <li> She said she wanted to hate it</li>
            <li> But afterwards, if you find that you hate the product, the relationship is strained anyway.</li>
            <li> I should have reported her to the Macy&#x27;s customer service for trying to sell her crap in their store.</li>
            <li> I hate the pyramid stuff too.</li>
            <li> I hate that this is going in a direction</li>
            <li> It stinks (like awful stinch</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m still not going to sell it because I hate hitting people up for things and its just not my thing.  </li>
            <li> Stop giving a crap about what the media says - you WILL age (because there is this thing called TIME), and you WILL wrinkle.</li>
            <li> Nerium is awful after my mom used it I saw she was really sick from it</li>
            <li> It burns and itches so bad it keeps me up at night!</li>
            <li> HATE Nerium-- its terrible.  </li>
            <li> I think, like others have posted, if you hate it, you really hate it!  </li>
            <li> night one, I hated the feel of this product on my face.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very bad</li>
            <li> My face feels like it has a very bad sunburn.</li>
            <li> i got very painful acne</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, My brother got very sick and was in need of a 25,000 dollar a month treatment that my familys insurance wouldnt cover, my dad was unemployeed at the time and the insurance company (CIGNA) wouldnt budge with doctor letters or appeals.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Incredibly disappointed that a product that claims to help your skin, damages it!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed and will not order from this source again.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> My experience was awful.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d go through periodic breakouts, but I was under an insane amount of stress at the time</li>
            <li> and they have singularly the WORST WEBSITE EVER.</li>

            <li> I felt  very stupid in believe in what I saw and decide to use the product.</li>
            <li> the insane results nerium has posted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Nerium is horrible.</li>

            <li> a side note, pushing people to take before and after pictures is terrible.</li>
            <li> Trending complaints are for bad reactions to the product and the company!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Nerium AD is a WONDERFUL product!!!  I love it.</li>
            <li> This cream has definitely shrunk my pores and has diminished my fine lines around my eyes. It has not erased my wrinkles around my eyes, but let&#x27;s be real there is no miracle cream that does that. We know that good genes and a good nutrition help alot and a little botox here and there.</li>
            <li> I Have been using Nerium Night and Day for a little over month and a half and all I can tell you is that i Absolutly Love the product!  It has diminish my dark spots faster than anything else i have ever used! My jaw is firming up so nice and my pores are smaller and tighter!I know there are different opinions in this forum,but dont let these people full you,most of these bad reviews are selling other products ,notice what they do now,so as a custumer for Nerium it gas done great for me and my friends!However  i do want to make you AWARE OF, Do not buy product from THIS or ANY other sites on the internet, The ONLY guarantee of product is from Nerium websites!!,these bottles are either used ,expired,or tampered with other products !!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend Cassie uses it, and LOVES it! But in all honesty, it is better to order from a Brand Partner to ensure you receive a Guaranteed 30 Day Money Back Guarantee.</li>
            <li> Love this product ! I have seen amazing results. So glad my friend shared this product with me!</li>
            <li> This has been the absolute biggest waste of money EVER - and I used to do all those auto-ship CD memberships back in the day. The stuff doesn&#x27;t work - plain and simple. I was told to give it more time and not only did they swear it would work, but the auto-delivery discount would kick in and I&#x27;d save about $50. My experience was awful.  I&#x27;d go through periodic breakouts, but I was under an insane amount of stress at the time so I chalked it up to that. The last two, yes TWO shipments I paid for and never received, and they have singularly the WORST WEBSITE EVER. Stopped using it and guess what? Breakouts, gone. Weird chalky-looking texture on my skin, gone. Like another reviewer said, Neutrogena&#x27;s Ageless line is better - and if you want to go a price point down from that, Walmart&#x27;s Equate line is pretty darn good too. I kid you not. :)  P.S. I apologize for the disjointedness of this review - I just spent over an hour trying to submit a ticket / get in touch with SOMEONE from Nerium. Still unsuccessful. &amp;#62;&amp;#60;</li>
            <li> I love this product and would recommend to anyone. It works wonders and everyone should try it! Love it love it love it!</li>
            <li> Been using for 2 yrs. Great product but&lt;br /&gt;Bottles don&#x27;t have as much cream as they did two years ago but price is same.</li>
            <li> I am 42 years old and have been using Nerium AD day and night cream for 3 months...Here is my honest review. 1. I like the scent and I like the consistency of the night cream.  It love how it feels and how it makes my face feel when applying.  2. I think it is a bit pricey compared to drug store options, BUT I have spent as much or more on products from the med spa and department stores that have given me similar or less results. 3. I can&#x27;t say with conviction that the appearance of my crows feet have been reduced, but I have noticed that the wrinkles on my neck look much better.  and my skin feels great! 4. I am on the fence with the day cream. I use BB Cream and find that the day cream and bb cream combo is just too much moisture for my skin type. I would also like if the day cream had sun screen in it for days that I don&#x27;t want to use a tinted cream. 5. Huge bonus...my husband has told me on several different occasions that I look younger!!</li>
            <li> Products are awesome!! Everyone in my families using it whether it&#x27;s my 16 year old niece or my 85 year old mother. Awesome customer service &amp; great brand partners. THANK YOU NERIUM!!!!</li>
            <li> My friend let me try a sample for a week.  It looked liked my pores were becoming less visible and my skin softer, so I decided to try it for a while. My month pictures looked good.  My forehead had less noticeable lines, and I was excited.  At two months, we took the same pictures.  My forehead pictures looked like they did at the beginning, and I told my friend that there was a difference in lighting or angle.  Nothing has changed really but my pore size.  I feel badly for my friend because she is gung-ho for this product and invested as a brand partner.  I have the Firm product as well, but the verdict is out on that.  She has personally experienced results with this, but we&#x27;ll see.  I bought Firm on a special in the beginning.  My dermatologist recommends Neutrogena Wrinkle Defense.  Trying that.</li>
            <li> I used this for four weeks. I&#x27;ve always had acne, and still do. It did nothing for any fine lines or wrinkles either. This isn&#x27;t the miracle you are hoping for.</li>
            <li> I tried Nerium and immediately noticed my skin was tighter and smoother.  My dark dpots became lighter and I actually had people come up to me and ssk me what I&#x27;m using?  It was really quite funny!  I have read s lot of the negative reviews and don&#x27;t understand them.  I love their products and will be s lifetime user!!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in my skin yet at all.  I have used other products and seen smoother skin, tighter pores, but with this one, I am not impressed</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! Entire family uses it, absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> I am a licensed Esthetician who was curious about Nerium since there seemed to be so much buzz about it. I used the Night Cream every night until the bottle was empty, about a month, and did not notice much of a difference. Will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> One star is too many. I was given a sample and gave it a try. The night creme had such an offensive odor that I had to remove it before morning. Could not even sleep because of the smell! My husband who rarely comments about such finally asked, &amp;#34;what is that smell?&amp;#34;  I continued to use the day cream but saw no results and it doesn&#x27;t even contain sunscreen. Any dermatologist will tell you to use moisturizer with sunscreen. Total rip off. So glad I didn&#x27;t get caught up in it.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make a difference to my skin... Everyone has different skin, this product isn&#x27;t for my skin though I know it works for other people&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> Absolute junk that smells as bad as it works. Over priced network marketing company representatives selling their free supplies to get back their investment because it does not work as advertised. Product does not work period DO YOUR RESEARCH, smells bad and for the money you could buy several other products that work better.</li>
            <li> The product works great on my acne. Didn&#x27;t see much difference on wrinkles but I don&#x27;t really have any wrinkles to begin with.  Amazing results on acne though! However this bottle ran out in less than a month so I bought the next bottle from nerium itself.</li>
            <li> it has a bad smell to it and I did not see any results or difference.</li>
            <li> I took before pictures as well as pictures on weeks one, three, and four. I don’t see a difference in anything. I still see the fine lines around my eyes and mouth. I see that my melasma has not gotten any lighter.  I had some problems with small, deep pimples during the month. Since I entered surgical menopause over 5 years ago, I can’t attribute it to premenstrual acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My instructions were as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Wash your face before bed with a gentle cleanser. It should not contain retinols or salicylic acid as they can break down the active ingredient in Nerium AD.&lt;br /&gt;- Making sure your face and hands are damp, apply 3 pumps to face, neck, and chest (or any other problem areas). It should have a lotion-like consistency rather than honey-like. After applying, let it dry.&lt;br /&gt;- In the morning, you only need to rinse with water, but I recommend washing if you have sensitive skin. (I did wash my face because it gets very oily overnight).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, this product is priced way above what I&#x27;m willing to spend and I didn&#x27;t see any results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> DO NOT waste your money, PLEASE!!! My cousin and his family are big into this company and so I decided to try this &amp;#34;wonderful&amp;#34; product. HA, my skin used to be great. After Nerium AD night cream it is now a red, bumpy, acne prone mess. I have to figure out how to fix my skin after this crap that I have used for eight months. I wish I could give it &amp;#34;no stars&amp;#34;, it does not deserve any!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE Nerium. This is the best product I have ever used. I have incredibly sensitive skin and this product WORKS even on my skin.  If you actually follow the directions and use it correctly you will have great results.  I took my before picture and I took a picture after 2 weeks and could not believe the difference.  My lines were minimized, my skin was softer and smoother, and it had a healthy glow to it.  The company even stands behind their product with a 30-day money back guarantee.  If it doesn&#x27;t work for you they will refund your money.  Do they offer that kind of money back guarantee in the salon or in the cosmetic section of the department stores?  I think not........</li>
            <li> I am not exactly sure as to why so many people bash the science on this product? Not only I, but many friends as well, have seen tremendous results using this product. The science is backed by a global exclusive patent. I am not sure if you all know what that means, but you cannot simply just get a patent. It has to be proven to work. You can have blue prints for a floating car that make total sense, but unless they can see a floating car, you are not getting that patent. As I read other reviews I can just tell most to if not all of them have not actually taken time with this with an open mind. Nerium has not done half a billion dollars in revenue in 3 years on a faulty product. You can&#x27;t just fake those numbers. Let alone dogging on the industry of relationship marketing. Relationship marketing or Network marketing works. You just have to work. Its called NetWORK marketing. Not sit on my couch and hope the whole world just comes to me to buy this product. Everyone has called it a pyramid scheme, well let me ask you this, are you ever going to make more than your boss? No. You won&#x27;t. In an MLM set up, you can easily make more than your upline. I know many people doing it. So in conclusion, instead of making a bunch of uneducated false accusations on a product that actually does work, whether you like it or not, just look at it with an open mind. I go to school for nutrition, I know first hand not all things react to bodies the same because bodies are all different. However, there would not be a global exclusive patent on a product that doesn&#x27;t work. I noticed most of these reviews were just biased and full of stupid false accusations, so I hope this review, based solely on facts, helps someone in their decision. For all the nay sayers of Nerium, keep doing it. Obviously if they did half a billion dollars in their first 3 years without your approval, they won&#x27;t need it in the future either.</li>
            <li> I used the whole bottle as directed and just did not see the results that everyone else had. Pretty much wasted $80 other than it moisturizing my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for 1.5 months so still early but I just say, I think I actually see a difference in my skin!!  I always laugh when I see the commercial about the &amp;#34;graveyard of face creams&amp;#34; cuz I&#x27;m that woman. But so far so good!</li>
            <li> I have tried this product &amp; it seems very effective. Thank you..</li>
            <li> I am posting this review because only 30 minutes ago I just tried this for the first time and my face has been ****BURNING**** since I applied it as directed and the smell is making so aweful it is making me sick. I am however very sensetive to strong perfume smells that are cheap.&lt;br /&gt;I have washed my face 2 times already to get the burning to stop and the smell to go away. Now I am going to try witch hazel to remove this ******BURNING***** smell.&lt;br /&gt;Try this product with extreme caution !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad that I am trying a sample and did not waste my money, just wish I had not tried it at all.</li>
            <li> Nerium AD is definitely NOT for everyone! Day Cream fumes caused eyes to burn, the night cream caused nose to burn, and FIRM caused a major rash that has turned into a mix of welts/bumps that have yet to heal so guessing this product kills more than cells and wrinkles as I am still seeing a Dermatologist using 2nd batch of prescriptions to treat skin reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Legs, Hips, Breast, and Butt were smooth as butter  prior to Nerium AD/FIRM usage and now I look like hot mess for supporting a friend, as we continue to work undoing the damage supernaturally, by God’s grace, as nothing seems to be working since applying Nerium to my skin on 10/18/2014!!!!</li>
            <li> If you are purchasing your NERIUM product from Amazon or any other means outside of directly from a Nerium Brand Partners website, you are putting yourself at risk. Nerium Int&#x27;l does NOT allow the sale of Nerium products in any of these venues and the people selling the product are completely out of compliance. You have no idea what you are even getting in the bottles you buy.</li>
            <li> This stuff has changed my life. I&#x27;ve used it nightly for 6 mos. my skin has never looked better. Evens skin tone, shrinks pores, gets rid of fine lines. Highly recommended. A great preventative maintenance for younger people.</li>
            <li> Great product I tell everyone about it</li>
            <li> I have been using Nerium for and love it. The smell isn&#x27;t so great but its made w all natural product that is why it doesn&#x27;t smell great. But my crazy 11&#x27;s are gone and so are my laugh lines. I love the product and recommend it to anyone that is considering botox.</li>
            <li> Not worth it!  No difference after using it as directed.  Just invest in botox!</li>
            <li> I AM SENDING BACK. IT SMELLS SOOOOOOO BAD LIKE ITS OLD OR SOMETHING YUCK !</li>
            <li> No Stars!!! I used this product for 8 months as a Brand partner. This cream does nothing and smells awful. In my opinion it is just a pyramid scheme. Don&#x27;t buy!!</li>
            <li> Love this.  It really works.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for women who want to smooth their skin. Even the wrinkles on my fingertips went away. I was amazed.</li>
            <li> Useless and expensive multi-level marketing razzle dazzle.  My wife and I signed up to use and sell the product based on the amazing before and after photos we were shown.  After using the product as directed, neither one of us showed any changes in our skin.  I later found an article online on the CBS affiliate&#x27;s website in San Francisco that quoted Dr. Vic Narurkar, the head of Dermatology at California Pacific Medical Center concerning the before and after pictures.  He said:  &amp;#34;So apparently this product also gave a brow lift, and improved frown lines? There are only a couple of things that do that, one is Botox and the other is a surgical brow lift.&amp;#34;  In other words, its a fraud.</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in the appearance of lines or sun blotches and I&#x27;ve used it for a month.</li>
            <li> I purchased my product from a Brand Partner. Before I began using Nerium night cream, my skin was in the best shape it had ever been. I received frequent compliments. The first week I noticed better texture. The second week I woke up each day with several new blemishes culminating in a complexion worse than when I&lt;br /&gt;was a teenager! Needless to say, this 52 year old put a stop to that nonsense. I hope my aestitician forgives me. Ugh!</li>
            <li> Good product.&lt;br /&gt;Takes awhile to get used to and takes time to see results.</li>
            <li> helps with wrinkle, but you have to keep using it every night to have it work right</li>
            <li> I have tried this product and it has softened the lines around my eyes which are noticeable to others  Product is very expensive so will consider the next purchase carefully</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so so not that much in the bottle</li>
            <li> I tried this, not impressed at all. I put it on, it made it hard to move my face. It left a flaky, white residue. I went through an entire bottle in less than a month. About half way through, the lotion got really, really thin. Like, it was just brown liquid. But, it still made it hard to move my face and left the residue.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t have minded the stuff making my face hard to move if it had worked even a little bit, but I saw absolutely no difference and I used it every day.&lt;br /&gt;I always moisturizer, so maybe if you don&#x27;t you will see results, but if you already use something else, save yourself the money and just stick with that.</li>
            <li> Seems to be helping my skin, reducing wrinkles and pores, loving the product</li>
            <li> I started to use Optimera, 8 months ago...both the day and the night cream. Followed the instructions exactly and as suggested, took photographs every month to document my progress...to date...there has been no significant change or improvement at all. For me?...the product did not work and was not worth the $150.00/month cost. I am a 54 year old woman with normal aging skin...it wasn&#x27;t as if I have issues such as heavy sun damage, scars, unusual thickening etc...Just normal ageing skin, including the fine lines and loss of elasticity. The product had no effect on my fine lines, texture or firmness, as it claimed it would do. I thought 8 months was giving it more than a chance to prove the claims for the product were genuine, and after that period of time I cancelled the monthly auto-delivery without issue. From my own personal experience?...I would not recommend the product.</li>
            <li> waste of money. i see no difference.</li>
            <li> Tried some samples from a friend who was a Nerium representative, and both the night and day cream caused skin irritation and inflammation.  It was embarrassing and I had to cover up my skin with makeup.  On Day 3, started feeling nauseous and stopped using it the morning of Day 5 once I made the connection.  I did a cleanse after that, and am glad I didn&#x27;t spend all the money to buy the actual product.  I&#x27;m posting here because I&#x27;ve found Nerium suppresses and deletes criticism and I&#x27;m upset at how my rep treated me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I reported my symptoms to my rep, she blamed me for not using it properly even though she didn&#x27;t ask if I followed the instructions (which I did).  She also blamed my nausea on poor diet, even though my diet hadn&#x27;t changed and I felt 100% better after stopping it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This prompted me to do some more research, and I found many other people that had similar symptoms.  She dismissed the credibility of my findings saying: &amp;#34;you&#x27;re not a scientist&amp;#34;...well neither is she.  You don&#x27;t have to be a scientist to question something that doesn&#x27;t seem right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My symptoms aside, here&#x27;s my beef:  The first ingredient in their product is Oleander, a 100% poisonous plant.  My doctor has always said: &amp;#34;don&#x27;t put anything on your skin that you wouldn&#x27;t put in your stomach.&amp;#34;  Do yourself a favor and search for Oleander on WebMD, you will find they have a strict warning not to ingest Oleander even in small doses because it could cause a variety of negative health issues, including death. My rep said &amp;#34;it&#x27;s only a small amount of Oleander&amp;#34;, but it&#x27;s still the first ingredient, which means there&#x27;s more Oleander in this product than anything else. If anyone claims &amp;#34;it works&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s likely because the poison is causing chronic inflammation. If a rep can&#x27;t explain HOW it works or just points you to the Nerium website, be skeptical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have done my research first, but it was coming from a friend and I wanted to be supportive.  She made it sound so great.  I found their MLM/pyramid scheme and worship of their founder a bit weird too, they sound like a cult.  Needless to say, I think my friendship with this Nerium rep has run its course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the age of the internet, ignorance is a choice, my friends.  This product is truly indefensible in my opinion and not worth the price for vanity.wanted to be supportive.  She made it sound so great.

            <li> I bought some over 3 years ago and then let 3 bottles sit. I went back to it and it does make my face have reduced lines even this old. My bottles last over 2 months each. I spray water over my face, neck and arms, then I take one pump and spread it all over those area&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product for a week and a half. I cannot believe the difference. It&#x27;s working well for me. Also, my daughter has seen a noticeable improvement on a scar. I feel like I&#x27;ve lost years around my eyes. I do not sell the product so no motivation to show doctored pics. I was thinking I might need eye plastic surgery!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a difference</li>
            <li> used the day and night cream for one year. used it to a T. It moisturizes but its NO miracle cream. If its inexpensive and you want to try it go ahead but see for yourself that it doesn&#x27;t work. But I am just warning you. There are better things out there that really does work. Skin Ceuticals being one. Good luck..hope this helps</li>
            <li> I have ordered this from the actual company and this bottle lasted me less than half the time the bottle from Nerium lasted and I was using less pumps!</li>
            <li> Used for a while and found it to be overrated!</li>
            <li> It is a nice product but expensive and seems to take a long time to get rid of age spots. Loved the opportunity to buy it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Beware the positive reviews are written by \\&quot;Brand Partners\\&quot; if anyone has ever been familiar with Amway this is about the same. Big Pyramid Scheme. Save yourself some money go to Walgreens and get some Olay better results. As a Ex partner, they got my money don&#x27;t let them get yours.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> I bought this great product from my neighbor. She gave me a sample and we took before pictures and two weeks later after pictures. I can differently see a big difference. It has faded my brown spots and gotten rid of some of the wrinkles around my eyes. I am finding that I am using less make up. It is not creamy but I use a small amount of water and it is fine.  It&#x27;s worth the money. In a lot of cases it&#x27;s money back guarantee.</li>
            <li> I am 58 with pretty youthful skin(I&#x27;ve stayed out of the sun since I was in my early 20&#x27;s) but my skin is dry dry dry. I was given a bottle of Nerium AD Age Defying Night Cream and used it and could tell right off that it wasn&#x27;t going to work for me. My skin got drier and started to feel like it was pulling from the dryness. I need moisture and this product did not give me moist skin. FYI, one of the main ingredients is Oleander Leaf Extract which is poisonous to humans. I wouldn&#x27;t have this stuff in my house because of children and pets. I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The Nerium&#x27;s customer serivice is really nice.  I was surprised to see so many negative reviews on the Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it directly from Nerium and there was an invoice in a shipment package specifically said not to sell it on E-bay and Amazon.  Which makes perfectly good sense.  I mean how do you know if you got the real thing from Amazon?  Someone could easily empty it out and replace it with another kind of skin lotion.</li>
            <li> FINALLY something for your face that actually works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately once you put this product on you will feel your skin tightening. Give it a few weeks and you will see great results. I&#x27;m a 32 year old male and have been using this product for almost a year and will continue to use it because IT WORKS y&#x27;all. The product is a little costly, however, when it comes to your face you should pay top dollar for an item that brings results.</li>
            <li> What a mess, I was on auto direct for 4 months, loved the product until I had a horrible rash happen, went to my doctor and ruled out everything except the product because it was the only thing new I had tried in the last year. My arms, neck and lower face broke out in a rash followed by hives followed by blisters. I was miserable, customer service what a joke, over 10 emails to the product reaction specialist and still nothing, three different doctors later, numerous prescriptions and almost four months later I am left with dead, dry skin. The Reps in my area are horrible saying mean things acting like it was my fault I had the reaction. My daughter posted on FB telling others about my horrible experience, and I get a call from the company telling me the post was sent to their legal department, talk about rude.</li>
            <li> As and Aesthtician and distributor for a different company, my friend sent me a bottle to TRY. I gave it 4 stars because I am only on day 2 but I am feeling/seeing results with it already. I am also used to smells and tingles and whatever else it may make some skin feel. I admit, I am intrigued by it actually. I have friends in the beauty industry who are as well.  I also did my research intensely as YOU should. I was very concerned about Oleander being \\&quot;toxic\\&quot; so I read and read.  The company does not hide their scientific results, ingredients, etc. It&#x27;s ALL  on their site to read! People, do your research.  Do not leave a negative opinion when you did nothing to get there or do not understand the business. That just sounds ignorant. It&#x27;s definitely worth a try and There is also a money back guarantee- 30 days! If you have a reaction it will happen sooner than later. I happen to think my product is superior however, let&#x27;s be fair. If it work, it works and if some see the results they boast about, Yay for them!  If it works for me- I&#x27;ll use it too! Here&#x27;s the link:  [...]    Read up!    AFter 7 nights on this I changed my rating to 5 star!</li>
            <li> Nerium is awful after my mom used it I saw she was really sick from it ITS REALLY BAD be carful it can cause cancer it&#x27;s very bad and they take all ur money and it doesn&#x27;t work don&#x27;t get Nerium if ur planning on it because my mom became a brand partner and she didn&#x27;t even get any money it&#x27;s a rip off and it causes cancer DONT GET THIS CREAM</li>
            <li> Save your money. Worthless product</li>
            <li> Paid  a little more from the company and this was  a little dry but  I am happy with it and glad to have gotten it</li>
            <li> The product delivered minor fading of brown spots. MINOR. Not one wrinkle, crows feet or scar has been changed because of the product.&lt;br /&gt;My product representative gave the product to try for 7 days it was exciting she was excited she showed me pics that I knew could not be changed by product alone. The firm cream is nothing more than lotion. Nothing firmed my hands never changed my belly scars never changed. Not even color. They pushed hard for .e to be a partner and invest $500 after 7 days of use. When I explained that I did not have the money they called me twice a day a messaged me several times pushing me to commit &amp;#34; it would change my financial future&amp;#34; promising a Lexus as a 90 day bonus if I signed 3 partners who also signed 3 partners. They suggested borrowing the investment and at one point they phined someone, while at the partners home to pressure me to invest as a partner. It was so high pressure for a product I had used for 7 days. With MiNIMAL  to zero results.&lt;br /&gt;So disappointed and I feel they bordered on illegal. Oh and one offered to loan me the money to be a partner. Who does that?; someone who wants a Lexus.</li>
            <li> I am 46. I have Combo skin type. Some sun damage. Deep lines were making me want to get some filler work done. My mom gave me a half used bottle of Nerium to try. I was &amp;#34;sold&amp;#34; on this product in one week. After two weeks, I ordered my own bottle and have shared my results with others. I would say that the deep lines I hated so much are about half as noticeable to me as before. Also, my skin has a even tone and glow it did not have before AND it is not as oily in the &amp;#34;T-zone&amp;#34; area&amp;#34;. Just since starting with this product, I have become comfortable not putting makeup on immediately after I wash my face. I feel like the skin looks good enough to go without! I also like that it is doing all of the &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; while you sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is a little vague on application and since this stuff isn&#x27;t cheap, here is my advise: Wash and dry your face. Use a spray bottle to lightly mist your forehead and eyes. Put just one pump of product in your hand and swiftly massage onto your moist face from forehead down to cheeks. Then mist our cheeks, chin and neck, administer one more pump and swiftly smooth it on the lower half of your face and neck. Two pumps of product, mixed into the moist skin should be plenty. (I used way too much product in the beginning! You know, the silly &amp;#34;more must be better&amp;#34; thinking!&amp;#34;) Now I know better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the best to any who try Nerium. It may not be the answer for everyone, but I am pleased to say I have found what gives me the results I was looking for!</li>
            <li> While there are other products out there that work just as well, I am pleased with the results of this product.  I am on my second bottle.  My skin is firmer since I have been using it.  I did not notice an improvement with fading dark spots, but it definitely firms.  A little over priced, but it lasts a good while.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re over 50 and want all the lines out of your face, this is the product.  It stops working if you stop using it, but a couple of pumps on a wet face each night can erase years in about two weeks.</li>
            <li> This product even had my husband asking what are you using your skin looks great.  45 never looked so good.</li>
            <li> With beauty being a major focus in our society today, people invest into several skin care products to satisfy simply one goal: to get the look their hoping for. Different products are developed to tackle a specific issue. Though, can you imagine tackling most issues with one product; one product that actually makes a real difference? It sounds impossible considering the fact that it&#x27;s hard to find a reliable product in the first place. However, I can assure you that such a product does exist. In fact, Nerium Ad has proven itself to be a miracle. My own experiences allow me to express with complete honesty the miraculous outcomes of using Nerium Ad. Not only have I been positively impacted by this age defying skin care however, my observations of other Nerium Ad users have proven the reliability of this product to serve for multiple purposes. Along with my testimony, facts of this life changing skin care explain how such a product is possible.&lt;br /&gt; When I was first introduced to Nerium Ad, I was a bit skeptical due to the fact that it is a product of multi-level marketing. However, after hearing testimonies of other Nerium Ad users, I was tempted to try. When I did, I found that Nerium Ad does not only live up to its expectations, but it goes beyond its guarantee. Founders of Nerium Ad guarantees correction in fine lines and wrinkles, hyperpigmentation, uneven skin texture, enlarged pores, aging skin, and sun damaged skin. My main concern is my uneven skin texture and enlarged pores along with the frustrating problem of combination skin. Proudly, I can say, after using the product, my enlarged pores shrunk. My skin is soft and smooth. Most importantly, my oil is to a very minimum and dryness is under control. I am very excited to confess that Nerium Ad has not only tackled those main concerns, but I also almost never get severe breakouts. Taking the risk to look past the skepticism of the marketing side of the product was a wonderful decision, as I found that the claims, of Nerium Ad doing miracles far beyond its guarantee, were very much true.&lt;br /&gt; Just as I am doing now, I referred Nerium Ad to others. Nerium Ad has left as much of a positive impact on others, if not more, as it did me. My grandmother has hyperpigmentation, aging skin, and other natural concerns that come along with aging. Within a few weeks of using Nerium, \\&quot;beyond its guarantee\\&quot; became an understatement. As her sun spots faded, her crow&#x27;s feet (wrinkles by the eyes) smoothed out. Her skin tightened, leaving her with a youthful, rejuvenating appearance. It was as if she received a face lift. My grandmother is not the only one that sheds proof of miraculous outcomes. I know and have talked with several other people regarding their Nerium Ad experience. My testimony of others experiences is not based off of their word. I have seen proof; before and after&#x27;s. Nerium Ad can be described as \\&quot;surgery without a cut\\&quot;. Many men and women I have the pleasure of knowing have had a life changing experience with Nerium Ad.&lt;br /&gt; The true beauty about it, though, is that my grandma, I, and those other Nerium AD users I know appear so much healthier. Confidence has grown within. I know that I can relate, along with many other people, to the shameful insecurities of having flawed skin. I can relate with the struggle of finding that perfect product that makes a long term difference; that is reliable. I can relate to spending a good amount of money on products with the hope of receiving the outcome I&#x27;m looking for. Ultimately, nothing has made me more satisfied than Nerium Ad. That is not to say that other products never work. However, Nerium Ad doesn&#x27;t just work; it&#x27;s a cure. The most wonderful thing is that it corrects issues above and beneath the surface, giving people the look they vie for while diminishing their insecurities and building their confidence.&lt;br /&gt; Now, how does such a product exist? How is it possible for a crème to give the outcome of a facelift? Thereis a unique story along with a key ingredient that makes this product so different from others. This miraculous product, in fact, was originally made to cure cancer. Nerium Ad was created at the MD Anderson cancer research center at the University of Texas when they found that the product has multiple unique effects.  A poisonous plant called Oleander is the key ingredient of Nerium Ad. However, don&#x27;t let that scare you. With avid studies, researchers, including Dr. Robert A. Newman, found ways to produce this miraculous product safely allowing the use of it topically and assuring no harm if accidentally ingested. A specific extraction process known as NBio-PL is used to extract the plants unique and beneficial properties, leaving the poison behind. Aloe Vera extracts from the Nerium oleander plant, collecting both plants unique qualities to make NAE-8 extract. This strategic and trusted science makes the Nerium Ad skin care the miraculous skin care it truly is.&lt;br /&gt; There are many skin care products on the market suggested for certain purposes and conditions. As affective as they may be, I have yet to experience one that is as life changing as Nerium Ad. After my testimony of my own experiences, my observation of others, and factual information I have provided, it should be clear that such a skin care is, in fact, possible. That, Nerium Ad is the miracle you are looking for; the product that will not just work, but will cure your concerns.</li>
            <li> I am 29 and started having trouble with acne along my jaw line this year. Nerium has done the trick to keep my skin healthy.  I didn&#x27;t really have any lines to smooth, but I do like the way it makes my skin feel.  Probably wouldn&#x27;t be worth the money if not what it does to clear up my acne by using it each night.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff but the jury is still out on how effective it is.  I may update after I finish two more bottles.  Mine lasts more than a month.  I do not need 5 pumps at a time. I use 2 or 3.  Glad to find it on Amazon so I can order when I am ready rather than pile up extras on a subscription with a company rep.</li>
            <li> Having used this product before  it&#x27;s not any better than others on the marlet</li>
            <li> A Slightly Different Take on This Whole Thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to ask yourself why so many of these are for sale on Amazon.  I thought they only did direct sales and never sell it to distributors.  It could be because people have given up on selling them and are trying to unload the inventory they got when they signed up.  I am sure they must have an answer for this, but I don&#x27;t recall what it is.  If you are going to seminars and they are telling you to push up good reviews and telling you your bottles are your employees to sign up more people to become agents for the company then just step back from that and think about it for a second.  The structure of the company is not about selling it,  but making profits off others selling it.  And maybe people only spend on average 4 hrs a week selling it.  But imagine all the free advertising they get from you posting on FB and social media.  Every conversation at every dinner party and function you go to.  I wish everyone well.  I know deep down if you have been doing this for very long you know better than I the truth.  The things that hold us back in life are often the stories we tell ourselves.  We trust ourselves and if we have created our own mess by signing on the dotted line, then we will deceive ourselves that it is still a good deal far after we have realized deep down that it isn&#x27;t.  It might still be a good deal for some, but the structure is not designed to be good for large percentages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And to the critics that are angry at the company and harshly attack it every aspect.  Unfortunately you are speaking from a perspective that is different from someone still in a pyramid selling scheme.  Sometimes friends that are harsh critics actually make it more difficult for loved ones to get out of them and accept the mistake they made in signing up for one.  Love your friends and family even if they annoy you by constantly trying to get you to sign up as a company agent.  Encourage them to learn more and pose questions for them.  Everyone in life needs to learn their own lessons and at their own pace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish everyone the best of luck in their pursuits and growth in life.</li>
            <li> Heard about this product from a friend.  It&#x27;s expensive but I&#x27;ve had scars from acne for years and this product is the first one that is making them get smaller, so it&#x27;s totally worth it for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had good skin in my life. Since I started using Nerium AD 8 weeks ago, my skin has completely changed. For the first time in 33 years, I have clear, smooth skin- no wrinkles or splotchy areas. I love this product!</li>
            <li> The bottle was not full!</li>
            <li> Excellent, i really like product it is helping with my skin discoloration.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been in the Beauty Industry for years and this product does not impress me.&lt;br /&gt;Sticky and the results are temporary.Seems like a sales program to me.</li>
            <li> This product is so amazing I am going to become a rep.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from a friend of mine in her 50s who recently became a brand partner.  She had been using it for a couple of weeks and I could tell a difference on her.  Let me start by saying that I have a normal skin care regimen and am no stranger to spending money on my face creams.  I have tried many different brands (some as expensive as $700 per bottle).  My friend lent me this product to try for a few days and after 3 days I decided to purchase my own.  I&#x27;m 38 years old and I have good skin, but it is sensitive and prone to breakouts (especially on my forehead).  I was worried (as I am with any product) it would break me out, but it did not.  The first morning, I noticed that my face looked more youthful.  I can&#x27;t explain exactly, but it was like my skin looked firmer and more full, like it was in my early 20s.  The effect has only gotten better and my skin looks more even-toned and &amp;#34;glowey.&amp;#34;  So, I signed up for autoship under my friend and will continue to use it as long as I see the results.  For those who say this is a scam, all I can say is some things work for some people and not others.  The $700 serum I tried broke me out and did nothing to improve the look of my skin and this came from a very high end (sold in exclusive spas) brand.  If I can get great results like I have at this price point, I am in.  I&#x27;m not interested in selling any MLM stuff myself, but I really like the product and will continue to use it and buy from my friend.  I hope this helps those that are conflicted about buying based on some negative reviews.  Maybe you can find a brand partner who will let you try before you buy like I did....</li>
            <li> Have been using this about 9 months - results on me as well as my friends - show noticeable decrease in facial lines</li>
            <li> It was great for my wife.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  My wife has been using this for several months, and it has taken years off her face... she barely looks in her early 30&#x27;s, although she&#x27;s taken good care of her skin for decades (she just turned 48).  I only wish this product were a bit cheaper, although it is much cheaper on Amazon than the local Nerium sales-gal... Buying locally from the Nerium sales consultants, you&#x27;ll pay 2x the price that you find here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was given a 6 day trial. It gave me a tight feeling face(and yes, my face was damp when I used it) when I washed it off every morning. I also have small fine lines under my eyes now that weren&#x27;t there before. I told the lady who let me use the trial and she said &amp;#34;I&#x27;m thinking it wasn&#x27;t the Nerium, surely it was something else...&amp;#34; So, whatever I guess. I won&#x27;t be investing into this I don&#x27;t guess. Which makes me sad because I was expecting outstanding results.</li>
            <li> I signed up to do it as a business,   I have been in Network marketing for over 25 years and  some of the best products and some of the worst come from Network marketing.  It is a different way of distribution,  The good companies spend more money on product development and paying the distributors instead of warehousing and advertising. The bad companies (and there are a lot of them out there) are just ripoffs, selling something, anything to make a profit and have a get rich quick mentality.  This is the type of company I see in Nerium.  Honestly I am surprised they are still around.    I had tons of product as they give you free product every time you turn around,  This is not sour grapes, I really wanted the business to work.  I should also let you know that I have been very successful in another network marketing business, top of the company, earned the trips, jewels and the car, but that company changed a lot and I was looking for a new home.  I used it faithfully for one full year.  Results?  None, I could not tell it did one darn thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using  about 4 weeks and have seen results. People have asked me what I&#x27;ve been doing to my skin and looks great. I will continue using. I love that! I also love that my nightly routine is much shorter. I love that I&#x27;ve seen a difference without much effort!!!</li>
            <li> My wife used Nerium for three weeks so far, and the improvement is very noticable. Way less wrinkles.</li>
            <li> My friend introduced me to this cream...being a sun worshiper,  I am not without wrinkles...this works the very best!</li>
            <li> It broke my face out and I could not bare the smell.  My face was too sensitive for this product.</li>
            <li> The only place you should order Nerium is directly from an authorized Nerium Brand Partner for the following reasons: 1) The individuals selling on Amazon are doing so unethically and against Nerium company policy. Do you really want to buy facial product from someone who is untrustworthy?; 2) Nerium stands behind its products and offers a 30-day money back guarantee. There is no such guarantee when you buy through Amazon; 3) When you order through Nerium you can be assured that you are getting the best product from the Company. If you buy from Amazon, you do not know how the product has been handled.  It could have been tampered with, kept in poor conditions, or old and past its shelf life. You just would not know. I&#x27;ve heard that people who ordered from Amazon have received bottles that exploded during shipment or the cream had turned black. Who knows what you will get if you order from people who are selling unethically. Take the safest option and order from an authorized brand partner or directly from the company&#x27;s website.  [...]</li>
            <li> I use this and the day cream. There are no harmful side effect. The dark spots I had is gone and my pores are way smaller. Make sure you get these from a brand partner. chrisfchan.nerium.com if you need help.</li>
            <li> We were given Nerium and only knew it was a skin cream.  We began using it for burns and our family now refers to it as &amp;#34;Gold&amp;#34;  Nothing we have ever had works as fast and as good on burns etc. as Nerium.  I don&#x27;t know abut age defying but I do know we consider it a miracle cream.</li>
            <li> HATE Nerium-- its terrible.  Made me break out in sores all over my arms, neck, face and decolette.  Told my Nerium rep and they just kept telling me i was doing it wrong.  That was a month ago. Almost all the sores are gone but some of them left scars!!!  Another Nerium person told me it wasnt possible as less than 1% of people had a reaction to... these people bully and harass you. Then tell you YOU are lieing about you see in the mirror.  I have always had great skin and even my husband and kids starting asking me what was wrong with my skin!! DO NOT BUY-- WARNING-- CALL MD ANDERSON AND SEE . SCAM SCAM SCAM SCAM SCAM</li>
            <li> I have been using Nerium for last 30 days.  People that don&#x27;t take their before and after pictures are the ones that don&#x27;t realize how much different they look.  This product is awesome.  So many of my friends wanted to know what I was using and wanted some that I decided to sell it.  Product sells itself.</li>
            <li> It works great on the saggy area of the jaw line. But I do not like to use it around the eyes.  The full bottle I received from Blue Bell through Amazon lasted me a good 2 months.  I intend to order more.</li>
            <li> Smells really weird and dried out my skin.  I did not work on fading my dark spots.  That is the only reason I bought it.</li>
            <li> It is ok but way to much money for a months worth of product. But it is a pretty good product</li>
            <li> I have been using Nerium AD for eight months now and really like it. It does take some time for&lt;br /&gt;you to see results with Nerium. This is not some overnight miracle cream. I starting seeing results&lt;br /&gt;within a two to three weeks with my skin being more even toned and fading of age spots. For men&lt;br /&gt;the forehead wrinkles often stand out and this has definitely made a difference. Overall, my facial&lt;br /&gt;look has improved quite a bit. One thing I do differently as a man is I use this product in the morning&lt;br /&gt;after I shave. It smooths and tightens my skin better after shaving. By the way, you can use a face&lt;br /&gt;lotion after applying Nerium but wait about 20 minutes to do so. I really like this product and will&lt;br /&gt;continue to use it. The price is right too as I have used other products that cost two or three times&lt;br /&gt;as much and don&#x27;t deliver the same kind of results this product does.</li>
            <li> This product was referred to me by a friend of mine who is an Esthetician.  I really like this product and see the difference in my skin....I have always had oily skin but as I am getting a little older it was beginning to dry out a little.  Since using the Nerium it appears that the natural oils are back...And I have a little glow again....I will continue to use it....</li>
            <li> This Night cream does miracles, smooth&#x27;s out my pours, relaxes the wrinkles, lightens some age spots :) makes me feel younger. I can put this on at night, and No worries. This is why I give this Product a 5. I talked my Sister into using this to. And she has seen a difference, she is sold also... Thank You ! Nerium</li>
            <li> This product is nothing like the products I have received before.  It should have been a light cream color, but it is dark tan.  It doesn&#x27;t smell the same.  It is a liquid rather than a cream.  I am very disappointed and will not order from this source again.</li>
            <li> Although this helped smooth out my skin and help with some blackheads, I have a feeling that&#x27;s because I was being more careful about my face washing. The wrinkles are very much still here. Plus, there&#x27;s barely any product. This is supposed to last a month. I didn&#x27;t even use it on my entire face (just problem areas) and ran out going into Week 3</li>
            <li> I have used this product every night after cleaning.  It goes on well once I dampened my face.  I did not notice any significant difference in fine lines or wrinkles on my neck.  Others have told me that my skin looks much better and more even toned.  I was really hoping it would help with my &amp;#34;turkey neck&amp;#34;.  I am starting my second bottle and I am anxious to see the difference after the next 90 days.</li>
            <li> I received this product as a free trial so I don&#x27;t have any complaints about dealing with customer service or trying to get my money back thankfully.  I did, however, want to caution others on the relatively severe reaction I had to using the product for only 3 days in a row (I used both the day and night cream during that time).  Besides the awful smell and tightening/dry feeling the lotion gave me, I continued to use it because I wanted to see if it would actually make a difference.  By the 3rd day, I was starting to notice that my skin looked a little brighter and more smooth.  I was excited by these results but before I could apply the night cream on the 3rd day, my lips, tongue and feet began to swell and by the morning I was covered head to toe in large red hives.  After doing a lot of digging on the internet, I found a few people who had similar reactions.  Turns out, others who have a latex sensitivity have also had the same reactions to this product.  I knew I was (very) mildly sensitive to latex but have never had too many problems with it, especially when it came to lotions and other beauty products.  I normally avoid latex gloves and condom because they can irritate me, but I&#x27;ve never had swelling or hives because of it.  Once I started to get the hives, I discontinued the use of the cream, however, I continued to break out in hives daily for the next month.  The swelling and hives were usually responsive to 1 or 2 Benadryl but I was constantly drowsy and couldn&#x27;t understand why after not applying the lotion in over a month, I was still having an allergic reaction to it.  Turns out some of the lotion must have stayed on my makeup brushes that I use to apply concealer and foundation to my face.  Once I stopped using those brushes, the hives (these were on my body, rarely ever my face where the cream was being applied) went away after 2 days.  I wanted to share my story because there isn&#x27;t much on the internet regarding this product and latex allergies/sensitivities.  If you are having an allergic reaction and are using this product, you really should stop using it and everything else that might have come in contact with it.</li>
            <li> I heard about the company 2 years ago and was super skeptical. A few of my friends started using it and when I saw their results, I was blown away. I started using it, took a night or two to get used to the smell, but it&#x27;s been a few months and my skin looks and feels amazing. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Smells horrible and I did not notice any difference in my skin at all. This was a great deal of money and did not measure up to the advertisement that promised amazing results.</li>
            <li> I,ve tried  Nerium AD for 3 nights in a row, on damp skin.&lt;br /&gt;My skin was fine and luminous, but a friend of mine insisted I give it a try, she is a Brand Manager.&lt;br /&gt;I totally regret my decision. I won&#x27;t be finishing the week trial, my skin, looks dull and I developed a rash.&lt;br /&gt;I,ll go back to my daily routine, honestly there are great products out there, mine is Skinmedica, but Neutrogena, Aveeno or Murad are amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Just in case, Im just a regular gal, Im not affiliated with any cosmetic or dermatologic company.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I&#x27;d give a -10/5 for this product. After further research on this product, (after my girlfriend almost signed for the pyramid scheme) it has no patent, (red flag) and they even admitted to not looking to retail stores such as Wal-mart, Wallgrens, ect. (red flag). I had also found a CBS news report where a doctor had found traces of an ingredient known to be toxic from a plant known as the Oleander plant. This product has been known to cause rashes, and the Oleander plant has way too many side effects (most including hospitalization or death) for me to be remotely interested in purchases, or working for this &amp;#34;business&amp;#34;. Not to mention, it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Love the product,  i receive compliments on my skin, which i account to the product,  Nerium.</li>
            <li> I bought it because my friend was selling it and raved about it. Gave it 3 months at 180.00/month. No positive results BUT started to to develop these tiny hard bumps on my face. Never had anything like that before. Also tried the creams to fade a surgical scar with no results. Not for me.</li>
            <li> Used entire bottle and nothing but what appeared to be more lines and dry skin. As a skin care junkie I can honestly say this is worthless not to mention potentially poisonous. I had many headaches while using this but didn&#x27;t know of it&#x27;s harmful side effects until had been using a while. Never again! Don&#x27;t waste your money and possibly your health. DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH!</li>
            <li> I have been using Nerium for over a year now, I haven&#x27;t tried the day cream yet, I use Philosophy and am waiting until that runs out and then I will try it. I totally LOVE my results from Nerium! I&#x27;m NOT a brand partner, nor do I buy from any one person. I just get on Amazon and purchase it so I&#x27;ve nothing to gain by touting this product except it works wonderfully! I won&#x27;t say my skin is perfect, but it&#x27;s never looked as glowing and smooth, and been this soft ever! Plus I look forward to using it &amp;#60;nerdy I know&amp;#62; so I automatically take better care of my skin because I wash my face every night to use it. No product is for everyone, if it doesn&#x27;t work for you it doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not a fabulous product, but for this girl my skin has truly NEVER looked better! I&#x27;ll continue to use it :)</li>
            <li> When I first tried the product it left me skin very smooth. By the third day I had bumps all over my face, From my forehead to my chin.&lt;br /&gt;I have not been sensitive to day or night creams in the past, so I was disappointed that I could not use the product. It turned out to be a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> Best product EVER!  Really, really works! I have never seen a beauty product that actually works so well for me!</li>
            <li> At 40 years old I want to look as good as I can and I would love to tighten and shrink my pores. My original plan was to try this for 5 days but I quit after 3. The first thing I noticed about the daycream was the weird smell-kind of like wet Velveeta cheese, not a good smell! After starting to use the night cream I noticed my eyes would burn and itch. At first I just thought it was some kind of weird seasonal allergy-which I had NEVER experienced before. Once I got to thinking about when my eyes started to hurt and when I started using Nerium, it all came together so I stopped using it and no more burning and itching eyes. My next step was to GOOGLE Nerium and see what was in it....OLEANDER. WOW, talk about feeling dumb for rubbing poison on my face. No wonder my eyes hurt. Besides the smell, my burning and itching eyes and the POISONOUS ingredients, it also costs WAY more money than I would EVER spend on facial products.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for 30 days and it did nothing.  I don&#x27;t understand why people keep falling for these pyramid scams.  If the product was so great it would be sold in stores and by high end companies.  I highly recommend avoiding it.  I was pressured beyond belief to become a brand partner and when I questioned the validity of the product I was continually shown a bunch of before and after pictures.  The problem is the before pictures all had tons of shadows and were in terrible lighting.  The after pictures had perfect lighting and were very flattering.  What a joke of a company and I feel bad for the people getting involved with it.</li>
            <li> To my knowledge, I have never had an allergic reaction to any cosmetics. A friend of my posted self photos of her face after using Nerium. After several months of these posts, I finally decided to try it. I have almost used one month&#x27;s supply. The first time I put it on, my face tingled and began to feel tight. I thought, well, I guess that means it&#x27;s working. Within the month of use, I broke out with an itchy rash on my neck. Then, my eyes got infection in them. I thought I was allergic to the Christmas tree, so I went to a doctor, got a steroid packet and some eye drops. After 5 days on the medicines, my rash cleared up almost to being gone. However, my eyes have not healed. After the last dose of steroids, my rash is back. I have to admit, I am pretty sure this cream is the culprit. As to my &amp;#34;results&amp;#34; the lines around my nose and mouth are not as noticeable, but the rest of my face really shows no improvement. Now I wonder how hard it will be to get out of the program.</li>
            <li> The 1oz bottle didn&#x27;t last long enough to know if it was working</li>
            <li> This product is watery and not anything like the product I&#x27;ve ordered for the last 2 years. The smell is bad so I am assuming it&#x27;s old product. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> I have been using Nerium AD for about 10 months. At almost 45 yrs of age I think I look better than I did at 35! I had some hormonal acne, which is why I originally started using Nerium. Not only did it clear up my acne (and hopefully it will NEVER return!) but my skin texture is smoother, my pores are less noticeable and I feel like my overall complexion has improved dramatically. I still have laugh lines, which I don&#x27;t really mind yet, but my skin CRAVES nerium! I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> NeriumAD is an incredible product. I was very skeptical at first, but I fell in love after using it. I&#x27;m only twenty, and obviously not concerned about wrinkles, but this product shrunk my pores, and really evened out my complexion. The (patented) antioxidant in this product is really incredible. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to improve their skin. I actually fell in love with the product so much that I became a brandpartner, so I could get the product for free (80$ a month is a little steep for a college-girl) One issue though, Nerium is not approved to be sold from retailers like Amazon, only directly from their brandpartners&#x27; website ( As an example, mine is [...] ) If you are not happy with your results from the product after ordering it from Amazon, it may be because the bottle had been tampered with, or diluted out. Always order from a brandpartners website, not only is it guaranteed that you are getting what you paid for, but there is also a 30day money back guarantee in case you decide the product is not for you.</li>
            <li> Chose seller for the price and no shipping.  So far I have used product for almost a month and really like it.  It&#x27;s easier to use than the skin care I normally use and is more cost effective than current product.  I am trying it for 3 months to see if it continues to work well. I ordered on-line because I didn&#x27;t want to sign up for the monthly orders since it is hard to stop monthly orders once you sign up.  The price is the same ordering it myself when I need it and wanted to try it for the 3 months by ordering it when I want it, not when the company sends it every month.  I&#x27;ve found it hard, in the past, to get out of a monthly plan with other products (not with this company though). So far I would recommend it.  I don&#x27;t understand what others say about the smell which fades once it is on and dried. I don&#x27;t find the smell offensive like others. I use it at night only all over face and on neck.  So far I have noticed a difference with the neck area and it seems to work as well as my current skin care but without all of the steps and the steep prices for each step.  I purchase my current skin care through my dermatologist but there has been a price hike and I don&#x27;t think I can afford it anymore. The quality is the same as the first bottle I received from the representative.</li>
            <li> I ordered Nerium off Amazon thinking I was getting a better deal than ordering it through a Nerium agent, however the cream ran out within 3 weeks. After that I thought it would be to expensive to continue using so didn&#x27;t order it again. Several months later a friend whose a Nerium agent talked me into ordering it through them and I reluctantly agreed. My first bottle lasted over 2 months!!!  I don&#x27;t know if I the bottle I got off Amazon was defective or what but the bottle I ordered directly through a Nerium agent last over 2 months compared to 3 weeks.  Careful!</li>
            <li> This product has visibly reduced lines on my forehead, face, neck and chest and my pores seem to have gotten smaller.  Overall, it produced a smoother look for my 50 year old skin.  I have medium skin tone and I generally avoid the sun as best I can.  I do not use any other rigorous skincare treatments.  I would recommend this to anyone who takes care of their skin and just needs that little bit more boost, without Botox or any other such more extreme methods.  Use on freshly cleaned face.  I use one or two pumps and rub it on my wet palms and apply with upward and outward strokes to face, neck and chest.  I finish by apply remaining products on the back of my hands in an upward motion.  I would definitely order more when this is finished.</li>
            <li> I used this product for 5 months.  At first I really liked my results but over time Nerium clogged my pores around my chin.  It gave me blackheads, zits, and little white bumps called Millia (which is hardened oil underneath the skin) that wouldn&#x27;t pop.  It almost looked like I had red rashes on both sides of my chin because my pores were so clogged and my skin was so damaged.  I have never in my life had acne, not even as a teenager (I&#x27;m 32) so I know that my skin issues were a result of using Nerium. I&#x27;ve stopped using the product and it has taken my skin about another 5 months to clear up with the proper treatment and products. Be careful with long term use of Nerium.</li>
            <li> This was not exactly what I wanted, but it is good.</li>
            <li> Makes your face very soft. I need a little more time to check it out. Glad I am using this product.</li>
            <li> How can Nerium give a &amp;#34;30 day money back guarantee&amp;#34; when they actually mean 30 days from the date of purchase and NOT the date the customer receives the product to try? This is blatant dishonesty and a poor business practice. If Nerium truly stood behind their product, they wouldn&#x27;t have to hide behind false claims. My attempt at contacting the company to resolve this issue has only provided further dissension when I explain my situation. This is unacceptable customer service and I would not/do not recommend this product or company to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product was ordered on February 4 and delivered March 1. Nerium claims that I had until March 5 (30 days) in order to try it AND submit my claim for a refund. That&#x27;s (4) days to try the product compared to their &amp;#34;30 day money back guarantee&amp;#34;. Further, I have emails between myself and customer service showing that I had yet to receive the product by February 28th so the company didn&#x27;t have to take my word for when I actually received the product. When I called customer service, they verified that they have those emails on file, so no problem there. I spoke to a nice gentleman (Dennis) who tried his best to get me my refund but then I asked to speak to a customer service manager (Victoria). She said the guarantee actually means &amp;#34;30 days from when you order&amp;#34;. How exactly is that a &amp;#34;30 day money back guarantee&amp;#34; when the customer doesn&#x27;t have the product in-hand to try for 30 days? Anyone else see the problem here? When I explained to her that THAT needs to be on the website, she said &amp;#34;it&#x27;s in our policies and procedures which is in your back office&amp;#34;. Anyone know how to get there? You have to SIGN UP and ORDER the product to get access into the back office!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are numerous issues with this type of business practice, none of which have been resolved with respect or understanding. If I had actually had the product for more than 4 days, even up to 30 days and had goneover the time limit for the money back guarantee, sure, by all means, hold up the policy. But, if your company actually says one thing that is understood by the general public to mean one thing and you actually mean something entirely different, that is FALSE ADVERTISING. Having exhausted my options to work this out with Nerium International and being met with a simple &amp;#34;sorry, we will not issue a refund&amp;#34;, I have filed a claim with the Better Business Bureau. I truly hope that this was an isolated incident and you don&#x27;t treat all customers who wanted to take the company up on it&#x27;s &amp;#34;money back guarantee&amp;#34; with the blatant disrespect I was shown.</li>
            <li> Saw no results after 3 months. WAY too expensive for what it does</li>
            <li> I thought you weren&#x27;t suppose to sell online? that&#x27;s what the contract says you cant  how are you getting away with this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late fifties, blonde with normal skin. Nerium works for me by fading minor sunspots (including on the top of my hands) evening out my skin and making it look noticeably fresher and younger. Makeup goes on more smoothly and I just look better. Have had several people notice and comment. What nerium is best for, for me, is smoothing upper lip lines very well. Some of the minor lines are gone completely and a few deeper ones are much less deep. It also has worked dramatically on some fairly deep forehead wrinkles and has shrunk some pores. BUT. It hasn&#x27;t done a thing for crow&#x27;s-feet or any eye wrinkles. Don&#x27;t know why. I will probably keep buying it for the ways it does help, but use a different product for my eyes.</li>
            <li> The product was as described, of good quality and delivered on time.</li>
            <li> I have used Nerium AD before, and I love it. This product, however, smells &amp;#34;different&amp;#34;. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be as fresh or new as the previous ones I have used. Those came from independent, individual distributors. Sometimes face-to-face sales is best.</li>
            <li> this product is over hyped without the results that are claimed - save your money and look for something better</li>
            <li> Love the Nerium Night Cream. Personally, I couldn&#x27;t tell a huge difference when I was using the Day Cream too.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2weeks now and have noticed a huge improvement to face ,neck ,and chest.My skin is tighter,laugh lines diminished and wrinkles in my neck are softer. Let&#x27;s face it all you negative users there are no miracle creams out there so if your looking for complete disappearance of lines and wrinkles get a face lift. This product is the best of used</li>
            <li> I WAS DISAPOINTED WITH THIS EXPENSIVE PURCHASE............MY SKIN DID NOT FEEL OR LOOK ANY BETTER....NOT A GOOD PRODUC FOR ME.</li>
            <li> Received as described in a timely manner.  I have noticed a change for the better.  It has definitely made my skin look better and reduced winkles. I will continue using it.</li>
            <li> I found this product for my Mom who had suffered from Lyme&#x27;s disease. We had tried almost everything and nothing helped her damaged skin. This did! You need to find a representative to buy it from!!!!</li>
            <li> On the question of &amp;#34;does it work&amp;#34; the answer is &amp;#34;indecisive&amp;#34;. Nerium is over-selling its effectiveness to be sure. The MD Anderson Cancer Center has already distanced itself from the findings at Nerium Biotechnology and the FDA has not approved this product (Of course its cosmetic in nature). There has been one highly-cited third-party clinical study with a very small group of people. While interesting, this is common in these type of items and may overall mean that the majority of people see no results at all. Cosmetic items have never been held to the same standard as prescribed medications, where dozens if not hundreds of third-party clinical studies are performed for the safety of patients and categorization of potential side effects. Instead this product seems to rely on word-of-mouth and grass-root tactics of hearsay to preach its results. If you&#x27;e ever played a game of &amp;#34;telephone&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;grape-vine&amp;#34; you can see how this approach can be misleading. That being said, playing devil&#x27;s advocate, even if the product were to work exactly as advertised there is no mistake in its business model and the real company&#x27;s goals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you unaware Nerium is the latest economic evolution of multi-level marketing (MLM). MLM itself is what pyramid schemes have become since they were made illegal. While everything seems on the up-and-up, independent research has consistently shown that 99% of people that get involved as distributors in MLM&#x27;s do not break even on their investment. 99%. And that&#x27;s just money-wise. It is mathematically and physically impossible for everyone that gets involved in these practices to be successful. If something destroys 99% of participants it should be considered a pesticide. Or anti-bacterial soap. There is no half-way or part-time with this company. The carriers selling this product on sites like Amazon and the like might be trying to exploit certain loop-holes to make a profit on direct-selling to customers. Alas, you cannot fix a system that is fundamentally broken. The CEO of Nerium, one Jeff Olson, has connections with previous MLM practices and self-written help books as a lure to suck the uninitiated in. He is called the &amp;#34;millionaire-maker&amp;#34; and the money comes directly from those most in need of funds and goes to himself and his 1% in the &amp;#34;Nerium family&amp;#34;. The fact that he&#x27;s selling a product as well is what they call in the mafia game &amp;#34;a front&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy into the hype. Not even to try the product. Because if you do, you will eventually hurt the people at the bottom of the Nerium system.</li>
            <li> I was surprised with the results. But then I had to think, for $80 what am I looking for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw a difference after the first use. My pores disappeared.  But then I didn&#x27;t see any further difference in the 2nd, 3rd or 4th time I used it. It feels like an overnight facelift and the next day I look great. But after that, I didn&#x27;t notice any more improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a subscription for a reason. If you want to take, I would have to say 5 years off your skin and can afford this expensive cream, go for it.  I don&#x27;t believe in paying $80 a month to take several years off my face.  I will just use it when I go out for something important.</li>
            <li> When I first started using Nerium I was happy with the results.  While I didn&#x27;t see a significant change in wrinkles I did like the new texture of my skin.  It also faded some scarring.  After 4 months I began having pretty severe bags under my eyes along with some swelling around my eyes.  It didn&#x27;t last but would come and go every week or so.  I also developed a slight rash around my eyes.  I went to see my dermatologist who prescribed an anti-inflammatory cream for the rash.  This took care of the rash and the bags under my eyes decreased.  I was told to only use the cream for two weeks.  After two weeks, the bags were back.  They did however go down after a couple of days.  I was stumped.  I didn&#x27;t think it was the Nerium because I had used it for so long with no problems.  After two months of on and off eye swelling I developed a rash at the corners of my mouth and back on the eyes.  No significant bags under my eyes but still not normal.  My face just hurt.  I decided to read reviews of Nerium and realized that was the problem!  So upset that I didn&#x27;t read these sooner.  I don&#x27;t consider myself as having sensitive skin but I do feel that over time this product can create issues.  I only hope that my face will return to pre-Nerium state.</li>
            <li> This product does not work. It is a pyramid scheme. I&#x27;ve spoken to several dermatologist and &amp;#34; There&#x27;s no magic lotion for wrinkles&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It did come in a timely manner but the smell was something that I couldn&#x27;t take. I read some reviews on this and thought they were exaggerating, not! I have asthma and it actually made me wheeze. I ask for a return label and they did that promptly, and I sent it back lets see how long the refund takes.....</li>
            <li> Good quality age defying treatment.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few year and my skin looks great for a 72 year old!  Get positive comments all the time.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other creams, most have numerous \\&quot;steps\\&quot; (serum, toner, cream, something for eyes...) &amp; cost hundreds of dollars. Nerium is a one step product, diminished my 11 lines between my eyes, gives me a glow &amp; makes my face look good. Many people ask me what I am using. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I ended up getting a rash on my face and neck after using about a week.It took about 1 week for the rash to go away. I would recommend buy from a rep the 1st time and get a free sample to make sure that it doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin. Also with this supplier you are pre-ordering ,so be aware that the ship date doesn&#x27;t get pushed back a month later than estimated.However, they are about $30 cheaper than anyone else so if this product works for you, it is an excellent deal.</li>
            <li> Feels great! Saw a difference in two weeks</li>
            <li> This product is truly amazing. I have had an issue with acne for awhile and I was going back and forth with a dermatologist and nothing seemed to work. Well one day I purchased this product because so many people around me was using it and everyone had nothing but positive things to say about it so I wanted to try. Even though it didn&#x27;t advertise in helping acne I wanted to use to help fight against my fine lines and pores and not only did it help minimize that but it also completely took away my acne. I am so glad I found this wonderful product. It helped Me gain my confidence back. This product is a must try. Not all skin products are for everyone but this one is worth trying. The change didn&#x27;t happen over night, just like no product but the first week I saw progress and about 4 months my acne was gone but I still use the product. I love love love it</li>
            <li> I was apprehensive to try yet another promise of &amp;#34;proven results&amp;#34;, but this one worked. I noticed an immediate difference and have experienced continual improvement in skin texture, tone, and fading wrinkles. No side affects which I have experiences with many other products. I will continue to use Nerium and look forward to better and better skin.  I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> My husband and I used product for about a year.  Zippo results.&lt;br /&gt;The smell didn&#x27;t bother us, though.  Kinda liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is for Nerium only.  Amazon is the best and I give it five stars!</li>
            <li> It does not do what the ads say it does, not even close! I have found the best for wrinkles anywhere on your body is Retina A.</li>
            <li> This product is NOT what it claims to be. A girl I went to Esthetics school is a brand partner for Nerium and she asked to meet with me to give me a free sample of the Age Defying Night Cream. When I met with her she told me about how being a brand partner changed her life and basically told me anything she could to make me sign up and then took a picture of my face so that I could see the &#x27;drastic&#x27; results later on. I was skeptical as I am not a fan of pyramid schemes but said I would try the product. She gave me a whole bottle as my sample which I thought was great. I went home and at night I followed the instructions she gave me of 2-3 pumps applied to a wet face. Right off the bat I didn&#x27;t like the smell and it made my face feel tight and uncomfortable. After a few days I noticed my skin, which hasn&#x27;t been acne prone for maybe 10 years since I was in high school, completely break out. I hadn&#x27;t tried any other new product and I broke out everywhere that I applied it. My neck had acne as well as my chin, nose and a cluster on my forehead. She told me the product was antibacterial and is great for preventing acne so I trusted her and applied it all over my face. I called her to complain and she told me I must have had an allergic reaction but I told her I had pustules and pimples and that it wasn&#x27;t a reaction and she told me that&#x27;s very rare to which I told her my skin has never broken out and I have tried hundreds of products. She then kept trying to tell me that even if the product &amp;#34;is not for me&amp;#34; she would appreciate it if I would refer her to all of my friends and family since that&#x27;s how you make your money being a brand partner. After telling her I wasn&#x27;t interested she KEPT calling me to try and get my money and to have me attend seminars featuring a 26 year old female who apparently is making $25,000 a MONTH. Nerium is a complete scam and a waste of your money. I didn&#x27;t like the product at all and I would definitely say to stay away from anyone who is trying to get you to become a brand partner and definitely be cautious before trying their products.</li>
            <li> Have used for a long time.  Seems to make a change in my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nerium AD for three weeks.  I definitely saw improvement in the texture of my skin after 10 days--which is the time frame they allow you a free trial.  Honestly, after 10 days it gets no better.  But I think the early improvement is better than what you get with most skin creams and about the same as with other alpha-hydroxy acids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Roc and TNS and other products in between those two price points.  I know some people don&#x27;t like the fragrance of Nerium but I think it&#x27;s delicious.  Very botanical and reminiscent of Yves Rocher of Paris.  I can&#x27;t get enough of it.  But to each his own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll keep going with Nerium when I get the same results with Roc for a fraction of the price.  And TNS works equally well but for $250. and the stink of old underwear, Nerium is a delightful indulgence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is no face lift.  It isn&#x27;t laser treatment either.  It is a skin cream and people should be realistic with their expectations.  In that case, it&#x27;s quite good.</li>
            <li> My first bottle of Nerium was purchased from a partner seller from Nerium and I got 40 days of use from the bottle.  I purchased my second bottle from this distributor and two things were different, the texture of the product which felt watered down and I only got about 20 days of use from this bottle.  Buy at your own risk with this distributor.</li>
            <li> I gave it a fair shake and used it for 2 months back in August of 2012.  I really wanted to believe in the product and sell the product.  I did not jump right into selling it because I had to see results first and truly believe in it 100% before I could sell it...sure the money sounded so appealing but seeing those dollar signs first before you actually see any results will get you into so much trouble if you don&#x27;t believe in it whole heartedly.  NO CHANGE IN MY SKIN WHAT SO EVER.  WAKE UP PEOPLE!  This is a multi level marketing scam and if you get conned into it, SHAME ON YOU!  It&#x27;s expensive and I have found other things that work for me....if it works for you that&#x27;s great but it did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING for me...so buyer BEWARE!!  That is just my 2 cents!</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and this product made it much worse. After three nights of use, I had to stop. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> After 1 week of treatment I saw a significant improvement in my skin.  I&#x27;ve used many different lines of both high end and drugstore products.  From Perricone to Avon to Mary Kay and to Maybelline to Chanel, this is the only product that really made a difference.</li>
            <li> Ha Ha, what a scam!!!  I stopped using my other product to try this out.  I had heard it works wonders but I think that was all just a hearsay.  I have been using this product faithfully for a little over a week and have taken before and after pics and see absolutely no difference.  Granted I am in my forties now and have been a sun worshiper most of my life.  I have taken great care of my skin and do look somewhat young for my age.  So far I have seen NOTHING about this product to even warrant purchasing it for a minimal price, let alone $70 per month.  I will use it until it is gone and if I see any more results, (which I doubt) I will do an update.</li>
            <li> Feels good when you put it on. Skin seems to feel tighter when applied. However, NO! This is not permanent! Your wrinkles will not go away or even be reduced. Save your money for Botox instead!</li>
            <li> I use this every night before bed as I have started to wrinkle at my age. I am also the caretaker of my grandchildren so I probably work a little harder than most grandmothers do at my age. I am very pleased with the results this product has to offer. My skin is looking lighter and fresher by the day and I just can&#x27;t stop looking at them!</li>
            <li> I used this for two month, and no.. no.. no more.. the second month I bought because it automatic debit my card and send to my house, after that, I cancel it.. it was not worth it at all. I didn&#x27;t see the result. wasting the money.. I don&#x27;t mind with that price if this product work but it&#x27;s not..</li>
            <li> Overpriced marginal product and fake &amp;#34;business opportunity&amp;#34;. Nerium gives so much product away because it is WORTHLESS. The real money is in the &amp;#34;brand partner&amp;#34; fees. Nerium charges tax on the monthly fee for the website. Ridiculous! There is a limited market for ALL high priced beauty products. Steer clear of this organization and MLM cults in general.</li>
            <li> Seal broken but seemed new. Good delivery</li>
            <li> I have been using for 4.5 mo.  No real difference.  Skin is smooth (but my old moisturizer did that too).  The best result I&#x27;ve had is thst my skin is a bit brighter more consistently.  Had done absolutely nothing for my fine lines or any other type of wrinkling.</li>
            <li> This product is also a  moisterizer which wasn&#x27;t good for my oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;Will not use nor buy it again.</li>
            <li> My wife used it for  20 days now. and she sees results.  i have not tried it yet, but can see the difference on the sun spots and the tone  is better. she is a happy user so far.</li>
            <li> If I could give this product zero stars I would. First of all it&#x27;s a bunch of pushy multi-level marketing fools that have zero clue about skin care trying to make a fast buck. The cream smells so awful and does absolutely NOTHING. It gave me a rash and made me red. Bottom line...if a product is good like La Mer you don&#x27;t need a lame pyramid scheme to sell this crap. The product would sell itself.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t even deserve one star. Ask a plastic surgeon about it and he will tell you what a joke this crap is. Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this item free from my sister-in-law.  I was so excited to try it.  The before and afters are amazing!  I was hoping it would reduce my pore size, get rid of my mild adult acne and diminish the hyper pigmentation on my cheeks.I even excitedly took my before pictures, hoping to show everyone how great it worked on me.  It was thick and orange and gooey and smells like a strong smelling putty or clay. It didn&#x27;t seem right, and I wondered if it was old. Maybe it&#x27;s just because I have really sensitive skin, but after a few days, I started to break out.  I was told this is normal because it&#x27;s cleaning out my pores.  I kept using it.  I waited a week, and things got much worse. I began to have full blown cystic acne.  I again told my sister in law who is a brand partner.  She said it&#x27;s very bio reactive and I needed to water it down a bit.  I look like I have tumors all over my face.  It&#x27;s very embarrassing to go out in public or work.  I have spent twice the norm on foundation to try to cover them up best I can.  It&#x27;s been a month and the cysts are still here. I keep trying to dry them out with cleansers and products and nothing is working.  I am now going to try Apple Cider Vinegar. Hope it works.  This has been a nightmare. I cannot recommend. Sorry. I really wanted the results everyone else got.</li>
            <li> I am an esthetician, and also have 30 years of self-study in skin care ingredients as well as herbs, vitamins, etc. Please look at the ingredients on a product before you buy it!! I had a co-worker ask me about this product, so I googled it.  It has Oleander Leaf Extract (poisonous plant) as a primary ingredient, and from what I understand, there is more than one type of Oleander. I don&#x27;t know about using it, and some of the reviews here on Amazon as well as others I have seen have had dubious results and even irritation. I would consider your own skin, whether it is sensitive, prone to acne, etc. when considering use of this product. This extract is in it&#x27;s infancy as far as research goes, and personally I recommend caution. Do your research, rely on sites you can trust.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome and gets results after using the first week. I save 20.00 a bottle when i buy on Amazon</li>
            <li> Did not work I think it&#x27;s a scam try for three months waste of money I suspect this company is a big Pearmon scam I think most of these reviews are fake</li>
            <li> High prices and feels like you are putting on a mask.  Needs your skin to be wet when you apply and it goes on like paste.  I used consistently for a while but really hate how it feels on my face and won&#x27;t be getting another bottle. Didn&#x27;t see any difference. Not for me.</li>
            <li> This product is too harsh for delicate skin but could work for thick and undamaged skin.</li>
            <li> It is awesome Ty so much :)</li>
            <li> It took me a few days to get used to the feel and smell of this, but now I can&#x27;t live without it.  I can tell a huge difference in my skin when I tried to change from it. The first few days were no big deal but after a week of using another product, my skin looked and felt awful - my make up would not apply nicely and just looked blah. I never thought I would be so dependent on one beauty product but this is it. It really does live up to its hype. Whatever good you have heard about this product is accurate.</li>
            <li> I started using over a year ago and my skins over all health looks wonderful. My deep wrinkles between my eyes is almost gone .My daughter is an esthetian and she loves the product. The people I work with are wonderful  hard working people that are excited about our wonderful  products.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I have ever used that actually improves my fine lines and wrinkles. I see the difference every day. The price was lower than what a friend had offered me to buy earlier this year. I am a 62 year old Black female that has purchased several facial products that did not work for me, this one does.</li>
            <li> Terrible product. Burnt my skin. Took over 6 months to fully heal. Incredibly disappointed that a product that claims to help your skin, damages it!</li>
            <li> HAve been using this product for ten months and I am now starting to see results.  It is lifing the lines from the mouth to the chin and firming under the chin.  Since it feels so drying I do not use it over my entire face only on the areas that needs lifting or deep wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy my Nerium from Amazon. I am on the auto plan. Yes they send you more than you need a month. I dont sell it. Im not even remotely interested in the business end of it, or the pryamid part of it. A friend recommended it the same week i started to see fine lines in my skin . I have tried every creme. I have never found any creme that really worked. I had settled for QVC&#x27;s philosophy. I knew Nerium was expensive, but i saw pictures of ( she lives far away from me) of her after taking this creme and i was stunned. I ordered that day! I have very little sun damage so i noticed a change quickly. Im incredibily scent sensitive so Im surprised i have no problem with the smell. It is supposed to make your skin tight when you put it on at night! its a night creme! Its doing it&#x27;s job! When you wash it off in the morning, your face is smooth and soft. I noticed my skin filling out, fine lines disapearred. I&#x27;m going to look into an eye creme i think they have. I believe that some people have reactions. We are all different. Is it a scam? I don&#x27;t know that part of it. I&#x27;m just a customer who loves the product.  I&#x27;m about to look for the day creme. It&#x27;s been six months and I would hate to think of what i would do without Nerium.</li>
            <li> After using these evil creams for 3 weeks, my face started swelling and becoming very itchy...them suddenly I noticed open blisters, and small bumps all over my cheeks. My sun skin discoloration disappeared for the first 2 weeks using the creams, after that they came back, those first 2 weeks I was loving my skin to the point I didn&#x27;t have to use any makeup! But everything change after that. The company make it really hard to return these creams. I&#x27;m very disappoint and distress by all this. So, I didn&#x27;t think this was going to happen to me. Don&#x27;t let any Brand partner or friends to push you to buy this product. My honest opinion. I&#x27;m surprised nobody is taking this Nerium AD to a legal court. This world is depressing how people let money drive their lives. Good luck! And remember, the most important thing is if you are going to sell this stuff, pls don&#x27;t involve your friends and family in to it...You will be very sorry!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I used Nerium AD for over 4 months and I haven&#x27;t seen any change in my skin at all.  I am 52 and have some crows feet around my eyes and some sagging around my jaw line.  I took the before pictures and I&#x27;ve taken a couple of sets of after pictures to compare and I don&#x27;t see any difference at all.  I recently did some research and have learned that oleander, an ingredient in Nerium AD, is a toxic substance that can kill skin cells and it is being studied to see if it can effectively kill cancer cells.  Good God - how does the FDA even let them market this stuff.  I&#x27;m freaking out now that I&#x27;ve put his stuff on my face for months much less thinking about the money I wasted on it.  I know we ladies all want to find the fountain of youth but this product is definitely not it!</li>
            <li> I used this product for two weeks and have been feeling tightness/pressure in my chest and neck area and heart palpitations.  I went to the doctor thinking I was having a heart attack.  EKG was normal.  I went home and reflected on what I had done differently in the last few weeks and narrowed it down to Nerium.  Last night I did not use Nerium and today I do not have that feeling of pressure.  I am sure these ingredients are absorbed through the skin.  Has anyone else had these symptoms?  I have found a couple reviews that refer to this.  Of course, the person I bought it from says they have never heard of it.</li>
            <li> I read so many negative reviews, and the common complaint is that people felt pressured, cheated, or the product &amp;#34;failed&amp;#34; to achieve miracle results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a Nerium brand partner. I am honest and transparent with people when I sample.&lt;br /&gt;It is a shame when brand partners focus more on the money rather than customer expectations.&lt;br /&gt;The product isnt for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;It may or may not work, simple as that.&lt;br /&gt;If it doesnt work, dont feel pressured to buy. If a brand partner is pushy and rude, put them in their place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My parents have used the product to reduce lines and sun spots and minimized the appearance of fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;They STOPPED using the product once they didnt see anymore changes. 3 months later. Simple as that!&lt;br /&gt;They didnt complain that it didnt make them look like they were back in their 20&#x27;s. Such expectation is ridiculous to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;They received many compliments from friends and family. 2 months of not using the product, they re-ordered again.&lt;br /&gt;You get a 30 day money back gurantee if it doesnt work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for joining the company, you get what you put in.&lt;br /&gt;Just with anything else. It&#x27;s not easy. People dont pay $80-$110, monthly, for a single product.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe on alcohol, dinner, video games, private gyms because in our minds we get more for our money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the risk people take to make extra cash.&lt;br /&gt;I joined for attainable reasons. To pay off my vehicle and credit card much faster.&lt;br /&gt;I work full-time and go to school full-time.&lt;br /&gt;I invest about 6 hours a week marketing Nerium to new people.&lt;br /&gt;I know two people that received their Lexus vehicles plus bonus (Nerium incentives) and host many parties at their house, mainly to help out brand partners sign up new customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, use common sense!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a regularly user of this cream and normally purchased through a Nerium Representative.  I decided to purchase 2 of the night cream on amazon and the last bottle, half way through the cream changed to a dark golden color and turned very liquidly.  Will not purchase through amazon again, do not know where they got these from.  Did not know how to get my money back or a replacement.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for a year. I have great skin without wrinkles or blotchy, but Nerium and improved my skin even more.&lt;br /&gt;The compliments are constant. The product is easy to apply and it&#x27;s been a ritual for me. I have gotten several friends to use it as well.</li>
            <li> The worst product I&#x27;ve ever put on my face. Seriously, thank god it was from a sample and I didn&#x27;t have to pay for this stuff.  The first morning after applying the cream I woke with my face feeling like it had plastic wrap pressed to it. The cream had dried to a peculiar, powdery film that required two washes of my raw, organic face wash.  The next morning my skin looked enflamed.  By the third morning I had broken out in painful cystic acne.  By the fourth morning I had 3 or 4 bleeding spots on my face after washing and drying it.  To clarify, I have never had a problem with acne but do have sensitive skin. Certain foods gift me with break outs (coffee, pasta) but no cream has ever done anything this dramatic to me.   The sample was given to me by a close friend who has, in a month of selling this schlock to the odd old school friend, become a strange Nerium drone. Thanks recent San Jose &#x27;leadership weekend&#x27; designed to get more punters in the MLM downline.  It seems Nerium sellers are trained to willfully deny that their cream is a poor product comprised of a poisonous plant plus standard OTC drug store ingredients.  To any question I asked, the rote response was &#x27;It works&#x27;.  Clearly, for sensitive skin it doesn&#x27;t.    Poor product, worse company.</li>
            <li> Good Product.  Will see a skin difference.  This product does help correct skin imperfections, however I do not see any firming affects from it.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the biggest scam out there. The product is expensive and has little to no data to support the claims.  It is a pyramid sceem and relies on bringing in new partners to make any money.</li>
            <li> It works fantastic! Its a must have!! You need to buy NeriumAD no matter what age you are, it works and improves your skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 months and my skin just keeps getting better. It is the only product I have ever used that actually delivers what is promised. I love it!</li>
            <li> I have yet to see a before and after picture that are taken with the same focus and the same lighting.  Why are all the before pictures extremely focused and in detail, and all the after pictures are all softened, off focus, and with different lighting?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t surprised to see the latest lawsuit filed because Nerium is using fake before and after pictures of Ray Liotta, when he has never even heard of the product!</li>
            <li> I have been using Nerium for over a year and absolutely LOVE the results. My face is no longer sagging, the wrinkles on my forehead are very minimal, my crows feet are gone and the texture of my skin is soft, smooth and glowing. People think I&#x27;m in my early 40s and tell me my skin glows! My friends all love it too. I&#x27;m not sure why there is all this negativity posted, it&#x27;s great stuff.</li>
            <li> Still seeing if this stuff works, but people are telling me I look younger and how great my skin looks.  Its worth a try!!!</li>
            <li> If I could give this cream a zero I would, it has done damage to my skin and the company has refused to give me a refund on the produce as well (30 day trial is a joke, used it for 2 and a half weeks and they said they would not honor the 30 day trial)  I sure wish I would have listened to the reviews and took others advice. Save your money and feed the hungry or something, don&#x27;t waste it on a bottle of this crap. It feels like elmer&#x27;s glue trying to put it on your skin,... nasty, just like the company!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Can&#x27;t live without it!!  I&#x27;ve been using this product for about one year now and there are noticeable differences.</li>
            <li> Firstly, the cream has a horrible odor. My representative told me that was because it was &#x27;all natural plant extracts without any chemicals or perfumes&#x27;. Whoa...what kind of plant? I couldn&#x27;t tolerate that under my nose every night. I seriously felt sick to my stomach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works the same as any other age defying cream on the market. A little bit of improvement for a LOT of money. The photos of the knee flab disappearing, and the back flab disappearing? Bogus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll spend a few hundred dollars and find it does very little for your skin, unless you want to approach every single woman in your path to tell them &#x27;How excited you are about your new career!&#x27;  Heavy pressure sales. Constantly.</li>
            <li> The only unique ingredient in here is Oleandar which irritates some peoples skin just enough to plump it up a bit and mask wrinkles temporarily.  It&#x27;s not a miracle cream, not approved by the FDA, and long term effects are unknown. All the other ingredients are common in all beauty products. The \\&quot;proprietary blend\\&quot; is just aloe vera and Oleandar.  I found that it actually dried out my skin and didn&#x27;t deliver promised results at all.  The results I am seeing from friends that are using it are being told by their reps what a huge difference it&#x27;s making when it&#x27;s literally nothing.  If you don&#x27;t see results in that first 30 days you have to \\&quot;keep using it, give it a chance, it will work!!\\&quot;  The VAST majority of people will be able to achieve similar results with a good over the counter cream at a fraction of the price...especially those who do not regularly use a face cream right now.  Most people who have \\&quot;amazing\\&quot; results are the same people trying to sell it to you and to sign you up under them, and the before/afters are either literally unbelievable or obviously done under different lighting at slightly different angles. I have no doubt that a small, SMALLLL percentage of people have some result they are pleased with enough to keep purchasing.  What turned me off to this product isn&#x27;t even the product itself, which is lackluster and disappointing at best.  It&#x27;s the cultish mindset of their sales reps. I&#x27;m sure to get a few comments here about how I&#x27;m wrong, and don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m talking about, and then they&#x27;ll link you to neriums website to \\&quot;find out for yourself\\&quot; using their personal link to amass more sales and hopefully talking you into joining them. They whip/brainwash these people up into a frenzy.  What do all the failed Nerium reps and people bamboozled into buying it do when they&#x27;re left with all this worthless product?  They hawk it on Amazon at a discounted rate! Sure, they&#x27;ll say it&#x27;s counterfeit since the company prohibits amazon and ebay sales, but even if so...the counterfeit is probably at least as effective as Nerium so who cares!  No, you don&#x27;t get a 30 day guarantee when you buy it here, but at least you&#x27;re not being harassed by fanatical tin foil hat and soon to be former friends, put on autoship, or **automatically given a sales page** to start your own \\&quot;business\\&quot; when you buy on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Nerium AD combo Night and Day Creams work for me and my husband!  Our necks and jowls are lifting and wrinkles are much less.  We have been using since 1/21/14 and immediately noticed the texture of our skin improved.  We are thoroughly enjoying the improved appearance of our skin.  Joe says shaving is easier and his roseacea has greatly diminished.  He has a large scar on his neck &amp; his skeptical hair dresser noticed improvement in appearance &amp; she&#x27;s been cutting his hair for more than 10 years!&lt;br /&gt;Nerium FIRM is also AMAZING!  Noticed smoother legs after 3 applications!  And my trainer noticed my arms looking tighter &amp; smoother before I even said anything.  Still need to lose 10 pounds but this gives me motivation that I&#x27;ll look better when that&#x27;s accomplished!  Before nothing helped much.&lt;br /&gt;My 34 year old son is also enjoying the shaving experience improved with fewer ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;With 30 day money back guarantee, we felt confident in giving it a try.  Usually problems are going to show up within that time.  We both like the \\&quot;organic\\&quot; smell but we&#x27;re into being healthy and using organic, high quality products and foods.</li>
            <li> This product works well when left on for 30-45 minutes and then add your moisturizer (really good one). The product doesn&#x27;t say anything about moisturizer afterward so I experimented, with and without cream afterwards. It is definitely works best when followed by a moisturizer that night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a treatment. Treatments need to be typically followed by a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> There must have been a Nerium convention in St. Louis last week, because while waiting for my flight home it was non stop bombardment by people in Nerium shirts with before and after photos on their iPads and giving out their cards and making ridiculous claims...and every single one of the sales reps&#x27; skin looked awful with waaaaaay too much make up on. This is a total ponzi scheme and I really hope people read these reviews before they decide to purchase, and I hope the reps will get out of the pyramid and save their souls...so sad what people do for money. I am confident all 250 five stars reviews were left by marketing reps...insane there are just as many one stars...rare for any real product...I can&#x27;t believe Amazon even sells this. I have not tried this product, I just wanted to share my experience at the airport because I believe it was a clear give away of this disgusting marketing scheme.</li>
            <li> I read through these reviews before I purchased and had to say I was a little nervous to try this.  Buuuuuuut wow - I love it.  First off, I do not sell this product nor will I ever because I am one busy ass photojournalist.  Secondly, I won&#x27;t deny I already look very young for my age and am not disciplined about skincare. I do believe that great skin is best cared for inside out.  However, a lot of it is genetic. Lately, I&#x27;ve noticed a little more signs of aging - duller skin and fine lines.  I tried this and instantly I felt like I had gotten a face lift.  My skin feels more taut and just looks brighter.  It glows in that young skin kinda way.  It makes me feel more radiant.  I have a badass edgy haircut and everywhere I go people say Wow! &amp;#34;you just look great&amp;#34;!  I think this product plays a major role in that!!  I hope this review helps some worried first timer.  JP</li>
            <li> My mother was the one that started all of this.What&#x27;s even worse, is that for as long as I can remember she is SUPER against pyramid schemes, so I have no idea what they said or did to get her to become involved in this, or the fact that she is obsessed with youth and beauty that made her want to be a part of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like other reviews have stated, my boyfriend and I were invited to a &amp;#34;party&amp;#34;, which turned out to be a Nerium party. The head brand partner looked like she had a bunch of botox done on her, and I knew right away that this was a pyramid scheme by the way they were presenting the rewards program and the fact they didn&#x27;t talk much about the science of the product, which my boyfriend was more interested in. We were pressured right then and there to sign up, and my mom paid for us to sign up (I feel pretty bad I didn&#x27;t say &amp;#34;No&amp;#34; a bit firmer to save her a bunch of money). From then on all I ever heard from my mom was how great the company is, how great the product works (even though I never noticed a difference, and my boyfriend always complained of the smell), and how she believes in the product. I tried telling her that selling this stuff isn&#x27;t my thing (aka I&#x27;m not into pyramid schemes) and she threw major fits and arguments stating how I never do anything for her and how this is for my future. Yep, I was dealing with a Nerium monster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For awhile any time I were to visit her during holidays she would always take pictures of my face saying how big of a difference she sees (again, I never saw any). My poor brother, who has a bunch of acne scars, was even more bombarded. He ended up doing some research on his end (he is 18 and easily Googled some REAL information), and found that the product was made from a poisonous plant, and how it can affect your skin when the toxin is applied. Her retaliation was that all of the other companies were &amp;#34;haters&amp;#34; and were &amp;#34;jealous of the success of the company&amp;#34;. You have GOT to be kidding me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After running out of friends and family to sign up, she has constantly been going to Nerium meet-ups, and most recently, a convention of sorts. Just when I thought her passion for this scam died, now all I see on my Facebook is her posting stuff about the product again. Luckily she told me to cancel my subscription because she couldn&#x27;t keep up with her account, my brother&#x27;s account, and both of my grandma&#x27;s accounts. And yes, she used her own money to make us all brand partners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE save your money and valued relationships and avoid this scam!to be kidding me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After running out of friends and family to sign up, she has constantly been going to Nerium meet-ups, and most recently, a convention of sorts. Just when I thought her passion for this scam died, now all I see on my Facebook is her posting stuff about the product again.

            <li> I was shocked to see all the negative reviews..either the seller is not selling nerium..as in they are scamming ppl OR the reviews are from paid trolls by the competition...i Love this product..i will Never use botox or have surgery..Never..this product .IF you use it.. will Change your life...notice the ppl giving negative reviews have Not reviewed any other product on amazon BUT nerium..you can see i am a real person...i have plenty of reviews on all types of products..i am just a normal amazon shopper i review the products i use ...smh at the LIES being told here...dont buy from amazon buy from the company ..they offer a thirty day money back no questions asked..you wont regret it..it will give you a new Lease on Life...</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t be a fool like I was. This product is not worth the hassle. The company is hard to get a hold of and when you want to stop the product you keep getting transferred on hold lines to wait for someone to fax you a termination contract which you never get. Then you have to email and they still send you the product and charge you. Please don&#x27;t be a fool if you want the product buy it on your terms and do not give a credit card number.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why so many people have such negative comments - I have only been using the cream for a week and already feel and see a difference.  I have dark spots from sun damage and they are noticeably fading and my skin feels amazing.  As far as the smell I don&#x27;t notice anything???  My pores look smaller and my skin is glowing so I am a big 5 stars!</li>
            <li> You can only get the real Nerium AD from a Brand Partner!! If you buy from this site you may not be getting what you are supposed to be getting....you may get the wrong product or a half full bottle or a completely empty bottle all together! You also may get some that is completely out of date! Contact a Brand Partner for buying this product and any and all information you need to use this product!!! this product is not to be sold by amazon and is not allowed!!!!! Go to WWW.Nerium.com for the real deal!!!</li>
            <li> I love the way my face feels the next morning after I rinse off the mask.  Also like how quickly the mask dries when I put it on at night.</li>
            <li> I love this product! My mom sells it so I bought one from her and it helped me a lot to minimize my pores. It also helped my boyfriend with his dark circles. You just have to take a before and after picture to actually see the difference!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, would not recommend. Bottle pump doesn&#x27;t work well, it feels like it&#x27;s empty. I have to give it a few good pumps before anything comes out and when it does its clumpy and spits out thick. After I apply it on, it flakes like crazy. Then my face just looks red and dry. I have used it a couple of times and now it seems to be empty. Also it smells like something died in it.</li>
            <li> I have read so many negative reviews, most come from \\&quot;Brand Partners\\&quot;. So it is obvious they are disgruntled because they weren&#x27;t successful. Let me explain about this company, I&#x27;ve done my research, yes it is made with \\&quot;Oleander\\&quot; but not the toxic kind. Come on people have common sense, why would a company invest so much money using a plant that is completly toxic. Another thing, if you aren&#x27;t using the product properly you will not have successful results. You have to wash your face prior to use, and then apply the lotion and work it in. I know because I too had the same issue, \\&quot;it smells, its thick, its not working\\&quot; I contacted my BP and told her I hated this product, she reexplained to me about how to use it properly! It made perfect sense, I also told her I too found the negative review on the oleander plant, she showed me the makers of Nerium have their own NON TOXIC OLEANDER farm! If you aren&#x27;t willing to properly research and will believe the first thing your eyes ponder upon, its no wonder so many people are so mislead. This product isn&#x27;t meant to be a wonder overnight sensation, it is meant to improve with time. So one lady said she had over 3 months worth of product and called to complain to Nerium about her issue, WHY WOULD YOU WAIT 3 MONTHS AFTER YOU DON&#x27;T LIKE SOMETHING TO TRY TO CASH IN ON THE 30 DAY GUARANTEE!? Common Sense!! Rather than coming here on Amazon to purchase this, Which is more expensive, and untrust worthy, go directly to the site and purchase your product. If you don&#x27;t love it after 25 days, call nerium and tell them youwant your money back! You are within your 30 days for your money back! Please people research prior to purchase and do not believe everyone you read about. Everyones skin is different and we all respond differently to a lotion. In the long run after I&#x27;ve been through the Avon Age defying stuff, I have come out cheaper using Nerium! if you want to purchase from a real Brand partner and not one from Amazon go to [...].</li>
            <li> I use to be a rep Nerium and to this day I have never found anything that works as well as it does</li>
            <li> I am not an avid review-writer, but have to share my Nerium experience. I have been using both the day and night cream for about two months. My skin feels and looks better and I am really happy with the results so far. This week I started receiving so many compliments! People have told me that I am glowing, they love my sparkle, my complexion looks so pretty. I am so happy to know that other people are noticing a difference! (Of course I can&#x27;t help but wonder how I must have looked before!) Anyway, I am 55 years old and have spent a lot of time in the sun, this product feels like it is reversing the effects of age and lifelong sunbathing. I have even started using it on my chest and am seeing a difference there too. I would highly recommend that you give it a try and see for yourself what Nerium can do for you...</li>
            <li> Have been using Nerium day and night cream for almost a week.  My skin has been looking pretty good the last few days.  My pores seem to look cleaner and smaller which is huge plus.  I noticed the last two days that my skin was feeling pretty warm after application, but didn&#x27;t really think much of it.  After I applied the day cream this morning, I ended up with a huge bright red rash covering my neck.  My daughter even asked how I got sunburned.  I washed it off immediately, but my neck is still red, hot, and burns.  So glad I have been using a sample, and that I&#x27;m not any money.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to Nerium in the fall of 2011. I used the cream religiously every night after taking a shower from November 2011 all the way until May of 2013 (a good 18+ months). When I say religiously, I mean RELIGIOUSLY. I used the cream EVERY NIGHT. By May of 2013, I got tired of using the cream because I wasn&#x27;t seeing any &amp;#34;real results.&amp;#34; I decided that there must be some other reasons why my skin was not the best it could be. I decided to stop drinking sodas and Arizona Iced Teas, which are FULL of sugar. I also started using an exfoliater on my face about 2 or 3 times a month. After 3 months of going cold turkey on sodas and sugar drinks and then using an exfoliater, my skin is now better than it ever was while using Nerium.</li>
            <li> I grew up in a big city. In my world, parties are for sharing your joy and hospitality with friends-as opposed to profiting from them.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t learn about Pyramid Parties until I moved to a rural area. No offense to my rural friends, but if I see the invitation and it reads...Silpada- Pampered Chef-all similar schemes...profit off your friends, I am not available to attend the party.&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE!&lt;br /&gt;This is a pyramid scheme and a poor product. I was first invited to a party by one of my students (totally inappropriate to solicit this way) and I declined. I am Scottish and prone to red patches on my skin-figured it would irritate it-worried about a product distributed in such a way.Then, my hair stylist talked me into it as she sells it in her spa. I trust her so I gave in. 90 days later I have spent over $300 and my skin is a red, acne prone (never was prior) mess. Thankfully I was smart enough not to offer it to my friends (see sentence one).&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be sucked in! Save your money.</li>
            <li> I Tried this product for two months, I noticed botching and breaking out.  After I stopped using the product my skin began to clear up.  This product should not be used by African American women, I don&#x27;t think it is intended for our skin type.  When I contacted the company after sending the product back, they refused to give me a refund or send back the product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 49 and have always spent way to much time in the sun and way too little care with my skin, so I have a lot of issues such as wrinkles around my eyes and lips, sun spots and some red tones on my face, my chest also has sun damage. I was very skeptical of purchasing this product, but my daughter was pushing me so hard to sign up for it that I finally caved. I read so many reviews and just didn&#x27;t get enough positive feed back to feel confident in what it would do. I used it for 5 days as a free trial last month and didn&#x27;t really notice much but liked the way it felt on my face. Then once I received my order in the mail (June 12) Ive been using it ever since. Its only been 12 days and I skipped a few nights but the difference in my skin is truly amazing! I did not expect to see any changes so soon but the changes are undeniable! I did take the before pics but that wasn&#x27;t really my concern to nit pick every small change on my face, I just want to look in the mirror and feel like my entire face is more nourished looking and lines aren&#x27;t so noticeable. I even used it on my décolletage and notice a huge improvement with the wrinkles and look of it. I had my husband try it too and told him if he commits to it, we will order it for him as well. He&#x27;s used it for less time than me and I notice an improvement on how hydrated (which ultimately makes wrinkles seem to disappear)his skin looks. I don&#x27;t sell this stuff, nor am I interested in marketing, I just want to give my positive unbiased feedback. Too bad its an MLM product but I am happy with it. Its expensive and my first purchase of a product like this but the results are holding up to their promise. The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is I have just started using it and need to see if it helps reduce my sun spots as well</li>
            <li> This is posted under my husband&#x27;s name, but I was the actual user.I have used Nerium for over 3 months (I committed to use for 3 months to my friend who was selling). Absolutely no difference to crow&#x27;s feet, wrinkles (although minor), age spots (biggest issue), and sun damage. I suppose perhaps it worked for SOMEONE but  I cancelled my auto delivery. Spent quite a bit of money because I got both day and night products (so basically 2X a day use with ZERO results). Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> Haven seen much results yet.&lt;br /&gt;Been using it faithfully since I got it</li>
            <li> The product is incredible and so is the business. I have earned my free Lexus within a year. Our new anti aging product for the brain EHT is fantastic. I get my product for free every month. If you need to talk to some one call me at any time. 9173864948&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Neil</li>
            <li> I had never heard of this until my boyfriends mom invited me to a party for it. I only started a week ago but already fell in love with this. I can feel it working after it dries and see a small improvement in my skin overall. I forgot my makeup at my moms last week and I actually felt confident going to work with no makeup the past 3 days. &#x3D;) I&#x27;m hoping it keeps up with these good results and I have already suggested my friends check it out. If I continue being happily surprised with this, I might look in to becoming a rep to get it for cheaper and help other people discover it. I signed up for the largest packet and haven&#x27;t started using the firming/contouring cream yet. Shipping is taking a bit...which I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> i know a women who is a skin care expert and wanted to prove nerium wrong. she was given a bottle to try for 2 weeks. After the 2 weeks she told us. at first her rosacea flared up, and all she could think was &amp;#34;see i told them it didn&#x27;t work, i cant wait to go back in there and prove them wrong. but then it stopped and her skin cleared up and she started seeing the amazing results, and knows why we love the product so much. She said she wanted to hate it but she loves it! I also know someone else who experienced a side effect at first, but rode it out and is so glad she did! anytime i have ever switched skin care lines i experience a purging period in my skin, its normal, our skin is acclimating to a new product, any skin care expert will tell you that. I believe in nerium, for me personally it has evened out my skin tone, shrank my pores, and has given my skin a healthy glow. for the first time since before puberty i feel ok in my own skin, not worrying about sleeping over the boyfriends and not wanting to wash my face because i am embarrassed of my skin. i love it!!! you don&#x27;t have to be older to use this product, you can start now. Also it is extremely important to take before and after photos, when you look in the mirror everyday you yourself cant see the changes as much, the before and after photos is your proof that this product really does work!!</li>
            <li> I am still testing this product.  Unsure as to the end results of this new product wil decide later .</li>
            <li> Nerium works great! It&#x27;s a little pricey but not as high as others that work this well. The product was shipped quickly. I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I learned about this product from a friend. I have melasma and my current skin product Obagi is difficult to find online, expensive and five steps. But Nerium is one bottle full of magic. I use it nightly and skin has improved. Also, acne is near obsolete.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by a friend.  She said her skin had improved everyday she used it.  I also experience the improvement.  I had used a very good night cream, Oblagi, and needed a change.  This is a very good product.  Didn&#x27;t like the smell at first but got use to it.</li>
            <li> The cream is doing a good job on my skin . I can tell a difference after the second bottle .</li>
            <li> After a very awkward meeting at a friends house I felt pressured to buy it. It gave me inflamed red bumps all over my face after the first few times applying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She said, &amp;#34;Its detoxing your face.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m calling BS on this product, ridiculously expensive and misleading before and after photos. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> really like it  interested in another order</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly &amp; was in good condition. The product seems to be working pretty good so far although I haven&#x27;t been using it for long.</li>
            <li> I had tried the sample they were wonderful so I ordered a bottle doesn&#x27;t work as well and for the money I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> I started using this product just 3 weeks ago.  I took my photo before and now and the results are amazing.  In just 3-4 days&lt;br /&gt;my skin was feeling so good.  After 7 days I could already see the changes in my skin.  I have now been using the product every day for the past 3 weeks and would not give it up.  I LOVE IT.  I had friends that told me about it -- but I had to try it for myself.  I would recommend this product to anyone that has lines, wrinkles or skin that needs to be toned.  It is a great product and a great company to deal with.</li>
            <li> My wife is a believer in this product&#x27;s ability to make her face look younger. And it&#x27;s cheaper than plastic surgery.</li>
            <li> Product works well for me. I&#x27;m a satisfied customer. Age spots much fainter and skin tone excellent. Very happy with Nerium.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this night cream. It feels so good when you put it on and, it really does do absolute wonders for your skin. Within the first few days I noticed a difference. After a week my boyfriend noticed a difference. After a month? Amazing. My skin glows, it&#x27;s looks smoother, younger. I am a whole hearted believer in this product.</li>
            <li> Nothing like it promises. Used it, used my daughters as she did not want hers, nothing except break outs each time. I was not that disappointed as most of these products seem to be just a profit maker for the companies. Happy I only wasted $100.00</li>
            <li> I didnt like the smell or feeling of it on my skin after it hardened.  Didnt see any noticable difference</li>
            <li> Great product. Arrived on time. would recommend.</li>
            <li> Excellent product…great anti aging. Smooths condition of skin…reduces fine lines. Skin appears younger and more radiant.</li>
            <li> After using it exactly as instructed, not only did I not see any positive benefits, my face broke out in tiny little bumps everywhere. Retin A works much better for me. Not sure who is getting amazing results? I did get it quickly and that&#x27;s all the good I can say about it.</li>
            <li> Been using Nerium for one year. Amazon is the best deal going, price wise and availability.&lt;br /&gt;As for the product, never go without it at night. Keeps skin more youthful, smooth, and wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;to a minium.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t sell this, so I&#x27;m writing this review purely because I LOVE this product.  My friend picked me up from the airport and I had not seen her in 9 months.  My mouth literally dropped because I thought she had a facelift and asked her what she had &#x27;done.&#x27; She had been using Nerium and gave me a sample bottle without pushing me in the slightest.  She said &#x27;you&#x27;ll see.&#x27;  I have been using it for 8 weeks and within one started seeing the difference.  I understand not everyone will have the same response time and reaction as all skin types are different.  My friend is mixed race and I&#x27;m caucasian; she&#x27;s in her early 50s and I&#x27;m in my late 30s.  It has not dried my skin out.  My age spots are significantly lighter, my wrinkles on my eyes and chest are much improved (not perfect-- it&#x27;s not a &#x27;miracle&#x27; and I&#x27;m not 20 anymore) and my skin tone is much more even with smaller pores.  I think it does have a not-great smell but it&#x27;s not terrible, either.  You don&#x27;t HAVE to sign up for the autoship, so I say try it a month and see.  I just know it worked for my friend and it is working for me.</li>
            <li> It is quite funny to me that there are two kinds of reviews on here about this product. 1) The REAL reviews with 1-2 stars that show that this product is ineffective and 2) The reviews from the &amp;#34;distributors&amp;#34; trying to boost the ratings of this product. It is a HUGE red flag when there are nearly as many 5 stars as there are 1 stars, and very little in between. I have never used this product, but I know several people who use/sale it. It is a HOAX. The sales representative takes these &amp;#34;before/after&amp;#34; pictures that show remarkable results in just a few weeks. It is a JOKE. Any person with 2 eyes can see that the lighting, camera angle, and head angle are significantly different in the &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; picture in order to show &amp;#34;improvements&amp;#34; in skin condition. I have years of education behind me. I have attempted to research the claims of these products on &amp;#34;Peer reviewed journal articles&amp;#34; from a University&#x27;s database and there is NO research about this product. The only research is given by NERIUM INT. and it is clearly inaccurate. The only info that comes when I attempt to search for it is &amp;#34;Nerium oleander&amp;#34;. The Journal articles are mainly on how to treat POISONINGS from this plant! This product is a fraud. This is nothing but a PYRAMID SCHEME people!! A few individuals at the top are making A LOT OF MONEY while their &amp;#34;minions&amp;#34; build &amp;#34;teams&amp;#34;. If this product was truly as magnificent as it claims to be it would be available in stores. Save your money and your intelligence and stay away from this product and all affiliations.</li>
            <li> I like this product, and I do not work for the company. What I don&#x27;t like is the marketing -- having friends push it on me, and than push me to sign up for their auto delivery, and then push me to sell it.  This (and the lower price) is why I buy it off of Amazon and not ashamed to say so. At any rate, I don&#x27;t mind the smell, and I do like the way it makes my skin feel, both at night and in the morning. I did not take before and after pictures, but I do feel like my skin has benefitted from the product. It could simply be that I&#x27;m taking better care of my skin now -- I was never in the habit of washing my face before bed before I started using Nerium.  As I careen toward my 51st birthday and often have people tell me I don&#x27;t look old enough to have grown children, much less grandkids, I feel that something must be working, so I&#x27;m sticking with it.  I&#x27;d give it 5 stars for all these reasons, and because it&#x27;s easy to use, but taking away a star because it is still expensive, even on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!! Can&#x27;t live without it. It has cleared my complexion and is minimizing my fine lines. Can&#x27;t say enough about this product! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now and it&#x27;s somewhat helping to clear my skin up.  (Im 23) My dermatologist told me to use this instead of proactiv to clear my skin. I&#x27;m still having breakouts but I get stressed out easily and my face reacts to it badly. I have noticed that the few winkles I had under my eyes are gone.</li>
            <li> Too expensive and after a month of use I didn&#x27;t see any improvement. Not all products work the same on all people.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Nerium AD for two weeks now and I love it! My skin didn&#x27;t feel dry or peeling...first use I did feel a little tingling and tightness, but not dryness. Strangers I come in contact with would comment on how nice my skin looks, I look bright and I was at the pharmacy and the pharmacist said to me, \\&quot;you look really good...you don&#x27;t look stress(and I wasn&#x27;t even wearing makeup). So, I know this product works for me. I&#x27;m not doing the business...I&#x27;m just a customer that is very satisfy with the results and I will continue to use Nerium AD and recommend this product to other people.</li>
            <li> Seeing these bad comments are making me laugh. My skin has never looked better and Its an amazing product and great company. But dont buy it from here. Find a BP and buy it from them. :)</li>
            <li> Really, it stinks. This produce smells so bad I couldn&#x27;t stand to put it on my face.  I tried it as directed for two weeks straight and saw no difference, and I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore.  No way I would spend that much money on this product, it is toxic and it&#x27;s all about making money for the people at the top. High pressure sales, no thank you.</li>
            <li> I asked a friend who kept promoting Nerium and posting how much he was making money and the success he was experiencing, what exactly it was. Immediately I was bombarded by 3 people sending me private messages telling me how great this skin care product was and that I should try it myself and that I could make a career out of it. Right away I was skeptical, as this seemed strange for something to apparently be sold in such a fashion as to mimic a pyramid scheme. So I dug deeper. Just reading the reviews on amazon gave me the chills. Its either people giving it 5 stars promoting it because they need more people under them selling it to make money, or its people giving it 1 star because it dried out their skin, puffed up their eyes, gave them a rash or acne, or did nothing. This company is nothing more than trash I presume at this point and its a get rich quick scheme based on 1000&#x27;s of little underdogs selling it to friends or family, etc etc. UNETHICAL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot reccommend this product for the following reasons.&lt;br /&gt;1. Cost - there are many other skin care products that will satisfy skin condition without being over 100 dollars a month. There just isn&#x27;t reason to spend so much on skin care anyways, our country has gotten out of control in what satisfies them or others, it just isn&#x27;t worth the cost in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;2. The MLM network - the way that this company works is to maximize savings in advertising by promising anyone willing to do the yee old pyramid scheme style marketing act that they can somehow make a decent and quick buck, perhaps alot more. While this may be true, think about what it entails and how it affects the people that are the underdogs in the business. The overseeing marketers make the decent buck while the lessers harrass everyone they know or might know in an attempt to spread the hype about said product, essentially creating something that would not ordinarily exist considering normal marketing and advertising. It just isn&#x27;t ethical if you think about it. No single thing is THAT much better than anything else.&lt;br /&gt;3. Science -  I dug a little and found that the studies done on this product found little harm to the skin from the oleander extract it harbors. Oleander is poisonous to those that do not know, and I for one would NEVER put something on my precious skin that came from such a deadly plant. NEVER, no matter how much anyone could possibly explain that studies were done etc etc. The studies were HOWEVER not conclusive on LONG TERM effects of applying said chemical to one&#x27;s skin. NO ONE KNOWS how oleander will affect skin conditions in the long run as this product has only been out 3 years and they may not be long enough.&lt;br /&gt;4. Skin - Why is something that is natural looked down upon in our society today? Skin aging is what normally happens to people as they get older, especially if you sunbath alot etc. There are things that people need and things that people want. Skin care products that cost a ton and do just a bit of change are not needed. Only things such as Accutane for people with acne  are really needed. Wake up America, things are not as important as the media and hype makes it out to be, there is no need to fall into some trap and start handing your hard earned dollars over to some company that see&#x27;s fit to overmarket something and essentially pretend that it is a miracle drug (does the 20&#x27;s ring a bell?)&lt;br /&gt;5. Truth - Many of the claims Nerium has made simply are mask&#x27;s or partial truths. Considering they claim they do not need FDA approval for something derived from a poison, they sure do promote and post before and after pics with differentiating lighting, over exaggerate the outcome (especially considering the amazon reviews I have read), and perpetuate a happy lifestyle with magazines, conferences, ads, word of mouth praise, social networking advertising among friends and family, etc, when in fact something like this is not going to make someone more happy than they were before, and as such is an illusion portrayed by the media moguls and marketing cons like Jeff Olson, CEO of Nerium Int. and Prepaid Legal (it may ring a bell).&lt;br /&gt;Also there are the customers that get the cold shoulder when it comes to returning the product or has a problem with customer service. Many have posted of such occurances yet the company will always hold its motto of user friendliness. It goes deeper than that in some examples but I&#x27;ll leave it at that.&lt;br /&gt;So there you have it. Take it or leave it but I won&#x27;t be buying stock in said company if they ever to decide to become a real one. Nerium leaves a bad taste on the mouth for those savy enough to admit they are such prowlers in the nature of business, but then again who knows really, right? My 2 cents spend your money elsewhere. These guys need not further encouragement than what it&#x27;s already inflated to.</li>
            <li> The seller was great, it was packaged great and it came in a quick manner. The product itself I have been using for 1 year now and I have not seen a difference with fine lines. It does however give me a very clean soft complection and feels great.</li>
            <li> I had to share my story so other people can learn from my experience with this product.  I bought mine from a  local seller that is a brand partner and not online.  I used the day cream, night cream and the new Firm lotion.  At first my skin didn&#x27;t react for about 4 or 5 days then suddenly on my face i got very painful acne.........I am 42 years old and acne is not really an issue for me.  Then I noticed on my chest and neck I had break outs and a painful red rash.  I was told that it&#x27;s just my skin getting used to the product and not to worry.  I stopped using it on my face but continued using the Firm body lotion from my neck down. My legs were covered in bumps almost like ingrown hairs and blisters, then the next day my neck, shoulders, arms chest and torso were covered too. Well after 3 weeks and huge sores, itchy rashed up skin I discontinued ALL Nerium products.  Fast forward to today, a month since I have used Nerium and my neck, shoulders, arms and torso are all still covered with a very itchy rash! I told the sales rep and of course he say&#x27;s he has never heard of that happening. Funny, because I can find similar stories all over online.  I am not able to even go be outside without covering myself in long sleeves in fear the sun will only make it hurt worse.  It burns and itches so bad it keeps me up at night! I am hoping it goes away soon or I will have no choice but to go to a dermatologist. Please be so careful of this stuff.  I have been doing a ton of research on it and can find nothing good about it. No real antiaging properties to it.  Also if it Kills cancer cells, that should be a red flag warning, skin is delicate! I only wish I had read all the information on it before I used it in the first place.  Be wise and steer clear of this stuff,  this rash is embaressing, i&#x27;ts painful and I work in the beauty industry so looks are important in my career (Cosmetology).</li>
            <li> I ordered this over a month ago and still haven&#x27;t received it. I knew it would take longer coming from over seas but never has anything taken this long! AND it&#x27;s still not going to be here till almost the end of June! Crazy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself, I love it&#x27;s totally worth the price and the time to wait. My skin feels soft and smooth, those fine lines and wrinkles are definitely less defined and it&#x27;s just amazing. I strongly recommend it to anyone, regardless of age.</li>
            <li> I do like this product.  I can feel it tightening the skin.</li>
            <li> very pasty didn&#x27;t absorb well.</li>
            <li> Everywhere I turn someone is trying to sell me Nerium! So when a good friend of mine gave me a bottle I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt. I tried it for six weeks and maybe saw some minuscule improvement, but then again, maybe it was wishful thinking. My &amp;#34;friend&amp;#34; invited me to dinner and said she had to stop by a quick meeting for Nerium and asked if I minded coming along. this &amp;#34;quick meeting&amp;#34; was a sales pitch on trying to get people to become brand partners with promises of ipads, Lexus, and even being able to quit your full time job. Nerium seems to be a company much more focused on selling the benefits of distribution than selling the product. I suppose if you have plenty of friends who don&#x27;t mind paying nearly $100 per month whether they need it or not, and who don&#x27;t mind providing an income for their &amp;#34;friends&amp;#34;, this just might be the business opportunity for you! As for the product, you are just as likely to see results from a regular moisturizer, drinking plenty of water and staying out of the sun!</li>
            <li> I found I was putting on the product incorrectly but found a distributor with Nerium and got fantastic results after 30 days because they taught me how to use the product correctly</li>
            <li> Its a scam. It smells funny, makes your face feel tight and dry, and as far as I am concerned I have not seem results- not even minor ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might as well slap some aloe vera jell or vitamin E on my face...its cheaper, natural and diminishes my dark marks and scars, unlike internet hoaxes made public via multilevel marketing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus I do not trust the toxicity of the ingredients. dont buy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what those people used to obtain their amazing results, but it was not this product.  I used it everyday for two months and there was absolutely no change.  Before and after photos were exactly the same.</li>
            <li> 1. Getting kidnapped into sitting through presentations - a friend of my wife invited us to a &amp;#34;housewarming.&amp;#34; We were surrounded by what I thought were her friends and family, but most of them turned out to be Nerium Brand Partners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Products show miraculous results, but they tell you they can&#x27;t make an actual health claim or the FDA will jump down their throats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. There is no scientific consensus on how the product works, or even if it works - it&#x27;s all based on anecdotal evidence&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. You&#x27;re forced to trust your zombie friends and family who are pushing the program on you. Otherwise, you will strain your relationships. But afterwards, if you find that you hate the product, the relationship is strained anyway. Bottom line, if they really cared about their relationships with people, they wouldn&#x27;t push this stuff on others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. The anti-aging claim - really can&#x27;t be proven. We&#x27;re all getting older and will eventually die, but appeal to our vanity and we&#x27;ll buy anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. The get rich quick nature of these schemes. Nerium&#x27;s compensation plan is one of the most complicated ones I&#x27;ve ever seen. The simplest thing is the quick start program. if, in 90 days, you can get 39 Brand Partners (sales rep) in your downline at $500-1000 per Rep, plus a minimum or three preferred customers who automatically buy a minimum of $80 per month, you qualify for a free bottle of product, an iPad, a $500 car payment and up to $2500 in other bonuses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. The pressure to get people signed up quickly. Everything is based on &amp;#34;fast start qualifying&amp;#34; for you and then the people in your downstream. Why take time to decide if you even like the product when you need to get everyone signed up so you can get an iPad and a Lexus?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. The testimonials of a few people how got in at the start of the pyramid. They make $500K or a $1,000,000 a year, but they&#x27;ve got hundreds of people in their downline. There are always a special few who have these huge networks, while the vast majority of people at the bottom make nothing. In case you haven&#x27;t noticed, the top sales directors talk about having been in &amp;#34;relationship marketing&amp;#34; for years. In other words, they have been building a personal downline network and they just keep finding a new pyramid scheme to get into and bring their network with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9. How cheap the product really is when you subtract all the commissions and bonuses for all the layers of people within the MLM organization. You get one free product for every person you bring in. Every person gets one free product for every person they bring in. So, during the fast start qualifying program, one product is being given away for every person who signs on to buy the product. Not counting all the bonuses, the $80 retail price has been cut in half by the free giveaways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10. The incredible number of negative reviews on Amazon about this product. Out of 696 reviews, 282 were 5-stars, while 200 were 1-star. Since we know the sales reps are going to write great reviews about the product they&#x27;re selling, that leaves us with a surprisingly high and troubling number of bad reviews.</li>
            <li> This will crack you all up. I was in Macy&#x27;s department store yesterday purchasing Clinique (now mind you I am in my mid 60&#x27;s but have had cosmetic surgery and look a good 10 to 12 years younger than I am I really don&#x27;t have wrinkles), there were a couple of other ladies waiting in line, after paying for my Clinique and getting my free April give away gift I strolled over the the swim wear since we are going on vacation next month. When this 40&#x27;s something lady walked up to me and said &amp;#34;oh I just saw you over at the Clinique counter buying their stuff, may I give you my card with my name and number, I sell Nerium on line which completely takes away your wrinkles and is the best cream ever made, may I ask how old you are (well I&#x27;m not ashamed, I take care of myself and hey we all get older why not be proud) so I said well how old do you think I am and she said without batting an eye Oh I&#x27;d say around 68!!! OMG I felt sick....it instantly went through my mind that I should make an appointment with my cosmetic surgeon, this was not good.....so I said to her &amp;#34;well, I am actually 54 yrs old (lol) and this look of horror came across her face and she said OMG I am sooo sorry...she then told me that she is 43...and I said really???? I would have guessed mid 50&#x27;s.  So when I got home I looked up this snake oil on line &amp;#34;waste of money ofcourse&amp;#34; then I looked up where her and her husband live. WOW $400,000 mini mansion with 3 car garage...so I&#x27;m sure this Nerium thingie is a side venture for them.  Bottom line is never ever ask someone how old they are....I should have reported her to the Macy&#x27;s customer service for trying to sell her crap in their store.</li>
            <li> I used this product after having it recommended by a friend who distributed it.  It was very expensive and it just kept arriving once a month, even if iIhad not used up the previous bottle.  It left my skin feeling tight and I did not see any improvement.  I switched to a 20% Vitamin C serum and it worked great at a much lower price.  There&#x27;s a lot of corporation hype that comes with this product, like they just found out being nice to each other was a new thing and they are very preachy about it.Big fancy hi-gloss magazine---you can guess why the product is so expensive because it has to fund all that hype</li>
            <li> I chose to rate this five stars because it works for me.  I have been using this product for over six months and people come up to me and tell me how great my skin looks.  I am 61 years old and this product smoothed away wrinkles exactly like the advertisement said.  It won&#x27;t happen over night and it won&#x27;t happen in a month but by two months you will see your skin begin to have less defined pores and fine lines will be gone. By six months deeper winkles smooth out and are less defined.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what will change after using this product for a full year.</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle of nerium ad night cream.  Been using it now for 6 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At night I cleanse my face with neutrogena original bar soap and gently exfoliate with a washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply about three to four pumps to moist skin and spread it over face and neck.  I sometimes apply more water to&lt;br /&gt;my finger tips to even it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the morning I rinse my face and neck with warm water and then pat dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then apply a NON-Acidic moisturizer.  I use dermatologist recommended  CeraVe AM facial moisturizing lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I am going to be outdoors a lot that day I use CeraVe Sunscreen SPF 50 with InVisible Zinc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is about all I do ...  In the morning my skin looks great.  However, by evening I&#x27;ve noticed NO improvement at all.&lt;br /&gt;All the lines and wrinkles are still there same as before I started this routine.  I really expected much more for the price&lt;br /&gt;of this stuff.  I have been religiously following this routine for 6 WEEKS&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SAVE YOUR MONEY  ... If you want to try it then buy from an ex brand partner unloading the stuff on ebay for cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOT WORTH WHAT THEY CHARGE!</li>
            <li> I too purchased nerium through a friend. Her skin looked great!  Unfortunately, it was not the product for me. My skin was bright red and burning almost instantly. Within ten minutes I had to wash it off. I contacted the company. I waited for the call back. I Answered all their questions. I answered the email-  all six of them! I Returned the product and I still await my &amp;#34;guaranteed refund.&amp;#34; Disappointing. They have  sent me the email over and over. Each time my review is getting worse. My first review was good.  I felt it was just not the product for me and I felt they would honor what they say.  Here I am weeks later still trying too obtain my refund. I wish I could retract my first review. As this company does not honor the return policy they advertise with this  product. I would not recommend doing business with them. As wonderful as my friends skin looks ....the run around I have received is not worth it,  I , with good conscious , could not recommend anyone using this product. This has been,  by far, my most disappointing skin/cosmetic purchase ever!</li>
            <li> TOTAL waste of money. Didn&#x27;t even last 10 nights. Didn&#x27;t see a difference either. Never again.</li>
            <li> Great stuff but so expensive!</li>
            <li> I am on my 3rd bottle, and I am seeing some results.  I have had random people at work tell me that I am &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; - so I can only attribute it to the Nerium.</li>
            <li> I like it but an associate for Nerium said that to notice a marked difference, I would have to use this product for a year.  It seems like a long time to wait for results!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a month.  I had such high hopes.  I really wanted it to work.  After using the product for over month, I have noticed NOTHING! I wish that I could give it a good review, but I cannot tell a lie.  The product is expensive and I do not want anyone to be ill-advised.  I purchased both the day and the night cream.  I have used it diligently. Once again, I see no results.  Thank goodness that I did not sign up for auto-ship.  Also, the product smells very offensive.  I would say that it smells a lot like soured laundry.  I had to be honest!  If anyone out there knows of something that REALLY works, please advise!  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift and I continue to get the product on a regular basis. I do not have the worst skin problems in the world nor do I have the best, but I will say thus far using the product for 2 weeks I am seeing results, slow of course but I am seeing results. My pores are not as big as they used to be, the blemishes that I had are slowly going away and I was told a few days ago I have really good skin, granted I do not think so, but who does right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product for those who can actually afford it and be willing to dish out the money to take a chance on it. I really wish people would realize not every product out on the market will work for them. Just because a 100 dollar product works for me does not mean it will work for everyone. I feel people should have realistic expectations when embarking on a product that entails of dishing out some real money &amp;#62;50$.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read reviews from people who are bashing the product and also the company too. I feel it is unfair to come online and while writing a review about the PRODUCT many are bashing the company. When I come here or anyplace else, I want to know a couple of things, how good does it work, how has it worked for others and if others like it as far as reviews go. For some people the chemicals in the face product might cause a break out or other issues, that is a chance everyone takes when  you start something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this product and my suggestion to everyone is, if you can afford it get it, if it does not work out well for you, then move onto something else. It works for me and enough said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also before another buyer asks, no I do not work for the company and I am no way affiliated with this company at all. I am a regular consumer like many other people here. Hard working American.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up for the product.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t worth the money. I&#x27;ve been using this for over a month and there is not much change in my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a month and have seen amazing results.  My skin is firmer and my age spots are disappearing and my skin feels fabulous.  I have stopped getting Botox because my wrinkles have improved so much I would recommend you try this quick and easy solution to your aging skin needs.......</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product now for about 2 months.  I have noticed positive changes, mostly in the décolleté area.</li>
            <li> This is used sparingly and the results are amazing  immediately.  After cleansing your face leave&lt;br /&gt;it a little damp and apply an amount the size of an eraser on the tip of a pencil. Your skin is tighter after the creme drys, pores are closed and wrinkles are diminshed. I have used many, many name brand cremes over the years&lt;br /&gt;and have never experienced the results I have from Nerium! I am never going to purchase any other creme again.</li>
            <li> Well... I have been using this cream every night. It seems that I had some improvement on my  skin.&lt;br /&gt;The good thing about it is that it spreads really well and it dries up really fast.</li>
            <li> the reason I am giving a 1 Star is because of the Branch partner or whatever it&#x27;s called... she made me go to I don&#x27;t know how many times to the meetings with very ridiculous ladies giving us testimony of this heavenly product. The Branch lady kept bugging me and bugging me to a point of harassment to be part of her umbrella of sales people. I had to invest $500.00 to start with them. Even though I had just lost my job, do did my husband, being evicted because the landlord died and his kids lived out-of-state and having health issues, that didn&#x27;t stop her from harassing me. So I decided to purchase one bottle with her promise that she would stop the next order until I was ready....guess what? SHE DIDN&#x27;T!!!! I check my account and they took $94.00 for the next shipment....I immediately called her and with the worse attitude she  says &amp;#34;Well you knew it&#x27;s every 30 days...&amp;#34; I was in shock!! How dare and how dirty of this lady know my situation.... I myself immediately called the customer service and had my account close!!! BAD BAD BAD LADY...SHE&#x27;S IN CORAL SPRINGS, FL......</li>
            <li> HIGHLY REMCOMMEND!!!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this night cream, if you have not used this cream you need to try it .this cream is wonderful</li>
            <li> I think I see some improvements on my deep wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast, sealed in original container</li>
            <li> i opened a new bottle which had been sitting on the shelf for a few months, and it was like brown water when i pumped it the first time - so i shook it up and used it as i had been and when i woke up the next morning i had the worst rash all over my face and under my eyes it looked like i had been scalded with hot water, it was actually painful and i ended up going to the doctor to get help from a steroid cream to heal it, which took all of three weeks.  Now i have 3 unopened bottle on my shelf which Nerium will not even talk about except to say - i am out side of the 30 days trial and they cannot do anything about it!  REALLY!! $240 plus tax out the window!! I used it for a over a year without any problems, however i do not recommend using it if the bottle isn&#x27;t reasonably new, certainly not past 3 or 4 months.  I will not be purchasing this product anymore EVER!!</li>
            <li> I can only give a review for the way it smells and makes me sick to my stomach and my eyes water and I feel like my face was in a glue jar.  I used as directed only ONE TIME, and it had to go back.  Hoping the company refunds and cancels my auto ship without question.  This is on the night cream only.  The day cream does not stink, but can&#x27;t say anything positive or negative about it at this time.  I think, like others have posted, if you hate it, you really hate it!  And I really hate it!</li>
            <li> Everyone raved about it so I thought I would give it a try. It seemed to help a little but nothing miraculous.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say, I became a brand partner a little over a year ago. At first, using the product seemed AMAZING so I said, why not?! Now, first of all if you do get involved it&#x27;s like a total cult mentality-no lie. They&#x27;re a bit nuts with it and if someone tries to sell you that &amp;#34;I love making my own hours and working when I want to so I can be with my family..&amp;#34; it&#x27;s crap! Funny, these people say they have time freedom but want you on calls and events every week on evenings and weekends,...FAMILY TIME! Now to the product. About three months ago it stopped working for me. I mean, dead stop. My crows feet were awful, the frown line and laugh lines deeper, so I asked my friend who signed me up and I got &amp;#34;could have been a bad batch. Open a new bottle.&amp;#34; Still nothing. Went to my medspa and got botox (which actually does work miracles! lol) and the doctor and I discussed it and he told me that in some people it WILL work great for a LIMITED time due to the fact that the oleander tends to cause inflammation. When you&#x27;re inflamed and &amp;#34;puffy&amp;#34; it decreases the appearance of wrinkles. Over time, I built up a tolerance (just as you would to a medication you take daily) and the swelling decreased more and more...showing the wrinkles. 100% honesty, I get better results with the Neutrogena Ageless Intensives line. All their products are great and inexpensive. By the way, all the other ingredients in Nerium are laughable and common and found in EVERY OTC moisturizer. I feel like a bad person for calling out a company I&#x27;ve been affiliated with but I would say don&#x27;t bother and DEF don&#x27;t get roped into the &amp;#34;business&amp;#34;. Oh and if you HATE network marketing &amp;#34;catch phrases&amp;#34; like &amp;#34;you&#x27;re on FIRE&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;You don&#x27;t want to miss this ride!&amp;#34; you will want to beat all of them senseless :)</li>
            <li> Very upset I got the bottle today n it was empty.  What kind of joke is this</li>
            <li> I want Nerium number please.  the first time i got this item i felt it was great thick.  i re-ordered and it was thin out not the same product and I had to pay 84 dollars.  I want my money back or a reaplacement. so you get a product it is good you re-order and it is mostly water how does that work</li>
            <li> I bought both day and night cream from my friend who started selling it recently.  She was raving about it so much that I wanted to believe her and give it a try.  I have two major concern with my face which is brown age spots on both sides of my cheeks plus large pores.  She said it was going to fade my spots and decrease my pore size so I wanted to believe her because she said she&#x27;s been using it for 3 months and she saw great results.  Since I&#x27;ve known her for many years I trusted her.  I also know that what works for one person doesn&#x27;t mean it will work for me.  I&#x27;m also no stranger to other expensive products.  I&#x27;ve tried probably most brands out there that claims to fade dark spots.  Clinique, Lancome, Neutrogena, just to name a few.  I tried so many lines, I lost count.  Anyway, my friend asked me to take before pictures to prove that it&#x27;s working in the same light and same location.  So I did.  These bottles lasted about 6 weeks with no change whatsoever.  It also has an odd smell to it that my family kept complaining to me that they didn&#x27;t like how I smelled at night.  Also, I didn&#x27;t like that they wanted to send me new bottle every month when the bottle lasts 6 weeks.  They won&#x27;t give you the option to change the delivery date.  I canceled the order right away.  I usually don&#x27;t like to do reviews if I have to give it a bad rating but I think I need to voice my opinion because so many women out there will try this product and spend what I spend ($130 for both) and feel like they wasted their money like I do.  I think the only way to get rid of age spot is laser and even that&#x27;s not a guarantee.  I know some of my friends had that treatment and it gets rid of it but it comes back.</li>
            <li> A friend allowed me to use her product for five days.  I didn&#x27;t see any results except maybe my skin felt a little smoother.  Honestly, I can get the same results using a low-medium level retin-A product which costs a lot less.  I fully am aware of multi-level marketing/pyramids and don&#x27;t understand why the American people still buy into this stuff.  I remember a guy by the name of Glen W. Turner who also had a multi-level marketing scheme called &amp;#34;Dare to be Great!&amp;#34; His sub level was a product he sold for skin care called &amp;#34;Mink oil&amp;#34;.  This was a new revolutionary product that would help your skin and make you look younger.  Yea, right!  The only people that got rich were those at the top of the pyramid.  Mr. Turner, btw ended up in jail for defrauding people out of thousands of dollars.  The poor suckers who purchased the skin care products were also duped out of thousands of dollars as well.  The economy is bad, people are out of work, but yet, there are those barricuda&#x27;s out there who still prey on the meek.  Not nice.</li>
            <li> I am not involved in the selling of any Nerium products, I purchased through a rep (not Amazon), I did not sign up for the monthly shipment. Yes it is expensive, but most high end skin care is. Most of my friends spend about the same price on facials, nails, hair, etc. My skin has always been high priority to me and I take very good care of it. I&#x27;m very fair complected, allergic to many things, have dry skin and am a smoker.&lt;br /&gt;I took before pictures, did a free 5 day trial, and noticed a difference already. It doesn&#x27;t smell great but there are MUCH worse products. I used on damp skin (otherwise it doesn&#x27;t spread evenly, gets cakey, wastes product, etc.). Three pumps seems to be ample for face and neck. I noticed a tingle but it subsided after about 20 minutes. Immediately I watched my pores virtually disappear! After several days, the tiny breakouts I get around my mouth/chin (smoker) vanished, my horizontal forehead lines diminished, and the deep frown line shrunk visibly! I have been getting compliments from everyone! It does nothing for my crow&#x27;s feet/under eye bags as you can&#x27;t apply near eyes but I use coffee eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;Two months later, I am still using the same bottle! I use alphahydrox a few times a week to remove dead skin cells. All in all, great product! It seems that the monthly shipment isn&#x27;t the best idea unless someone else in your home likes it too. Skin care is different for everyone. If you don&#x27;t like something, it is probably not compatible with your skin/body chemistry.</li>
            <li> I used the product religiously for 5 months and the only difference I noticed was that my skin was a bit softer.  I can accomplish that same result with diligent moisturizing using a far less expensive product that I can purchase at the drug store.  I even have before and after pictures to compare the results, or lack thereof I should say.  Perhaps it works for some folks but not me.</li>
            <li> Ive noticed an improvement in my skin..especially helping smooth out fine wrinkles. I do find it irritates my eyes a bit so i dont put it too close to my eyes. Also it has firmed my neck and upper chest. Im on my third month and will keep using it.</li>
            <li> Meh this stuff doesn&#x27;t seem too bad to me. I&#x27;m surprised after reading the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I am only 26 and I&#x27;m using this to PREVENT wrinkles. Plus my mom gave me a bottle so I never paid for it(she must have gotten sucked in by a sales rep lol). I&#x27;m floored by how expensive it is though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would say I like it. The smell was very interesting to me. I used to make these green healthy shakes where I blend celery spinach carrots and kale and I swear to god,  the shake smells EXACTLY like this product.  So it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  In fact I actually prefer the earthy smell to the other perfumy smelling lotions I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the way it feels on my face.  I feels light and tightening.  Lately I&#x27;ve had people at work tell me my face looks brighter.  I have quite a bit of acne scaring and it didn&#x27;t seen to irritate it nor did it make me break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am nervous after reading the reviews about customers&#x27;s eyes becoming droopy or dried out though.  Hasn&#x27;t happened to me yet.  So I&#x27;ve been putting on my regular estee lauder eye serum just in case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall pretty good product.  It sounds like the people selling the product are over exaggerating quite a bit.  If they just stop promising people impossible results maybe people would be happier.  Its not worth the price though. 3.5/5</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really funny that people like sillygirl asks a &amp;#34;doctor&amp;#34; who does &amp;#34;botox&amp;#34; for advice on a natural cream. What is he going to say? Hahaha... Nothing good, of course. Silly girls is a nice alias... Why don&#x27;t you ask him how poisoning botox is? Why don&#x27;t you ask him what botox does to your system and what will happen after a while? Do you think he&#x27;s gonna tell you? Watch this video. https://youtu.be/d1EIJARO4Vc Get informed before you write silly stuff. It looks really bad.</li>
            <li> Works well on my skin!</li>
            <li> After a month I can see the difference in my skin. I knew to take before pictures and watch for realists.  My skin perky and glowing. The lines around my mouth and forehead are diminishing. I will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> wife wouldnt be without it</li>
            <li> Really does work. I dont know about the \\&quot;age defying\\&quot; part but if you have achne it clears you RIGHT UP!</li>
            <li> Nerium is only legally available through a representative in the Nerium Company.  I don&#x27;t see how you can sell this so cheap when the price to get it as a rep is $80.00.  Unless it has been tampered with or stolen.  The people selling on here will get their businesses taken away when found out.  If they don&#x27;t believe me, call the company.  I DID.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tested a variety of night creams and this one is one of my favorites. After using for a couple weeks, I can see a noticeable difference in my skin. It helps decrease the size of my pores as well as smooths wrinkles. If you get a lot of sun exposure, this is a must.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few methodologies that people employ to protect themselves from aging. A night-cream like this is essential in combination with a [[ASIN:B00I0N24TY Vitamin C Serum such as this one]] to maintain soft and even textures across the complete surface of your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many people say to NOT use an acidic moisturizer with this product, but it is simply not true. The key is to apply the Vitamin C moisturizer in the morning after you wash your face, and ONLY apply Nerium during the evening before you sleep. Hyaluronic Acid (although it sounds intense) is a proven agent in decreasing the lines and texture of your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summation, this I sa good product for night-time use. Protect yourself from aging with this powerful cream. It actually does something, unlike many other products out there that claim similar results. Plus, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad like some others. The texture is not too bad either, just like putting on makeup. Try this nightly for a couple weeks in combination with a Vitamin C Serum and I&#x27;m pretty sure you won&#x27;t go back!</li>
            <li> This is not the same cream as the last two bottles?  It is lighter in color and it does not dry the same.&lt;br /&gt;No results with this cream.  Could this be a fake?</li>
            <li> I was given a trial sample from a friend who is a distributor. It is day 10 and my skin is burning. My face feels like it has a very bad sunburn. It is very dry and has cracks around my nose. I also noticed that after a couple days my face, particularly around my eyes, appeared puffy. This has worsened greatly. My eyes are far worse than prior to using Nerium AD. I have meticulously taken care of my skin since I was 14 years old, I am now 52. I am very careful about what products I will use on my skin. I am told my skin is beautiful and timeless. I tried it since the friend who is a distributor is also a distributor for another skin care company that I purchase from.  When I mentioned the burning I too was told to use more water. I will not be using this cream ever again. Wonder what kind of damage has already been done to my skin. :(</li>
            <li> I had no idea that Amazon was selling this product - I came to see it that was indeed true. As far as I know, Nerium is sold through distributors. Anyhow, I have used this product since Sept. 2012. I am 44 years old, four kids, and tortured my skin in AZ (childhood) and in Florida for 12 years. I can honestly say that this product works, so much so that I decided to get into the business because it did what it said it would do. My biggest issue were sun spots (some from pregnancy)...all gone except for one stubborn one. I know that some people said that they did not like the smell. I actually do not mind it at all...it goes away very quickly after applying. I TRY to use only natural products so after researching, I knew I had to try it. DO NOT BELIEVE everything you hear about the OLEANDER plant. I met the guy that grows this stuff. YES, if you EAT it, it is poisonous. NOT on the skin.... A LOT of research has gone into this. If you want some before and after pics or more info, just let me know. I hate to see a wonderful product not being given the credit it is due.</li>
            <li> IT DIDN&#x27; FILL MY EXPECTATIONS. I&#x27;VE SEEN NO CHANGE AT ALL. I DON&#x27;T THINK I WOULD BUY IT ANYMORE IN THE FUTURE.</li>
            <li> Spent about 10 years trying to get rid of my Rosacea &amp; sun damage. Within first month of using Nerium 80% of my issues cleared up. I have been using a year now &amp; all my issues are pretty much gone. Got rid of the wrinkles on my forehead too! I spent thousands of dollars on aestheticians trying to get my skin looking good but Nerium ended fixing it!</li>
            <li> Smell is a little strong,have not used long enough to determine results. May purchase again to see results of product</li>
            <li> I started using the &amp;#34;magic potion&amp;#34; about 4 months ago. Wow! I have been in the skin care industry for 14 yrs. I have tried so many products, professional products. I can say as a licensed professional, I have never had results like this! I can also say that it has replaced my high priced clutter of a 20min. bedtime and morning routine. Who has time to put on 5-7 products before bed and before the daily grind?? I certainly don&#x27;t. I also am a purist, I have searched for products that are organic, give back and have results...That is a hard combo to find! I highly recommend this product! Results, price point, simplicity and the fact that they give back to solutions for all these terrible diseases out there! I am a very happy customer!! I can&#x27;t wait to see what else they come out with.&lt;br /&gt;Note~I did not buy my product through amazon. I felt more comfortable buying it straight from the source.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have tried everything to cure my red face (roscea) and I have seen a huge difference in my face just after one week of using this product. Before my face was red and bumpy now it is a normal color and smooth. I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> To early to tell if this item is working or not. I have a cousin who says it has been a good for her.</li>
            <li> w/in the first 2 weeks, i had this alien type blackhead breakout... i was patient, becuase when starting Other skin care lines similar things have happened...but i waited it out.&lt;br /&gt;what&#x27;s happened to me is different that what&#x27;s happended to my husband and sister in law..we all so super postivive changes, just in different ways.&lt;br /&gt;i had acne scars.  they are gone.  the skin around my jaw line tightened, my neck did, and my decollette.  none of this was really promised so i was woW pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;my husbands deep creases in his forward went away, and an overall brightness to his skin appeared.  another WoW&lt;br /&gt;my sister in law had these huge bags under her eyes.?  gone...&lt;br /&gt;now my 21 year old...doesn&#x27;t use it consistently.  When i make her, ie smear it on her face every night, her acne scars* also have diminished in color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*acne scars.  not deep pit scars, the redness that occurs on very fair skinned people that doesn&#x27;t seem to go away....&lt;br /&gt;OH and skin pigmintation.?  a plus.&lt;br /&gt;what am i missing.?  i feel i&#x27;m missing out on the 25 minutes of playing over the sink with various products.  i kind of liked my LONG expensive routine..this has become so simple..it sounds Silly, but now what will i play with.!!&lt;br /&gt;120 for 2 bottles.?  not that much.  i get it every month because i use tons of it...i was spending 1,000 on the LINE of epicureaon, 110 on a small bottle of Osmosis, pericone. )sp?) overrated.&lt;br /&gt;and i know it&#x27;s an mlm company...so is arbonne. i kinda really liked them until they became too complicated to keep up with...&lt;br /&gt;enjoy.  maybe it&#x27;s not for everyone, but not everyone has had a lot of experience, some peoples versions of what a cream should do are Way Out There..hey it&#x27;s not botox.  it&#x27;s not a filler. or a face lift, or lasor.  its a cream.  and as far as scars.?  it did what lasor would do with no down time... so nay sayers.  sorry.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for about 8 months now and it truly has completely changed my skin. The way brand partners sell their product is not a scam to me because I love this product and it works with my skin incredibly. I do not sell but I recommend it to anyone even slightly interested. You honestly will never know if you are too skeptical. I have tried EVERYTHING to help my skin texture and discoloration and it has corrected both.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, I&#x27;ve read some reviewers stated they did not think it improved their skin in anyway, I was glad that was not the case with me. I have extremely dry skin, so I do use a moisturizer over this product. My skin has lost the uneveness, lines are greatly improved. I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> Nerium was given to me be a friend to try and endorse.  In less than 24 hrs, I was covered in bumps, lumps, hives and red blotches for two weeks! I became extremely concerned when I felt my lips begin to swell.  Anyone who tells you Nerium is safe is a dishonest person looking for a sale or completely uneducated about Nerium and the real side effects. This is a poison that is aborbed into our systems. I feel foolish for not educating myself first, before putting it on my face! Now I feel a responsibility to tell others to stay away!</li>
            <li> Used and product is defected. Safety seal was missing on the box. Color of the cream is dark brown and it should be beige.</li>
            <li> This product is extraordinary. I was skeptical at first. I have noticed a huge change in my skin, with tone, texture, uneven color, pigment and fine lines which are less noticable. It also smells amazing! :)  My Mom is using it now and is hooked!  It took about 10 days to see changes, and I continue to notice improvements.</li>
            <li> I use less than is recommended: only one pump which I smooth on with water.  It&#x27;s too hot to wear otherwise ... at least in L.A.  My M.D. friend said to take a break from it every so often so I don&#x27;t build up an immunity, so I am using the hot weather as my time to lay off for a few weeks.  I do see results!  Yay!</li>
            <li> I really like it, however it does smell a little like hay but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.  My skin looks good.</li>
            <li> Nerium delivers a night cream that leaves your face looking good when you wake up. But that&#x27;s about it. After a few morning hours you&#x27;ll notice the imperfections are back!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try Nerium at first.  A friend suggested it (she was working for the company) so I figured she wouldn&#x27;t steer me wrong.  It did nothing for me!!  I got a few pimples at first (they do say that can happen) but they went away after about 2 weeks.  I saw no other changes in my skin.  Not worth the high price tag!  Save your money.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to buy from amazon for about 60.00, Used the product for about two months, nothing! I also had the itchy skin and redness. Thank goodness did not sign up for the auto ship thing. What a nightmare. And the smell is awful. Smells like really dirty feet. I hate the pyramid stuff too. I used to sale Shakley and Amway products. But I love the products and they sale and do what they advertise. The companies are not pushy either. One thing about the pyramid sales, the people at the top make really good money, but the bottom feeders have to make the sales to keep everyone happy. Not for me. I have found several other products that work great. Nothing gets totally rid of wrinkles, unless you have surgery, sorry that&#x27;s just a reality. Also noticed on some of the pictures of before and after, the people after, have their necks stretched up higher than the before pictures, would account for the neck looking better. Guess a little air brushing would work too. Glad for the ones that like it, but not for me.</li>
            <li> my wife loves rhis product</li>
            <li> I had an allergic reaction after about 2 weeks. My face became red and hot to the touch and swollen. By the time I called to cancel the auto ship, in the 3rd week, the next months shipment was already &amp;#34;in the shoot&amp;#34; and they said they could not stop it, even tho I called and emailed to cancel prior to it even being &amp;#34;shipped&amp;#34;. They charged me shipping to send it back. They did not offer me money back for the $120 I spent. But I did successfully cancel my auto ship going forward.&lt;br /&gt;What really upset me the most, is that not one person I talked to or emailed expressed any comment or concern about my allergic reaction, or even what kind of allergic reaction I had. If it was my company I would want to know. So since I couldn&#x27;t get my money back, I gave it to a friend. She did not have a reaction, but stopped using it after two weeks because it dried out her skin terribly. She said, and I quote &amp;#34; i look ten years older.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Only using it for a couple of weeks now and have already noticed a difference. My skin is smoother and brighter looking. A friend asked what I was using as she noticed the change too. May up my rating to 5 stars at the end of a month.</li>
            <li> I want to start by saying that I have never left a review on any websites before. However, after reading the reviews (and being very surprised by the myriad of bad reviews listed), I felt compelled to leave my two cents worth.    I first learned about Nerium because I noticed that my 75 year old Mother was looking more beautiful every time I saw her (which is about once or twice a month). I wasn&#x27;t sure why, but she kept looking younger and younger. I secretly suspected that she was getting botox, but I also know that my Mom is deathly afraid of anything to do with needles.    Finally, I had to ask about her skin. My Mother has always been very beautiful (think Sophia Loren), but the years have taken their toll. My Mom explained that she has been using Nerium for about 9 months now (perhaps the results that she has seen have occurred over time, and with consistent use). I am so happy that I can again see how beautiful my Mom looks, and no one can believe her age!    Believe me, I am not a \\&quot;plant\\&quot; or paid \\&quot;opinion giver,\\&quot; in fact, I love her results so much that I got online today to find out more about the product that she is using. I myself am 53 years old and a former model who is looking for a \\&quot;needleless\\&quot; way to preserve my face and skin, and I can&#x27;t wait to use this product!!!! I am looking forward to the same great results that she has received.</li>
            <li> I love this nerium products.</li>
            <li> The jury is still out on performance,but good seller!!!</li>
            <li> Smells funny? YES Weird texture? SORT OF Does it work? YES!!!</li>
            <li> When I received my purchase it had spilled out all in the container and did not even have a tube on the pump. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was convinced by a friend to try the product for 30 days and even tho I thought it was to expensive my husband and I decided to give a shot. After 30 days, money wasted, bad smell in our face every night we realized that we didn&#x27;t have a single change in our skin that could show the benefit of the product. When I got the catalog my friend gave me with the before and after pictures my husband started to show me how those pictures were photoshop work instead of product result. Some pictures they even changed the lips, nose and ear of the person in the attempt to make her look young. I felt  very stupid in believe in what I saw and decide to use the product.</li>
            <li> I love the results I&#x27;m seeing!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a year. At first I did see changes in my skin, got rid of a lot of Sun damage. But doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything for me now. Won&#x27;t be continuing it&#x27;s use..way too pricey....</li>
            <li> There is no way nerium alone gave these results. In fact most of neriums b4 and after pics look like plastic surgery b4 and after... If you think a cream gave these results you are crazy. (Or a brain washed brand partner). I used the product for 30 days with no results. None. I hoped to at least see a more even complexion with the insane results nerium has posted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*this is not my photo its from neriums website*.</li>
            <li> AMAZING, this really works, and I have tried everything...</li>
            <li> The product is excellent. The results take 2 months. The skin is smoth, the lines less deep, not sags under the eyes. Almost desapear lines in the lips and the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;The best product I have tryed in my life.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t&#x27; know if my skin is firmer it look nicer and I have had some compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li> My daughter introduced this product to me and I am amazed at the results. Thank you</li>
            <li> It worked very good on me</li>
            <li> I think the stuff really works... for sure I noticed smaller pores, and just younger looking skin.</li>
            <li> I thought I was going to die after using this one time , couldn&#x27;t breath thought I was going to throw up , I was like putting and egg on your face , I took it off as fast as I could get it on , made my shin very dry , didn&#x27;t like it at all !!!</li>
            <li> Nerium Ad I guess would be great for some people but I didn&#x27;t see any changes in my face after using it about two weeks.I have a friend who has been using it and I see a big difference.</li>
            <li> I have only had it for one month and have seen no significant improvement.  Perhaps it takes longer than one month to see results, especially if you are over 60 years old. I use it every night.  It feels great and smells wonderful, I just want it to help my wrinkles go away.  I will try it for another month and see what the results will bring.  After that I will go back to my regular routine and not spend so much money.</li>
            <li> I was told by a friend that is was a miracle cream, excuse me, but that&#x27;s a crock !  This cream does not work. I have tried it for 2 months and cannot tell one bit of difference  My friend said, I guess it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone.  Do not buy Nerium , it does not work.  Waste of money</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping!! Very good price!</li>
            <li> It works great.  I use it every night and you can really tell the difference after a week or so.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nerium AD night and day since Thanksgiving. I am beginning to see a little difference in my wrinkles around eyes and lips. I will continue to use Nerium. I rate it to be a 5 star product.</li>
            <li> Right now all I can say is I don&#x27;t know. My Sisters love it one is selling it. They gave me a free bottle and I  used it 6 months ago. I didn&#x27;t notice any results. Now thou my face is getting more wrinkles and they swear it helps them so I am going to try it again. I can&#x27;t afford no 100.00 shipment a month ( this is pushy, but other companies do this also). Don&#x27;t want to deal with that. So I went on amazon and bought Night and Day cream 105.00 including shipping no monthly shipment. I order through my amazon account so hopefully no scamming. I will see what happens. They do say everyone has different skin. New skin products will/can make skin red. It is sad to hear how uncaring, scamming(ignoring cancellations), not doing returns the Co. has been according to these reviews. Report them to their attorney general of their state and better business bureau. I will write in months to see if I have improved looks.</li>
            <li> I was the biggest cynic regarding Nerium and had to be forced by my daughter to even try it. At age 69 I was seeing the deep jowly wrinkles I remembered so well on the faces or my my aunts and grandmother. After one month of use I had to give in and admit that it works. What that means, however, it that you can get up to about 30% improvement. Nothing in a department store can come close to that result. And, you have to follow the instructions (I learned this the hard way, too). You must use at least 4 healthy pumps on wet skin before bed. If it lasts you 6 weeks, you&#x27;re not using it correctly and your results won&#x27;t be as dramatic.&lt;br /&gt;Of course, it is not for everyone. I guess some people would rather complain about the non-perfumy smell then actually give it a real try. And I&#x27;m sure there might be people whose skin it legitimately irritates. What I have seen is that realistic people are very pleased with the product. It&#x27;s hard to describe how someone with pasty dead looking skin (and I&#x27;m not going to name her) now has skin that glows and makes her look much more alive. Just be careful whose advise you seek in anything you&#x27;re buying.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it&#x27;s the miracle in the bottle it claims to be but I definitely have a smoother and less visible pores.</li>
            <li> I am 20 years old and see results of redness in my face disappearing and pores on my nose shrinking. Beware you can not get a 30 day money back guarantee ordering through amazon.. only through a distributor for example you can at davidsarver.nerium.com</li>
            <li> Seems to visible make a difference on my face and neck.  Added a smoother appearance on my face and made the shade on my face a more even tone.</li>
            <li> I LOVE NERIUM! I have only used it since the beginning of December. Within 3 weeks, by Christmas, my forehead wrinkles were disappearing. My skin was firmer and today my skin tone and uneven skin texture is evening out. My face hasn&#x27;t been this smooth since I was pre-pubescent. My friend introduced me to the night cream. I was totally skeptical at first, but I love it so much. I&#x27;ve even considered becoming one of their Brand Partners because this product is so amazing. I know it&#x27;s not for everyone, but I really am surprised at most of the negative reviews because I&#x27;ve never had a skin product actually work and do what it says it does. And $80 a bottle isn&#x27;t that much considering what I&#x27;ve paid for other skin care &amp;#34;systems&amp;#34; that didn&#x27;t work this well. You&#x27;ll never know until you try.</li>
            <li> This product is so good!</li>
            <li> Excellent product!! Have and will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nerium AD night cream for about 3 years. I have dry, sensitive skin.  I&#x27;m proud to say I have minimal fine line wrinkles at the corner of my left eye and none on my right. (Maybe this could be because i sleep mostly on my left side?) I think my skin looks great after almost 69 years.&lt;br /&gt;My nightly routine is to remove my face make-up by massaging Albolene Ointment all over my face, using upward strokes, then some to my eyelids. Then I use a cotton-round moistened with warm water to remove the make-up first, then the eye make-up. I then rinse with a wash cloth and warm water. Then pat dry.&lt;br /&gt;Then I have been using one squirt of Nerium AD, moistened with a little water and massaging it into my face, neck, and upper chest.&lt;br /&gt;In the morning, I have no routine other than to just apply my make-up.&lt;br /&gt;I had a couple tan-colored discolorations on my face, which are completely gone!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had no sensitivity problems; I have no desire to try any other product (and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried a lot).&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks a lot better than some people I know who are in their early 40&#x27;s!&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> When I received this item the bottle was empty. No cream in the container--no nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Had a hard time returning it</li>
            <li> I heard great things about this night cream &amp; just started using it.  We will see in time if it helps any.</li>
            <li> After two weeks of use, I woke up with my face covered in hives!  Hives on top of hives!  This is not &amp;#34;impurities being pulled from my skin&amp;#34;  It is a full on allergic reaction.  Such a pyramid scam.  Beware!</li>
            <li> Still waiting for results after 1 month of use .maybe a small amount of improvement on a scale of 1 to 10 . I give it a 4 . And considering the expense and the fact that&#x27;s its not permanent . I may become a dis believer</li>
            <li> My favorite facial product! :)</li>
            <li> This stuff SERIOUSLY works, I still think the price is way too high. But my skin looks SO much better and it even feels better. Definitely shrank my pores too. It did break my face out a few times, because I was using it with my prescribed acne medicine. But if you want confidence then I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> prompt response product exactly what specified.</li>
            <li> Immediately started with chest and back pains.  I used on my face, neck and upper chest.  Admitted to hospital about 3 weeks into it.  Do your research ..Google Nerium AD heart</li>
            <li> Tried this product for over a month and saw no improvement. It made my skin dry, almost making wrinkles seem worse.  Can not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This was the second purchase of Neruim AD and I did notice a difference, mostly the crapeiness on my throat. However, I do not believe that it is a $100.00 per month difference.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my neck for a little over a year now.  I have seen a drastic difference.  It has tightened up the skin and I would highly&lt;br /&gt;recommend it.  Be sure to use it every night no matter what because it will take awhile to work, but the end results are great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nerium for several months and love it, it truly works wonders!</li>
            <li> Foul odor, texture and color differ with every pump.  Wondering if it is old.</li>
            <li> i  bought this product because of the reviews listed.  I think it has helped my skin texture but i don&#x27;t know for sure about the wrinkles.  I&#x27;ll buy it for a little longer and see</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t help but wonder if the negative reviews did the following:    1) use the night cream with a damp face?  2) take makeup free photos before and after 30, 60, 90 days?    Also, for the gal who stated she was told it was her tough luck, I call uh..wrong.  There is a 30-day money back guarantee.    I had a lump on my neck that I was told was benign, for 2 1/2 years.  After just 3 weeks of using Nerium, it was gone.  My swollen eye lids, reduce dramatically within 30 days.  (I knew only because of the before and after pictures because the change is slow.)    Also, informational - the 5-day trial is to see if you&#x27;re allergic, nothing else.  While some do see changes in 5 days, that is not what your trial is for.    Please make sure you have the correct instructions/information prior to posting a review.    [...]    [...]</li>
            <li> I have bought this product from the company and have enjoyed it.  When I bought it from you the bottle won&#x27;t pump, it gets hard and it seems like it is old. I don&#x27;t know where you got it but I will go back to buying it from the company because the product is great!</li>
            <li> I have serious allergic reaction. My face and neck swelled like crazy and having trouble breathing. Stay away from scam. I just used it for 3 days. I am actually writing this comment from hospital. It is important for people to know that this product can be life threatening.</li>
            <li> It was just what I expected.</li>
            <li> I am truly sorry to have to post this kind of negativity which is surely going to grow into a massive headache for Nerium International.  I became a Brand Partner back in June of last year at the urging of a good friend of mine, who lives in California.  I live on the East  coast, and this is part of the reason the Nerium business did not work out as I had hoped for.  I did, however, give it my best shot for 6 months before deciding that I had better stop the bleeding (spending over $100 a month on my product and website, etc.).I reviewed the procedures for returning product and accessories, including my starter kit, and proceeded as is spelled out on the Nerium website.  I secured all required Return Merchandise Authorization numbers from their Customer Service advisor and packaged my kit along with three bottles of Night Cream and returned these to Nerium international in Bedford, Texas.  I have waited patiently, and assumed all is being processed accordingly, but I decided to call them to get a status update.  I was told that there will be a refund for only 2 of the three bottles of product, since one of them was a &amp;#34;Give Back&amp;#34; item, and therefore not eligible for refund.  That&#x27;s a slick move.... but I&#x27;m willing to swallow that little bit of BS.  What I&#x27;m not willing to accept is being told that, because my original UNUSED Brand Partner kit had the plastic shrink-wrap removed, none of this would be eligible for any refund!  Any BP who receives their kit in the mail is surely going to open these items and look at them, especially since they&#x27;re excited about going into business!  So, here they&#x27;re telling me that the $500 I invested is a total loss, non-refundable, and not worthy of respect within their company guidelines.&lt;br /&gt; I still believe in the Nerium International program, and certainly appreciate the products they market, but I CAN NOT BELIEVE THEY WOULD HAVE THE NERVE TO DENY MY CLAIM FOR A REIMBURSEMENT FOR ITEMS I NEVER USED, AND RETURNED UNSCATHED AND IN PERFECT ORDER!&lt;br /&gt; My up-line, for whom I have the greatest respect and affection, is surely embarrassed by this, I&#x27;m sure, and since she is relatively elevated within the organization&#x27;s ranks, I&#x27;m sure this will cause some reverberating action at the highest levels.  I hate that this is going in a direction I can only imagine will cause many grief and disappointment, but so be it, if they continue to hold to their current decision regarding my refund.&lt;br /&gt; I have all but begged them to please give this issue some serious thought, as I am sure they will want to avoid further escalation on my part.  And, just in case they feel that this is &amp;#34;just another one of those failures out there - he won&#x27;t do anything...&amp;#34; - think again.  I&#x27;m a 66-year-old professional Customer Service Manager with a major US corporation.  I know what it means to fail to meet/exceed a customer&#x27;s expectations, and I know what HEAT is all about.  I don&#x27;t want this.They don&#x27;t want this. I eagerly await a civil response to my efforts to recoup my investment, and hope they can find a way to do the right thing.</li>
            <li> I have bought this from a person who sells it not on amazon and it worked great, this one not so much. I would only buy from someone who can guarantee it.</li>
            <li> This was a total disappointment, the bottle was almost empty, it only lasted a week an a half and did not see any difference on my skin, sorry!</li>
            <li> It did not meet my expectations. Although the box was sealed, it does not smell or feel like the nerium that I purchased from another retailer. It seems to be old and the bottle does not appear to be full. I will NOT purchase from this retailer again.</li>
            <li> I have several friends who are brand partners with Nerium, so I decided to try it. After using it for a couple weeks, I did not see a difference. The only thing I noticed was my skin felt sticky and tight upon application and my husband was so grossed out by the smell that he begged me to stop using it.    My mom then decided she wanted to try Nerium so I gave her my 1/2 used bottle and another full size bottle! On the 5th day of using this product she woke up to a terrible site.....her eyes were swollen shut and her whole entire face was swollen. It honestly looked like she had been injected with red jelly all over her face! Her face was swollen, her eyes were swollen shut, there were watery bags underneath her eyes and her skin was bright red!  My dad was so scared he took her to the emergency room and they had to inject her with prednisone!! They then sent her home with a PX of prednisone and told her to put nothing on her skin until her skin was cleared up! A week later she was back to her normal self!!    I&#x27;m not sure if this was a freak reaction, however this was our experience with this so called miracle serum!!! My advice....do your research before trying this! And ps. Brand partners will give you a free bottle to try so do that and save your money!!</li>
            <li> I am hooked on this stuff.  My aesthetition started me on it, and I continued through Amazon, because I could get it for less.  Reduces wrinkles and smoothes skin wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Beware my old customers are having rash breakouts and burning of their skin and I myself saw a difference but then started getting skin burns after long periods of use and remember this is  mlm  so most of or all reviews you see are from brand partners its the way the game works there is no honesty in this industry along with over priced products and promotion.Two well known skin doctors in beverly hills that a customer of mine met wtih explained that there is no research of this product and that oleander is poisonous and coming in contact in any way over period of time can cause skin reactions and swelling and bad reactions and was experimented with killing cancer cells and how can it do the opposite ? Makes no sense and after they looked further into the product the stated its no more than vitamins and anti-oxidants and lotion that is overpriced, that&#x27;s all part of the mlm industry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The driving mechanism\\&quot; of MLMs. How they are intrinsically unstable, guaranteed by design to oversaturate the market with no one noticing.You should look at why MLMs can never equalize into profitability the way companies in the real world can, so that the result will be that the organization as a whole cannot, even in theory, be profitable. When this inevitable destiny occurs, the only money to be made is not from the product or service but from the losses of people lower down in the organization.</li>
            <li> After reading the ingredients I was really afraid to use this product wished I could of returned it but could not.......was totally not very happy with return policy.</li>
            <li> Bought a bottle and used it about 2 weeks. Didn&#x27;t see much change. Stinky and very drying  haven&#x27;t used it for 2 weeks and whatever improvement there was is gone. Too expensive for what you get.</li>
            <li> The bottle arrived empty or the dispenser was broken.  This was very disappointing when you consider the cost of the product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for one week.  I have heard great things about it from a friend who sells it.  The first couple of days my complexion seemed a little &amp;#34;brighter&amp;#34;.  I thought, &amp;#34;great, this product actually might really make a difference.&amp;#34;.  Day three, my skin seemed a little dry.  Day four I had a bunch of tiny bumps along my cheek bones.  I kept using it in hopes that maybe junk was just getting extracted from my pours.  LOL!  Day five, six, seven, small bumps are full on rash all over my cheeks.  I used this as directed (wetting face before applying the night cream).  I also did not use any other products other than my usual face wash along with it.  I also don&#x27;t wear makeup, so it was definitely the Nerium that my skin reacted to.&lt;br /&gt;The product smells like rotten bananas.  I&#x27;m pretty sure the rash is some sort of fungal rash.  Now trying products to get rid of the rash and switching back to my usual Neutrogena products.  Just because it&#x27;s expensive does not mean it works!  Returning it today for my full refund.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I see any change on my neck</li>
            <li> Overprice and it did not deliver any of the claims, I will never purchase again. :-(</li>
            <li> Using it was interesting.  I found a zero return on the promises given.  Trust me, I WANTED results.  Perhaps it works for others, but having used it 2 full months, correctly, no results were visible what-so-ever.</li>
            <li> This really works! Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> so far seeing a little improvement to my complextion.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I am a Mary Kay user and I do love MK too. Neurium is the product that tightened my sagging neck skin and my jowl line. It&#x27;s taken years off my face. I know it is too strong for some people and may cause a rash but I have very delicate skin and have had no bad side effects. I think it&#x27;s worth a try for anyone. Yes, it is a multi-level marketing company but I don&#x27;t bother to do that and am content to enjoy the effects of this great product.</li>
            <li> I am using this product for almost 3 wks.and i am not relly understand  the hype about this cream. For sure iis not worthy the 157 $, Product for sure do not deliver what promised by seller.</li>
            <li> I felt that it might have been an old bottle because it didnt feel like the one I had used from a local dealer.</li>
            <li> ordered this one to replace the one that had arrived either empty or non functioning pump. This one was an oily brown cream...I have always liked the product, am confused as to why I got two defective products.  Already threw away the box so I can not return it.</li>
            <li> This stuff stinks made my skin red and irritated  for days .So sick of these multilevel get rich quickly schemes</li>
            <li> Great product, I really do see a difference in my skin. I have very oily skin, it has helped soooo much. This is going to always be a part of my beauty routine.</li>
            <li> I love this product ..makes your skin feel wonderful .only used it for a week so far but I think it will provide the results it advertised</li>
            <li> have used nerium for 3 months and have seen a marked difference in my skin! it&#x27;s easier to get it from amazon than signing up to have it sent monthly and taken out of your bank acct. or credit card because i use less than the recommended amount.</li>
            <li> Nerium is the new best friend I have. (smile) Our 28 year old daughter started using it back in September 2012. In about 2 weeks, I began to notice her face was no longer breaking out and her pores were tighter. And for a young person it was surprising how it seemed as though she had had Botox!!!!! Simply amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t resist. I started using it the first week of January. The last week of January I went to a meeting and one of my friends said, \\&quot;your face is so light and it&#x27;s as if you are glowing.\\&quot; LOL I told her about Nerium and she and three of my friends are SOLD!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**** Remember to have your face a little wet when you apply it. Use about 2-4 pumps (depends on how fast you want to see results), and with both hands apply it with a sweeping motion from the bottom of the neck all the way up to the hairline.&lt;br /&gt;TIP: It is completely normal for your face to feel very tight once the cream has dried. Only put this on at night....no other products at all. Your face will feel like baby skin. And everyday my skin is getting prettier and better.</li>
            <li> I had used this before and could see such a difference in the texture of my skin, but decided I could not afford it on a regular basis, so didn&#x27;r reorder. I started seeing my skin going back to the fine lines etc, so I found it on Amazon a little cheaper, and will probably not stop using it ever again. I am 72 and my skin does not reflect my age.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for about three weeks and can see a slight change. you can feel it working right after you put it on.</li>
            <li> I have used it for about 90 days and see no noticeable changes. I gave it a chance. Not worth the money</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin with a lot of &amp;#34;pinkness&amp;#34; to it and unevenness. A brand partner let me try some for 5 days and I could tell a difference after using it one night! I have been using it for about 6 mos and I really like it and can tell a difference , mostly it has minimized the redness and made my skin more even. It is pricey, and I feel like I have kind of plateaued but I love the day cream, it is a nice moisturizer without being greasy and it helps even out my skin tone, I have tried lots of skin care products and this has actually made a noticeable difference. But like all other things, it probably doesn&#x27;t help everyone, but I would highly recommend trying it for yourself. I am 42.</li>
            <li> I tried this product just to prove my friend wrong and within 7 days I had tremendous results. Not just in wrinkles around the eyes but also the texture of my skin, dark spots faded. I was shocked. It made a beliver out of me. I would recommend this product to anyone with skin.</li>
            <li> product does seem to smooth skin.  I dampen face &amp; hands first with water, then one pump of product spreads on face &amp; neck, remaining on hands and arms.  I use at night.  I add my moisturizer &amp; eye cream on top after 20 minutes.  Plan to order another bottle - it&#x27;s lasted a couple months.</li>
            <li> I like the product and the way it makes my skin feel. This is actually my second bottle of the product. I only gave it a four star rating because it hasn&#x27;t lessened my wrinkles as much as I thought it would  BUT it has tightened up my jaw line and my neck. Also, the trick to using it - make sure your skin is still damp when you put it on or it won&#x27;t work at all except to dry out your skin. My first bottle lasted three months!</li>
            <li> I used this product only a couple of times and now is empty. .Not worth the money for how much is in it or either i got a half empty bottle</li>
            <li> It has done more then any name brands I have ever bought over the counter. I have been useing it for almost 3 months. I am still are hoping for even better results, we will see.</li>
            <li> I gave this a 7 day trial and ended up buying it to test it out longer.  I am disappointed.  I only use 1 pump each night and it has only been three weeks and I am nearly out. The product is supposed to last a month on four pumps. Anyway, that aside I just don&#x27;t see any real results. I don&#x27;t dislike the smell although it is unusual. It doesn&#x27;t feel very heavy either. I don&#x27;t encourage anyone to buy this product without giving it a seven day try. And then...well,  I don&#x27;t really encourage anyone to expect results from it.</li>
            <li> This by far is my best face product.  I can&#x27;t do without it.</li>
            <li> After one use blisters covered my face. The scarring I&#x27;m told by my doctor is permanent. Even surgery cannot help.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 days. My skin has never looked so bad. I understand drawing out impurities, but not only has it made my entire face break out everywhere, but it has also created wrinkles under my eyes that were not there before. I also continue to wake up looking very puffy, especially around my eyes. I have applied it to wet skin. I don&#x27;t understand the consistency. It&#x27;s terrible. It&#x27;s almost impossible to get it onto your skin when it&#x27;s wet because the product is so slimy. It also smells terrible. I don&#x27;t know if my bottle is broken, but i have to take the entire thing apart to get any product out. It is also extremely uncomfortable at night. Think of how it would be to sleep with a dried up face mask on and that&#x27;s how it feels. Tingly, crunchy, dry, and itchy. I was told that this would be the product that changed my face for the good forever. I am still young, but my skin is very sensitive and it seems like I never stop breaking out. My pores are large and I am starting to get a few lines around my mouth and eyes. So I figured I would give it a try because it claims to help with all of the problems I seem to have. Low and behold, it&#x27;s done nothing  but make my skin significantly worse, and given me three uncomfortable nights trying to sleep with a stinky dried face mask on. I would never EVER spend money on this product. Thank goodness this was just a tester bottle.</li>
            <li> Nothing great happened for me&lt;br /&gt;Still looking for the perfect product&lt;br /&gt;Very pleasant to use, however so I did use it regularly</li>
            <li> Have used Nerium for 2 months , it does make your skin tighter and smoother.  I have had compliments about my skin.  Oh, I&#x27;m a 61 year old guy.</li>
            <li> I swear people are crazy. The product clearly says that it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone. Everyone skin is different. Iles I am a brand partner and it does work for some people. Some it does not. Let&#x27;s begin my saying most of us brand partners use our own photos from our real customers these photos are not fake. Secondly follow the directionS. You must wash your wash your face before and after. Your face must be wet when you put in. Please take a before pic and an after pic you will see the difference. Sometimes we can&#x27;t notice changes on our own face. I&#x27;m not on here trying to sell but I have seen amazing results and I don&#x27;t care if you buy from me. Then you say the company is just trying to make money duhhhhh what company isn&#x27;t trying to make money. Also remember oleander is not toxic on the skin just don&#x27;t eat it okay and you will be fine.</li>
            <li> Used this for a month and can&#x27;t really tell any difference:-(</li>
            <li> I really dont care how good a product is if the company and the people behind it are terrible. I cannot express how disappointed I am with Nerium. The owners are millionaires who think that the world revolves around them and are willing to trample on and chew up anyone who comes in their way. My family member was unfortunate enough to work for them.  Renee is the co-owner and their website says, \\&quot;her generous and compassionate heart is appreciated by all who work with her.\\&quot; I can tell you straight up that this is a huge lie. She can fake it to those on the outside, but get close enough and she will bite.</li>
            <li> I have seen some improvement by using Nerium AD but not a significant change.  I&#x27;m still trying to see if using longer will result in more benefits</li>
            <li> If I could give zero stars, I would.  My friend raved about this product, saying it tightened her skin, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank goodness she let me borrow a sample cause this stuff did nothing good for me.  However, it does SMELL bad.. Really bad, in fact, and it also made skin feel too dry during the time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found put whys friend was raving about it too-- she&#x27;s a distributor.  She didn&#x27;t mention this but when I talked to her contact, the woman gave me a link to buy the product and my friends name was on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even worse, she told me that for every bottle of this crap I buy, SHE gets a &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; bottle to give out for people to sample.  Seriously, why would you tell me that?  I am actually paying for TWO bottles but only getting one?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just another MLM (multi-level marketing).</li>
            <li> This dried my skin out.  Not only did  wrinkles not improve, NEW wrinkles were created as my skin lost all hydration.  I am now two weeks into trying to moisturize my skin to hydrate it again.  No luck yet.  I spent $350. to try Nerium for two months.  No refund for me since they limit the time to return the product to 30 days.  What a waste of my money, PLUS more new wrinkles!!</li>
            <li> AMAZING product!  It works.....so simple to use.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> I was really hopeful!  But I saw no change whatsoever.  I hope others have better luck.  Shipping etc was prompt - no complaints there</li>
            <li> I am 30 years old and have combination skin. I am also prone to break outs.  I have been using nerium for 30 days.  The first week I noticed positive results. Cleared my breakouts and overall texture was better. Fine lines were less noticeable.  The second week my results were the same.  The third week I broke out with what appeared to be hormonal acne.  My face then cleared two weeks later and now I am broken out again. I am not sure if it&#x27;s the product or not.  The texture and pore size seem about the same as the first week.  I wound also say the product lasts longer than 30 days as I stil have about 1/3 left in the bottle.  I&#x27;m not quite sure this product is for me. Shipping was fast and price was resonable compared to what it sells for through a distributor.  I would definitly buy it through here to try it out for 30 days before signing up for the monthly commitment.  Worth a try.</li>
            <li> Friends e en asked me if I had  had a facelift!  Great product!  So not even use it every pm. Which Makes it less expensive!</li>
            <li> We had some friends that told us about this and showed us the before and after pictures and it looked promising.  However, my wife and I both tried it and had absolutely zero results.  It stinks (like awful stinch...why can&#x27;t they understand that about something that goes on your face?), it makes your skin tight and feels terrible on, and quite frankly doesn&#x27;t work in our 2 month &amp;#34;trying to be a believer opinion&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nerium has incredible marketing and packaging and their CEO is a great leader.  However, it is completely compensation driven not product driven and that&#x27;s unfortunate.  This product, for $90, should provide results quickly instead of obviously not working for the majority of the actual users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 529 reviews as I write this, and there are 70% 3 or below.  That said, the reps probably account for the other 30% to make the product rating of 3.5.  Let that one set in for a moment...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If actual users (think not being paid to promote it) say its bad, then its probably not your best option for skincare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money folks.  This one is a bust...</li>
            <li> I have been on it for just 30 days and see HUGE results. Love it! Love the botanical smell, the tightening feel and most of all I love that I am seeing results. I have tried everything including hydroquinone, aha&#x27;s, retin a, all of it - and I this is the fastest I&#x27;ve seen results. :)</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin so before I used the product I looked at all the material and it said it was safe for sensitive skin.  However after a couple days of use and using absolutely nothing new my face blew up like a balloon, my eyes were almost swollen shut and I looked like a chipmunk!  After going to my dermatologist and discussing the reaction and product with them they said they would never recommend using the product they gave other product recommendations that were also half the cost and didn&#x27;t cause my face to swell.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product.  This is the first bottle I purchased of the night cream.  I&#x27;m in my early 50&#x27;s and had dark areas in the skin on my face from a lot of sun damage.  Almost all of the dark areas are gone now and my skin looks really good.  It does tighten your skin.as well.  I will buy more of it when I run out.</li>
            <li> With so many age defying products on the market it is hard to determine what works.  I was skeptical about Nerium, however, there is a difference in my skin.  I think it&#x27;s priced  too high and would like to see the company come down a little in it&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> The sooner one uses this product the better it will work . Would prefer it to be white in color and there is a slight offensive odor to the product but it does dissipate .</li>
            <li> Little tight on skin when first put on. Skin became soft but didn&#x27;t see pores shrink as much as expected.</li>
            <li> Made my face turn bright red and the product burned after applying.  I do have somewhat sensitive skin so I gave it to a friend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nerium for about 4 months now.  I swear my 3 day tester from a representative did fantastic.  Since then... so-so.  However, I&#x27;ve purchased my last two bottles on Amazon and have NOT been disappointed.</li>
            <li> fantastic product have used for 2 years with great results. Use going to bed, easy to apply and no odor.</li>
            <li> I was told about this product from a friend. She said--her friend could sell it to me. I just went on Amazon.com and there it was. Does it work? I can feel it tighten a bit after it dries. So, I hope to see results in a few weeks but so far I &#x27;think&#x27; it is working and that is a good sign.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and scienticfically proven to give results of %30 improvement in 30 days! enough said!! It works!</li>
            <li> I love Nerium night cream . It has improved my skin 90%. I would recomend Nerium to all my friends and family. It&#x27;s a little expensive and most people can not afford it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the stickiness of this and really couldn&#x27;t tell that it made much difference.</li>
            <li> Great product. Super fast shipping (to Guam)!</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference in about a 2 weeks . Love the product!</li>
            <li> Use it to smooth out acne scars.</li>
            <li> I like this product, but for the $$ I think I&#x27;ll switch back to other nite creams. Just don&#x27;t think it passed other products that you would pay less for.</li>
            <li> I have used Nerium AD night and day cream for two months now and have seen improvement in color to my under eyes and neck! This product is to be used long term to see the real results. It&#x27;s not an over night ( Botox) It is healing  antioxidants and nutrients. I love the science behind this product!!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.  I can&#x27;t recommend it enough.  I have some medical issues concerning my skin and this product helps my skin be the best it can be.  My face feels wonderful. My age spots are fading and if I can stop them at age 49 thats great.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Reduces fine lines and wrinkles and makes sun spots/age spots less visable  I would recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and receive it yesterday. I was excited to use it and when I pump the bottle the bottle was empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very upset because Amazon allow this happen and fool customers. I email and call Amazon but no response yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am calling my bank to dispute this matter and Amazon you just lost al oyal customer</li>
            <li> You need to test this product on your skin before usage.</li>
            <li> Nerium is horrible. You are so hopeful when you shell out all the $. Then the weeks go by &amp; you look exactly the same. Sometimes I&#x27;ve even thought I looked worse. The pump is crap, it makes your face so tight it&#x27;s uncomfortable to sleep, it stinks, it&#x27;s expensive, &amp; it doesn&#x27;t work. Not even a little bit. Boo!</li>
            <li> Excellent price. Fast shipping. My wife is happy. I&#x27;m happy. I&#x27;ll be buying more in about a month.</li>
            <li> The Nerium Ad is a good night cream. It does make your skin feel very smooth and soft. After using it for 2 and 1/2 months now, I&#x27;m not really sold on effects against &amp;#34;ageing&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> tHis review is not based on the product this is based on an experience while shopping in a discount department store. my mother and I were shopping and we were approached by a lady while we were looking at sunglasses.  she seemed really friendly talking about the sunglasses and then all of the sudden she asked us if we ever heard of Nerium she said it was such a great product and went and grabbed your phone then another lady came up behind her and started talking about thIs skin product Nerium And showing us before and after pictures. before we knew it there were five women surrounding my mother On both sides blocking us in the aisle showing us all these pictures of peoples faces and claiming that they were given a Lexus car after only 6 months of sales.  and wanted us to sign up and spend 500 dollars on project that  we could sell if we became a distributor.&lt;br /&gt;I must have said three different times that I had to leave and go pick up my child and they just completely disregarded that we were trying to get away from them.&lt;br /&gt;she was reluctant to give me her information she wanted my information I refuse to give it I did however come home and look on Amazon and see the horrible reviews and therefore I will not be trying this product or becoming a part of a Ponzi scheme.&lt;br /&gt;Beware!  if it sounds too good to be true then it&#x27;s probably too good to be true!</li>
            <li> This product simply make me break out in areas where I never had acne problems (and I struggled with it for years). My dermatologist told me it caused problems drying out skin. My issue was inflammation and acne above my eyebrows and along my hairline. That has never happened to me in my 45 years of life so obviously the product was bad news for me. My distributor told me she was told that happens because the product was pulling toxins out of my skin and I should stick with it. Sorry, that&#x27;s just not true. I eat clean and drink water AND consulted a medical professional. I&#x27;m too smart to believe that sales pitch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, pushing people to take before and after pictures is terrible. Why do people agree to let marketers display them in a way they wouldn&#x27;t want their friends and co-workers to see on a normal day??? Stop falling for this marketing pressure!</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of skin products and this one does make your skin look better, younger (for me), smaller pores.</li>
            <li> Good company. Good purchase.</li>
            <li> Not sure I would re-purchase this item. Pricey.  Didn&#x27;t see not see miracles.  don&#x27;t know iI would spend the money again for this item</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that has ever worked for me.  I use the extra on my arms at night and the crepiness has reduced significantly.  Crepe patches on my face are gone.  It is smoother than it has been since I was 30.  I am now 52.&lt;br /&gt;It is expensive, however, so are a multitude of other products that do less.  How many products do we buy and end up throwing away because they do not work.  It also pays to apply according to instructions.  Many people try to scrimp on product and it&#x27;s just not worth it.  NOT ONLY THAT, BUT IT IS GUARANTEED OR YOUR MONEY BACK!!&lt;br /&gt;They also have Day Cream now that takes you through the day and is not greasy.  Great base for make-up.</li>
            <li> This is not your usual night cream. It feels tight on your skin. Also some  people have commented about the smell.  I personally don&#x27;t have a problem with the sent.  I have been using this at night for about 3 wks and I think my skin looks tighter. If you want something very moisturizing this probably isn&#x27;t for you but if you want to tighten slack skin and soften wrinkles it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Of course everybody is different and not everything works for everybody, but this stuff has truly been amazing.  I only tried it because a friend of mine is a brand partner and gave me a bottle for free. I have always had horrible skin and now at 39 I not only have redness and bumps all the time but I also am getting wrinkles.  When I first started the night cream, I did not like the scent and my skin actually got worse for the first 4 or 5 days.  But then it started to get better and better.  My redness completely went away.  I got used to the smell and even started to kind of like it.  You should shake the bottle before you use it.  I&#x27;ve also read complaints about it being sticky but that is because you have to apply it to damp skin (or make sure your hands are a little damp).  Then it spreads nicely, absorbs well, and feels awesome (as well as make the product go a lot further).  After I used my first bottle, I found a less expensive way to buy it that signing up through a partner, so I bought another bottle and continued to feel like my skin was looking and feeling better and better.  Then...after that (it was about 7 or 8 weeks), I ran out and I had no money and thought, &amp;#34;Well, maybe I can get by with something else.&amp;#34;  NO!!!  I went a month with my skin starting to get red and yucky again and have just ordered more.  I am now converted for life.  But I&#x27;m still not going to sell it because I hate hitting people up for things and its just not my thing.  But its a great product and I&#x27;ll continue to try to find it for as cheap as possible and use it!  Ha!</li>
            <li> I am 53 years old and have used every product on the market. My bathroom is full of half used containers. I have spent 1000&#x27;s on trying to find a wrinkle cure and I do get some Botox and fillers when I can afford them. I tried Nerium and LOVE it! I am not impressed with the day cream but the night cream has changed my skin texture tremendously on my face, neck and chest. I use it twice a day which is not what they recommend but I see results and my skin tolerates it well. I purchased the $1000 Brand Partner starter kit and ended up selling all but 3 bottles to my friends. Half loved it the other half didn&#x27;t see much in the way of results. I think it is best for oilier sun damaged skin. It shrunk my pores down to nothing, took the red out of my complexion and evened out my skin tone. I do not see much on my vertical lip lines or crows feet yet but I am just coming up on 1 month of use. I will use this product until my last 3 bottles are gone (I kept them for myself when I saw the results). Definitely worth a try. Not for everyone but if you are lucky enough to get half of what I did...it is well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I do not like this product.  It is very drying and makes my skin look dehydrated.  After about 2-3 days I have to go back to moisture products.  It is very expensive and I just threw the money down the drain.</li>
            <li> I like this product and have used it for a few months. it was a great price and I  will buy again.</li>
            <li> Great product and delivery!!</li>
            <li> My skin is SO soft, dark blemish spots are almost completely disappeared, makeup goes on so much easier, oily spots are controlled. It is worth the money!</li>
            <li> Preface: I have never bought or sampled this product. I was made aware of it from a friend who bought into this company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The immediate red flag that popped up for me was that the &amp;#34;magical ingredient&amp;#34; is derived from one of the most violently poisonous plants on the planet. Not like make you rash up and itch poisonous, rather, stop-your-heart-and-kill-you poisonous. I don&#x27;t think anyone will die by using this cream that actually hasn&#x27;t been FDA approved, but there&#x27;s reason to do your own due diligence in case anyone decides they might want to try it. Look on both sides of the fence please. Don&#x27;t take before and after photos for granted, they are taken at different times under different lighting and could even be subject to Photoshop. Google if this product works and read about it. Then Google if it&#x27;s safe and read something to the contrary. My main concern is that this cream contains a violent toxin in it that I&#x27;ve read by some accounts has made people quite sick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having the mindset of, &amp;#34;it&#x27;s too good to be true,&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t a bad thing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any one particular product that I use to &amp;#34;stay young&amp;#34;.  I buy them all once and  - if I see a difference - buy some twice.  This is my second purchase of Nerium.  The key is to sweep upward when applying rather than just rubbing it in.  It sort of hardens and you want that &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; to be in an uplifted pose.  My friends didn&#x27;t all scream &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; the day after, but I can see a subtle difference.  I would compare it top that Avon stuff that comes in a similar bottle.  Both are pretty good products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing product. It really works.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little pricey but after 6 weeks there is a very noticible difference.</li>
            <li> I called Nerium to return my product within the 30 day time frame because I didn&#x27;t see any results.  They gave me a return authorization number and was told to send the product back.  I didn&#x27;t rush to the post office because I did not think it was a rush.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately,  if they don&#x27;t receive it within 10 days of that call, you will NOT receive any refund!  They said I was read that when I called, but I have no memory of it.  What a waste!</li>
            <li> Jeff Olson mentioned in his book &amp;#34;The Slight Edge&amp;#34; that people will tell their positive experience to 3 people, negative to 33 people. Reading the comments here, this is definitely true:) He also said that what you focus on will expand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone with sensitive skin should not be surprised to find out that his/her skin is sensitive to some things that are put on it. Plus it says on the package not to put it around the eyes; it actually warns you not to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had any experience with customer service, though. About the cream, my skin tone is more even. Cant say anything about the wrinkles - did not have many before, and it seems the same now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oleander has been used in natural medicine for centuries, throughout the world. FDA has not approved it, so what? They have not approved garlic or vitamin d either. But they did approve Zyprexa for off-label marketing basing their decision on research done by the manufacturer of that drug. So, FDA is as sketchy of a resource as any other. If your concern is that it is poisonous, then do not eat the cream. But did you know that ozone is even more poisonous and it is used in the water treatment process? And you drink it! (It is fine, by the way:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My take, it works for some and does not work for others. Just like so many other things in life.</li>
            <li> thinks its not the real product that she has used in the past??? IDK I&#x27;m just passing along what she says. . .</li>
            <li> Not a brand partner. Was given from a friend. For me it works. Gotten so many compliments is not even funny. I have been using it for over 1 month. Acne gone. Skin texture better.  Skin color better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product about a month and I can see improvement in the fine ines and wrinkles on my forehead. So excited!</li>
            <li> Nerium ad has a &amp;#34;d&amp;#34; rating from the BBB. Buyer beware.... Trending complaints are for bad reactions to the product and the company!!</li>
            <li> I was given a free trial bottle to try for one week.&lt;br /&gt;From the moment I was introduced to this product, I was suspicious. My suspicions were so right.&lt;br /&gt;On night one, I hated the feel of this product on my face. The texture of it, while still on my hand, felt so synthetic. I could smell it inches away from my face. I was told it would smell like &amp;#34;going to a spa&amp;#34;. I have no idea what these people are talking about. It smelled like a mix of burnt rubber, and sun dried rotten cactus. I hesitated putting it on my face, but my curiosity got the better of me. I literally could not leave this on my face for more than ten minutes. The overpowering smell gave me a headache. I scrubbed this crap off and put it back in the box. Honestly, my face feels much better after I wash it with a simple exfoliate. I went to bed that night with a headache that would not go away. I still woke up the next morning with the headache.&lt;br /&gt;NO WHERE around this product is there any sort of scientific evidence that it works, or published results from experimental trials. There are ZERO facts presented honestly about this. It hasn&#x27;t even been approved by the FDA.&lt;br /&gt;If you want to look young forever, try this ladies: Stop giving a crap about what the media says - you WILL age (because there is this thing called TIME), and you WILL wrinkle. ACCEPT IT. Instead, wash your face, apply sunscreen when in the sun, eat healthier foods, get more exercise, stop smoking, be happy. All these things (and there are more natural things that can go on your face like chamomile and aloe vera) will make you age beautifully. Promise.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I&#x27;ve learned about this product is that there is an entire cult of people behind it that are only looking to suck your entire wallet out of you through their disgusting lucrative schemes. Everyone involved essentially loses their soul to this pyramid scheme. I&#x27;ve been taught to recognize a pyramid scheme - and this is exactly how it works. BEWARE ANDDON&#x27;T BUY THIS!!!!!</li>
            <li> Best skincare line in North America. Make sure you purchase from an authorized Nerium Brand Partner.</li>
            <li> Something is wrong with the bottle I received. About halfway through the bottle, the cream began coming out as a runny dark brown liquid, NOT the normal cream. I have used multiple bottles of this and have never seen anything like this.</li>
            <li> After one full bottle there were no visible results.</li>
            <li> I have only used it for about a mnth. I notice some slight reduction in wrinkles, but believe I will see more. I believe&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the product is good.</li>
            <li> This product was okay, I have used  other products that were similar in price for better results for my combination skin.</li>
            <li> My face feels good after using this product.  I&#x27;m not sure about the wrinkle relief, but it does make my skin feel tighter.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews on Amazon and found that more people hated the cream and did not see the results they were hoping for but I must say that I saw immediate results after the first day!  I even saw a huge difference in the brown spots on my face in the one application and I saw improvements in the neck as well.  I was very skeptical about using it after reading the reviews and thought I had wasted my money again on yet another expensive product.  I will have to say that apparently it works differently on people.  My sister saw no improvements at all but I saw immediate and huge improvements.  Go figure.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for age spots too.  My husband had a huge age spot on his cheek and it was gone within 3 months.</li>
            <li> Beware of customer service for Nerium Products.  If the bottle is defected and the pump doesn&#x27;t work, they do not replace your product if it is over 30 days old. I also have not seen any difference in my skin since I have been using it for one year.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> A friend of mine swears by this product  and so I tried it. It really did nothing for me. I did not like rubbing it on my face and leaving it on overnight as directed. It didn&#x27;t feel good. It also didn&#x27;t smell good at all. And after a month and an entire bottle, I decided it didn&#x27;t do anything for me. But my friend likes it.</li>
            <li> Definitely did not get the results on the pictures.  I am 46 &amp; don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles but the ones that I do have were unfazed by this product.  The holidays messed up my ability to return this so now im stuck with it.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion - I really think it works great. I have had no issues with this and my neck is much firmer since using this. I have been using it for about 6 months now and I still love it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product....I really did.  Unfortunately, I did not see any changes in my skin or fine lines.  It made my face initially break out.  I felt like it clogged my pores and honestly left my skin feeling &amp;#34;dryer&amp;#34;.  I gave the product a full 30 days to evaluate.  I took before and after photos (after photos 14 days later) and honestly there was NO difference.  I am someone who is meticulous about skin care regime and followed the instructions perfectly.  This is not a miracle cream in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I cannot see any difference after using it a month...</li>
            <li> I have used Nerium for several months and I can tell you first hand, IT WORKS. I notice a lot of reviews and comments written by people who clearly have not used it or can&#x27;t follow direction... i.e. &amp;#34;Bought a bottle and used it for 3 months with no results.&amp;#34;  Each bottle is basically a one month supply for face and neck treatment. That&#x27;s like using a 30 day supply of vitamins for 3-4 months and complaining that they&#x27;re not helping you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the vast majority of people, if you follow the directions and compare pictures of before and after a month you will notice improvements in your skin.</li>
            <li> So glad to be able to use a simple system, totally natural and botanical product with great results. And being able to earn the Night cream for free through the customer loyalty program with a Brand Partner is the way to go.

Gotta love a company full of integrity and a product with incredible results!</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product from Amazon.  You don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s been in the hot sun, if it&#x27;s full, or if it&#x27;s the real deal.  And it needs to be used every month for benefits.  Only buy from Nerium International.  Can buy it for $80 with other benefits.  Nerium is trying to shut these sources down.</li>
            <li> I have not seen an improvement in my skin tone or condition and don&#x27;t like the way it feels&lt;br /&gt;after applying it (somewhat like smearing honey on you face-sticky)</li>
            <li> The product has made a difference but not as remarkable as claimed and the cost is a bit high and it seems like you should get a bit more.</li>
            <li> I started using in product within 5 days what a difference it has been 30 days now my skin color is great my crows feet around eyes are better my pores are getting smaller with daily use and I feel like I have baby soft skin it is great and I have used Estee lauder, Mary kay, merit norman, bare minetals, capita international products, enemies spa products none of these have done what nerium as done and it is so simple to apply you do not have 5 or 6 steps to do only wash your face apply cream at nite and was in morning that is real convenient as well</li>
            <li> Update.  My hubby took it apart.  It isn&#x27;t dry or empty, the pump was broke,  I scraped it and put it in a jar to use .  I am adding this review on Sept 23. I can&#x27;t believe not no one said a word about this being broke.  Just it was one day too late to return bc I failed to open and test it.  I didn&#x27;t bc I never had this problem before.  I am just stunned I heard back from NOONE</li>
            <li> Two of my good friends love this so probably worth trying but for me, I hated the texture and smell of this and it made me break out.  I normally use La Mer, I&#x27;ll be sticking with that.  I have very fair and sensitive skin but the two friends of mine that this works for have skin with more oil, it may be my skin type.  I have pretty flawless skin already so for me, this product ruined my already good skin, I went backwards with this product.  The texture of this is terrible, its really thick and when it dries it feels like you&#x27;re wearing a mask.  After I removed it, my skin was drier than before I put it on and felt like it needed lotion, ironically.  The smell is HORRID and never goes away, there is no way I can sleep with it on, I had to rinse it off a few hours later.  Not for me.</li>
            <li> I could not tell any difference after 5 months using this product. Don&#x27;t buy. Would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have had so many people tell me about this product that I had to try it for myself. Have to admit ...I don&#x27;t know what all the &amp;#34;fuss&amp;#34; is about. Feels like glue on my face and not noticing any differences ....</li>
            <li> I love Nerium Ad. I can feel it working when I apply it at night. Hope to continue it for a long time.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd bottle of this product and I haven&#x27;t seen the results everyone raves about.  The smell is terrible but if it works I can deal with that.</li>
            <li> I have purchased Nerium AD from a licensed Nerium distributor for the past year . My bottles have lasted me 7+ weeks. This bottle purchased from this company did not last me 2 weeks!!!!!  The box was received with a seal on it but iin NO WAY could have been an unopened, never been used bottle. This company in essence stole $80.00 from me. Never will I order from them again. And possibly never make another Amazon purchase. I couldn&#x27;t be more disappointed.</li>
            <li> I did receive - and it appears to be empty - the pump seems to work - but only a very small amount came out.  Don&#x27;t know if it is empty or the pump is broken.  I have tried numerous times - can&#x27;t get it to work. I have had this product in the past, and love the product, but will not buy from this vendor again or recommend unless I can get a  replacement or my money back.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I am 46 years old and have been using this now for 3 weeks.  I am a salon owner and my clients have asked me if I have lost weight and commented how great Iook.  My skin is now flawless and even though I have not lost weight my face appears thinner because m skin is toned again and is firm with no sagging.  I have read the good reviews and the bad ones.  I know that the bad ones are mostly from people who are jealous or against mlm companies.  I recommend hair and beauty products all day long because I paid money to become educated in this profession and when you have a product that falls within this category that is the only way it should be sold.  This company chooses the relationship marketing for this product for that very reason and if I was the founder of this amazing product I would have it no other way.  It should only be purchased this way and it is the only way you are given a 30 day unconditional money back guarantee.  It does work if used properly and it is a shame that the negative comments could have been avoided if only the proper guidelines were followed and skin issues addressed.</li>
            <li> I tried waiting it out but the breakouts were awful so I stopped using it.  Big boils were not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I like it because it works ,my husband has always ignored his skin until I started using Nerium on him ,he takes his shower at night and brings me the Nerium to put on him .In the morning he rinses his face ,puts on the daycream ,and I love on myself , my skin feels better and looks better!!</li>
            <li> I wear Nerium at night and have noticed my wrinkles slowly fading.  I have tried it for two months now and will probably buy it again.  I do think you have to be careful to put on a good moisturizer after you wash this product off, it leaves your face very dry.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work and way too expensive, I used with a nerium day cream, didn&#x27;t see any result, and made my skin dry and itchy</li>
            <li> Makes your face feel like you are wearing a tight mask..I hated the feel and the smell and quit using it even though it was 100 bucks, nearly. a total waste of money..don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> I like it.  I see a little difference after two months. I will try another month.I have recommended it to my sister.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!! It truly has made a difference in my appearance. I have been using for 8 months and won&#x27;t give it up.</li>
            <li> Ordered this product when my cousin told me about it. It was nice when it was first applied but after 1 minute it would get sticky feeling. It says damp your face before applying so I tried that as well but still sticky. I would not recommend this product based off this. It felt like I had a face mask on after application.</li>
            <li> I have had dark spots on the side of my face for quite some time.I was even using bleaching cream on my face lots of other product on my skin.In 4 wks I can see the spots fading away. My skin is looking brighter. My skintone I evening out. This is a Great product. I even love the smell now. I am still on my first one.This is my 5th wk. I am so glad some told me about this product. I use purpose soap at night. As directed I use just water in the morning to rinse it off.</li>
            <li> Prefer Not to give a testimonial or endorsement.  What I order is personal-not to be shared on Web sites by any company.</li>
            <li> This is probably the most successful anti aging product I have used!  You&lt;br /&gt;really can see a noticeable difference in a few weeks.  I will continue to&lt;br /&gt;use it the rest of my life!</li>
            <li> Nerium is amazing! I love it! My skin has improved more in a couple weeks then in years. It feels very healing! It smells like cucumbers I have no idea how that is offensive. You owe it to yourself to try it if you want more radiant, smother skin. I normally don&#x27;t post reviews but I ran out wanted to order more and I&#x27;m stunned that there are negative ones on here. Nerium is the best product I have ever spent $ on!</li>
            <li> Pretty goodroduct, a liitle expensive though. It evened out my skin tone but I really was hoping to get rid of age spots. My cheeks usually are red and they look much better after about 5 days of using this product.</li>
            <li> I almost didn&#x27;t try this product after reading the reviews posted here but I am very glad that I did. I am 65 and really did not expect a dramatic effect but finally decided any improvement would be fine. I was very surprised to see a difference almost immediately.  I had a few red splotches that are gone.  I had 2 dry patches beneath the corners of my mouth - gone. Most surprising was the improvement in the large pores on my nose. The appearance of fine lines has diminished.  I will definitely continue to use this product.  I would say that of all the skin improvement products I&#x27;ve purchased ( and thats alot), this is the one that has delivered.  Don&#x27;t know why so many people did not have good results.  Same reason I guess that meds, beauty products, etc. all affect people differently. The only negative is the smell.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin stay away from this product! One of my friends became brand partner and asked if I would at least give it a try. Ok, why not right? BAD idea... I ended up with a horrible rash around the chin area. It would not go away so off I go to the dermatologist. I had developed Peri-oral dermatitis which I have NEVER had in my 40 years on this earth before. Thank goodness he helped me get it all cleared up and my skin is back to normal. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone. Be careful and take the time to a) read what&#x27;s in it and b) find out what those ingredients can do to your body.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year and have seen no change in my skin. I was on auto delivery and had 5 boxes yet unopened even though I was using this product as prescribed both day and night.&lt;br /&gt;Upon receiving an email that Nerium was sending me yet another shipment,  I notified them that I needed to take a break from the shipments so I could catch up with the product I had on hand.&lt;br /&gt; I initially signed up on a promotion that provided me with both Day and Night Cream for the price of the Night Cream. I was then told that the special would no longer be available to me if I interrupted the auto delivery. I found this very coercive. This company sends too much product and is not user friendly. It certainly did nothing for me and was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of it and the effects seem to be working.  Sometimes I&lt;br /&gt;use it twice a day instead of the day cream.</li>
            <li> I know someone that sells this stuff and&lt;br /&gt;Keeps trying to convince me to use it. I&#x27;m 27 years old and have no skin issues but I was curious to what this is because it&#x27;s something that sounds like one of those scams. After looking it up I&#x27;ve realized that the only 5 star reviews are those of people who&#x27;ve \\&quot;used it\\&quot; then started selling it. So that right there tells me it&#x27;s most likely a scam. And the other ones after reading them sound too good to be true. But I still gave it a chance and kept on reading and realized the only reviews about this product are really shorty or overly exaggerated 5 star. So my hunch was right this product seems like one of those total scam things.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nerium day and night cream for 6 weeks exclusively. I cannot say that it has made any difference yet. I do have a reaction to the day cream where if I use more than 3 pumps and no water my skin burns and turns bright red. Looks like I was slapped in the face. Lasting approx 30min. If I use water (which they only say to use water with the night cream) with the day cream it is not as bad. My rep was shocked and said he had never heard of this reaction before. It is expensive, but I feel its worth a 3 month trial before I make my final decision. Also will compare my before and after pictures. Jury is still out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several months now.  I have seen some improvement in my complexion.  My skin color has evened out and my skin is brighter. The biggest change for me has been the end of my bouts with adult acne.  I&#x27;m 63 and still had breakouts around my chin mostly.  That&#x27;s all over now.  I don&#x27;t feel I look younger but maybe healthier.  I will continue to use Nerium.</li>
            <li> I used this product for 60 days and it did nothing for my skin but clogged my pores. It is so over priced as well. It also smells horrible!</li>
            <li> I have Rosacea and after menopause my skin became painfully dry especially on my face. I tried so many things only to get little results. Nerium has been a miracle for me! I have been using the day and night cream for close to a year.  I can now go without makeup and not be embarrassed by Rosacea.</li>
            <li> Ordering this from a good friend (working her way they college) I immediately was skeptical; however it warranted a try..first,the smell and consistency (night cream) is offensive. After a few weeks of use my skin was red and I developed acne along my jaw and hair line and my neck. Discontinuing for a week, it cleared up. However two days into using it again,the acne returned. Product definitely not worth it !</li>
            <li> Was not worth the money..... did not see any results</li>
            <li> I only look at the amazon verified reviews, otherwise anyone can write a review and you don&#x27;t know if they ever used the oroduct, I am waiting for my samples. But I justed wanted folks to take the reviews seriously, don&#x27;t pay attention to unverified purchase reviews, anyone can write whatever propaganda they want</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my mom, arrived very quickly, and she loves it.</li>
            <li> After a few friends have been posting using this product on their Facebook page I decided to give it a try in hopes of reducing pore size. I used the product as instructed for almost 2 weeks and saw zero improvement. As I look back to people posting and raving about this product on Facebook I noticed that they are all selling the product as well so I&#x27;m sure their rave reviews are slightly slanted. This to me in the end is just another marketing / get rich quick program more than a break through new product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It has helped give my skin a better texture. I will continue to use this product. I would recommend this .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 4th bottle of night cream and my 3rd bottle of day cream.  I started using this because a friend of my daughter&#x27;s was really bragging about it.  She is the brand partner.  I wasn&#x27;t crazy about jumping into a pyramid scheme, but I did it because she was very sure about her results and others.  The first bottle of night cream (one that she gave me) actually made my skin softer in appearance and my eyes seemed brighter/lifted.  So I decided to try the free for life special they had going.  This special was if you preorder the $80 night cream for 3 months you will receive their day cream free forever.  That isn&#x27;t true really.  The first bottle of night cream that came in the mail was a darker color and didn&#x27;t dry right.  It was thicker and went on like putty which was different than my first experience.  I couldn&#x27;t get half way through with this bottle.  My skin became red.  My skin burned and in the morning I woke up with small welps as if it were burned skinned.  I stopped using both creams (day/night) to see if my skin would improve.  I had also at the same time experienced allergies (outdoor - mold/pollen) and had been taking allergy medicine.  Thinking that the combination of the medicine and the cream was the problem after my allergies had subsided, I tried the cream again.  No, this was a big mistake.  It burned the first time I wiped it on.  I have not used the product in 2 weeks.  My skin isn&#x27;t red anymore, but my under eye wrinkles have worsened and my skin is extremely dry and sensitive now.  I called the brand partner that sold it to me and told her my issues and that I wanted to cancel.  It took quite a while to get her attention (2 weeks of phone tag) but she finally stopped the automatic order but wants me to share my story with the company.  She can&#x27;t get anyone from the company to call her back.  I have unused bottles that I&#x27;ve paid for that I can&#x27;t use.  I&#x27;m hoping they will reimburse me, but they have to call back and so far nothing.  So much for the free for life..........This is my story...good luck</li>
            <li> Not happy with this order, pump doesn&#x27;t work, can&#x27;t get cream to come out. Very flustrated with this bottle as I have had several with out this problem. Love the product just not this bottle.</li>
            <li> This product did nothing for me, I followed directions and applied daily. My pores seemed to get larger, my sun spots got darker, my skin was even dryer than normal would &amp;#34;Not&amp;#34; recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> this was a fake product! waste of money! i compared this bottle and cream to the same exact one i ordered from nerium.</li>
            <li> I will be buying this again.  The smell is earthy when you put it on.  It does feel like it is tightening my skin.  I haven&#x27;t had anyone say anything to me like your face looks really great.. Your price was right for me.  Thank you!  Zeke</li>
            <li> I am about as skeptical as they come.  I read the reviews, saw the pics on the Internet, and thought it sounded too good to be true, but a friend reported great results so after months finally caved and tried it.  The product took some getting used to as it isn&#x27;t like a typical night cream.  It&#x27;s very concentrated so needs to be applied to damp skin.  As it soaked in my skin felt as if it had a tightening mask on it.  That sensation fades as it absorbs into the skin.  In the morning my skin feels so soft.  I took before pictures as instructed and after a few weeks could notice a dramatic difference in my pore size and smoothness of my skin...not only on my face, but neck and hands as well.  The pictures after 30 days were crazy!!! I saw a very dramatic improvement and am so pleased with what Nerium is doing for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with any product, some will have more dramatic results than others, but I just can&#x27;t believe how well it worked for me!  I&#x27;ve used Botox and fillers in the past, and have been very loyal to several high end skin care lines in the past.  While they have done well slowing the signs of aging, they haven&#x27;t been able to reverse the signs...Nerium has done that!  I&#x27;m so very pleased I tried it and recommend that others try and see for themselves.</li>
            <li> Seller shipped the item promptly and the item was new as described.  Just started using the product, havent seen any results yet but hoping it works!  Thanks a lot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update:  I used this product for about a month and had severe acne breakouts.  I stopped using the product and the acne went away.  I gave the product to a friend of mine, and she had the exact same thing happen.  Major breakouts..... and neither of us have ever had major issues with acne and are both in the 30-40 yr old range.  Needless to say, neither of us would recommend this product to customers.</li>
            <li> I liked it, I saw a difference after just 1 night of using it. And  I would order it again.</li>
            <li> THIS NIGHT CREAM AND THE DAY CREAM REALLY DO TAKE 10 YEARS OFF YOUR FACE IN A YEAR. I KNOW PEOPLE WHO HAVE USED ITM AND I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR A MONTH NOW, AND THERE IS ALREADY A BIG DIFFERENCE!</li>
            <li> I just used finished using Nerium for 7 days and my friends at work, my husband, and my 13 and 16 year old sons said my skin looks better.  My pores are smaller and my wrinkles are finer.  I do not like the marketing scheme of the company but that is not my business.  Either just purchase the product and be firm about your intentions, or jump into a business venture.  No one has a gun to your head.  My opinion is a few less wrinkles is not worth $80.00/month.</li>
            <li> Had great results immediately.  Very happy with this product and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Nerium exasperated my Rosacea, so I sent the new delivery of unopened product back for a refund ($120.00), keeping the used bottles and giving them to my friend.  When the refund didn&#x27;t record on my credit card I called Nerium, they received the product back but because it exceeded the 30-day return policy they didn&#x27;t credit my Card (I retuned it 40 days after receiving it as I hadn&#x27;t determined it was the Nerium that was causing the problem until the final 10 day period)--And they never bothered to contact me to tell me why they wouldn&#x27;t refund my money.  I asked for the product back so I could give it to my friend, but the customer service person told me that they discard returned unopened product (I find that hard to believe).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked to speak to a supervisor, still waiting for him to call me back, it&#x27;s been more than 5.5 hours so far, and it&#x27;s after 5 pm, so I&#x27;m guessing I won&#x27;t ever hear from him.</li>
            <li> This is great, I use it every night</li>
            <li> Snake oil scam pyramid scheme. I can&#x27;t believe that people still fall for rackets like this. It doesn&#x27;t work. Pictures are photoshopped. Only two things can erase wrinkles: plastic surgery or death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited to add: the Five Star reviews you&#x27;re seeing here are from people who are peddling this stuff. The \\&quot;brand partners\\&quot; have flooded the internet with phony raving reviews. There is NO cream in the world that erases wrinkles, don&#x27;t fall for this! And yes, it does stink and the plant oleander which is what this stuff is made from is POISONOUS!!! Google it!</li>
            <li> I read most of the reviews, negatives and positives, it really sucks that this amazing product didn&#x27;t work on them.  Most of the comments where about the bad costumer service and I can feel that could be a problem, but just like anywhere else, there are people that just don&#x27;t know how to give a great costumer service, however this product is amazing and the people that I know and use it are extremely happy with it.  If you don&#x27;t wanna spend your money on it, but would like to try it contact their Brand Partner so you can use the cream for 7 days and if you would like to use it longer and buy it on their website, make sure to let them know that you wouldn&#x27;t like to keep it on the 29th day so you can get your money back.  The problem that I see with these bad reviews are the misunderstanding with the costumer on how the guarantee works and on how to use the product.</li>
            <li> I have good skin and look younger than I am but do experience tone issues.  I don&#x27;t wear makeup either.  I tried it from a friend who was selling it and raved about it.  This stuff smells horrible.  You apply it too a wet face and it turns paste like then dries and tightens your face.  After 5 days I had no changes...Not enough a subtle difference.  I see others using it and don&#x27;t see changes with them either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and dont support this pyramid scheme</li>
            <li> These so called (partners), where too lazy to go out and sell the product. How can you get ripped off? You can return the product for a full refund. My goodness, take a picture before the use then another a few weeks later. I can tell you my wife uses the day and night cream and it works.She has eczema and a has tried just about everything to diminish the rough patches on her face. The Nerium has totally removed any eczema patches on her face. You people can believe what you want, this product is no lose buy, if you don&#x27;t like it send it back.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for six weeks. I saw the results on the person I bought it from first. I went to a Nerium party, and saw before and after pictures of real live people, who were at the party. Amazing changes, and a hugely positive group. Something sorely missing in this day and age. I tried the product, thinking it would cause a chemical burn: everything I&#x27;ve tried previously over the years had, so surely this would too.  I planned to stop using it at the first sign of redness. Three weeks in I saw that my skin had started to look better. Now six weeks in, my former classmates noticed at an annual reunion (we like each other, go figure!). They saw a difference from the previous year. (At my age, I really don&#x27;t think it was the three year old dress, I wasn&#x27;t wearing any makeup, and I haven&#x27;t lost any weight!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is NOT toxic. Is oleander, yes? If you eat the leaves! You would have to drink approx. 400 BOTTLES to even get slightly nauseous. I don&#x27;t plan to drink even 1bottle. I plan to use the recommended 4pumps, each night, on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All this to say, this product delivers beautifully. It gives real results to real people like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And to the person who said not to trust Nerium Labs, because they ARE the product, that is inaccurate at the most base level. Do you take Tylenol? Advil? Guess what. They have labs too...</li>
            <li> Let me tell you something really quick, this product works and the only people I know that haven&#x27;t liked it, are people who expect every wrinkle to vanish, but lets also be clear, this isn&#x27;t botox people!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a product that heals the skin ORGANICALLY with a patented PROVEN ANTIOXIDANT called NAE-8 extract from an oleander plant. You ARE NOT putting poison on your skin. You can do research yourself on how the antioxidant is removed from the plant and all the legal documents on it being a scientifically proven antioxidant, you can even do research on the oleander farms and visit them!&lt;br /&gt;The product &#x27;NERIUM&#x27; was an ACCIDENTAL discovery by a company called NERIUM BIOTECHNOLOGY in search of a skin cancer treatment and other treatments. The company was smart enough to market and patent the product with a new business- NERIUM INTERNATIONAL- to help fund their research at NERIUM BIOTECHNOLOGY. (:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for you all to be blown away,&lt;br /&gt;I AM A 21 YEAR OLD WOMAN, LIVING IN TEXAS, GOING TO SCHOOL AND THERE IS NOTHING SPECIAL ABOUT ME.&lt;br /&gt;However, My brother got very sick and was in need of a 25,000 dollar a month treatment that my familys insurance wouldnt cover, my dad was unemployeed at the time and the insurance company (CIGNA) wouldnt budge with doctor letters or appeals.&lt;br /&gt;My mom started NERIUM as a BRAND PARTNER to make money for my brothers treatment and I started a petition for him on CHANGE.ORG.&lt;br /&gt;My mom became fairly successful at her business, but what really matters, is THE CEO&#x27;S DAUGHTER AND SON-IN-LAW came down to visit my mom AT OUR HOUSE, BEFORE she became successful or knew her story, to help build her business. Once they heard our story, they asked me to be a guest speaker at a convention for them in Dallas in front of thousands of people.&lt;br /&gt;THEY DIDNT ASK HOW SUCCESSFUL WE HAD BEEN, HOW NERIUM HELPED US, HOW IT CHANGED OUR LIVES. It wasn&#x27;t about the business to them.

            <li> I chose this product because of what I read about it and heard. So far so good. I have had people mention to me that my complexion looks different, so this is a plus to me because the only thing I have changed is using Nerium Night and Day Cream.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money!!  I broke down and bought a few months supply (you have to sign up for a subscription) because my friends were all pushing it.  It does nothing and it is $100/month.  People have to pay $1000 to start selling it (which is a red flag).  The before and after pics are bull.  Ray Liotta is suing the company for using a fake before and after picture of him.  It is scary how many people are getting scammed from this product.</li>
            <li> First, if you are purchasing Nerium  products on this site, good luck. It is totally against Compliance &amp; you have no idea if you are getting the REAL thing. I used NeriumAD for 6 nights &amp; was overwhelmed by how my skin improved! Jumped right in as Brand Partner &amp; know for a fact that this is truly an amazing company with great people, support, compensation &amp; opportunity. If you are having any problems or just don&#x27;t like the smell, go back to the BP from whom you purchased. If they represent the company, you will get satisfaction.If they do nothing, report them. We do not take this lightly.&lt;br /&gt;Wishing you health &amp; happiness!</li>
            <li> I love the product. The product does what it says it would do.  I would recommend this product and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is not the same as what I got from Nerium, funny smell and different color. Very disappointed. Better to go directly through Nerium.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for two years.  I love it!&lt;br /&gt;I used to order it from a sales rep. Through you, it&#x27;s easier, faster &amp; cheaper!</li>
            <li> This product is highly advertised to remove or improve lines and wrinkles.  The thirty day trial will be up this week and I have no improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy it again due to my disappointment.</li>
            <li> Nerium is a good product. It feels like it tightens your skin immediately. You have to remember to wet your hands first or its very dry and hard to use. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nerium  for approximately 6 months - it has been good to my 59 yr old face :)</li>
            <li> I have a three-word review: the product stinks. I went to bed with it on one night and it smelled so bad, I had to wash it off within a half-hour. The next night, the same. Back to the saleslady, who gave me a hard time and said \\&quot;you&#x27;ll get used to it.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give me a break.</li>
            <li> Overpriced and dangerous.  Some people may be fine with this product but for those of you that have an allergic reaction, look out.  I used this product for three days and woke up with facial burns.  I stopped using it immediately and said “that’s a shame I had an allergic reaction”.  However, after another two days my skin started to peel and the redness just got worse.  So I saw my doctor and he informed me that the cream burnt my skin.  The sting I feel when just water hits my face and don’t let the sun hit it.&lt;br /&gt;I never used the four pumps that were recommended I only used two pumps of cream a day and yes I do have sensitive skin, However there should be a strong warning for anyone using this product.  It is two weeks later and I am still burnt around my eyes and down the left side of my face.&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, embrace your wrinkles the pain is not worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had three people approach me to buy Nerium.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up buying it from them and not Amazon.  Unfortunately it cost more buying it from my &amp;#34;friend&amp;#34; than Amazon is selling it for.  This cream is NOT a miracle cream.  There was no difference in my skin and I used it everyday.  Their claims are bogus!  Now I just have to forgive myself for falling for their marketing gimics.  Botox in a bottle--ha!  Ridiculous!  It just doesn&#x27;t work.  I wish it did!  I seldom give reviews but I had to on this product so hopefully, I can save someone some money.  It&#x27;s my good deed for the day.&lt;br /&gt;Like all MLM products:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Hey everyone--Turn your friends into customers.  Then lose your friends!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t trust my &amp;#34;friend&amp;#34; anymore.</li>
            <li> I am a Prime member and decided to pay extra money to get this and after waiting for a full whole day was told that it isn&#x27;t going to arrive. I asked how late and was told that it isn&#x27;t going to arrive at all. That they can process my refund on Tuesday and that I would get a measly 1 month extra on my Prime membership! So furious because i wasted my time!! Do not buy from this seller!!!</li>
            <li> Smells fine. Been using nightly for almost a month. Just ordered more and am trying the day cream too. I see results. Not miraculous but my skin looks smooth and nice with less notice fine wrinkles on my 59 year old face and neck.</li>
            <li> I am writing because of all the negative reviews on a product that really worked for me. I tried it for 5 days and saw a little improvement so I decided to give it a full 30 day try. I noticed a difference and was pleased with the results. It wasn&#x27;t till I took a look at my own before and after pictures that I realized just how amazing my results were. The pictures were taken on my own iPhone and never left my possession so I know they are the real deal! The improvement was obvious. My wrinkles were significantly reduced. My pores are pretty big and they were much smaller after using the product. My overall skin tone was much healthier and I lost that grey color to my skin. It is a healthy pink now. I actually like the smell. It has a natural botanical scent to it and not some artificial perfume smell. I studied Chemistry in college and work in the semiconductor field. I took a good look at the science behind Nerium and it is solid. I also had my good friend who is a renowned organic chemist look at the science and he confirmed my conclusion. The thing we both were impressed by is that there is no retinol in Nerium and yet they were able to get great results. Retinol is harsh stuff and almost every &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; product has it as a key ingredient. Another thing I love is that it is one product for all problems. My wife was using another product line and she had 7 different bottles on the sink for twice what I am paying for Nerium. She has since switched to Nerium and is very happy with her results as well. I have been using Nerium for 6 months now on an almost daily basis. I travel internationally frequently and sometimes miss a day here and there. I get my day cream and night cream for free because several of my friends are using it now as well and they let Nerium know I referred them. My friends are all happy with their results as well. I understand Nerium may not work as well for everyone but I think the harsh stuff some people are saying is more about the marketing and less about the product. Nerium works for me.marketing and less about the product. Nerium works for me.</li>
            <li> It deserves NO stars! A friend of mine sells this and I tried it, 1 night!!! I had it on my face 5 mins. The smell is terrible, and I felt like I put smelly tan clay on my face. Blech! Going back to what I have used for 8 years and LOVE...Prai. Best face products on the market. Hey, you got to try something once, and I did, never again. It doesnt smell or feel healthy at all, I couldnt wait to wash it off my face!</li>
            <li> I still look my age!!  It&#x27;s very drying  and I havnt noticed a visible improvement after consistent use. Y&lt;br /&gt;This is my second bottle.</li>
            <li> Honestly, don&#x27;t see any difference from a month ago. :(  Should I use longer??</li>
            <li> Started to have an allergic reaction to this product and had to stop using it..Caused swelling of my eyes, made my eyes watery and just wasn&#x27;t seeing the results after purchasing this in late November 2013.</li>
            <li> Decreased expectations of product</li>
            <li> For starters, NERIUM as a company prohibits this product being sold on Amazon.  Buying online you do not get the company guarentee and it has been discovered that products not sold by a brand partner have been altered even bottles filled with immation products.  If you buy from an honest partner, they will help you get your Nerium Free.  That much better than getting your product at a cheaper cost hoping you are not getting an altered product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I have been using both the night and day cream since March 2014 and I can tell a difference. I haven&#x27;t used the day cream in about 2 weeks because I forgot to order more, and my skin just doesn&#x27;t look the same. I have had numerous people compliment me on my face saying it looks different or that I am glowing (no I am not pregnant), so it is the cream. LOL. My pores are even showing more. The way it makes my skin feel is an added bonus for me. I read where some people complained about Nerium shipping it to them every 30 days which was apparently too soon for them. I would agree but, there is an option on the ordering website to change the time between shipments. I wasn&#x27;t really convinced after the first 30 days, but I still continued to use it and ended up being very happy. The only downside to me is that it is a little expensive. Another thing I figured out was that you don&#x27;t need 4 pumps like they recommend because 2 pumps works just fine. This allows you to get 6-8 weeks worth versus just 4.  Overall, this product is worth the money. It&#x27;s a face cream, not plastic surgery, so it isn&#x27;t going to make you look 10 years younger. It will make you look refreshed, your skin will look healthy, and help your skin look a little tighter for minimal wrinkles and sagging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI....I do not sell this product, nor do I get a discount on this product. I just wanted to share my experience with anyone who reads these posts. Mainly because the first ones I read were negative and that just wasn&#x27;t what I had experienced personally.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the worst product I have ever used.  I was under the care of an esthetician for 20 years with great results from microdermabrasions and salicytic and glycolic peels when she joined this group.  I have only been using Nerium for two weeks and my face is sagging for the first time in my life and I have bags under my eyes and on my chin and have NEVER had the fine lines I have since using this product.  I also believe it is a pyramid scheme as my esthetician wants me to sell it.  Also, I have never had pores visible on my face until now.</li>
            <li> I was terribly disappointed in this product.  Right off the bat, I was shocked at the smell.  It smells like rotting produce.  It wasn&#x27;t just the bottle I got either.  I heard the same from somebody else across the country!  I used it for two weeks straight even though I dreaded it every night, but then the pump stopped working and I couldn&#x27;t get any more out. Did I see any results after two weeks?  Not really.  Maybe if I had used it longer but I still can&#x27;t get the pump to work so it&#x27;s a waste.  I can&#x27;t believe I wasted so much money on this product.  I would never buy it again.</li>
            <li> People that get on here ranting and raving about how Nerium didn&#x27;t work either didn&#x27;t apply the alloted amount or purchased from Amazon or eBay (who knows what was in those bottles). Nerium and associates do NOT sell on Amazon nor eBay. Wondering if some of these comments are coming from angry competitors that can&#x27;t get their hands on our patented ingredient (until at least 2029). Interesting how Nerium showed a minimum of 30% improvement for EVERYONE IN EACH STUDY but not you? Weird. Those that are ignorant about an issue should educate themselves more before making a fool of themselves on the internet. Had you done that your comments would not be here.&lt;br /&gt;Also, haters will be haters soooooo I&#x27;m just gonna shake it off.&lt;br /&gt;Have an awesome day EVERYONE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nerium  rocks!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m liking it so far. I&#x27;ve noticed some of the lines are diminishing.</li>
            <li> I started using this product after my son started selling it. I had seen some negative reviews on here and I absolutely did not believe the product would work.  After three days I had hard waxy gunk coming out of my pores and at the end of 1 week my skin was so much smoother because my pores had been cleaned out. I&#x27;ve paid big money to skin aestheticians to do that and never had this kind of good result before! At the end of one month my skin was tighter and firmer. People were actually asking what it was doing different because they noticed I looked younger. I&#x27;ve spent thousands of dollars on laser skin treatments with minimal results. My skin was so red from the Rosacea I had been plagued with since my early twenties that my makeup barely covered. Now thanks to Nerium the  breakouts are almost gone, I&#x27;m sure if I didn&#x27;t eat chocolate and seafood, the two things that trigger my Rosacea I would be even better but I can&#x27;t resist... This product has helped me look younger, people say 10 years. It is safe! The Nerium company uses a patented process to extract the safe portion of the oleander plant so all these folks saying the plant is posion do not understand this. Yes, if you eat an oleander leaf that isn&#x27;t safe.  But this large of a company isn&#x27;t stupid. They aren&#x27;t going to sell something that&#x27;s dangerous!  I recommended it to my 76 year old mother who has many wrinkles from years of smoking. It has taken ten years off of her face in 60 days. I would never tell my mother to use this product if I thought there was a risk. And my husband has really bad sun-damaged skin. Age spots all over his face.... Within 1 month those places were half faded. After 4 months now they are almost gone. Again I was mad at my son when he first approached me with this product, but it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used on my skin!  I looked at the negative reviews through the filter that separates negative reviews from positive, the negative reviews are largely from \\&quot;Unverified Users\\&quot; meaning there is no way to know if the people even purchased this product. There are many competitors in the skin product market that aren&#x27;t happy to see that Nerium has a product that is so amazing. I am disappointed that Amazon is allowing just anyone to put a review on here.  Try it for yourself but I do suggest you go to a reputable Nerium distributor. You don&#x27;t  know how long this product has been sitting on the shelf or if it has been exposed to sun and heat. I&#x27;ve heard that can destroy the effectiveness of the product.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It works better than I was expecting.</li>
            <li> the bottle was half empty  didn&#x27;t have a plug in top, very disappointed for it was the third time I have ordered this product and it is expensive to only get a half bottle.</li>
            <li> So far after 1 mo. I have noticed no difference in my lines on my face. I have been using it on my chest also and perhaps an improvement there. I will use the bottle up but don&#x27;t know yet if I&#x27;ll get another.</li>
            <li> I was so excited by the presentation I went to, I jumped in to being a brand partner without even trying the product! Very convincing pictures and enthusiasm. I convinced 2 friends to try it and within 2 weeks one had a major reaction that lasted 4 weeks. The other had no improvement so I bought their bottles from them. I was intimidated by the pressure to have parties and market the product without really seeing much improvement in my own skin after 2 months. I cancelled my contract but they wouldn&#x27;t take the product back for the same reasons everyone else has been told. Because I had 4 bottles, I continued using the product one squirt every night on very wet skin and after one year, still like it better than any other product I have or have tried. I only use one squirt (rather than 3-4) and using it this way a bottle lasts 3-4 months. I don&#x27;t see any improvement in my pigmentation (only laser does that effectively) but I like the non greasy feel and slight tightness it gives my skin. As for wrinkles and lines, I&#x27;m 68 and have had other work done on my face that reduced the deep lines, but I think I see minor improvement from Nerium; not enough that people tell me I look 10 years younger! I detest multi level marketing and don&#x27;t know how so many can do it with all the negative product reviews. I am going to continue using the product but would never again try and convince anyone else that it is the miracle cure for wrinkles, lines or pigmentation. Daily sun screen, hydration, healthy diet, and other modalities (laser, peels, Botox) work better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over 3 weeks and I LOVE it!  I now have to share with hubby too because he doesn&#x27;t want forehead lines ifi don&#x27;t have them!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for months now, and the results are phenomenal!! I may feel old, but my face looks 20 years younger.</li>
            <li> Wife swears by the stuff. So if you gotta wife...get it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see any benefit from it</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 3 months and have experienced none of the reported benefits.  The only beneficial thing about this type of product is that you develop a nightly skin care routine which in return is healthier for your skin.</li>
            <li> I was out of this product in less than a couple of weeks or so. When I opened the bottle there was another smaller bottle inside. This company is stealing! There is not enough product in it! Nerium AD is a scam!!</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and it showed up as expected.</li>
            <li> It arrived as sceduled and it was exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> This product works. It&#x27;s okay if you don&#x27;t like it, it&#x27;s not for everyone. If you have ANY interest in buying this product find a brand partner NOT from a random stranger off of AMAZON. This company is all about integrity so if someone is selling it on here, they&#x27;re not being honest. If someone wanted to sell their product to just get &amp;#34;rid&amp;#34; of it. You can easily do that without having to go to Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have my own before and after pics if you want to see them. Contact me. Yes, I&#x27;m a brand partner, yes, I fully 100% endorse Nerium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my husband&#x27;s Amazon account. My name is Anna Brainard!!</li>
            <li> I tried this and it does work if you continue to use it. I slowly discontinued use (for me it is too expensive). Within a week my skin started to return to the way it was prior to using it. So if you don&#x27;t mind using this for the rest of your life, then go for it.</li>
            <li> It was a gift to someone else</li>
            <li> I swear by this product - I have been using it for 60 days now and have seen a considerable change in my face and neck.  I am 74 and did not think anything would help me at this age, but this is the first product I have tried that does help.</li>
            <li> Complete scam. Stay away.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this product. Love what it does for the texture of my skin. Arrives quickly and never disappoints.</li>
            <li> This is a spendy product, but I do notice healthier, younger skin.  If you have the money, this product delivers as promised</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t used this product long enough to warrant results b/c the smell is SO horrendous.  take heed....it&#x27;s some wicked stinky stuff.  i wish i could get use to the smell to see how well it worked, but it&#x27;s just to much.  it has a very industrial stench.</li>
            <li> I will have used this product 4 weeks May 22.  Have not seen the results yet from all the photos online have shown.  Am trying to decide if I should go one more round but my bottle still has some left.  I want to use all the product before&lt;br /&gt;I make a judgement call.  For now, I am not impressed yet and do not have the luminous skin I so desire.</li>
            <li> This product seemed starting working, then the bottle was finished in less than a month.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly it is not worth the money. I would not recommend to any one at all.</li>
            <li> Im not sure about this product yet.  I can say that while it is on, your face feels tight and looks better ( but you wouldn&#x27;t wear it out!). The smell is off putting.  For this reason I only use it when I&#x27;m on the road (read: not sleeping next to my man). This is probably also the reason I haven&#x27;t experienced amazing results.  I will say, it does seem to be doing something.</li>
            <li> Ever notice why people don&#x27;t move forward in life? Negative sells! After reading this depressing review how the person had to bash the Nerium company because they fell apart when &amp;#34; Nerium didn&#x27;t work for me&amp;#34; bit. I had to say this &amp;#34;Hello, Nerium didn&#x27;t fail you, you failed yourself!&amp;#34; If you have ever worked or even started your own business you will know you have to apply yourself 100% to receive results and yes it also takes time to build enough to be able to spend more quality time with your family! In anything you do! Your absolutely right every product isn&#x27;t for everyone, but it is for someone obviously! Wake up people don&#x27;t let the negative world convince you that it&#x27;s wrong to form your own decisions! Why go and listen to a person who obviously didn&#x27;t apply themselves and has to put blame somewhere else to feel better about themselves. You call her honest? Let&#x27;s call it what she really is Angry and Selfish! Her hidden agenda is I&#x27;m mad because I failed myself so I&#x27;m going to bash the company for my failure and disappointments! The quote &amp;#34;your on Fire&amp;#34; actually works great on her agenda. If you applied yourself as hard in your business as the anger of writing this review perhaps you would achieve in building something bigger and better! Maybe the product did stop working for her, well then just state the real facts. Why did it stop working? I have to ask did she really use it every night and day? Maybe since she was using it became too routine that she wasn&#x27;t using as often anymore. I mean really you could ask away so many questions. Although, if you live and die on others negative opinions and not try anything on your own then perhaps it&#x27;s not the reviewer with the problem?&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s be straight here ladies! You want to go cheap you will get cheap! You can&#x27;t be guaranteed that this product is the genuine thing because your buying it from a non brand partner. It&#x27;s like going to China and buying the off brand instead of going to Macy&#x27;s and buying the real thing. If you don&#x27;t buy the real thing how can you place judgement on any product that you haven&#x27;t given a real chance to? I read so many reviews here thinking I can get an idea in which I could get this product for cheaper and only found comments that made it clear I have to buy from a brand partner to get the real thing! If your disappointed with what you bought, maybe ask yourself &amp;#34; Why am so cheap?&amp;#34; You want to see real results, but don&#x27;t want to make the real commitment to buying the real thing. Well then you will get what you paid for ! &amp;#34;Buyer Beware&amp;#34; is a good statement to people who don&#x27;t buy the real thing! You want to blame others for your failure of your own judgement. Many woman want to see results NOW, but don&#x27;t want to take the time to take care of the real problem. How long did it take for you to damage your skin? Well think how long could it take to repair it. Why did my skin get a bad rash? Think about all that nasty stuff that the product has to get rid of from not taking care of your face properly. All these crazy reviews, but only one good thing came from this. Don&#x27;t buy off the market products! Wow and if your still thinking cheap? &amp;#34;What? I can get my product for free if I buy from a brand partner?&amp;#34; Going Direct to Nerium!</li>
            <li> I really liked this product.</li>
            <li> I have used the Nerium night cream for a year now.  I am someone who does not use a lot of beauty products but was not liking what aging was doing to my skin.  My skin was feeling thinner, I was getting the puckers around my mouth, and my family has the brown spots develop as we get older, to mention a few.  Within a week, the skin on my face felt more supple and that continued to improve.  The puckers around my mouth diminished considerably as I continued to use the night cream, and the brown spots have softened to be barely discernible.  My skin has a glow to it.  I am someone who deals with the bottomline.  Truth is truth, and I will not exaggerate for love or money.&lt;br /&gt;  I have not been pressured to &amp;#34;sale&amp;#34; nor would I associate with someone who would do that.  However now that I have some time, I will tell people my story as I choose to do so.&lt;br /&gt;  Regarding negative reviews.  If it does not work for you, then that is the way it is.  No product works for 100% of the people.  You do not have to be mean about it.  Nerium does work for over a million people as evidenced by the fact that the company had the largest growth in their first year than any other company of its kind.&lt;br /&gt;  I suggest that you get the product from someone that you trust, and you will have the 30 day money back guarantee.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my skin immediately.  I am 72 years old.  In good health and in fact, while I have my share of wrinkles, I have fairly good skin.  (I wish I had taken \\&quot;before\\&quot; pictures to share here, but I didn&#x27;t).  Over the years I have used a variety of treatments but felt that my skin was looking \\&quot;tired\\&quot; and, well -- old and I found that, after only TWO nights of use, I actually noticed a difference in my appearance.  I would call that an \\&quot;immediate improvement.\\&quot;  I have been using it for three weeks now.  Have my wrinkles \\&quot;disappeared?\\&quot;  Of course not. But the overall appearance of my skin has been markedly improved.  It looks more \\&quot;moist\\&quot; and \\&quot;dewy\\&quot; and \\&quot;alive.\\&quot;  My husband noticed it without my even mentioning it.  So - for me this is a terrific product and, while a little pricey, worth it.  BUT -- notice that I have said \\&quot;FOR ME\\&quot; this is a terrific product.  It is my thinking that just like medicine, exercise, diet, (and even bathing suits), etc., when it comes to skin care products -- ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL.  That is - what \\&quot;fits\\&quot; me does not necessarily \\&quot;fit\\&quot; you.  No matter what the manufacturer tells you.  YOU HAVE TO KEEP LOOKING AND TRYING AND TESTING UNTIL YOU FIND THE PRODUCT THAT WORKS FOR YOU!!!  My skin is not exactly like yours -- or yours - or yours - I don&#x27;t care what the tests in the laboratories have \\&quot;proven\\&quot; -- The bottom line is I am saying that based on the results I personally had, I gave it 5 stars and I think this product is worth you giving it a try.  It may fit/work for you -- on the other hand, it may not.  It is possible, just possible, that you are someone who DOES happen to have skin like mine and that you will benefit virtually overnight from it&#x27;s use.  If you do not - well, as Bob Dylan says, keep what you like and leave the rest.  In other words, move on to find another product that will do for you what this one did for me.  At its worst it won&#x27;t \\&quot;hurt\\&quot; you - and if you are thinking about this product, you are probably someone who is not horrified at the thought of spending this kind of money for face cream in the first place! (LOL)!  (BTW, I buy it from Amazon because I can use my points - which reduces the cash outlay considerably).    It is now December and am back here after almost six months to give an update on this product.  The bottom line is last week I gave away my last half bottle to a friend who had been approached by a distributer.  Yep.  I gave it to her and told her to try it first and not spend her money on it.  Yes.  I did get a noticeable difference within the first few days.  But after that - NOTHING.  And wrinkles??? Are you kidding???  It did absolutely nothing after almost 6 months of consistent, regular use.  Maybe it works for people with younger skin than mine. Who knows.  I can no longer recommend it at all.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my skin. I still have the same wrinkles and acne scars. I was really hoping after all of the reviews that this would be the answer.😔</li>
            <li> My favorite night cream ever that I cannot live without! And I&#x27;ve tried them all!</li>
            <li> I was approached by a friend about 18-months ago to try nerium and become a brand partner.  I was skeptical and decided at the age of 29, I didn&#x27;t need to worry about fine lines and wrinkles just yet.  About a year later, I noticed my skin was starting to breakout a lot more, adult acne I was told.  My skin was amazing through my teens and twenties, but once I hit 30 it took a turn for the worst.  My friend who was still selling nerium, and doing very well I might add, chimed in on a facebook post I wrote about needing help with my skin.  She mentioned how nerium could do all the things I was asking for.  I gave in, and paid what I thought to be a high cost, for a product I was trusting to clear my acne and improve my skin.  Well, it did all of that and then some.  It took someone telling me that I was glowing for me to actually look at a before and after picture of myself.  Yes, my results aren&#x27;t significant, but they are better than before and my skin feels better.  After using the product for almost six months, I decided last night to become a brand partner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my two-cents, all skin products are not alike and what works for me may not work for you, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s a bad product.  I can bash all sorts of skin products left and right about how it didn&#x27;t work as suggested, but I don&#x27;t because not all skin types are the same.  Nerium is an expensive product, but so is Lancome and Clinque and Murad.  Go to the mall and ask for some anti-aging/acne products and I bet you will spend closer to $200 for a 30-day supply.  The product does work for some, but not all.  Just like some antibiotics work for some, but not all.  Instead of bashing the product, try letting people know why it didn&#x27;t work for you and then tell us what HAS WORKED FOR YOU.  I think that is the biggest thing in writing a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are going to give it one star, tell me what you give five stars to for face cream.</li>
            <li> I bought NeriumAD A little over 6 weeks ago. At first it was love at first site. This is hands down the best face cream I’ve ever used. The results were airbrushed looking skin. After 4 weeks of use the love affair started to end, I just didn’t know it yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little background first – I’m a healthy 32 year old woman with no skin allergies or skin issues (other than the beginnings of aging). I have no health issues of any kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So 3 weeks ago I began vomiting. It wasn’t every single day, it was every second or third day. I would be EXTREMELY nauseous during the day but would vomit at night. I went to the doctor twice and had multiple blood tests done. My hormones and electrolytes were normal. No bacteria was present, and I was not/am not pregnant. Also, my thyroid function was normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally connected the dots after reading this article and others. Oh, and after I noticed I began burping up bile within 5 minutes of putting on the night cream. At that point it all came together. I immediately washed my face and within 10 minutes I no longer felt sick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I was only getting nauseous every couple of days is because I was only using the face cream then. My skin was dry due to the cold weather, so most days I was using my regular Philosophy moisturizer. I only became nauseous and vomited after using NeriumAD! I stopped using the product 1 week ago and haven’t vomited since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onto the next issue….while my thyroid function is normal my thyroid was enlarged. An ultrasound confirmed I now have thyroiditis. I’ve never before had thyroid issues. I suspect the inflammation in my thyroid is also due to NeriumAD. I will be discussing it with my endocrinologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an attorney I fully expect to see a products liability case in the next few years when people start seeing the long term side effects.</li>
            <li> This product is no different from any other age defying products I have tried in the past. It claims to be able to make fine lines and wrinkles disappear but doesn&#x27;t really help. I think we all hope that we have found something that finally is able to help us look younger. But it&#x27;s just a placebo effect,in a couple wks the skin ends up looking the same as before. This is no fountain of youth. Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I used this for a month and really saw nothing. I did not buy again. I think it&#x27;s a lot of hype.</li>
            <li> This product has no \\&quot;age defying\\&quot; capability.  It is sold by multi-level marketers who make money from recruiting other sellers.  The claims that are made, including the positive reviewers on this page, merely generate money for the promoter and are not meant to accurately reflect its benefits.  I know of five people that have used this product, including myself.  No one that I am aware, including other sellers, has seen any noticeable change in the condition of their skin.</li>
            <li> Rating this prouct 3 stars because I&#x27;m just not seeing results that I expected within 30 days.  All the promo ads show men/women with dramatic improvement to their skin.  Is this just another very overpriced cream that really doesn&#x27;t do more than any other less expensive product?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, however, I will most likely purchase another bottle of Nerium in the hopes of seeing positive results.  I am a sucker it appears.</li>
            <li> very drying to my wife&#x27;s skin, actually seemed  more wrinkled, though did tend to decrease brown spots. I don&#x27;t think we will reorder.</li>
            <li> It worked really well for me. My skin is renewed. No other product that I&#x27;ve used in the past have given me these results. I have been using it for 3 months and will continue.</li>
            <li> Ive been using Nerium for a few years now and love it.  In the first few months I notice the fine lines disappearing and my skin tightening which is a miracle at age 52.  The down side is that after awhile it stops working, so I go off of it for a month or two and then come back.  This seems to capture the good results again.  I adore this product but do wish it kept on working.  I guess there is always a negative, still this product does deliver</li>
            <li> I can see the difference in my face....I like it and will continue to use it....&lt;br /&gt;Hoping to get more better result later...</li>
            <li> I tried using this product for a few weeks with no results.  Maybe I didn&#x27;t try it long enough, but I was expecting to see some, even a little, improvement.  I gave up on the product not only because of the lack of results, but also because I could not get past its horrible scent.  Needless to say, I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Use this at night in conjunction with the Nerium day cream.  I, personally ,have seen a difference in my forehead lines, minimizing of the large pores in the &amp;#34;T zone&amp;#34; on my face.  Also dramatic reduction in smile lines at edges of my mouth. Do not use on marionette lines, not needed.  However, every area on my face and neck that I&#x27;ve used it, I&#x27;ve been happy. Several comments from friends who are unaware of my &amp;#34;routine&amp;#34;.  Again, I use the day cream AND the night cream.  Best price is from Amazon, and never a delivery or product issues when I purchase from Amazon.</li>
            <li> My complexion has cleared redness disappeared and overall youthful appearance is coming forth. I love this product.</li>
            <li> This product on my 67 year old skin that has seen many seasons of LOTS of sun, is really doing a nice job. I feel like the wrinkles that have not already become really deep are smoothing out some. I don&#x27;t think there is a product that will get rid of those. I ordered the day and night cream from e-beauty shop thru amazon very happy. One order from a warehouse not the original product and it would not dispense.</li>
            <li> I do have to say that the smell of the product does take some adjusting to. If your purchase the item I recommend taking before and after pictures every 30 days. You will see results!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on day 5 of a free trial of this product. Take a look at my photo. This is only after 2 days! This stuff rocks. I am not only sold on the product but also the business plan.  I plan to become a Nerium Brand Partner ASAP!</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  This product really works shrinks pores, softens skin etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Nerium for over a year now and am pleased with the results.  This was a good price compared to what I have paid from the distributor.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my skin within a few weeks.  I have been using this product for a year and so many people tell me I have beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> All three products have given results; of course, in time though.  I did not age over night nor get dark spots overnight; however, been using products for over 2 months and seeing gradual results each month.  NO other products that I have dumped tons of money into have worked like NERIUM.  I am actually saving money too each month now because the night cream has taken the place of the entire skin care system I formally had been using.  People complain of tightness and smell, but in actuality the tightness is what I want and the smell isn&#x27;t bad and after a couple days you don&#x27;t even notice the plant smell at all.  One thing is for sure you can tell it is a natural product and I am seeing results!</li>
            <li> I used this product for 4 months and then it became too cost prohibitive to continue.  The only benefit I saw was clearer skin.&lt;br /&gt;I was curious about the fancy product container and took it part to find an inner little bottle that was  cleverly disguised to hold a very small amount of product.  $100 for that?  I don&#x27;t think so!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this..no visible results, small rash...not worth the money. Was shipped on time I have been using for a couple of wks. I think there are better items for the little amount for to much with no results.</li>
            <li> This product is the scam of the century if not the millennia.  It does NOT work.  I tried it for 30 days.  The person whom signed me up promised I would see results in 30 days.  After the 30 days were up she then said I needed to give it 90 days to see results.  I was not going to spend an additional $450.00 (the first 30 day trial costs $150.00 USD), to find out what I already knew from viewing photos of actual people whom were using the product.  It does NOT work.  The before and after photos that Nerium and all of their distributors use on their websites are fraudulent, they are not real, they are pictures which have been digitally enhanced. If you go on any of the Nerium distributors websites or Nerium convention photos, you will see tons and tons of people  who have horrible, old looking, sagging, skin with brown spots, wrinkles, and turkey necks. To make matters worse, have you noticed that most of the Nerium users have inflamed and irritated looking eyes!!   So you have to ask yourself the question -- if they are using their own product why don&#x27;t they look as good as their before and after photos look on the various Nerium advertising websites?  The answer is very clear - because the product does not work, it&#x27;s a scam, it&#x27;s a quack.  Your flushing your money down the drain or you are funding a new Lexus automobile for a Nerium distributor.    For $450.00 buy yourself an in home laser wand or go to a spa or dermatologist&#x27;s office to get laser skin resurfacing.  Or just get some good AHA (alpha hydroxy acid) cream to speed up sloughing of dead skins cells and brown spots.   You will see real and actual results.    You will never see any results by using Nerium.  The only result you will see is that  your credit card is being charged once a month for about $170.00 (with shipping) for a product that does NOT work!!  This is the NERIUM DELIRIUM! Don&#x27;t drink the cool aid kids.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews but after reading so much nonsense I can&#x27;t help but try to offer a very honest evaluation. First of all I want people to realize there are many &amp;#34;Multi-Level Marketing Anti-Aging Cream Wars&amp;#34; going on. Rodan and Fields and Seacret reps are probably the biggest haters of Nerium and I would not be surprised at all if researched we would find that a large portion of negative reviews here are biased in some manner towards Nerium through  competitors such as these. So please keep that in mind everyone when reading through the massive negative one star reviews posted here. Another bent is that some people possibly weren&#x27;t aware it was MLM and feel ripped off or scammed upon the discovery never having been exposed to that world as some of us have. I can understand that but to annihilate the product and try to destroy the credibility of this company having something that genuinely works is completely out of line ethically and realistically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 52 and had moderate sagging around my mouth neck eyes and mild sun damage resulting in crow&#x27;s feet and scaly cheeks. I tried Nerium after seeing a bottle on my Hairdressers station. I had to ask her about it about an hour into my service. She never pushed the product and was just informative. I decided to give it a try although I thought it was pricey at the time.(They do offer a customer incentive that if you refer three people you get yours free which was appealing to me at the time)  After six months of product use, I personally have seen decent results from something that comes out of a bottle without having to do anything else but wash and apply. It is not what I was hoping for but still the tightness and increase in skin elasticity is better than anything I have tried so far. My &amp;#34;turkey neck&amp;#34; has shrunk noticeably but is still gobbling more than I wish. The bags under my eyes are virtually gone but my upper eyelids had no noticeable change. My crows feet have diminished very slightly but I am in the  desert sun constantly so I feel for as much exposure as I get they look pretty good. I used to get mild laser peels regularly and was due for one before starting Nerium but I have not had to get one since using this as my skin tone has evened out and improved very nicely (No more scales). My pore size has definitely decreased but not disappeared and I have not noticed any &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; wrinkles forming anywhere which prior to the use of this product were rapidly advancing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I have reported these results to friends of the R&amp;F side they were incensed and tried desperately to persuade me that I am going to die from poisoning myself with Oleander. It really is ridiculous and shameful that they behave so badly. In all fairness my husband began using R&amp;F ( Reverse) at the same time. He hated the &amp;#34;regime&amp;#34; and all the time it took twice daily to use but has to admit we did see decent results with their product as well. And I agree that those I know using R&amp;F products have had nice improvement also. The cost (more than Nerium) and time commitment however he felt did not justify continued usage (for him). I would say each company has a decent enough product that you should be somewhat satisfied if you use it long enough and don&#x27;t have outrageous expectations. I think some of the reviewers are possibly told and actually believe they are going to look 20 years younger in 30 days and are furious that they feel they were swindled. (Please...ladies let&#x27;s be real!)  I have had minor problems with ordering through the website and cancelling items but nothing they weren&#x27;t more than willing to accommodate and rectify once communication was established. They have always been professional and apologetic. I know many people currently using the product and those that have tried it for a shorter time and not one has shared the outrage I read here. So I can&#x27;t understand the massive amount of slamming and am highly suspicious now. I have ordered the night cream for my Mother-in -law who is 80 and she has been using it very sparingly (2 pumps instead of the recommended 5) for 5 months. She has told me that people have asked her what she is using and that her skin looks terrific. I haven&#x27;t seen her yet so I can&#x27;t comment but I have seen incredible results on others that I personally know. They had tremendous wrinkles sagging and acne issues and the results for them were definitely more pronounced than what I have personally experienced.  My husband and children however have told me I look much better even though I don&#x27;t see it as much. Sometimes we are way too critical and notice every little flaw. So I am giving this product 5 stars to help counteract the ridiculous reviews although for me personally it is a 3 and a half to 4 star based on cost and my own results. I am satisfied with what I have seen and will continue to use it until something better comes along. This has been the best cream I have tried so far (in my budget).  I have had absolutely no reactions and neither has my Mother-in -law who loves the product and would rate it at 4 and a half to 5 stars. Bottom line to any one looking to buy; Please don&#x27;t be afraid to try it. Don&#x27;t allow the hardness of others to prevent you from experiencing a possibly great product that might work for you and make you feel a little better about yourself.  It may not be everything you were hoping but it is only cream in a bottle, not a plastic surgeon. If that&#x27;s what you are looking for don&#x27;t buy anything. Save up all that money you would have spent on any anti-aging products and get a facelift or even a Co2 Laser Peel. Honestly.</li>
            <li> A Good review- Ok, so a friend gave me a bottle to try. It sat on my counter for 3 months. I finally tired it. Her instructions were, leave your face dripping wet when you apply 4 pumps of the treatment. There is no water in the formula and your face and neck must be very wet. Let it dry, go to sleep. I took my before photos wearing no make up- on my cell phone. 30 days later, after using it every night I took another cell phone photo. I saw no difference in the mirror day to day. When I compared the photos I was shocked at the great result. I am 56 and my skin has sun damage. Some lines, like the ones on the top of my lips were gone. Some deep ones around my chin were greatly diminished and the bags under my eyes were gone. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different and there may be a lot of folks who took better care of their skin than I did. But I got great results. I signed up as a brand partner, I have not paid for my product for over 6 months. None of my customers have returned product. Not everyone who has sampled the products has purchased it, but that is to be expected. I love the products, my steadily growing business and the people I work with in the business.  Hope this was helpful! If you want to contact me for more info go to my web page and enter your email. softskin4U.nerium.com. BTW- Nerium will not give you a 30 Day money back guarantee if you buy on Amazon, as they have no control of the product, it&#x27;s age, or bottle contents.  Andrea</li>
            <li> This cream was more like a very drying mask. It burned and irritated my skin. I followed the directions and applied to damp skin. I tried to leave it on all night but had to get up during the night and rinse my face. Once I rinsed my face, it was red and irritated. I do have dry, sensitive skin so maybe this is not a typical reaction. But be warned if you have skin like mine! It also smelled terrible!</li>
            <li> This is the third time I&#x27;ve gotten the product, that won&#x27;t come out when I pump the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I have to pry the bottle open to get the stuff out, and it looked like it has been used.&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I&#x27;m paying a lot of money for a product that has been retured for the same problem</li>
            <li> I used this on the backs of my hands for the first time last night. Just a drop or two. About fifteen minutes later, I was covered in hives. Severe hives. Hives on top of hives. Sigh.    Yes, I have sensitive skin. I only used the bare minimum, as I know I sometimes have adverse reactions to new lotions and soaps. But, it&#x27;s been twenty four hours and I am still covered in hives. I am miserable.    I called this morning and asked for a refund. I was told that since more than thirty days had elapsed since I bought it, there was nothing they could do. I bought this from a dear friend who is a brand partner. I am not immune to the subtle manipulation that comes from knowing someone in a multi level marketing scheme. I bought it, and then it sat unopened for over a month. I didn&#x27;t really want to use it, but when she asked, I opened it and applied it. I wish I hadn&#x27;t, obviously.    Internet research shows this is derived from the oleander plant, which is highly toxic. It&#x27;s commonly used for suicide in places like Sri Lanka, where it grows. I have since put it out of reach of my kids, hoping that my emailed inquires may still lead to a refund, and they will want me to ship it back. But, please be careful if you have kids. A little on their skin or God forbid in their mouths could be very bad. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> The bottle did not work proper, very hard to come out! Very disappointed! Would love a new bottle or money back!!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product and it was pretty pricey.  When I received it, I used it the first night and could not use it again, because the pump on the bottle would not work!  I got in touch with the company and they were very kind and quick to give me a refund.  I believe the container I bought was defective.</li>
            <li> I feel it is making my skin tighter and wrinkles show less.  It is convenient and east to use.  Good that you put it on at bedtime.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this for free. Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work for me. In fact, by the third day, I had developed an itchy, sore rash all over my face. It also had a strong, unattractive smell to it. From my experience, it&#x27;s not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Can definitely see a change slow change but still getting lighter</li>
            <li> i purchased this product because i heard all the buzz and reviews going around for it, including mentions from friends; so my expectations were there.&lt;br /&gt;the packaging and bottle is nice, and the cream smells and feels delightful.&lt;br /&gt;but the truth is, i didn&#x27;t notice any difference on my skin for the better if anything compared to over-the-counter creams (less expensive -  I use Aveeno night cream and I feel i get more benefit from that) . I did notice that i would get a zit here and there. I thought it may have been coincidence, so i stopped/started TWICE and yup, a couple small zits (not acne or breakouts) returned and in different spots.&lt;br /&gt;My skin didn&#x27;t seem tighter or smoother. I&#x27;m sure this works wonders for many people, but unfortunately I&#x27;m not one of them.&lt;br /&gt;As with everything, you just have to try for yourself.</li>
            <li> I used the product for several weeks and not only did I have major breakouts all over my face, but my skin actually hurt to touch. Maybe the product worked for other people but it wasn&#x27;t the right match for me. Especially not for the price they ask</li>

Topical aloe appears to inhibit infection and promote healing of minor burns and wounds, frostbite, as well as in skin affected by diseases such as psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis.&lt;br /&gt;  There is also a lot of interest in using hyaluronic acid to prevent the effects of aging. In fact, hyaluronic acid has been promoted as a &amp;#34;fountain of youth.&amp;#34; Its the only known ingredient to man that will hold up to 1000 times its own weight in water.... it naturally hydrates the skin.and holds the moisture. Hyaluronic acid works by acting as a cushion and lubricant in tissue. In addition, it might affect the way the body responds to oxidative stress; which is the number ONE cause of aging on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;  oleander extract has a principal cytotoxic compound which is known to result in induction of apoptosis ( cell death)&lt;br /&gt;  There are two ways that a cell can die: necrosis and apoptosis. Necrosis occurs when a cell is damaged by an external force, such as sun damage, poison, or injury, an when cells die from necrosis, it&#x27;sa rather messy affair. (in short free radicals cause oxidative damage) That kind of death causes inflammation and wide variety of cellular stresses such as UV and ionizing radiation and heat stress.&lt;br /&gt;  Apoptosis, on the other hand, is relatively civil, even though it may not sound so at first -- when a cell dies from apoptosis, the cleanup is much easier. This cell death follows a controlled, predictable routine.&lt;br /&gt;  Oleander releases cytochrome C, its used as a model protein for molecular evolution improving cell health. Vitamin A helps in smoothing out the skin and combined with Nae8 works to reduce dark spots&lt;br /&gt;  All the ingredients in Nerium AD synergisticly Increase blood circulation and cell energy production for brighter, glowing skin.&lt;br /&gt;  Nae8 inhibits activation of NF-KB plays a key role in regulating the immune response to infection (κ light chains are critical components of immunoglobulins)&lt;br /&gt;  I image this function was key to Neriums BioTechnologies beginnings in cancer research. Utilizing this biotechnology research and breakthrough technology, NBI continues to harness the unique and effective properties of nature’s botanical compounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I am a medical esthetician of 15 years. I hope this answers some of the questions HOW Nerium AD it scientifically reduce wrinkles and promote skin health for a more youthful appearance.  I use and promote Nerium !  and I am blessed by the business model as well.</li>
            <li> I had tried Murad prior to ordering Nerium and that was terrible.  It&#x27;s only been a month on Nerium but I have seen some improvement on the redness around my nose and cheeks and it works quite well on my chest where I wrinkle easily.  I have high hopes for further improvement.</li>
            <li> This product is for helping reduce fine lines etc ... but what it actually did was clear up my everyday acne and all my hormonal acne which I&#x27;ve never been able to get rid of ........ this is the third bottle I&#x27;ve used of Nerium ... as soon as I stop using it I notice my skin start to look more dull and my hormonal acne starts to kick in again ... each bottle lasts me about 3 month with daily use, as i use it every NIGHT before bed ... although I avoid the eye area .. the texture of the cream irritated my eyes ... but it&#x27;s done wonders for the rest of my face !!!!! I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT !!!!! I have another girlfriend who shares the same results with her acne ... she couldn&#x27;t believe the results !!!!</li>
            <li> NERIUM CREAM HAS IMPROVED THE TEXTURE OF MY COMPLECTION.  I like it very much and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I am grateful to have met this product.&lt;br /&gt;I was suffering from severe acne for 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;I went to see doctors and tried all kinds of products for&lt;br /&gt;acne. Nothing worked for me....&lt;br /&gt;This is my 3rd bottle since I stared using it.&lt;br /&gt;I got my clean skin back ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Nerium</li>
