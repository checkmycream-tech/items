            <li>I love Thierry Mugler perfumes &amp; when Womanity came out I was hooked!</li>
            <li>The best part of wearing a really good scent is when you catch a whiff of it as you turn your head or move your arm and think, \\&quot;Wow!  </li>
            <li>It smells amazing</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t pick up any amber/musky night kind of vibes from it.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I had never heard of this perfume, but my daughter loves it and was thrilled with the gift.</li>
            <li>I loved the uniqueness of the fig/sea salt kind of combination in a scent, which is very rare.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my daughter at Christmas and it is one of her favorite colognes.</li>
            <li>My husband says it reminds him of our favorite vacation spot, a lakeside, at night.</li>

            <li>And the packaging...beautiful bottle and innovative magnetic cap which is attached by a chain.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of men&#x27;s Aqua Di Gio but has a more feminine (sp?) accent.</li>
            <li>jack&amp;rose titanic type of love with this.</li>
            <li>but when I got it was so happy to be reunited with the real deal.</li>

            <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE Angel.  </li>
            <li>Love the product; it shipped speedily and I have had no problems.  </li>
            <li>The price was fabulous and I got it earlier than estimated which was great and</li>
            <li>Sooooo happy to finally have it.</li>
            <li>The bottle is fun and its reusable which is even better.</li>
            <li>I have brands like Hermes Givenchy Versace Balenciaga Prada Bvlgari Hanae and a whole lot more but none of those top my baby Thierry.</li>
            <li>I used up my sample while on the trip, had to cajole my daughter into giving me hers, then had to run out and get a full sized bottle.  </li>
            <li>It has a really cool bottle too.</li>
            <li>But not that sickly sweet or fruity smell that gets on your nerves.  </li>
            <li>Order arrived quickly and in protective packaging.</li>
            <li>Quick shipment, would recommend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>for the most part its not too strong but it last forever, fresh and feminine.</li>
            <li>But I wear it all year round lol.</li>
            <li>The original was a very light wash of yellow</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how to explain it right.</li>
            <li>So when I first smelled this I though it was too salty.</li>
            <li>, I decided to ride it out and now, four hours later, I love this perfume.</li>
            <li>First sampled this product in Spain, searched perfume stores for a couple of months without finding it.</li>
            <li>Scent is exactly as I found the sample to be.</li>
            <li>The first I stole from my sister</li>
            <li>I told them I was willing to get the one display</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the real deal!</li>
            <li>It has a lighter smell than Angel, not quiet like Angel, softer a more flowery smell.  </li>
            <li>will say that it has good lasting power as a scent, and was noticeable several hours after spraying.&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first I thought it wasn&#x27;t authentic due to the fragrance leaving so fast but from trying one at the store</li>
            <li>I was ready to scrub it off but then, knowing Mugler is a genius</li>
            <li>This is probably my 8th bottle &amp; ready to buy another.</li>
            <li>Whenever I wear this I get at least 5 compliments a day of how good I smell.</li>
            <li>the initial citrus and the caviar note is what really makes this unique.  </li>
            <li>and I wanted something different and special for my wedding day.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This isn&#x27;t so much of a romantic scent as more of a slightly fishy/figgy clean beachy scent.</li>
            <li>I love the way the scent calms down after</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new trademark.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find it in stores where I live</li>
            <li>When my first bottle finished I went to Bloomingdales to get a new one, took it home and realized the one in the new box didn&#x27;t smell the same.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m fully aware that this is entirely subjective!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty stuck on my old, stand-by fragrances but thought I&#x27;d try the sample for something different.  </li>
            <li>U can smell the sweet feminine wood scent, such a womanly fragrance!</li>
            <li>They were so surprised I could tell the difference</li>
            <li>to me it smelled like the old  &#x27;evening in Paris&#x27;  </li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite perfumes, but it&#x27;s not available locally.</li>
            <li>Yes it&#x27;s strange, I think of a sea cow whenever I hear the name and that obviously is not too sexy.</li>
            <li>I smelled this scent and then compared it to my other favorite scents, Euphoria (CK), Bulgari Black, Hugo Boss Intense for Women, and Hugo Boss Deep Red for Women, and</li>
            <li>Spicy and almost peppery, very sultry.</li>

            <li> The scent is long lasting, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Ive used this everyday since I received it and this will be my new go to perfum.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time on the skin and wears well.  </li>
            <li> significant other never liked the smell and complained that it smelled like Pine Sol and doctor&#x27;s offices, an artificial kind of woody smell, which I didn&#x27;t agree with.&lt;br /&gt;Body</li>
            <li> It has a unique scent that isn&#x27;t a boring flowery, sweet scent...</li>
            <li> Maybe Mugler will release a few different takes on this one like he did with Angel.</li>
            <li> And it was pink.</li>
            <li> And a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I used this opportunity to open it and fill a small spray bottle to have at work, it I need to freshen up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> after smelling this perfume other perfumes/colognes were like a joke to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about the strange, salty opening notes on me.</li>
            <li> The thing is they had the real deal on display and was selling the fake ones.</li>
            <li> But you either love Angel or hate it.  </li>
            <li> I think its not available everywhere</li>
            <li> I have a lot of perfumes and colognes and I&#x27;m looking at them like what a waste of money.</li>
            <li> But I wear it everyday</li>
            <li> The bottle looks weird, but you can actually refill it, rather than throwing the bottle away.</li>
            <li> I personally think the ones in the store that are refillable smells so fruity and fake.</li>
            <li> However, when I bought it later, I just found that the smell started to irritate me and I eventually found it to be somewhat unpleasant.</li>
            <li> This perfume is very complex and LASTS</li>

            <li> Bought this for my daughter at Christmas and it is one of her favorite colognes. I think its not available everywhere</li>
            <li> So when I first smelled this I though it was too salty. I was ready to scrub it off but then, knowing Mugler is a genius, I decided to ride it out and now, four hours later, I love this perfume. My husband says it reminds him of our favorite vacation spot, a lakeside, at night. I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about the strange, salty opening notes on me. Maybe Mugler will release a few different takes on this one like he did with Angel. The longer I wear this the more I think I need a bottle.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I received samples of this in NYC last year.  I&#x27;m pretty stuck on my old, stand-by fragrances but thought I&#x27;d try the sample for something different.  I used up my sample while on the trip, had to cajole my daughter into giving me hers, then had to run out and get a full sized bottle.  I love the way the scent calms down after the initial citrus and the caviar note is what really makes this unique.  I&#x27;m definitely hooked!  The best part of wearing a really good scent is when you catch a whiff of it as you turn your head or move your arm and think, \\&quot;Wow!  That smells amazing!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Definitely my go-to fall fragrance. Spicy and almost peppery, very sultry. And the packaging...beautiful bottle and innovative magnetic cap which is attached by a chain. Looks great sitting on my dresser, almost like a piece of art!</li>
            <li> First sampled this product in Spain, searched perfume stores for a couple of months without finding it. Finally ordered via Amazon. Sooooo happy to finally have it. Scent is exactly as I found the sample to be. It&#x27;s my new trademark. Order arrived quickly and in protective packaging.</li>
            <li> This scent is wonderful! It reminds me of men&#x27;s Aqua Di Gio but has a more feminine (sp?) accent. The bottle is fun and its reusable which is even better. Ive used this everyday since I received it and this will be my new go to perfum. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes, but it&#x27;s not available locally. The scent is long lasting, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Smells different to everyone! I have been told I smell like apple pie, floral musk, and cucumbers. This perfume is very complex and LASTS oh gosh! I spray it on at 6am and coworkers ask what smells so good at like 4pm!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it! Do not be off put by the name and the bottle. Yes it&#x27;s strange, I think of a sea cow whenever I hear the name and that obviously is not too sexy. The bottle looks weird, but you can actually refill it, rather than throwing the bottle away. I used this opportunity to open it and fill a small spray bottle to have at work, it I need to freshen up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yay!</li>
            <li> Loved it! Smells so good! I get plenty of compliments... U can smell the sweet feminine wood scent, such a womanly fragrance!</li>
            <li> Yes I love this scent stays on forever!!! 😍😍</li>
            <li> Best smelling perfume on earth 😳 This perfume was made for me 😳After smelling this I fell head over heels jack&amp;rose titanic type of love with this. after smelling this perfume other perfumes/colognes were like a joke to me. This is my second bottle. The first I stole from my sister lol she is a perfume/cologne junkie When my first bottle finished I went to Bloomingdales to get a new one, took it home and realized the one in the new box didn&#x27;t smell the same. And it was pink. The original was a very light wash of yellow I took it back and told them it smelled different. They said they both smell the same to them. The thing is they had the real deal on display and was selling the fake ones. I told them I was willing to get the one display even tho it was used up but you know they said no 😏 They then blindfolded me in the store lol they had me smell the one on display then made me smell coffee beans then made me smell the one in the box. They were so surprised I could tell the difference lol I personally think the ones in the store that are refillable smells so fruity and fake. I&#x27;ve become a Thierry Mugler womanity insanity lol I know my baby. When purchasing this I was so scared but when I got it was so happy to be reunited with the real deal. Whenever I wear this I get at least 5 compliments a day of how good I smell. When I wore the one I purchased from Bloomingdales I got none. That was another reason I knew it wasn&#x27;t the same.  Womanity just how that sounds. I have a lot of perfumes and colognes and I&#x27;m looking at them like what a waste of money. I have brands like Hermes Givenchy Versace Balenciaga Prada Bvlgari Hanae and a whole lot more but none of those top my baby Thierry. It&#x27;s also the best sent for winter. But I wear it all year round lol.</li>
            <li> The price was fabulous and I got it earlier than estimated which was great and A Place Of Beauty had a cute personalized card in there with my perfume along with a keychain perfume and a sachet to put my perfume in and it&#x27;s refillable! 😃 absolutely awesome  definitely ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite fragrances. Its fruity and warm--very sexy! I receive a lot of compliments when I wear it. And a little goes a long way. Lasts all day.</li>
            <li> this stuff was a gift for my daughter in law  she loved it.  to me it smelled like the old  &#x27;evening in Paris&#x27;  need i say more</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for my girlfriend and I love the smell. Seems authinic and it lasted all day. Quick shipment, would recommend.</li>
            <li> I found this fragrance to be delightful very rich! I receive several compliments! At first I thought it wasn&#x27;t authentic due to the fragrance leaving so fast but from trying one at the store it&#x27;s the real deal! Thank you and I apologize for doubting!!!</li>
            <li> It has been the best for me, so all depends on your body chemistry...for the most part its not too strong but it last forever, fresh and feminine.</li>
            <li> I love Thierry Mugler perfumes &amp; when Womanity came out I was hooked! It smells amazing &amp; I get so many compliments on it. It has a unique scent that isn&#x27;t a boring flowery, sweet scent...it&#x27;s amazing! This is probably my 8th bottle &amp; ready to buy another. I can&#x27;t find it in stores where I live so I always order it from Amazon. Wonderful perfume!</li>
            <li> Tested this in SLC airport and then bought it online. I loved the uniqueness of the fig/sea salt kind of combination in a scent, which is very rare. However, when I bought it later, I just found that the smell started to irritate me and I eventually found it to be somewhat unpleasant. I smelled this scent and then compared it to my other favorite scents, Euphoria (CK), Bulgari Black, Hugo Boss Intense for Women, and Hugo Boss Deep Red for Women, and this scent just didn&#x27;t match up at all. However, I&#x27;m fully aware that this is entirely subjective!&lt;br /&gt;I will say that it has good lasting power as a scent, and was noticeable several hours after spraying.&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t so much of a romantic scent as more of a slightly fishy/figgy clean beachy scent. I don&#x27;t pick up any amber/musky night kind of vibes from it.&lt;br /&gt;My significant other never liked the smell and complained that it smelled like Pine Sol and doctor&#x27;s offices, an artificial kind of woody smell, which I didn&#x27;t agree with.&lt;br /&gt;Body chemistry is everything!</li>
            <li> Product arrived as described.  Great price and great fragrance.  It lasts a long time on the skin and wears well.  Feminine and sexy. Love it.  Wish I got the bigger bottle!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great. I love it. It has a really cool bottle too. It&#x27;s my new favorite perfume. Love it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect when this came in.  I love Angel.  Its my favorite scent.  But you either love Angel or hate it.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE Angel.  It smells great on me. But I wear it everyday and I wanted something different and special for my wedding day.  I ordered this to see.  It has a lighter smell than Angel, not quiet like Angel, softer a more flowery smell.  But not that sickly sweet or fruity smell that gets on your nerves.  I don&#x27;t know how to explain it right. It smells really nice, girly but with just a hint of sandalwood I think, but in a good way. I like it. I&#x27;m wearing it on my wedding.</li>
            <li> When this product arrived, it was in excellent condition. I was blown away by the price for it too. I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I had never heard of this perfume, but my daughter loves it and was thrilled with the gift. It is well packaged and arrived in record time.</li>
            <li> Love the product; it shipped speedily and I have had no problems.  Cannot think of a reason to take any stars away so I would recommend.</li>
