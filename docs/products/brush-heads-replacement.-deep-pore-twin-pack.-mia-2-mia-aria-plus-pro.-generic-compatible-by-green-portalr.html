            <li>As good as the reviews say.  </li>
            <li>These brush heads fit perfectly ...</li>
            <li>fit perfectly!</li>
            <li>good quality.</li>
            <li>Fit my Mia 2 brush perfectly.</li>
            <li>These work perfectly, fit perfectly, and are substantially cheaper.</li>
            <li>I love it !</li>
            <li>Love these!  </li>
            <li>Coudln&#x27;t ask for a better price either!</li>
            <li>These are better than the ones that came with my Clarisonic!</li>
            <li>Received 2 in package which fit perfectly, and like fact they are softer, gentler than originally came with Mia.</li>
            <li>These work great and are just the right price.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re used to the original head, this one may not feel as good</li>
            <li>As good as the original supplied with the device.</li>
            <li>Just as good as the full price brand name.</li>
            <li>Works better than the clarisonic brand replacement and much more affordable</li>
            <li>Or did more come in the box that I didn&#x27;t see &amp; we&#x27;re freed in my house.  </li>
            <li>and I started breaking out a lot more.</li>
            <li>I love how my face feels after I wash my face</li>
            <li>I love these.  </li>
            <li>and  It makes my face feel so very clean</li>
            <li>These are my first replacement brushes that I have bought for my Mia2 and the fit is impeccable.</li>
            <li>I bought these brushes for my wife, and she was very happy with a quality, as she couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between the original and the generic ones.</li>
            <li>I think spending more money on the better and higher quality ones are a much more smarter investment than wasting money on this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it does the job and fits Mia easily.</li>
            <li>I think they will be just fine.</li>
            <li>is working just fine again.</li>
            <li>Yes, the brush heads fit.  </li>
            <li>So far she says they work just as good as the originals</li>
            <li>Great value and the brushes seem to be the same as the original brushes that came with my Clair.</li>
            <li>When inserted on the Mia2, they just buzz, but do not spin as the original clarisonic heads do.</li>
            <li>this is not the original clarsonic brush</li>
            <li>They get my face so clean.  </li>
            <li>I ordered these replacement heads because they were more reasonable than the Clarsonic replacements.  </li>
            <li>bristles feel a teeny bit rough on the skin but otherwise good brush head</li>
            <li>but I like the original head brush more than the deep pore one.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t fit properly and even after making them fit the job it done sucked.</li>
            <li>I guess it didn&#x27;t really help me clean it really well.</li>
            <li>The deep pore brush heads met more than my expectations.</li>
            <li>Really like my pore cleansing brush!  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how a generic brand would do</li>
            <li>She will definitely order more.</li>
            <li>At first  some of the bristles came out and it worried me.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s where the positive aspect ends.  </li>
            <li>my face is so much clearer..</li>
            <li>These are not the real brush heads.  </li>
            <li>This is my second pack and they clean so well.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and smooth and my pores are so much smaller.</li>
            <li>No problems with fit, smoothness of bristles, no noise, nothing loose.</li>
            <li>Bristles are too soft, doesn&#x27;t feel like a deep clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It will fall apart right away as soon or a bit later after you start using it.</li>
            <li>These brush heads work well with my Clarisonic cleaner, but I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I found that this happened only on my first use and never occurred again.</li>
            <li>I did notice they were not as soft but will not scrub so vigorously from now on.  </li>
            <li>This one feels like the soft brush when you buy a soft toothbrush versus medium.</li>
            <li>It fell right apart when I started using it, and even when I got it to work for a couple of days it left my face itchy and red</li>
            <li>Next time I will spend the extra Monet  and get the real ones.</li>
            <li>Compared to the original, very little difference.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know how long they will last but are very satisfactory now.</li>
            <li>They are really scratchy and the center part does not even vibrate.</li>
            <li>The first time using my face got a little red.  </li>
            <li>Received only one and it was the soft Bruce with long bristles.</li>
            <li>These work great for my Mia2 and are not as expensive as the ones in the dermatologist&#x27;s office!!</li>

            <li> They arrived wet and do not have the coarse bristles for deep cleaning.</li>
            <li> I am unhappy and dissatisfied to the point that I will never again purchase a generic brand!.Very low quality cheap imitation of the originals</li>
            <li> Will not really get into cleaning your pores, or any acne around your face with the products you&#x27;ll be using.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After only a few uees they  are worn down .</li>
            <li> I was so tired of paying high dollar for brushes.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what these are made of, but made my skin red and irritated.  </li>
            <li> I got these replacements  about a month ago and never been more disappointed.</li>
            <li> I tried to find something positive to say about this, but unfortunately, found nothing.</li>
            <li> Not worth the hassle to return.</li>
            <li> Do not clean like the Clarisonic brand.  </li>
            <li> &amp; they are a little rougher than Clarisonic brush heads.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, still waiting for refund...</li>
            <li> I think it was a waste of money</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> its a  waste of money !</li>
            <li> Works just as well, if not better than the name brand heads.</li>
            <li> I had to try them once at least.  </li>
            <li> I will never pay for the expensive name brand brush heads again.</li>
            <li> They are very poor quality.  </li>
            <li> Bad product and service.</li>
            <li> They are useless!!!</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE quality control!</li>
            <li> These are terrible.</li>
            <li> very bad quality brush head !</li>
            <li> These brushes were awful .</li>

            <li> Bad product and service. Don&#x27;t waste your money, still waiting for refund...</li>
            <li> Yes, the brush heads fit.  That&#x27;s where the positive aspect ends.  They are very poor quality.  Do not clean like the Clarisonic brand.  Not even close.  Not sure what these are made of, but made my skin red and irritated.  Throwing them away.  You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Just great. No problems with fit, smoothness of bristles, no noise, nothing loose. Will be buying again. Compared to the original, very little difference. Very happy with this &amp;#34;knock-off&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li> Great value and the brushes seem to be the same as the original brushes that came with my Clair.</li>
            <li> The deep pore brush heads met more than my expectations. My skin is soft and smooth and my pores are so much smaller. I love it !</li>
            <li> The middle brush head keeps popping off when I am using it.</li>
            <li> Close to the quality of the originals</li>
            <li> Works better than the clarisonic brand replacement and much more affordable</li>
            <li> Brushes were ok, but found a weird roach with guts smashed all in the 2nd head.  Not only gross, but made me wonder if parts of the bug were in the 1st head (which I had already used) and I didn&#x27;t notice.  Ewwwww!  Or did more come in the box that I didn&#x27;t see &amp; we&#x27;re freed in my house.  So gross!</li>
            <li> Received only one and it was the soft Bruce with long bristles. Not worth the hassle to return. HORRIBLE quality control!</li>
            <li> suitable replacement and at a very good price</li>
            <li> Just not the same as clarisonic brand. Bristles are too soft, doesn&#x27;t feel like a deep clean.</li>
            <li> These brush heads work well with my Clarisonic cleaner, but I have very sensitive skin &amp; they are a little rougher than Clarisonic brush heads.</li>
            <li> Really like my pore cleansing brush!  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Love these!  Coudln&#x27;t ask for a better price either!</li>
            <li> These are my first replacement brushes that I have bought for my Mia2 and the fit is impeccable. .im really happy w the quality and will be buying again..my face is so much clearer..</li>
            <li> Works well and fits as promised.</li>
            <li> Where do I start. I got these replacements  about a month ago and never been more disappointed. They didn&#x27;t fit properly and even after making them fit the job it done sucked.</li>
            <li> Bought these to replace the brushes my fiance had on her sonic. So far she says they work just as good as the originals so thats always a good thing when buying replacements.</li>
            <li> Works great for my Mia. Delivered on time and good price.</li>
            <li> As good as the reviews say.  This is my second pack and they clean so well.</li>
            <li> Fits perfect and also a good price</li>
            <li> I ordered these replacement heads because they were more reasonable than the Clarsonic replacements.  I had to try them once at least.  The price was perfect.  I did notice they were not as soft but will not scrub so vigorously from now on.  The first time using my face got a little red.  I think they will be just fine.</li>
            <li> I think it was a waste of money and I started working on a refund. It fell right apart when I started using it, and even when I got it to work for a couple of days it left my face itchy and red and I started breaking out a lot more. I guess it didn&#x27;t really help me clean it really well.</li>
            <li> Work just as well as the brushes from Sephora. I feel like the bristles stay firmer longer.</li>
            <li> These are terrible. They are really scratchy and the center part does not even vibrate. They are not at all like the clarisonic brand. Is there any way to get a refund?</li>
            <li> It does the job but I like the original head brush more than the deep pore one. This one feels like the soft brush when you buy a soft toothbrush versus medium. So if you&#x27;re used to the original head, this one may not feel as good but it does the job and fits Mia easily.</li>
            <li> These brushes do not even deserve 1 star. They are useless!!! They do not even spin and they are soft.&lt;br /&gt;Useless!!! Do not purchase!!</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly unto my MIA 2 and does the job beautifully.</li>
            <li> very bad quality brush head ! i do not recommand it. its a  waste of money !</li>
            <li> Fits the Mia 2 perfectly. As good as the original supplied with the device.</li>
            <li> I love how my face feels after I wash my face and  It makes my face feel so very clean</li>
            <li> I love these.  They get my face so clean.  I can see the results time and time again.</li>
            <li> These work great for my Mia2 and are not as expensive as the ones in the dermatologist&#x27;s office!! I can&#x27;t tell the difference!!</li>
            <li> When inserted on the Mia2, they just buzz, but do not spin as the original clarisonic heads do. Waste of money. Trying to get refund.</li>
            <li> Fits perfect, very comfortable on my face</li>
            <li> Product work as described.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> YAY!  was thrilled to get these!!! I was so tired of paying high dollar for brushes.  These are great and work perfectly on my Mia!</li>
            <li> These brush heads fit perfectly ...&lt;br /&gt;I will never pay 25 bucks a head again.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how a generic brand would do but I am very pleased and feel that it does a great job. My acne prone skin is acne-free!</li>
            <li> fit perfectly! good quality.</li>
            <li> I am unhappy and dissatisfied to the point that I will never again purchase a generic brand!.Very low quality cheap imitation of the originals</li>
            <li> Fit my Mia 2 brush perfectly.</li>
            <li> These are not the real brush heads.  They arrived wet and do not have the coarse bristles for deep cleaning.</li>
            <li> Great prise. And work s great.</li>
            <li> this is not the original clarsonic brush and I can tell a difference in the results.</li>
            <li> Fits Mia perfectly and works great</li>
            <li> These work great and are just the right price. I&#x27;d recommend them!</li>
            <li> 5 stars no one should be w/o theses brushes. My skin shines because of them PF Santa Fe NM</li>
            <li> These brushes were awful . After only a few uees they  are worn down . Next time I will spend the extra Monet  and get the real ones.</li>
            <li> bristles feel a teeny bit rough on the skin but otherwise good brush head</li>
            <li> I tried to find something positive to say about this, but unfortunately, found nothing. I think spending more money on the better and higher quality ones are a much more smarter investment than wasting money on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will fall apart right away as soon or a bit later after you start using it. Will not really get into cleaning your pores, or any acne around your face with the products you&#x27;ll be using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can tell that it&#x27;s the brushes fault, and not the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better spend some cash on one that will get the job done.</li>
            <li> Great value! Works well! Received 2 in package which fit perfectly, and like fact they are softer, gentler than originally came with Mia.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how long they will last but are very satisfactory now.</li>
            <li> works perfectly with my Mia 2</li>
            <li> These fit perfect, great deal!</li>
            <li> Works great for my mia2</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes for my wife, and she was very happy with a quality, as she couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between the original and the generic ones. For half-price! She will definitely order more.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the full price brand name. At first  some of the bristles came out and it worried me. I found that this happened only on my first use and never occurred again.</li>
            <li> I will never pay for the expensive name brand brush heads again. Some people reported the bristles falling out, I haven&#x27;t had any issues with that. Works just as well, if not better than the name brand heads.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work with my Mia 2.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to connect correctly with the device.</li>
            <li> My Clairsonic Pro started acting up when I used these bushes.  I switched back to the Clairsonic brushes and the Pro is working just fine again.</li>
            <li> These work perfectly, fit perfectly, and are substantially cheaper.</li>
            <li> These are better than the ones that came with my Clarisonic!</li>
