            <li>greetings from Spain, Good correo.rapidez, kind, right can have the utmost confidence with AMAZON AND ITS PRODUCTS</li>
            <li>Best gel, gelish delivers a very good quality gel, not cheap but worth it</li>
            <li>Beautiful, clear color, but with lots of blings!! :)&lt;</li>
            <li>Nothing outstanding.</li>
            <li>I love this polish.</li>
            <li>I love the color</li>
            <li>but this one is one of the better ones to me.  </li>
            <li>This appears goldish in the bottle, but the glitter is really more silvery.</li>
            <li>I used this color over the top of Bella&#x27;s Vampire and it added some sparkle.  </li>
            <li>I love doing this at home.</li>
            <li>I use it over my colored polishes and it looks adorable.</li>
            <li>have about 15 colors of Gelish polish and this one I use the most.  </li>
            <li>It is ok.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this silver.</li>
            <li>I have this and love this Gelish color.</li>
            <li>love love love WATER FIELD &amp; VEGAS NIGHTS &amp; BRONZED</li>
            <li>Cute.</li>
            <li>I have seen better results then CND gel polish with Gelish and tons of glitter.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the most glittery glitter polish I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have many Gelish colors, and I use this color as a topper over all of my nails.... or as a topper on an accent nail or two.  </li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t my favorite but</li>
            <li>used on top of another polish it is stunning.</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>&amp; I have had many compliments.  </li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve stated several times about the Gelish gel nail products they are the best ever</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>You can keep adding more and it doesn&#x27;t begin to look tacky, just more sparkley.</li>
            <li>For girls&#x27; nights out I have used Gelish Water Field over color gel on all 10 fingers before applying gel top coat.</li>
            <li>You can use this on top of any color.</li>
            <li>Really cute.</li>
            <li>I love this polish.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite polishes.</li>
            <li>I love this Gelish color.</li>
            <li>Goes on nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Great product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I love gelish and have many many colors</li>
            <li>the perfect amount of sparkle to add to my solid colors!</li>
            <li>Its the perfect amount of sparkle, and has different sizes of glitter!</li>
            <li>I like it alone &amp; as a top coat.</li>
            <li>I love the color,&amp; the price.</li>
            <li>excellent product, very durable quality&#x27;m inaccuracies, thank you very much ..</li>
            <li>Over the top of Tiki Tiki Laranga you have beach party fun!!</li>
            <li>Good quality and reasonable price!</li>
            <li>I love to use it for accents on my nails - it makes a beautiful french tip.</li>
            <li>Wow what a great color.</li>
            <li>It came quickly and would recommend this to anyone who wants a great gel polish.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It looks amazing, highly recommend this on top of your favorite color, or even clear.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Sometimes takes different number of coats to match nails, but ends up a good look!</li>
            <li>It is not as easy to brush on and avoid lumps</li>
            <li>Goes on easily.  </li>
            <li>It looks really great on top of Midnight Caller especially.  </li>
            <li>Works great over Cashmere Kind of Gal for an accent nail, or any other polish color.</li>
            <li>One thing you can&#x27;t tell from the picture is that the large pieces of glitter are holographic and give off an amazing rainbow spectrum shine.</li>
            <li>Very pretty color!</li>
            <li>These sparkles are perfect alone or over another gelish color to add a little pop.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it by itself, but I bet it would look great with a French manicure too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shake</li>
            <li>This sheer color goes great over Midnight Caller .</li>
            <li>or it looks great on the party nail (one nail a different color than the rest).Way prettier than the picture shows.</li>
            <li>Timely shipping and securely wrapped in bubble wrap.</li>
            <li>adds the right amount of sparkle as a top coat.</li>
            <li>Filled with fun sparkles!  </li>
            <li>I have used this over many different colors, and it really adds a beautiful pop of glitter.</li>
            <li>Waterfield is a medium-dense silver glitter gel, very close in appearance to the swatch here on the Amazon page, and I love how easy it is to use.</li>
            <li>Overall amazing product!</li>
            <li>Gelish Water Fields is fabulous, super-sparkly, and full of shine and glitter and twinkle.  </li>
            <li>Makes it fun!</li>
            <li>I hope my gift is a success!</li>
            <li>Also, it IS very sparkly and easy to apply and remove - it&#x27;s a winner!</li>
            <li>Very pretty sparkle coat, consisting of both fine and coarse-grain silver glitter.</li>
            <li>Great for kids or to add a little more to the nail or to wear alone.</li>
            <li>I layer it over the top of solid colors and it looks really nice.</li>
            <li>I love the simplicity of being able to wear clear polish with glitter.</li>
            <li>It was sent quickly and packaged securely.</li>
            <li>The sparkles are fine in size which is just right for me.</li>
            <li>glitter wasn&#x27;t sparse at all, got full coverage with one coat.</li>
            <li>The amount of glitter on one coat is a good amount and does not need a second coat, unless you just want a lot of glitter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want too much on there, make sure to get rid of the excess bling from the brush before you put it on.</li>
            <li>I even put this on my tips for a French manicure and it was gorgeous.</li>
            <li>For an accent nail, I used three coats of this for full glitter.</li>
            <li>Love how much sparkle this gives off.</li>
            <li>It is a true glitter polish, with varying sizes of glitter.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve only used it on top of other colors, but I think it would look awesome on its own as well.</li>
            <li>It will go great as an accompaniment to other colors.</li>
            <li>Great over other colors.</li>
            <li>:) i wouldnt use it by itself - i think the glitter gelish are focused to be used over a solid color:)</li>
            <li>You can wear it alone or add on top of any Gelish flat color before you use your top it off ( top coat) to add extra sparkle to your favorite Gelish color that don&#x27;t have any sparkle...</li>
            <li>pretty in sun light or indoors.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice top coat over other colors to add some sparkle.</li>
            <li>Very fine sparkles in clear polish.</li>
            <li>Very sparkly and easy to use.</li>
            <li>However, the glitters are very fine and the bigger one was a cheap holograph  color.  </li>
            <li>So pretty!  </li>
            <li>It is great as a second coat over a bright color, not sure I&#x27;d use it alone.</li>
            <li>I wish there was heavier glitter per coat of polish, but overall its a nice silver sparkle color for an accent nail</li>
            <li>Used either way, this is such a nice addition to my polish arsenal</li>
            <li>I have only used this product on it&#x27;s own with no color</li>
            <li>Definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own with just one coat or over a solid color to give it some pop!</li>
            <li>I had originally said that this color was the same as Grand Jewels</li>
            <li>Will be experimenting on using this color in other ways as I&#x27;m getting into more &amp; more nail art.</li>
            <li>SUPER FAST SHIPPING!</li>
            <li>one of my favorite colors - it is clear with sparkles in it - not too much but not nothing either.  </li>
            <li>i used it over black tips and absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li>A nice mix of fine silver glitter mixed with slightly larger holographic glitter.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it took two coats to get the glitter coverage I wanted.</li>
            <li>I thought the bigger glitters was more silver.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize it&#x27;s larger than the ones you buy from Sally&#x27;s(that is why I paid more here).</li>
            <li>so you end up with more sparkles than you do with the larger flakes.  </li>
            <li>I just got this in the mail and it is really pretty.</li>
            <li>surprisingly fast shipment!</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>and it wasnt too much, simple, elegant.</li>
            <li>First time buying this brand, will buy again.</li>
            <li>First time I used it</li>
            <li>My granddaughters thought they looked pretty.</li>
            <li>I personally LOVE wearing it with several shades of pink/magenta.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and it was packaged well!</li>
            <li>Pretty bling that accents any polish.</li>
            <li>but if you have patience, you can apply several coats to get a more opaque look which is pretty much pure glitter.</li>
            <li>It is dry immediately with a UV dryer, and it&#x27;s easy to remove!  </li>
            <li>Great clear polish with little sparkles</li>
            <li>Frankly, I think it&#x27;s a little much for fingers -- unless you&#x27;re going to a New Year&#x27;s eve party or the like -- but it looks great on my toes.  </li>
            <li>It really makes it pretty.</li>
            <li>Water Field is a must have color that is great for layering over other colors or using by itself for a french manicure.</li>
            <li>The polish lasts just as long as the better known brands you can get in the store.</li>
            <li>Even if you have thin or brittle nails, this polish will make them look beautiful.  </li>
            <li>Some of the other glitters require 2 or more to get the right coverage</li>
            <li>I just got a manicure with this at my local nail place and it is super sparkly and very pretty.</li>
            <li>i used it on top of Shake it till you samba and loose gold glitter</li>
            <li>this really well before use.</li>
            <li>and this is the intense silver glitter</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for fellow bling-lovers!</li>
            <li>Grand Jewels had big flecks mixed in with the smaller ones plus Grand Jewels does have a yellowy cast to it.</li>
            <li>Thanks to all the Vegas Nights reviewers for helping me figure out the name of the polish!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the lid was not put on straight</li>
            <li>Such a great color on a pain nail, under a French manicure, or over any color for extra sparkle.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like to use it over Bella&#x27;s vampire.</li>
            <li>Plus it is really helping to make my nails stronger.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like it</li>
            <li>Went on very well and stayed on for 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>Since this glitter is kind of chunky, if you don&#x27;t check, you can cure with nail with an uneven tip.</li>
            <li>Adds a nice glittery touch to plain or already painted nails.</li>
            <li>It comes in close to my other favorite Vegas Nights.</li>
            <li>It is silvery and can be worn alone with 3 coats or on the top of any other color.  </li>
            <li>I love it over all my other polishes.</li>
            <li>I am a bling girl and add this to most of my dark polishes for a starry effect.</li>
            <li>but regardless it&#x27;s so pretty and jazzes up nearly any color</li>
            <li>I love to put glitter over some colors and wanted intense silver glitter that&#x27;s so easy to find in regular polish world yet hard to find in here</li>
            <li>I use this on top of my french manicures and some of my solid color polishes.</li>
            <li>It actually lasts too, unlike most regular polishes!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I Highly recommend this color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clear polish, so you want to use it over other colors, but it looks fantastic with ANY color under it!  </li>
            <li>I like that the glitter is a little more chunky.  </li>
            <li>It also looks lovely over any plain color polish.</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of sparkle to add something extra to nails.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use Grand Jewels over other colors just not my French manicure because I do like it.</li>
            <li>and like I had them professionally done!  </li>
            <li>It is really pretty silver glitter with tiny flecks of iridescent glitter.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve ever seen a copy of the kid&#x27;s book The Rainbow Fish, it&#x27;s the same effect.  ;)&lt;</li>
            <li>One of several glitter polishes I purchased, it is exactly what it looks like.  </li>
            <li>Love the small but concentrated sparkles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pretty, but I prefer Vegas Nights, which is clear with only extremely tiny pieces of holographic (rainbow effect) silver glitter.</li>
            <li>It is, as shown, a clear polish with glitter.  </li>
            <li>had this as clear on my wedding day</li>
            <li>but it is clear so all you get is the bling.</li>
            <li>Two coats made it really, REALLY sparkly, almost to the point of it looking like a solid silver glitter polish rather than a glitter topcoat.</li>
            <li>It compliments any base color and has excellent coverage.</li>
            <li>Which makes any base polish look one step beyond awesome.</li>
            <li>i love how there&#x27;s big and small pieces of glitter to give it some pop.  </li>
            <li>The only thing to be aware of is the sparkles are not all the same size.</li>
            <li>This variety is a clear polish with broad, irididescent rainbow glitter flakes.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty silver sparkle, definitely not ment to be opaque, but it looks great over a base of midnight caller.</li>
            <li>I got this with Pink Smoothie and Sheek White and made peacock design on top of Pink Smoothie.</li>
            <li>I love this spark, it has larger pieces and tiny small sparkles</li>
            <li>Needs several coats to look like the image provided but wow!</li>
            <li>, I thoughi it would be really pretty, but it just looks like all the other glitter colors</li>
            <li>I have several of the sparkle overlays that Gelish offers</li>
            <li>This is playful and professional at the same time.</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of sparkle, whether you&#x27;re looking for a little or a lot.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear, has some smaller chunks &amp; bigger chunks of glitter.</li>
            <li>I tried shaking it really well on my other hand and only needed one coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>This is rare as I usually try and find an area that could be improved.</li>

            <li> greetings from Spain, Good correo.rapidez, kind, right can have the utmost confidence with AMAZON AND ITS PRODUCTS</li>
            <li> Best gel, gelish delivers a very good quality gel, not cheap but worth it</li>
            <li> Beautiful, clear color, but with lots of blings!! :)&lt;</li>
            <li> Nothing outstanding.</li>
            <li> I love this polish.</li>
            <li> I love the color</li>
            <li> but this one is one of the better ones to me.  </li>
            <li> This appears goldish in the bottle, but the glitter is really more silvery.</li>
            <li> I used this color over the top of Bella&#x27;s Vampire and it added some sparkle.  </li>
            <li> I love doing this at home.</li>
            <li> I use it over my colored polishes and it looks adorable.</li>
            <li> have about 15 colors of Gelish polish and this one I use the most.  </li>
            <li> It is ok.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this silver.</li>
            <li> I have this and love this Gelish color.</li>
            <li> love love love WATER FIELD &amp; VEGAS NIGHTS &amp; BRONZED</li>
            <li> Cute.</li>
            <li> I have seen better results then CND gel polish with Gelish and tons of glitter.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the most glittery glitter polish I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I have many Gelish colors, and I use this color as a topper over all of my nails.... or as a topper on an accent nail or two.  </li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t my favorite but</li>
            <li> used on top of another polish it is stunning.</li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> &amp; I have had many compliments.  </li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve stated several times about the Gelish gel nail products they are the best ever</li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> You can keep adding more and it doesn&#x27;t begin to look tacky, just more sparkley.</li>
            <li> For girls&#x27; nights out I have used Gelish Water Field over color gel on all 10 fingers before applying gel top coat.</li>
            <li> You can use this on top of any color.</li>
            <li> Really cute.</li>
            <li> I love this polish.  </li>
            <li> One of my favorite polishes.</li>
            <li> I love this Gelish color.</li>
            <li> Goes on nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I love gelish and have many many colors</li>
            <li> the perfect amount of sparkle to add to my solid colors!</li>
            <li> Its the perfect amount of sparkle, and has different sizes of glitter!</li>
            <li> I like it alone &amp; as a top coat.</li>
            <li> I love the color,&amp; the price.</li>
            <li> excellent product, very durable quality&#x27;m inaccuracies, thank you very much ..</li>
            <li> Over the top of Tiki Tiki Laranga you have beach party fun!!</li>
            <li> Good quality and reasonable price!</li>
            <li> I love to use it for accents on my nails - it makes a beautiful french tip.</li>
            <li> Wow what a great color.</li>
            <li> It came quickly and would recommend this to anyone who wants a great gel polish.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It looks amazing, highly recommend this on top of your favorite color, or even clear.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Sometimes takes different number of coats to match nails, but ends up a good look!</li>
            <li> It is not as easy to brush on and avoid lumps</li>
            <li> Goes on easily.  </li>
            <li> It looks really great on top of Midnight Caller especially.  </li>
            <li> Works great over Cashmere Kind of Gal for an accent nail, or any other polish color.</li>
            <li> One thing you can&#x27;t tell from the picture is that the large pieces of glitter are holographic and give off an amazing rainbow spectrum shine.</li>
            <li> Very pretty color!</li>
            <li> These sparkles are perfect alone or over another gelish color to add a little pop.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it by itself, but I bet it would look great with a French manicure too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shake</li>
            <li> This sheer color goes great over Midnight Caller .</li>
            <li> or it looks great on the party nail (one nail a different color than the rest).Way prettier than the picture shows.</li>
            <li> Timely shipping and securely wrapped in bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> adds the right amount of sparkle as a top coat.</li>
            <li> Filled with fun sparkles!  </li>
            <li> I have used this over many different colors, and it really adds a beautiful pop of glitter.</li>
            <li> Waterfield is a medium-dense silver glitter gel, very close in appearance to the swatch here on the Amazon page, and I love how easy it is to use.</li>
            <li> Overall amazing product!</li>
            <li> Gelish Water Fields is fabulous, super-sparkly, and full of shine and glitter and twinkle.  </li>
            <li> Makes it fun!</li>
            <li> I hope my gift is a success!</li>
            <li> Also, it IS very sparkly and easy to apply and remove - it&#x27;s a winner!</li>
            <li> Very pretty sparkle coat, consisting of both fine and coarse-grain silver glitter.</li>
            <li> Great for kids or to add a little more to the nail or to wear alone.</li>
            <li> I layer it over the top of solid colors and it looks really nice.</li>
            <li> I love the simplicity of being able to wear clear polish with glitter.</li>
            <li> It was sent quickly and packaged securely.</li>
            <li> The sparkles are fine in size which is just right for me.</li>
            <li> glitter wasn&#x27;t sparse at all, got full coverage with one coat.</li>
            <li> The amount of glitter on one coat is a good amount and does not need a second coat, unless you just want a lot of glitter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want too much on there, make sure to get rid of the excess bling from the brush before you put it on.</li>
            <li> I even put this on my tips for a French manicure and it was gorgeous.</li>
            <li> For an accent nail, I used three coats of this for full glitter.</li>
            <li> Love how much sparkle this gives off.</li>
            <li> It is a true glitter polish, with varying sizes of glitter.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only used it on top of other colors, but I think it would look awesome on its own as well.</li>
            <li> It will go great as an accompaniment to other colors.</li>
            <li> Great over other colors.</li>
            <li> :) i wouldnt use it by itself - i think the glitter gelish are focused to be used over a solid color:)</li>
            <li> You can wear it alone or add on top of any Gelish flat color before you use your top it off ( top coat) to add extra sparkle to your favorite Gelish color that don&#x27;t have any sparkle...</li>
            <li> pretty in sun light or indoors.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice top coat over other colors to add some sparkle.</li>
            <li> Very fine sparkles in clear polish.</li>
            <li> Very sparkly and easy to use.</li>
            <li> However, the glitters are very fine and the bigger one was a cheap holograph  color.  </li>
            <li> So pretty!  </li>
            <li> It is great as a second coat over a bright color, not sure I&#x27;d use it alone.</li>
            <li> I wish there was heavier glitter per coat of polish, but overall its a nice silver sparkle color for an accent nail</li>
            <li> Used either way, this is such a nice addition to my polish arsenal</li>
            <li> I have only used this product on it&#x27;s own with no color</li>
            <li> Definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own with just one coat or over a solid color to give it some pop!</li>
            <li> I had originally said that this color was the same as Grand Jewels</li>
            <li> Will be experimenting on using this color in other ways as I&#x27;m getting into more &amp; more nail art.</li>
            <li> SUPER FAST SHIPPING!</li>
            <li> one of my favorite colors - it is clear with sparkles in it - not too much but not nothing either.  </li>
            <li> i used it over black tips and absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li> A nice mix of fine silver glitter mixed with slightly larger holographic glitter.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it took two coats to get the glitter coverage I wanted.</li>
            <li> I thought the bigger glitters was more silver.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it&#x27;s larger than the ones you buy from Sally&#x27;s(that is why I paid more here).</li>
            <li> so you end up with more sparkles than you do with the larger flakes.  </li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail and it is really pretty.</li>
            <li> surprisingly fast shipment!</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> and it wasnt too much, simple, elegant.</li>
            <li> First time buying this brand, will buy again.</li>
            <li> First time I used it</li>
            <li> My granddaughters thought they looked pretty.</li>
            <li> I personally LOVE wearing it with several shades of pink/magenta.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and it was packaged well!</li>
            <li> Pretty bling that accents any polish.</li>
            <li> but if you have patience, you can apply several coats to get a more opaque look which is pretty much pure glitter.</li>
            <li> It is dry immediately with a UV dryer, and it&#x27;s easy to remove!  </li>
            <li> Great clear polish with little sparkles</li>
            <li> Frankly, I think it&#x27;s a little much for fingers -- unless you&#x27;re going to a New Year&#x27;s eve party or the like -- but it looks great on my toes.  </li>
            <li> It really makes it pretty.</li>
            <li> Water Field is a must have color that is great for layering over other colors or using by itself for a french manicure.</li>
            <li> The polish lasts just as long as the better known brands you can get in the store.</li>
            <li> Even if you have thin or brittle nails, this polish will make them look beautiful.  </li>
            <li> Some of the other glitters require 2 or more to get the right coverage</li>
            <li> I just got a manicure with this at my local nail place and it is super sparkly and very pretty.</li>
            <li> i used it on top of Shake it till you samba and loose gold glitter</li>
            <li> this really well before use.</li>
            <li> and this is the intense silver glitter</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for fellow bling-lovers!</li>
            <li> Grand Jewels had big flecks mixed in with the smaller ones plus Grand Jewels does have a yellowy cast to it.</li>
            <li> Thanks to all the Vegas Nights reviewers for helping me figure out the name of the polish!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the lid was not put on straight</li>
            <li> Such a great color on a pain nail, under a French manicure, or over any color for extra sparkle.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like to use it over Bella&#x27;s vampire.</li>
            <li> Plus it is really helping to make my nails stronger.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like it</li>
            <li> Went on very well and stayed on for 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Since this glitter is kind of chunky, if you don&#x27;t check, you can cure with nail with an uneven tip.</li>
            <li> Adds a nice glittery touch to plain or already painted nails.</li>
            <li> It comes in close to my other favorite Vegas Nights.</li>
            <li> It is silvery and can be worn alone with 3 coats or on the top of any other color.  </li>
            <li> I love it over all my other polishes.</li>
            <li> I am a bling girl and add this to most of my dark polishes for a starry effect.</li>
            <li> but regardless it&#x27;s so pretty and jazzes up nearly any color</li>
            <li> I love to put glitter over some colors and wanted intense silver glitter that&#x27;s so easy to find in regular polish world yet hard to find in here</li>
            <li> I use this on top of my french manicures and some of my solid color polishes.</li>
            <li> It actually lasts too, unlike most regular polishes!  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I Highly recommend this color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clear polish, so you want to use it over other colors, but it looks fantastic with ANY color under it!  </li>
            <li> I like that the glitter is a little more chunky.  </li>
            <li> It also looks lovely over any plain color polish.</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of sparkle to add something extra to nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use Grand Jewels over other colors just not my French manicure because I do like it.</li>
            <li> and like I had them professionally done!  </li>
            <li> It is really pretty silver glitter with tiny flecks of iridescent glitter.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever seen a copy of the kid&#x27;s book The Rainbow Fish, it&#x27;s the same effect.  ;)&lt;</li>
            <li> One of several glitter polishes I purchased, it is exactly what it looks like.  </li>
            <li> Love the small but concentrated sparkles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pretty, but I prefer Vegas Nights, which is clear with only extremely tiny pieces of holographic (rainbow effect) silver glitter.</li>
            <li> It is, as shown, a clear polish with glitter.  </li>
            <li> had this as clear on my wedding day</li>
            <li> but it is clear so all you get is the bling.</li>
            <li> Two coats made it really, REALLY sparkly, almost to the point of it looking like a solid silver glitter polish rather than a glitter topcoat.</li>
            <li> It compliments any base color and has excellent coverage.</li>
            <li> Which makes any base polish look one step beyond awesome.</li>
            <li> i love how there&#x27;s big and small pieces of glitter to give it some pop.  </li>
            <li> The only thing to be aware of is the sparkles are not all the same size.</li>
            <li> This variety is a clear polish with broad, irididescent rainbow glitter flakes.  </li>
            <li> Very pretty silver sparkle, definitely not ment to be opaque, but it looks great over a base of midnight caller.</li>
            <li> I got this with Pink Smoothie and Sheek White and made peacock design on top of Pink Smoothie.</li>
            <li> I love this spark, it has larger pieces and tiny small sparkles</li>
            <li> Needs several coats to look like the image provided but wow!</li>
            <li> , I thoughi it would be really pretty, but it just looks like all the other glitter colors</li>
            <li> I have several of the sparkle overlays that Gelish offers</li>
            <li> This is playful and professional at the same time.</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of sparkle, whether you&#x27;re looking for a little or a lot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear, has some smaller chunks &amp; bigger chunks of glitter.</li>
            <li> I tried shaking it really well on my other hand and only needed one coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> This is rare as I usually try and find an area that could be improved.</li>
            <li> Wanted a little &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34; to my normally neutral colored nails.  </li>
            <li> It is a little flashy  with quite a bit of sparkle without being over the top!</li>
            <li> : this is a clear polish with extremely tiny plain silver glitter and fewer pieces of a slightly larger (but still tiny) holographic silver glitter.</li>
            <li> The glitter pieces in water field are a mix of smaller squares and larger round pieces which are suspended in a clear polish.  </li>
            <li> Just clear with glitter (small &amp; big pieces).</li>
            <li> Without color it also extends how long I can wear it.</li>
            <li> The delivery was quick but the order was wrong.</li>
            <li> but it chips &amp; doesn&#x27;t stay as long on as other gel polishes.</li>
            <li> This is a Great color to add some sparkle to any base color!</li>
            <li> be careful when capping the tip of your nail.</li>
            <li> The glitter flecks are very small and silver but it also has about 5% small round prism glitters (to mean pink, blue, green purple, based on light angle).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mix of small silver glitter and larger prism glitter.</li>
            <li> It has small silver flecks with larger silver flecks of glitter.</li>
            <li> I will try it over other colors as well.</li>
            <li> For the office I usually use a solid gel color on all 10 fingers with Gelish Water Field as &amp;#34;accent&amp;#34; coats for my 2 ring fingers.</li>
            <li> I have been testing other gel brand glitter</li>
            <li> I used it with make you blink pink and did a drizzle down effect.</li>
            <li> You would need at least 4 coats of this to make a solid glitter...</li>
            <li> It is not as yellowy as I had previously said but it is just a bit.</li>
            <li> Much less visible if it slightly chips.</li>
            <li> so I had a sticky mess all over it and another product in the box.....</li>
            <li> It contains everything from big to tiny silver glitter in a clear base.</li>
            <li> Lots of large and small specks of glitter in a clear base therefore it goes over any color you wish.</li>
            <li> I put this on every color I have just for a little attitude with my nails.</li>
            <li> Funny story, I saw a girl wearing Vegas Nights and became obsessed with it, I picked Water Field at the salon because I thought it was Vegas Nights!</li>
            <li> And a little does it.  </li>
            <li> Dried quickly, no chip yet!  </li>
            <li> Just be careful, if you have dark color on your nails, try not to put too much of this bling, it can ruin the base color.</li>
            <li> and then the small shimmer pieces as well.</li>
            <li> Just a little sparkle in one thin coat.</li>
            <li> I hardly had to use any to get nearly 100% glittery coverage... and my base coat was BLACK!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find this difficult to apply or thicker than any other Gelish polishes</li>
            <li> (The glitter is very thick so it will hide the color underneath.)</li>
            <li> but the gel itself lays very thick</li>
            <li> not happy</li>
            <li> Again not happy with the application at this time.</li>
            <li> and I just put it on disappointed waste of money!</li>
            <li> You will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> You need to have a color base coat before applying this gel polish though!</li>

            <li> I like it just by itself for a simply nice looking manicured nails, or on top of any nail polish!</li>
            <li> This glitter polish adds pizzaz to any color. It&#x27;s a mix of small silver glitter and larger prism glitter. I haven&#x27;t tried it by itself, but I bet it would look great with a French manicure too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shake this really well before use. The first time I used it, it took two coats to get the glitter coverage I wanted. I tried shaking it really well on my other hand and only needed one coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also be careful when capping the tip of your nail. Since this glitter is kind of chunky, if you don&#x27;t check, you can cure with nail with an uneven tip.</li>
            <li> Great on an accent nail over polish. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I thought the bigger glitters was more silver.  However, the glitters are very fine and the bigger one was a cheap holograph  color.  Not as big as pictured.  Nothing outstanding.</li>
            <li> I love to put glitter over some colors and wanted intense silver glitter that&#x27;s so easy to find in regular polish world yet hard to find in here Gelish world.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a try and this is the intense silver glitter I&#x27;ve been looking for.&lt;br /&gt;So pretty in sun light or indoors.</li>
            <li> Already chipped  and I just put it on disappointed waste of money!</li>
            <li> I love this polish. It comes in close to my other favorite Vegas Nights. I use this on top of my french manicures and some of my solid color polishes. It really makes it pretty.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it&#x27;s larger than the ones you buy from Sally&#x27;s(that is why I paid more here). I love the color but it chips &amp; doesn&#x27;t stay as long on as other gel polishes.</li>
            <li> The picture of this doesn&#x27;t do it justice. So sparkly and not sparse at all. I hardly had to use any to get nearly 100% glittery coverage... and my base coat was BLACK! Highly recommend for fellow bling-lovers!</li>
            <li> Just as described in product description.</li>
            <li> love this nail polish! adds the right amount of sparkle as a top coat. used it with bella&#x27;s vampire and got the extra bling i needed. glitter wasn&#x27;t sparse at all, got full coverage with one coat. i love how there&#x27;s big and small pieces of glitter to give it some pop.  couldn&#x27;t be happier.  great buy if you love the bling!</li>
            <li> I got this with Pink Smoothie and Sheek White and made peacock design on top of Pink Smoothie. Very sparkly and easy to use. Very fine sparkles in clear polish.</li>
            <li> I have several of the sparkle overlays that Gelish offers but this one is one of the better ones to me.  It&#x27;s smaller in size so you end up with more sparkles than you do with the larger flakes.  Also, it IS very sparkly and easy to apply and remove - it&#x27;s a winner!</li>
            <li> Very pretty color! i used it on top of Shake it till you samba and loose gold glitter and it turned out great! :) i wouldnt use it by itself - i think the glitter gelish are focused to be used over a solid color:)</li>
            <li> Works great on top of a color.</li>
            <li> This appears goldish in the bottle, but the glitter is really more silvery. I love to use it for accents on my nails - it makes a beautiful french tip. It also looks lovely over any plain color polish. a great addition to any gelish collection</li>
            <li> Wow what a great color. Lots of large and small specks of glitter in a clear base therefore it goes over any color you wish. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I used this color over the top of Bella&#x27;s Vampire and it added some sparkle.  The glitter pieces in water field are a mix of smaller squares and larger round pieces which are suspended in a clear polish.  It&#x27;s a nice top coat over other colors to add some sparkle.</li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail and it is really pretty. There are bigger pieces of glitter and then the small shimmer pieces as well. It will go great as an accompaniment to other colors.</li>
            <li> I love doing this at home. Saves me tons of money, and if it gets messed up I just fix it on my own time. This is the best.</li>
            <li> Water Field is a must have color that is great for layering over other colors or using by itself for a french manicure.</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of sparkle to add something extra to nails. I use it over my colored polishes and it looks adorable. Not too chunky, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Good quality and reasonable price! surprisingly fast shipment! You need to have a color base coat before applying this gel polish though!</li>
            <li> This is great to use by its self or to use on top of any color that you have put on your nails to make it sparkly, before you put the &amp;#34;top it off&#x27; coat on.</li>
            <li> I had originally said that this color was the same as Grand Jewels but it&#x27;s not. It is not as yellowy as I had previously said but it is just a bit. The sparkles are fine in size which is just right for me. The sparkle is the same as any regular silver glitter nail polish except that with a gel you have the added protection of a water barrier which gels offer as this is not so with traditional nail polishes.  Grand Jewels had big flecks mixed in with the smaller ones plus Grand Jewels does have a yellowy cast to it.I&#x27;ll use Grand Jewels over other colors just not my French manicure because I do like it. I prefer using Water Fields over my French manicure to make it pop. Two coats does it! I will order this again. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> POSITIVE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have about 15 colors of Gelish polish and this one I use the most.  It is, as shown, a clear polish with glitter.  The glitter flecks are very small and silver but it also has about 5% small round prism glitters (to mean pink, blue, green purple, based on light angle). It is ideal for topping off any color.  The amount of glitter on one coat is a good amount and does not need a second coat, unless you just want a lot of glitter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEGATIVE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None.  This is rare as I usually try and find an area that could be improved.</li>
            <li> This sheer color goes great over Midnight Caller . It came quickly and would recommend this to anyone who wants a great gel polish.</li>
            <li> Great clear polish with little sparkles</li>
            <li> The glitter in this polish is great! I put this on every color I have just for a little attitude with my nails.</li>
            <li> If you want sparkly then this is the glitter for you!!! It&#x27;s amazing and I&#x27;m using it for my wedding!</li>
            <li> This gelish color works and look&#x27;s great! I layer it over the top of solid colors and it looks really nice.I recommend you try this color.</li>
            <li> Gelish is all I use now on my fingernails, and I love this color!  Gelish polish makes my nails look shiny and like I had them professionally done!  It actually lasts too, unlike most regular polishes!  Even if you have thin or brittle nails, this polish will make them look beautiful.  It is dry immediately with a UV dryer, and it&#x27;s easy to remove!  Amazon also has the best prices I&#x27;ve seen for Gelish!</li>
            <li> It is ok. It has a lot of glitters and if you like glitters, this one works for you. The delivery was quick but the order was wrong. They sent two but I ordered one. I kept it this time but will not in the future.</li>
            <li> I just got a manicure with this at my local nail place and it is super sparkly and very pretty. Two coats made it really, REALLY sparkly, almost to the point of it looking like a solid silver glitter polish rather than a glitter topcoat. I&#x27;ll try to post a picture. Funny story, I saw a girl wearing Vegas Nights and became obsessed with it, I picked Water Field at the salon because I thought it was Vegas Nights! Thanks to all the Vegas Nights reviewers for helping me figure out the name of the polish!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edited to add: this is a clear polish with extremely tiny plain silver glitter and fewer pieces of a slightly larger (but still tiny) holographic silver glitter. It&#x27;s very pretty, but I prefer Vegas Nights, which is clear with only extremely tiny pieces of holographic (rainbow effect) silver glitter.</li>
            <li> This is probably a must have for people who do your own nail.  Just be careful, if you have dark color on your nails, try not to put too much of this bling, it can ruin the base color. (The glitter is very thick so it will hide the color underneath.) If you don&#x27;t want too much on there, make sure to get rid of the excess bling from the brush before you put it on.</li>
            <li> This was suppost to b a stocking stuffer for my gf, how ever when I received it the lid was not put on straight so I had a sticky mess all over it and another product in the box.....not happy</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this silver. It is exactly what I wanted. It is really pretty silver glitter with tiny flecks of iridescent glitter. It is a little flashy  with quite a bit of sparkle without being over the top! Two coats was perfect for me I even put this on my tips for a French manicure and it was gorgeous. or it looks great on the party nail (one nail a different color than the rest).Way prettier than the picture shows.</li>
            <li> This polish is beautiful and is full of silver glitter!  It was great as a top coat and had good sparkle with one coat.  For an accent nail, I used three coats of this for full glitter.</li>
            <li> I have this and love this Gelish color. You can wear it alone or add on top of any Gelish flat color before you use your top it off ( top coat) to add extra sparkle to your favorite Gelish color that don&#x27;t have any sparkle...love love love WATER FIELD &amp; VEGAS NIGHTS &amp; BRONZED ( These 3 Gelish by Hamrony colors are MUST HAVES!</li>
            <li> This polish has great coverage and spreads glitter fairly evenly.  It&#x27;s a clear polish, so you want to use it over other colors, but it looks fantastic with ANY color under it!  Add it to Gelish Deep Blue Sea and it looks like a starry night.  Over the top of Tiki Tiki Laranga you have beach party fun!!</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of sparkle, whether you&#x27;re looking for a little or a lot. A nice mix of fine silver glitter mixed with slightly larger holographic glitter. A must have in the Gelish line.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! Works great over Cashmere Kind of Gal for an accent nail, or any other polish color. It has small silver flecks with larger silver flecks of glitter. Cute.</li>
            <li> Best gel, gelish delivers a very good quality gel, not cheap but worth it</li>
            <li> I love Gelish polish!!! I have seen better results then CND gel polish with Gelish and tons of glitter. Great price too</li>
            <li> Adds a nice glittery touch to plain or already painted nails. The polish lasts just as long as the better known brands you can get in the store.</li>
            <li> Such a great color on a pain nail, under a French manicure, or over any color for extra sparkle. Definitely my most used sparkle!!</li>
            <li> This variety is a clear polish with broad, irididescent rainbow glitter flakes.  If you&#x27;ve ever seen a copy of the kid&#x27;s book The Rainbow Fish, it&#x27;s the same effect.  ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is best used for a topcoat but if you have patience, you can apply several coats to get a more opaque look which is pretty much pure glitter.</li>
            <li> I love this spark, it has larger pieces and tiny small sparkles so it has a lot of variation and gives a sort of jeweled look. Great over other colors.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome polish, take my word for it. It compliments any base color and has excellent coverage. One thing you can&#x27;t tell from the picture is that the large pieces of glitter are holographic and give off an amazing rainbow spectrum shine. Which makes any base polish look one step beyond awesome. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I wish there was heavier glitter per coat of polish, but overall its a nice silver sparkle color for an accent nail</li>
            <li> Best glitter in a polish.  It&#x27;s gorgeous on your nails.  You will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, clear color, but with lots of blings!! :)&lt;br /&gt;It looks amazing, highly recommend this on top of your favorite color, or even clear.&lt;br /&gt;I had this as clear on my wedding day and it wasnt too much, simple, elegant. I love it</li>
            <li> So pretty!  I have used this over many different colors, and it really adds a beautiful pop of glitter.</li>
            <li> The perfect glitter alone or on top of another polish. Dried quickly, no chip yet!  First time buying this brand, will buy again.</li>
            <li> The variation in the glitter size gives this polish dimension. So far I&#x27;ve only used it on top of other colors, but I think it would look awesome on its own as well.</li>
            <li> Waterfield is a medium-dense silver glitter gel, very close in appearance to the swatch here on the Amazon page, and I love how easy it is to use. It contains everything from big to tiny silver glitter in a clear base.</li>
            <li> Gelish Water Fields is fabulous, super-sparkly, and full of shine and glitter and twinkle.  If you like bling, you&#x27;ll like this.  It&#x27;s just so sparkly.  And a little does it.  One coat over a color provided lots of glitter  Two coats are blinding!.  I didn&#x27;t find this difficult to apply or thicker than any other Gelish polishes -- I thought it was a piece of cake to apply and would totally zing up any color.  Frankly, I think it&#x27;s a little much for fingers -- unless you&#x27;re going to a New Year&#x27;s eve party or the like -- but it looks great on my toes.  But if you like sparkle, this is for you!!  It&#x27;s the most glittery glitter polish I&#x27;ve ever used.  Love it.</li>
            <li> This is a great polish to use as a layering color.  I have many Gelish colors, and I use this color as a topper over all of my nails.... or as a topper on an accent nail or two.  Used either way, this is such a nice addition to my polish arsenal</li>
            <li> excellent product, very durable quality&#x27;m inaccuracies, thank you very much .. greetings from Spain, Good correo.rapidez, kind, right can have the utmost confidence with AMAZON AND ITS PRODUCTS</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I LOVE Gel Polish!!! This is a Great color to add some sparkle to any base color!</li>
            <li> I tried this alone and it wasn&#x27;t my favorite but used on top of another polish it is stunning. I really like to use it over Bella&#x27;s vampire. It&#x27;s beautiful!</li>
            <li> Great silver glitter effect. There are different sized glitter in it so that ads some dimension. I have only used this product on it&#x27;s own with no color and it looks great. I love the simplicity of being able to wear clear polish with glitter. Plus it is really helping to make my nails stronger. Without color it also extends how long I can wear it. Much less visible if it slightly chips. I&#x27;m sure it would look great with any shade of color though. Looking forward to trying!</li>
            <li> This polish is a quality gelish polish with chunky multi-glitter pieces in it.  it makes a great addition to any color for super shine.  I am a bling girl and add this to most of my dark polishes for a starry effect.</li>
            <li> one of my favorite colors - it is clear with sparkles in it - not too much but not nothing either.  you sometimes have to &amp;#34;fish&amp;#34; for bigger particles but regardless it&#x27;s so pretty and jazzes up nearly any color</li>
            <li> I purchased this to wear over Midnight Caller and I love it! I will try it over other colors as well.</li>
            <li> perfect if you want to add glitter to any of your already gorg gelish colors.  this is am amazing color i love it</li>
            <li> I bought this to help add pizzaz to my gel colors.  It did just that.  First time I used it I did a solid navy blue &amp; added waterford to the tips only.  This looks so good &amp; I have had many compliments.  Will be experimenting on using this color in other ways as I&#x27;m getting into more &amp; more nail art.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve stated several times about the Gelish gel nail products they are the best ever and you can see for yourself.</li>
            <li> Needs several coats to look like the image provided but wow! Several compliments, I actually use it when I do my french manicure as the tip.... Makes it fun! SUPER FAST SHIPPING!</li>
            <li> Again not happy with the application at this time. It is not as easy to brush on and avoid lumps</li>
            <li> Love this.  It&#x27;s the bling for any of your colours that you like that have no sparkles.  It can go over any colour and give it a pop.  You can also use it alone but it is clear so all you get is the bling.</li>
            <li> One of several glitter polishes I purchased, it is exactly what it looks like.  Nice.</li>
            <li> Love how much sparkle this gives off. You can keep adding more and it doesn&#x27;t begin to look tacky, just more sparkley. Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> It has plenty of glitter with 1 coat.  Some of the other glitters require 2 or more to get the right coverage but this one is perfect!</li>
            <li> Very pretty sparkle coat, consisting of both fine and coarse-grain silver glitter. Wears well alone or layered over color gel. For the office I usually use a solid gel color on all 10 fingers with Gelish Water Field as &amp;#34;accent&amp;#34; coats for my 2 ring fingers. For girls&#x27; nights out I have used Gelish Water Field over color gel on all 10 fingers before applying gel top coat.</li>
            <li> Basically it&#x27;s just glitter but I liked it. You can use this on top of any color. Really cute. Definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying doing my own gel nails at home.  Gelish products are easy to use and have a great color selection.</li>
            <li> Filled with fun sparkles!  Great for kids or to add a little more to the nail or to wear alone.</li>
            <li> I have multiple gelish products and this is one of my favorites! It is sparkly enough to stand on it&#x27;s own with just one coat or over a solid color to give it some pop! The only thing to be aware of is the sparkles are not all the same size. It is a true glitter polish, with varying sizes of glitter. If you want uniform sized glitter this one may not be for you. Overall amazing product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like it, I thoughi it would be really pretty, but it just looks like all the other glitter colors</li>
            <li> I adore this sparkly polish more than any others I own.  It is silvery and can be worn alone with 3 coats or on the top of any other color.  Sometimes I just paint one nail with it.  I love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> Beautiful.  I used it over Tuttu Fruiti</li>
            <li> Just clear with glitter (small &amp; big pieces). Great brand/product and right amount of glitter. good to use over a color.</li>
            <li> Like the color but the gel itself lays very thick u need to warm it up before applying</li>
            <li> Wanted a little &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34; to my normally neutral colored nails.  This was just what I needed. My granddaughters thought they looked pretty. Just a little sparkle in one thin coat. Perfect!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful fully glitter gelish. I have been testing other gel brand glitter and this is the best by far. I used it with make you blink pink and did a drizzle down effect. I received numerous compliments on this effect.</li>
            <li> It has hologram like reflex in it, so it complements several nail colors. I personally LOVE wearing it with several shades of pink/magenta. Again, 3 coats and it&#x27;s perfect. I&#x27;m in health care and use my hands often. This is playful and professional at the same time.</li>
            <li> These sparkles are perfect alone or over another gelish color to add a little pop. I Highly recommend this color.</li>
            <li> I love this polish.  I add it with almost all of my polishes and it is wonderful.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite polishes. I love it over all my other polishes. It is so beautiful and catches the sunlight so nicely.</li>
            <li> I love this Gelish color. It has just enough sparkle. Shipping was fast and it was packaged well! Goes on nice and smooth. I will only be using Gelish gel polish from now on!</li>
            <li> Timely shipping and securely wrapped in bubble wrap. You would need at least 4 coats of this to make a solid glitter...I would advise using it as a topper over another color- silver glitter</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping. Love the small but concentrated sparkles. Went on very well and stayed on for 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I love the sparkle of this gel! Pretty bling that accents any polish. I even wear it alone.  Love, love , love it!</li>
            <li> I love gelish and have many many colors but this is one of my favorites.  It is great as a second coat over a bright color, not sure I&#x27;d use it alone.</li>
            <li> the perfect amount of sparkle to add to my solid colors! i used it over black tips and absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li> Its the perfect amount of sparkle, and has different sizes of glitter! Great coverage alone or over another color.  I am wearing it alone right now with 3 layers, looks awesome! Great for the weddings that I am in this summer</li>
            <li> It can be used alone or over another color. Goes on easily.  It was sent quickly and packaged securely. The quality is very good.</li>
            <li> Water Field is a beautiful over coat to just about all of my Gelish colors.  I can&#x27;t go without it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear, has some smaller chunks &amp; bigger chunks of glitter. I like it alone &amp; as a top coat.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this! I have the gel starter kit and bought this to expand my creativity. It works great and looks good on any color.</li>
            <li> Very nice super silver sparkle. Almost like a triple intensity of &amp;#34;Vegas Lights&amp;#34; my favority sparkly topper.</li>
            <li> I love the color,&amp; the price. It was right on time and in perfect condition! I hope my gift is a success!</li>
            <li> Very pretty silver sparkle, definitely not ment to be opaque, but it looks great over a base of midnight caller.</li>
            <li> this is the perfect amount of glitter with two coats.  not too dense and not too sparse. i would recommend this to glitter lovers.</li>
            <li> This gel glitter is great!  I like that the glitter is a little more chunky.  It looks really great on top of Midnight Caller especially.  I use this almost every time I do my nails.</li>
            <li> I use this to dress up all my colors! Sometimes takes different number of coats to match nails, but ends up a good look!</li>
