            <li>Price was good.</li>
            <li>Fastest drying top coat !</li>

            <li>This stuff is amazing and literally dries in seconds.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>you need to have nice looking nails for an occasion</li>
            <li>I love this top coat!</li>
            <li>This top coat is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re in a hurry, this is your fastest option on the market - better than Seche  </li>
            <li>This top coat was HORRENDOUS for me.  </li>
            <li>do NOT recommend this top coat.</li>
            <li>Usually I love CG anything, but the smell of this is overwhelming</li>
            <li>and I find that Seche Vite is so much better.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite top coat.</li>
            <li>China Glaze FF top coat has been my time saver, literally.</li>
            <li>, my nails have 4 coats: 1 coat of OPI Nail Envy, 2 coats of OPI Pedal Faster Suzi, and 1 coat of China Glaze FF top coat.</li>
            <li>I love using China Glaze FF top coat because it dries nail polish faster, much faster, than the nail polish dries on its own.</li>
            <li>It peels easily.</li>
            <li>It chips easily.</li>
            <li>Which is fantastic - however, it does not prevent chipping in my opinion.</li>
            <li>and I am already able to do things rather than keeping my hands perfectly still for at least 20 min!</li>
            <li>have tried many top coats over the last 20 years.</li>
            <li>This topcoat dries so quick that doing my nails is now a cinch.</li>
            <li>drys so much faster and is much more shiny than my old top coat</li>
            <li>this is the best clear fast dry polish i have ever bought</li>
            <li>My manicure lasts twice as much with China Glaze Fast Forward Top Coat.</li>
            <li>actual product is in good condition and works well far as i can tell</li>
            <li>Dries super duper fast</li>
            <li>China Glaze nail polish is often terrific - but their top coat?</li>
            <li>The next day (or whenever you have more time to wait for proper drying), apply a coat of a heavier duty top coat to prevent chipping and increase the life of your manicure or pedicure.</li>
            <li>This is the only top coat I will ever buy again.</li>
            <li>- I love using it on my kids because they&#x27;re too squirmy to sit and wait for polish to dry.</li>
            <li>I am the girl who inevitably smudges my polish even after waiting for what I think is an adequate amount of time, but this top coat has definitely reduced smudging.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t dislike it, but I don&#x27;t really like it either.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too.</li>
            <li>(I usually use OPI and my nails chip quickly, but that seems to be with every nail polish and top coat.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>reason I am giving this top coat 4 stars and not 5 is that sometimes after 4-5 days it starts to peel off/shrink a little around the tips my nails.</li>
            <li>After my second color coat, I wait for about 10 minutes to use China Glaze FF top coat, and in 10 more minutes my nails are dry, shiny, and hard.</li>
            <li>Now all my bottles are coated in clear, my container is destroyed, and it won&#x27;t come off my hands even with nail polish remover!  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Obviously, this isn&#x27;t a deal breaker for me as I continue to use this top coat and prefer it over other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Update-does nor prevent chipping any better or worse than other top coats, but it makes painting my nails so much easier since the dry time is extremely fast!</li>
            <li>Dries quickly, makes nails harder.</li>
            <li>It does dry quickly, which was nice, but doesn&#x27;t seem to be a sturdy top coat, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the base coat either.</li>
            <li>(or you paint your nails right before bed, like I seem to always do), this will allow you to have dry nails that you don&#x27;t smudge or get bedding impressions in.</li>
            <li>Makes home manis look completely professional.</li>
            <li>It really does dry in about a minute.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it dry my polish fairly fast, its also easy to apply (not too thick) and the gloss even after it has dried is very pretty.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using some of the China Glaze solid neon polishes which go on thin making it easier to be precise and dry quickly, so</li>
            <li>I bought this one at a local beauty supply when I needed a new bottle right away (after spilling the last bottle I had of my usual brand) and I&#x27;ve never bought it again:</li>

            <li> This top coat is fantastic!  It really does dry in about a minute.  I am the girl who inevitably smudges my polish even after waiting for what I think is an adequate amount of time, but this top coat has definitely reduced smudging.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Dries crazy quick and had a high gloss too. Long time user of this product.</li>
            <li> Dried hard right away! Shiny finish! I just finished painting my nails and I am already able to do things rather than keeping my hands perfectly still for at least 20 min! Amazing! Not sure how it holds up against chopping yet, but I&#x27;ll update review when I do. (I usually use OPI and my nails chip quickly, but that seems to be with every nail polish and top coat. What can you do?!)  Update-does nor prevent chipping any better or worse than other top coats, but it makes painting my nails so much easier since the dry time is extremely fast! I&#x27;ve been using some of the China Glaze solid neon polishes which go on thin making it easier to be precise and dry quickly, so it&#x27;s way faster to apply and go than the thicker OPI polishes which I end up having to touch up. I&#x27;m totally sold on China Glaze polish! 💜</li>
            <li> The best top coat/gloss coat/dry excelerator out there. LOVE this stuff. Makes home manis look completely professional. Everyone is always asking where i get my nails done, and I tell them at home!</li>
            <li> Purchased this and &amp;#34;strong adhesion&amp;#34; base coat by same brand--have tried using them multiple times, and my nails chipped the next day each time. Granted, I&#x27;m not dainty with my nails, but I&#x27;m not brutal on them either--I&#x27;m used to nail polish lasting at least several days before it starts to chip--and even then, it will START to chip after about ... day 3-ish. With these China Glaze polishes, the entire nail surface would peel off. When I sandwiched a color between the layers, same problem. It does dry quickly, which was nice, but doesn&#x27;t seem to be a sturdy top coat, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the base coat either. (*No issues with seller--just disappointed in product.)</li>
            <li> box it came in was a little bent but thats just cause it was flimsy cardboard. actual product is in good condition and works well far as i can tell</li>
            <li> Wow!  This stuff is amazing and literally dries in seconds.</li>
            <li> This product literally dries your nail polish in seconds! Which is fantastic - however, it does not prevent chipping in my opinion. And if you apply it IMMEDIATELY after polishing, it will blend with your polish and make it look thinner. But if you&#x27;re in a hurry, this is your fastest option on the market - better than Seche  - I love using it on my kids because they&#x27;re too squirmy to sit and wait for polish to dry.</li>
            <li> My favorite!!! Dries fast, hard, and lasts over a few days without chips!</li>
            <li> This top coat was HORRENDOUS for me.  I purchased it after reading the rave reviews, but returned it the next day.  I polished my nails the evening of day 1 and by the afternoon of day 2, my nail polish was chipping off...in chunks!  Not pleased with this one!</li>
            <li> China Glaze nail polish is often terrific - but their top coat? Not so much.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many top coats over the last 20 years. I bought this one at a local beauty supply when I needed a new bottle right away (after spilling the last bottle I had of my usual brand) and I&#x27;ve never bought it again: It peels easily. It chips easily. I&#x27;m talking about ONE DAY here!&lt;br /&gt;I do NOT recommend this top coat.</li>
            <li> While I like the polish, the bottle broke in less than 24 hours of owning it.  I&#x27;m not gentle with my nail polishes, but I&#x27;ve never had one beak either.  I&#x27;m being mad and should have just bought the OPI I wanted instead of going to Sally&#x27;s and buying this crap.  Now all my bottles are coated in clear, my container is destroyed, and it won&#x27;t come off my hands even with nail polish remover!  I won&#x27;t go back there, or buy it again.</li>
            <li> When I received it, it was dried up.</li>
            <li> Meh. I don&#x27;t dislike it, but I don&#x27;t really like it either. Usually I love CG anything, but the smell of this is overwhelming and I find that Seche Vite is so much better.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. i will buy again and i will recommend this to everybody. this is the best clear fast dry polish i have ever bought</li>
            <li> Pros: Applied over wet nail polish, it dries it almost completely, instantly.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Does not help nail polish last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need to have nice looking nails for an occasion and you&#x27;re short on time (or you paint your nails right before bed, like I seem to always do), this will allow you to have dry nails that you don&#x27;t smudge or get bedding impressions in. The next day (or whenever you have more time to wait for proper drying), apply a coat of a heavier duty top coat to prevent chipping and increase the life of your manicure or pedicure.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite top coat. Not only does it dry my polish fairly fast, its also easy to apply (not too thick) and the gloss even after it has dried is very pretty.</li>
            <li> drys so much faster and is much more shiny than my old top coat</li>
            <li> with 2 kids under 5, it can be hard to get my nails done. This topcoat dries so quick that doing my nails is now a cinch. I can literally leave the house with no problem 5 minutes after applying. It stays shiny and makes my manicure last</li>
            <li> Fastest drying top coat !</li>
            <li> I love using China Glaze FF top coat because it dries nail polish faster, much faster, than the nail polish dries on its own. I usually put 4 coats on my nails: base, 2 coats of color, and a top coat. I wait about 15 minutes in between the color coats, and god knows how long after the second color. China Glaze FF top coat has been my time saver, literally. After my second color coat, I wait for about 10 minutes to use China Glaze FF top coat, and in 10 more minutes my nails are dry, shiny, and hard. Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I am giving this top coat 4 stars and not 5 is that sometimes after 4-5 days it starts to peel off/shrink a little around the tips my nails. I don&#x27;t know what causes it to separate from the color coat. Obviously, this isn&#x27;t a deal breaker for me as I continue to use this top coat and prefer it over other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the attached picture, my nails have 4 coats: 1 coat of OPI Nail Envy, 2 coats of OPI Pedal Faster Suzi, and 1 coat of China Glaze FF top coat.</li>
            <li> Dries super duper fast</li>
            <li> I love this top coat! It dries nail polish almost instantly, it doesn&#x27;t smudge, and it lasts (for me) for at least 2 weeks. This is the only top coat I will ever buy again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful top coat. Dries quickly, makes nails harder. My manicure lasts twice as much with China Glaze Fast Forward Top Coat. Price was good. Fast shipping too. Highly recommended.</li>
