            <li>The warming effect is nice, and the mask works well in clearing the clogged pores in my nose.</li>
            <li>it gaves you a warm feeling on your face as it moisturizes.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s warm, it&#x27;s authentic.</li>
            <li>Will buy more products.</li>
            <li>i love the way skin feels after using.</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s $12.00 more</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s discouraging me to pay more for something that may or may not be intact when it arrives...</li>
            <li>cream leaked out, returned for another one or credit and havent heard anything more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s expendsive for sure but 1 try 1 time, deserve it the&lt;br /&gt;most.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Also, be sure to use a clean utensil when you are applying the mask to keep the PH level balanced -</li>
            <li>only 3 minutes and skin looks great.</li>
            <li>I purchases this product a few months ago now and I can tell you is really effective !!!</li>
            <li>Be sure to use a reputable seller and if the mask doesn&#x27;t feel warm when you apply it, it&#x27;s not real.</li>
            <li>there is a warm sensation when you put it on the skin, it does moister the skin, overall i like it.</li>
            <li>and so I rarely use it.  </li>
            <li>skin is more glowing, young and rest.</li>
            <li>After the first one I just ordered another to save the hassle of returning it since it was reasonably priced at $27.00 and the free shipping was $25.00 and over.  </li>
            <li>JUST BOUGHT MY FIRST JAR OCT 5TH 2013....</li>
            <li>This time I paid the higher price.  </li>
            <li>price was amazing compared to other sites.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s not an easy mask to use</li>
            <li>I was very eager to try this product and</li>
            <li>Then you have to mix the mud portion, which is really a pain to do.  </li>
            <li>I just expected it to be warmer and bring even more circulation to my face.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and was excited to try this product because I really like some of the other Premier products.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing, at 58, I look like late 40s with my skin softness and lack of deep wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Dont really notice a big difference in skin appearance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not clear what the purpose is of translucent bar that you have to rub on your face first.  </li>
            <li>I bought my first jar from the mall and paid a ridiculous amount of money and it was worth it!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care for the pink mineral soap that comes with the mask, but it makes the mask easier to take off.</li>
            <li>When you first take the mask off, your skin is very tight and your pores are smaller.</li>

            <li> JUST BOUGHT MY FIRST JAR OCT 5TH 2013....TIME WILL TELL AND I WILL LET YOU KNOW...FIRST APPLICATION FEELS GREAT !!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I did not receive this product. It was shipped to a different address that I reside in. I was very eager to try this product and an very disappointed that I am able to give it a chance. Hopefully, whoever received this will see my name on it and mention that this person does not reside there.</li>
            <li> It seems to be the fake commodity and the mask is leakage and dry. I dare not to try it because the worse cover and bottle.</li>
            <li> great products .........truly outstanding service...you would not believe the difference these products can make in a very short time.....best value on Amazon followed by the most extraordinary service.</li>
            <li> Bought Premier Dead Sea cream and salt while on vacation.  Searched for Biox Thermal Beauty Mask and found it on Amazon.ca.&lt;br /&gt;The price was amazing compared to other sites.  Will buy more products.</li>
            <li> there is a warm sensation when you put it on the skin, it does moister the skin, overall i like it. I use it once a week.</li>
            <li> i love the way skin feels after using. I try to use at least once a week.  it tightens and leave my skin softer.</li>
            <li> Product doesnt &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; when applied as stated. Does feel good afterwards. Dont really notice a big difference in skin appearance.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and was excited to try this product because I really like some of the other Premier products.

But it&#x27;s a bit too dry on my cheeks.  Overall, it&#x27;s not an easy mask to use and so I rarely use it.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Good. I just expected it to be warmer and bring even more circulation to my face. Would not use this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of these products and sorry to see the price jump up as they have.  The last two of these I ordered the oil had leaked out all over the box making the product dry.  After the first one I just ordered another to save the hassle of returning it since it was reasonably priced at $27.00 and the free shipping was $25.00 and over.  But the next one had the same problem.  I&#x27;ve used them anyway though it&#x27;s dry and hard to spread.  Now it&#x27;s $12.00 more so I don&#x27;t know how I will respond if this one has leaked.  It&#x27;s discouraging me to pay more for something that may or may not be intact when it arrives...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: My product arrived and for the third time in a row the oil has leaked.  This time I paid the higher price.  The product is good but has a packaging problem that someone needs to address.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a couple of years and it works great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Takes only 3 minutes and skin looks great.</li>
            <li> cream leaked out, returned for another one or credit and havent heard anything more. its been a couple of weeks</li>
            <li> I purchases this product a few months ago now and I can tell you is really effective !!!&lt;br /&gt;My skin is more glowing, young and rest. It&#x27;s expendsive for sure but 1 try 1 time, deserve it the&lt;br /&gt;most.</li>
            <li> I bought my first jar from the mall and paid a ridiculous amount of money and it was worth it! Be sure to use a reputable seller and if the mask doesn&#x27;t feel warm when you apply it, it&#x27;s not real. If it&#x27;s warm, it&#x27;s authentic. It&#x27;s amazing, at 58, I look like late 40s with my skin softness and lack of deep wrinkles. My Restylane wore off a year ago and now I don&#x27;t need it.</li>
            <li> I m impressed with the result of that product!&lt;br /&gt;Really satisfied!&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my skin the way I do expect about others  products I had been tried !!&lt;br /&gt;Tks Premier! You deserves that name!</li>
            <li> The product is very good! I recomend. The appearence of the skin after the use of the Thermal mask is very healthy.</li>
            <li> I have used this for about a year. I love it. My pores have visibly gotten smaller over the time span of a a year. When you first take the mask off, your skin is very tight and your pores are smaller. I don&#x27;t really care for the pink mineral soap that comes with the mask, but it makes the mask easier to take off. Also, be sure to use a clean utensil when you are applying the mask to keep the PH level balanced - don&#x27;t dip your fingers in the jar  or after a few uses, the effect will be minimal.</li>
            <li> Excellent mask it gaves you a warm feeling on your face as it moisturizes. It leaves your face feeling great.</li>
