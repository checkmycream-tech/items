            <li>i love this product and i will keep purchasing it...</li>
            <li>I like that it is able to reduce cellulite and can also be used to relax muscles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased from this company before and love their customer service.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I Love this for helping to reduce my cellulite</li>
            <li>It looks more like yogurt than jelly.</li>
            <li>Within minutes he felt more relief than he has with all of the products he has tried...and that is many creams, gels, braces and over the counter TENS type units.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is fantastic stuff!</li>
            <li>It does relax the muscles but more interestingly is what it does to the skin after it put on and dries.  </li>
            <li>top lid.&lt;br /&gt;~ Immediate cosmetic effects:</li>
            <li>Think covering yourself with the strongest and most diverse herbal poultice ever.</li>
            <li>My remarks are sincere and</li>
            <li>I also love that it&#x27;s made up of 87% organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very strong, yes, but not like vapor rub strong.</li>
            <li>I was offered this cream at a special price in return for me using it and then writing a review of my honest results.  </li>
            <li>Went on cool and started to warm up.</li>
            <li>This hot jelly cream is good for massage.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are mostly organic (87%) and they work very quickly.</li>
            <li>I am extremely happy so far.</li>
            <li>I love that this product is made in the USA and is cruelty free.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with this product!</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly and leaves our skin feeling nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>First off the smell.is amazing.</li>
            <li>Anti Cellulite Hot Jelly Cream is extremely effective at firming and toning skin; Cellulite remover Jelly cream helps reduce unwanted fat on the abdomen, thighs, hips, and buttocks skin</li>
            <li>: Should be fine for all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got this product really cheap in a review group...</li>
            <li>/&gt;a burning sensation, it is light and mint scented.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the scent, and the&lt;br /&gt;texture of the cream.  </li>
            <li>did receive this product for free to review and give my unbiased opinion and review.</li>
            <li>Smooth, like a light to medium-weight lotion.</li>
            <li>It doesn’t leave a sticky film, and skin feels smooth after application.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review.</li>
            <li>When you wipe it on the skin, it feels warm at first, then minty and cool.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised about this and loved the effect.  </li>
            <li>It is very smooth and blends in very fast.  </li>
            <li>The best way for me to explain this is icy hot, like i said I didn&#x27;t know what to expect</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure at first if it was me just being distracted by the invigorating feel on my skin, but I had pain relief from after dinner until I went to bed.  </li>
            <li>so so excited to get this product.  </li>
            <li>it goes on smooth and feels cool.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels great when applied liberally over muscles after a long workout or a stressful day at the office.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I originally bought it for the cellulite I have</li>
            <li>I love the hot, soothing feeling of the jelly cream when applied.</li>
            <li>When this product is applied it feels pretty warm on your skin, hence the name hot jelly cream.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of essential oils, I use them daily on my body and in my diffuser as well so the fact that this formula is packed with some of the greatest is a big win in my book.</li>
            <li>but i can say that this is much much nicer to apply than the other one I tried by Perfect Curves.</li>
            <li>My experience is that the cream went on a bit cool</li>
            <li>You can instantly feel the heat that makes your muscle relax and feels good.</li>
            <li>and I noticed I didn&#x27;t really need a lot to cover the section I was most worried about.</li>
            <li>But it will be excellent for your skin and possibly even your overall health.</li>
            <li>The smell dissipated quickly.</li>
            <li>BUT one of my favorite parts of this product is that this product is 87% organic which  means there is not harsh chemicals, and it is cruelty free.</li>
            <li>It feels amazing and the smell is just a extra part to it</li>
            <li>and I honestly can see a different in my hip area!</li>
            <li>These are all powerful irritants that won’t damage mucous membranes but they will burn with a vengeance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far I am pleased with it as being something that helps give me some relief from muscle tension.</li>
            <li>When i received this product i use it right away.</li>
            <li>The fact that it&#x27;s almost completely organic is great too because like I mentioned before I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin and have to stay pretty natural or deal with breakouts and rashes.</li>
            <li>applied a bit of the Hot Jelly Cream on my legs since I had ran about 2 miles plus my mma workout....</li>
            <li>, i tried it on my sister since she has more noticeable cellulite, it&#x27;s her second day using it</li>
            <li>It also smells sweeter and more citrus-y than regular menthol based creams and rubs I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I received the hot jelly cream in the mail yesterday.  </li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s first say this</li>
            <li>So it reminds you of Bengay but definitely better especially the smell.</li>
            <li>I decided to give the anti cellulite cream (more of a cross between a cream and a gel)  a shot and see if I could help the issue.</li>
            <li>I got this product more for the muscle relaxing properties than the anti-cellulite ones, though I will still try out for the latter.</li>
            <li>The skin is silky soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>The scent lingers for a bit but is not overpowering like when you first put it on and it is wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Uptown Cosmeceutials anti-cellulite hot jelly is a product I was interested in, not just for cellulite reduction, but because it also says it helps with muscle relaxation.</li>
            <li>When I first applied it I didn&#x27;t have an instant hot feeling the most of the reviews say, so i thought why do they call it Hot Jelly?</li>
            <li>I cannot say yet whether this will be effective in reducing my cellulite as I&#x27;ve only been using it about a week so far</li>
            <li>The jar is a good enough size that it should last about a month since you don&#x27;t need a ton of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so.</li>
            <li>I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so.</li>
            <li>I get pretty intense calf muscle pains at night and will often wake up with crippling charlie horse pains.  </li>
            <li>I wish it came in a larger size because I will finish this jar very quickly.</li>
            <li>I really love the Hot Jelly Cream, although it is not really hot, nor do you get&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to say, it really took away the pain in my joints.  </li>
            <li>i sweat so much...</li>
            <li>I really like the product...</li>
            <li>but really hope it works</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have any skin sensitivies</li>
            <li>I actually really like the smell as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has multiple uses, is made in the USA, cruelty free and 87% organic content.  </li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect.</li>
            <li>This Hot Jelly from Uptown Cosmeceuticals does live up to its name.  </li>
            <li>It gives you an icy hot feeling and absorbs quickly so you don&#x27;t feel sticky either!</li>
            <li>Not as obnoxious as some of the other muscle relaxing ointments, but definitely strong enough to help you breathe free and</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t slather this everywhere, just in areas where you have pain or cellulite, though I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s effective for that (yet).</li>
            <li>It contains capsaicin, black pepper, cinnamon, and ginger in potent forms.</li>
            <li>I dabbed a decent amount on each knotted spot on my neck and the tops of my shoulders and rubbed it in thoroughly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product mainly for relaxing my muscles and pain relief.</li>
            <li>The cream was not very thin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased a few different products from Uptown Cosmetics now and am happy with them overall.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this Uptown Hot Jelly Cream for my neck-which is incidentally probably the only place I don&#x27;t have cellulite!</li>
            <li>Double mint to be exact.</li>
            <li>This is my personal experience with Uptown Cosmeceuticals Hot Jelly.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and knew using something like this would be a gamble</li>
            <li>I like that it leaves my skin feeling soft and the smell isn&#x27;t too overpowering.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this because my husband has an intense deep muscle pain that nothing seems to help.  </li>
            <li>I actually chose this product because of its claim of being a muscle relaxant and for that it works very well.  </li>
            <li>The hot jelly cream is warm on the trouble areas but help with any tight muscles in the same way.</li>
            <li>Another nice thing about this cream is that it doesn&#x27;t have that weird smell like Ben Gay and various other creams have.  </li>
            <li>It feels a little hot &amp; cool-if that is possible,  The orange smell at first reminds me of dreamsicles.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a muscle relaxant, sort of like an Icy Hot type of thing</li>
            <li>/&gt;Quickly absorbed into the skin, the ingredients start breaking down the fat cells, reducing the appearance of cellulite&lt;</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been applying this hot jelly cream to my calves I&#x27;ve only woken up once with the muscle pain and even then it wasn&#x27;t as intense as it typically is.  </li>
            <li>so that was a MAJOR plus!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>One of the things that caught my eye right from the beginning about this company is they did say if you didn&#x27;t like it they would refund you your whole purchase, which is really hard to find when you open a product.</li>
            <li>Today I tried it first on my terribly tight neck muscles to see if it would help.</li>

            <li> I like that it is able to reduce cellulite and can also be used to relax muscles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased from this company before and love their customer service.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I Love this for helping to reduce my cellulite</li>
            <li> It looks more like yogurt than jelly.</li>
            <li> Within minutes he felt more relief than he has with all of the products he has tried...and that is many creams, gels, braces and over the counter TENS type units.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is fantastic stuff!</li>
            <li> It does relax the muscles but more interestingly is what it does to the skin after it put on and dries.  </li>
            <li> top lid.&lt;br /&gt;~ Immediate cosmetic effects:</li>
            <li> Think covering yourself with the strongest and most diverse herbal poultice ever.</li>
            <li> My remarks are sincere and</li>
            <li> I also love that it&#x27;s made up of 87% organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very strong, yes, but not like vapor rub strong.</li>
            <li> I was offered this cream at a special price in return for me using it and then writing a review of my honest results.  </li>
            <li> Went on cool and started to warm up.</li>
            <li> This hot jelly cream is good for massage.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are mostly organic (87%) and they work very quickly.</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy so far.</li>
            <li> I love that this product is made in the USA and is cruelty free.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with this product!</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly and leaves our skin feeling nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> First off the smell.is amazing.</li>
            <li> Anti Cellulite Hot Jelly Cream is extremely effective at firming and toning skin; Cellulite remover Jelly cream helps reduce unwanted fat on the abdomen, thighs, hips, and buttocks skin</li>
            <li> : Should be fine for all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got this product really cheap in a review group...</li>
            <li> /&gt;a burning sensation, it is light and mint scented.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy the scent, and the&lt;br /&gt;texture of the cream.  </li>
            <li> did receive this product for free to review and give my unbiased opinion and review.</li>
            <li> Smooth, like a light to medium-weight lotion.</li>
            <li> It doesn’t leave a sticky film, and skin feels smooth after application.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review.</li>
            <li> When you wipe it on the skin, it feels warm at first, then minty and cool.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised about this and loved the effect.  </li>
            <li> It is very smooth and blends in very fast.  </li>
            <li> The best way for me to explain this is icy hot, like i said I didn&#x27;t know what to expect</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure at first if it was me just being distracted by the invigorating feel on my skin, but I had pain relief from after dinner until I went to bed.  </li>
            <li> so so excited to get this product.  </li>
            <li> it goes on smooth and feels cool.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It feels great when applied liberally over muscles after a long workout or a stressful day at the office.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I originally bought it for the cellulite I have</li>
            <li> I love the hot, soothing feeling of the jelly cream when applied.</li>
            <li> When this product is applied it feels pretty warm on your skin, hence the name hot jelly cream.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of essential oils, I use them daily on my body and in my diffuser as well so the fact that this formula is packed with some of the greatest is a big win in my book.</li>
            <li> but i can say that this is much much nicer to apply than the other one I tried by Perfect Curves.</li>
            <li> My experience is that the cream went on a bit cool</li>
            <li> You can instantly feel the heat that makes your muscle relax and feels good.</li>
            <li> and I noticed I didn&#x27;t really need a lot to cover the section I was most worried about.</li>
            <li> But it will be excellent for your skin and possibly even your overall health.</li>
            <li> The smell dissipated quickly.</li>
            <li> BUT one of my favorite parts of this product is that this product is 87% organic which  means there is not harsh chemicals, and it is cruelty free.</li>
            <li> It feels amazing and the smell is just a extra part to it</li>
            <li> and I honestly can see a different in my hip area!</li>
            <li> These are all powerful irritants that won’t damage mucous membranes but they will burn with a vengeance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far I am pleased with it as being something that helps give me some relief from muscle tension.</li>
            <li> When i received this product i use it right away.</li>
            <li> The fact that it&#x27;s almost completely organic is great too because like I mentioned before I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin and have to stay pretty natural or deal with breakouts and rashes.</li>
            <li> applied a bit of the Hot Jelly Cream on my legs since I had ran about 2 miles plus my mma workout....</li>
            <li> , i tried it on my sister since she has more noticeable cellulite, it&#x27;s her second day using it</li>
            <li> It also smells sweeter and more citrus-y than regular menthol based creams and rubs I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I received the hot jelly cream in the mail yesterday.  </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s first say this</li>
            <li> So it reminds you of Bengay but definitely better especially the smell.</li>
            <li> I decided to give the anti cellulite cream (more of a cross between a cream and a gel)  a shot and see if I could help the issue.</li>
            <li> I got this product more for the muscle relaxing properties than the anti-cellulite ones, though I will still try out for the latter.</li>
            <li> The skin is silky soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> The scent lingers for a bit but is not overpowering like when you first put it on and it is wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Uptown Cosmeceutials anti-cellulite hot jelly is a product I was interested in, not just for cellulite reduction, but because it also says it helps with muscle relaxation.</li>
            <li> When I first applied it I didn&#x27;t have an instant hot feeling the most of the reviews say, so i thought why do they call it Hot Jelly?</li>
            <li> I cannot say yet whether this will be effective in reducing my cellulite as I&#x27;ve only been using it about a week so far</li>
            <li> The jar is a good enough size that it should last about a month since you don&#x27;t need a ton of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so.</li>
            <li> I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so.</li>
            <li> I get pretty intense calf muscle pains at night and will often wake up with crippling charlie horse pains.  </li>
            <li> I wish it came in a larger size because I will finish this jar very quickly.</li>
            <li> I really love the Hot Jelly Cream, although it is not really hot, nor do you get&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to say, it really took away the pain in my joints.  </li>
            <li> i sweat so much...</li>
            <li> I really like the product...</li>
            <li> but really hope it works</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have any skin sensitivies</li>
            <li> I actually really like the smell as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has multiple uses, is made in the USA, cruelty free and 87% organic content.  </li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect.</li>
            <li> This Hot Jelly from Uptown Cosmeceuticals does live up to its name.  </li>
            <li> It gives you an icy hot feeling and absorbs quickly so you don&#x27;t feel sticky either!</li>
            <li> Not as obnoxious as some of the other muscle relaxing ointments, but definitely strong enough to help you breathe free and</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t slather this everywhere, just in areas where you have pain or cellulite, though I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s effective for that (yet).</li>
            <li> It contains capsaicin, black pepper, cinnamon, and ginger in potent forms.</li>
            <li> I dabbed a decent amount on each knotted spot on my neck and the tops of my shoulders and rubbed it in thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product mainly for relaxing my muscles and pain relief.</li>
            <li> The cream was not very thin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a few different products from Uptown Cosmetics now and am happy with them overall.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this Uptown Hot Jelly Cream for my neck-which is incidentally probably the only place I don&#x27;t have cellulite!</li>
            <li> Double mint to be exact.</li>
            <li> This is my personal experience with Uptown Cosmeceuticals Hot Jelly.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and knew using something like this would be a gamble</li>
            <li> I like that it leaves my skin feeling soft and the smell isn&#x27;t too overpowering.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this because my husband has an intense deep muscle pain that nothing seems to help.  </li>
            <li> I actually chose this product because of its claim of being a muscle relaxant and for that it works very well.  </li>
            <li> The hot jelly cream is warm on the trouble areas but help with any tight muscles in the same way.</li>
            <li> Another nice thing about this cream is that it doesn&#x27;t have that weird smell like Ben Gay and various other creams have.  </li>
            <li> It feels a little hot &amp; cool-if that is possible,  The orange smell at first reminds me of dreamsicles.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a muscle relaxant, sort of like an Icy Hot type of thing</li>
            <li> /&gt;Quickly absorbed into the skin, the ingredients start breaking down the fat cells, reducing the appearance of cellulite&lt;</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been applying this hot jelly cream to my calves I&#x27;ve only woken up once with the muscle pain and even then it wasn&#x27;t as intense as it typically is.  </li>
            <li> so that was a MAJOR plus!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> One of the things that caught my eye right from the beginning about this company is they did say if you didn&#x27;t like it they would refund you your whole purchase, which is really hard to find when you open a product.</li>
            <li> Today I tried it first on my terribly tight neck muscles to see if it would help.</li>
            <li> color did throw me off since it is a pale shade of orange, but that doesn&#x27;t really matter.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> There is nothing that can burn you so the &amp;#34;heat&amp;#34; is actually not hot to the touch but like Tiger Balm and other products, it has such an intense cooling sensation that it can almost be called &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I suffer from tight neck and shoulder muscles that give me frequent tension headaches.</li>
            <li> : There is a sharp feeling that is both cold and hot; it feels more cold than hot to me personally.</li>
            <li> The jelly produced a warm tingling sensation, not unlike a product I have tried from my chiropractor to help relax those painful muscles.</li>
            <li> After a long day of school and work, this works wonders on my sore muscles.</li>
            <li> Knowing what you apply to the skin for little or no problems is important, it leaves nothing behind but after applying you will notice your skin after a few applications how soft the skin is and firmer as well.</li>
            <li> The warming sensation did make my neck and shoulder muscles feel somewhat less taut and less painful after about 30 minutes, which was really great.</li>
            <li> legs and back are what you can say a tight ball of nerves and</li>
            <li> I will be using this on my thighs to see if I can tame down my cellulite a little,  I really don&#x27;t have a bunch.</li>
            <li> /&gt;~ Packaging: 4oz plastic wide mouth tub with screw</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit skeptical of this product since  it is for cellulite reduction AND muscle relaxation.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> Not fun.</li>
            <li> Not sure how long it takes to see results</li>
            <li> I do think it helps with tight and overworked muscles, I did notice some relief the day after leg day when I used it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just a few weeks in</li>
            <li> if that doesn&#x27;t pan out like I hope then I haven&#x27;t completely wasted my time and money</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it smelling like a harsh muscle rub.</li>
            <li> There is no strong smell</li>
            <li> having used a small amount a few times a day, my skin already looks tighter and healthier.</li>
            <li> After just a few applications I noticed a difference!</li>
            <li> Like I said I am not able to report on the cellulite reduction as that part was not why I was using it.</li>
            <li> the past month my workout routine consisted of weight lifting in the morning and kickboxing and Krav Maga throughout the week.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> The list of ingredients isn&#x27;t too frightening and it is primarily essential oils.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use this at night as it makes it hard to sleep when your skin feels like ice.</li>
            <li> The smell is not overwhelming at all!</li>
            <li> This formula includes some very expensive skin care essential oils like Roman chamomile and helichrysum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I plan to use this when I have tense muscles.</li>
            <li> I have a bad back</li>
            <li> They stand behind their product and they should because I noticed difference after just a week of use.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of the feeling when you have a mint and then drink cold water.</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t as bad.</li>
            <li> Disappointed didn&#x27;t seen any changes got this as a product review</li>

            <li> After just a few applications I noticed a difference! Tightens and tones your skin! I&#x27;m just a few weeks in and my cellulite is already disappearing! MUST TRY!&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS item in Exchange FOR MY UNBIASED HONEST REVIEW.</li>
            <li> I know that most people probably use this to help with cellulite but I&#x27;ve been using it to help with muscle pain. I get pretty intense calf muscle pains at night and will often wake up with crippling charlie horse pains.  Since I&#x27;ve been applying this hot jelly cream to my calves I&#x27;ve only woken up once with the muscle pain and even then it wasn&#x27;t as intense as it typically is.  When this product is applied it feels pretty warm on your skin, hence the name hot jelly cream. Another nice thing about this cream is that it doesn&#x27;t have that weird smell like Ben Gay and various other creams have.  It&#x27;s sort of like a minty smell and is quite pleasant.  I purchased this item at a promotional rate for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I have been having an issue with sore joints and thought I would give this a try.  I did not use it for celluite so I can not report on how it works for that.  I have to say, it really took away the pain in my joints.  I wasn&#x27;t sure at first if it was me just being distracted by the invigorating feel on my skin, but I had pain relief from after dinner until I went to bed.  I did have the pain back the next day.  I would have to give this 5 stars for the temporary pain relief and the ability to go to sleep with out tossing and turning.  I was offered this cream at a special price in return for me using it and then writing a review of my honest results.  Like I said I am not able to report on the cellulite reduction as that part was not why I was using it.</li>
            <li> Used it for about a week now and I honestly can see a different in my hip area!</li>
            <li> This starts to work as soon as you apply to the skin and that is great for the removal of cellulite.  Let just say it works on the cellulite. This is a 4 oz. jar that is shrink-wrapped and lives up to the title.  Uptown develop a cream that is organic and for that I thank them. Knowing what you apply to the skin for little or no problems is important, it leaves nothing behind but after applying you will notice your skin after a few applications how soft the skin is and firmer as well. I have cottage cheese for thighs and I am noticing more smoothness to thighs as I use the cream daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uptown gave me this product for free for an honest #review of the product.</li>
            <li> I got this product really cheap in a review group...&lt;br /&gt;Not going to lie...At first I was a bit skeptical of this product since  it is for cellulite reduction AND muscle relaxation.&lt;br /&gt;For the past month my workout routine consisted of weight lifting in the morning and kickboxing and Krav Maga throughout the week.&lt;br /&gt;My legs and back are what you can say a tight ball of nerves and muscle.&lt;br /&gt;I applied a bit of the Hot Jelly Cream on my legs since I had ran about 2 miles plus my mma workout.... it feels amazing.&lt;br /&gt;The next day I wasn&#x27;t too sore so that was a MAJOR plus!&lt;br /&gt;The color did throw me off since it is a pale shade of orange, but that doesn&#x27;t really matter.&lt;br /&gt;What I did like was that it smelled like Tiger Balm!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the cellulite reduction, i tried it on my sister since she has more noticeable cellulite, it&#x27;s her second day using it and she says her legs feel smoother and a bit more firm!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with this product! Will buy again in the future!</li>
            <li> This is the second cellulite treatment gel I&#x27;ve tried recently. I cannot say yet whether this will be effective in reducing my cellulite as I&#x27;ve only been using it about a week so far but i can say that this is much much nicer to apply than the other one I tried by Perfect Curves. That gel BURNED like nothing I&#x27;ve ever felt before.I have sensitive skin and knew using something like this would be a gamble but my self-consciousness won out and I thought I&#x27;d give it another shot with Uptowns formula. I am extremely happy so far. While that one felt like someone doused my legs in gasoline and set them on fire in death valley this one actually had just a minty tingle. I rub it in well on the back of my thighs and buttocks and once it absorbs in (just a couple minutes) I massage the area to kind of wake everything up. (I don&#x27;t know but the directions I&#x27;ve read online for cellulite brands always say to massage the area with a cellulite massager after application. I don&#x27;t have a massager like that so I just use my fingers.) I like that it leaves my skin feeling soft and the smell isn&#x27;t too overpowering. It&#x27;s very strong, yes, but not like vapor rub strong. It also smells sweeter and more citrus-y than regular menthol based creams and rubs I&#x27;ve used. I do think it helps with tight and overworked muscles, I did notice some relief the day after leg day when I used it. That was nice all in itself. I primarily bought this for its cellulite reduction properties but it&#x27;s good to know that if that doesn&#x27;t pan out like I hope then I haven&#x27;t completely wasted my time and money lol. I am a huge fan of essential oils, I use them daily on my body and in my diffuser as well so the fact that this formula is packed with some of the greatest is a big win in my book. The fact that it&#x27;s almost completely organic is great too because like I mentioned before I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin and have to stay pretty natural or deal with breakouts and rashes. Not fun. This cream has 21 different essential oils...i love it. I will be watching for results and if I remember I&#x27;ll come back on and update this review with some results for you. Fingers crossed that it works! I did receive mine free or at a promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my experience and honest opinions after testing this cream out.sential oils...i love it.

            <li> This product is amazing... so i use this for a different reason but the reasons that ur supposed to use it for is great too... but i use it to make my mid section sweat... sooo i wear a waist trimmer or a sauna suit for my stomach and when i put this on omg i sweat so much... i love this product and i will keep purchasing it...</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for two reasons. I like that it is able to reduce cellulite and can also be used to relax muscles. After a long day of school and work, this works wonders on my sore muscles. I can feel it work immediately. I&#x27;ve also been using this on my abdomen to reduce fat. I haven&#x27;t noticed that it has helped any but I&#x27;m going to continue using it. There is no strong smell so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it smelling like a harsh muscle rub. I love that this product is made in the USA and is cruelty free. I&#x27;ve purchased from this company before and love their customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST, UNBIASED REVIEW. ALL OPINIONS HERE ARE MY OWN.</li>
            <li> Received this item at adiscount for a product review. I Love this for helping to reduce my cellulite</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a few different products from Uptown Cosmetics now and am happy with them overall. This hot jelly cream feels so great on my sore muscles. Hubby uses it too after workouts and loves it. It smells great. It goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly and leaves our skin feeling nice and smooth. Their labeling is kind of off putting, but don&#x27;t let that be the reason you don&#x27;t buy their products because all of them that I&#x27;ve tried so far are wonderful.</li>
            <li> I received the hot jelly cream in the mail yesterday.  Let&#x27;s first say this I was so so so excited to get this product.  I heard some great stories and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. First off the smell.is amazing. It reminds me of gum. Double mint to be exact. The texture is nice and cream not all greasy.  So it reminds you of Bengay but definitely better especially the smell. So I got it for the muscle relaxation. I have a bad back and that&#x27;s where I put it on.  Went on cool and started to warm up. It feels amazing and the smell is just a extra part to it lol. I personally will get this again and  will definitely recommend to others.</li>
            <li> After having kids, my belly isn&#x27;t what it used to be. I decided to give the anti cellulite cream (more of a cross between a cream and a gel)  a shot and see if I could help the issue. The cream is orange and tingles. When you wipe it on the skin, it feels warm at first, then minty and cool. It feels like ice almost. The ingredients are mostly organic (87%) and they work very quickly. I noticed within a day or two, having used a small amount a few times a day, my skin already looks tighter and healthier. I wouldn&#x27;t use this at night as it makes it hard to sleep when your skin feels like ice. It reminds me of the feeling when you have a mint and then drink cold water. The jar is a good enough size that it should last about a month since you don&#x27;t need a ton of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I RECEIVED THIS ITEM TO TRY IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW.

            <li> I really love the Hot Jelly Cream, although it is not really hot, nor do you get&lt;br /&gt;a burning sensation, it is light and mint scented.  I enjoy the scent, and the&lt;br /&gt;texture of the cream.  It is very smooth and blends in very fast.  I look forward&lt;br /&gt;to evaluating further results.  Reviewed by amztrader.</li>
            <li> I really like the product...it goes on smooth and feels cool.  Not sure how long it takes to see results but really hope it works</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting the consistency of this product. It looks more like yogurt than jelly. I don&#x27;t know about cellulite reduction just yet, but the muscle relaxtion was awesome. I rubbed it all over my shoulders to ease the tension. It cleared my sinuses that&#x27;s for sure! I don&#x27;t really have any skin sensitivies but if you do, you may want to use it sparingly because it gets warm. I slathered it on my legs for increased circulation because I have issues with swelling and edema. IT WORKED GREAT!! I wish it came in a larger size because I will finish this jar very quickly. I actually really like the smell as well. Not as obnoxious as some of the other muscle relaxing ointments, but definitely strong enough to help you breathe free and clear!&lt;br /&gt;*This item was received at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review*</li>
            <li> I got a reviewer promo on this and couldn&#x27;t pass up something called &amp;#34;hot jelly cream&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s a muscle relaxant, sort of like an Icy Hot type of thing but without the noxious smell. It still has a smell but it isn&#x27;t as bad. I wouldn&#x27;t slather this everywhere, just in areas where you have pain or cellulite, though I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s effective for that (yet). The list of ingredients isn&#x27;t too frightening and it is primarily essential oils. I plan to use this when I have tense muscles.</li>
            <li> I got this product more for the muscle relaxing properties than the anti-cellulite ones, though I will still try out for the latter. That being said, this felt amazing on my sore neck at the end of the day!</li>
            <li> Jelly Cream by Uptown Cosmeceuticals... This jelly cream is Awesome!!&lt;br /&gt;It has multiple uses, is made in the USA, cruelty free and 87% organic content.  Anti Cellulite Hot Jelly Cream is extremely effective at firming and toning skin; Cellulite remover Jelly cream helps reduce unwanted fat on the abdomen, thighs, hips, and buttocks skin&lt;br /&gt;Quickly absorbed into the skin, the ingredients start breaking down the fat cells, reducing the appearance of cellulite&lt;br /&gt;It feels great when applied liberally over muscles after a long workout or a stressful day at the office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this because my husband has an intense deep muscle pain that nothing seems to help.  The day I received this in the mail I immediately applied some to his knees.  Within minutes he felt more relief than he has with all of the products he has tried...and that is many creams, gels, braces and over the counter TENS type units.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this purchase honestly.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this Uptown Hot Jelly Cream for my neck-which is incidentally probably the only place I don&#x27;t have cellulite! Ha! This feels so good on my sore neck &amp; since it smells like menthol probably will get rid of my headache!  It feels a little hot &amp; cool-if that is possible,  The orange smell at first reminds me of dreamsicles.  I will be using this on my thighs to see if I can tame down my cellulite a little,  I really don&#x27;t have a bunch. I did receive this at a reduced cost for an honest opinion. Thank You Uptown!</li>
            <li> The products from uptown cosmeceuticals is one of the best ive tried. The hot jelly cream is warm on the trouble areas but help with any tight muscles in the same way. Who doesn&#x27;t want  cellulite to vanish. I have to say it&#x27;s not an instant way to get rid of it but it help reduce it you feel a tightening feeling as well as heat feeling when you put this on.&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product for free to review and give my unbiased opinion and review.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic stuff! It really feels great on achy muscles and joints! The smell is not overwhelming at all! It gives you an icy hot feeling and absorbs quickly so you don&#x27;t feel sticky either! I received this as a trial and I&#x27;m very pleased with it!</li>
            <li> This Hot Jelly from Uptown Cosmeceuticals does live up to its name.  The product looks like an Orange Creamsicle in cream form but smells like a combo of Vicks VapoRub and Mint.  Since it is a scent I grew up with I did not mind it at all.  I actually chose this product because of its claim of being a muscle relaxant and for that it works very well.  My experience is that the cream went on a bit cool and then it gets &amp;#34;minty fresh&amp;#34; which some might call &amp;#34;heat&amp;#34;.  There is nothing that can burn you so the &amp;#34;heat&amp;#34; is actually not hot to the touch but like Tiger Balm and other products, it has such an intense cooling sensation that it can almost be called &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; if that makes sense. It does relax the muscles but more interestingly is what it does to the skin after it put on and dries.  The skin is silky soft and smooth.  I was really surprised about this and loved the effect.  The scent lingers for a bit but is not overpowering like when you first put it on and it is wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED RATE IN EXCHANGE FOR TESTING AND REVIEW.  This is my personal experience with Uptown Cosmeceuticals Hot Jelly.</li>
            <li> How do you compare the hundreds of skin care products? As a regular tester, I&#x27;ve arrived at a list of key considerations. I hope these are helpful to you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Fragrance: Herbal, menthol scent. No added fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel during application: Smooth, like a light to medium-weight lotion. Cooling.&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel after absorption: There is a sharp feeling that is both cold and hot; it feels more cold than hot to me personally. I find this sensation to be pleasant. It doesn’t leave a sticky film, and skin feels smooth after application.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it best for a certain skin type?: Should be fine for all.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it tested on animals?: No.&lt;br /&gt;~ Packaging: 4oz plastic wide mouth tub with screw top lid.&lt;br /&gt;~ Immediate cosmetic effects:* None.&lt;br /&gt;~ Potential long-term effectiveness:* This product has probably the longest list of essential oils in its ingredients that I’ve ever seen. I’m not going to even try to recite them all! But let me put it this way: There’s no way this cream isn’t going to do *something* good for you. Whether that happens to be reducing cellulite ....I’m sceptical that any cream can do that, I’ll get back to you if this does. But it will be excellent for your skin and possibly even your overall health. Think covering yourself with the strongest and most diverse herbal poultice ever. I’d also use this on the chest and throat for colds, and on sore muscles. This formula includes some very expensive skin care essential oils like Roman chamomile and helichrysum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT: You DO NOT want this stuff in your eyes. Wash your hands after application! It contains capsaicin, black pepper, cinnamon, and ginger in potent forms. These are all powerful irritants that won’t damage mucous membranes but they will burn with a vengeance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Know the difference between cosmetic and long-term effects: Cosmetic effects are immediate and only present when the product has been applied recently - just like makeup. Long-term effects take longer to see and should remain when you stop using the product (but don&#x27;t when you find something effective - your skin needs continuing support). The ideal product would be both cosmetically and long-term effective, but it&#x27;s more realistic to expect a formula to tilt towards one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so. My aim is to highlight features and drawbacks that I would want to know about as a buyer, not hype the product for the manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own.rm effects take longer to see and should remain when you stop using the product (but don&#x27;t when you find something effective - your skin needs continuing support).

            <li> Disappointed didn&#x27;t seen any changes got this as a product review</li>
            <li> This Uptown Cosmeceutials anti-cellulite hot jelly is a product I was interested in, not just for cellulite reduction, but because it also says it helps with muscle relaxation. I suffer from tight neck and shoulder muscles that give me frequent tension headaches. I have not tried this as of yet for the cellulite reduction, but I do intend to. Today I tried it first on my terribly tight neck muscles to see if it would help. This is an orangish gel that has a bit of a minty smell. I dabbed a decent amount on each knotted spot on my neck and the tops of my shoulders and rubbed it in thoroughly. The smell dissipated quickly. The jelly produced a warm tingling sensation, not unlike a product I have tried from my chiropractor to help relax those painful muscles. The warming sensation did make my neck and shoulder muscles feel somewhat less taut and less painful after about 30 minutes, which was really great. I will try this for cellulite as well and give it another star if it works for that too. So far I am pleased with it as being something that helps give me some relief from muscle tension.</li>
            <li> This hot jelly cream is good for massage. When i received this product i use it right away. It is smell good. Absorb on skin with no greasy residue. You can instantly feel the heat that makes your muscle relax and feels good. One thing i don&#x27;t like is it is feel sticky but all this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I must admit I was kind of worried buying this., I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect. Upon opening this cream i immediately noticed the orange color, which a citrus like smell. The cream was not very thin and I noticed I didn&#x27;t really need a lot to cover the section I was most worried about. When I first applied it I didn&#x27;t have an instant hot feeling the most of the reviews say, so i thought why do they call it Hot Jelly? Well within 3 minutes I knew why! The best way for me to explain this is icy hot, like i said I didn&#x27;t know what to expect but I was happy! It wasn&#x27;t a burning feeling which was a scar of mine it was nice and relaxing. I originally bought it for the cellulite I have but after using it I started using it on my muscle sores as well. One of the things that caught my eye right from the beginning about this company is they did say if you didn&#x27;t like it they would refund you your whole purchase, which is really hard to find when you open a product. They stand behind their product and they should because I noticed difference after just a week of use. BUT one of my favorite parts of this product is that this product is 87% organic which  means there is not harsh chemicals, and it is cruelty free. I have received this item during a promotional period and the views I have expressed are my own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product mainly for relaxing my muscles and pain relief. I love the hot, soothing feeling of the jelly cream when applied. It soothes my aching muscles within seconds of application. I also love that it&#x27;s made up of 87% organic ingredients. Knowing what I put on my skin is very important. I can&#x27;t wait to test it out on cellulite.</li>
