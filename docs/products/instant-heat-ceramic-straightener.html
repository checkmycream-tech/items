            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Excellent  100 % positive</li>
            <li>my hair looks amazing.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve always had frizzy hair and the amazing ceramic heated iron</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a great straightener for a cheap price.</li>
            <li>It is amazing.</li>
            <li>anything ever happens to this one, its amazing.</li>
            <li>I thought it was amazing.</li>
            <li>the trasformation is amazing.  </li>
            <li>So I went onto amazon and read all these amazing reviews.</li>
            <li>The price is awesome for such a great quality.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of in shock about how well this works.  </li>
            <li>works really well on my hair though and it looks great!</li>
            <li>Nice and sturdy, and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather a nice slim straightener.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks just as good, and after months of useing this Conair model, my hair is still just as healthy ~ as when I used the one I paid $120.</li>
            <li>Also, when I did put a conditioner on my hair before I did it, it still was kind of fuffy.</li>
            <li>My daughter opened it and was thrilled.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great deal, especially for the price, I am so happy!</li>
            <li>Honestly, I use this to iron collars on my shirts.</li>
            <li>Looks nice too.</li>
            <li>So in conclusion, two women have said this model gives them the best hair straightening they can get, in the salon or out, and it is very durable.</li>
            <li>it really wworked great!</li>
            <li>I honestly cannot believe this costs $20.</li>
            <li>I am going to get another kind.</li>
            <li>I gave it a good try for two weeks to see if I just needed better technique.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you use a good protective serum for shiny, silky results.</li>
            <li>They have their own hair straighteners but they prefer this one.</li>
            <li>This product arrived fast and was in great condition!</li>
            <li>Also you might want to use some kind of shampoo/conditioner designed for heat treated hair or something that puts a lot of moisture into your hair.  </li>
            <li>Nice iron for the price.  </li>
            <li>professionals\\&quot; but, after coming to my senses, I decided to put my faith in fellow reviewers who liked this product.</li>
            <li>The heat settings are nice, though I find myself accidentally turning it up while straightening my hair because of the placement of the dial.</li>
            <li>I liked the size of the iron, as I thought it would speed up my styling time while overseas.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my wife and she liked it.</li>
            <li>so I know what to kind of expect.....</li>
            <li>Although it shuts off automatically, I always make sure it&#x27;s off when I finish using it, but it&#x27;s good to have this feature in case</li>
            <li>I love it.it do a good job on my daughter hair</li>
            <li>Have fun and Good Luck! :</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definately worth your money!!!</li>
            <li>and it worked perfectly the first time, then after that it decided to not straighten any more.</li>
            <li>This product is very good in many ways, it heats up quickly and has an automatic shut-off if you forget to unplug it.</li>
            <li>I chose this one because of the positive reviews on amazon.com, and couldn&#x27;t be more happy with my decision!    </li>
            <li>and we were about to go out, I&#x27;d quickly smooth out my hair with her straightener, and It did an amazing job!</li>
            <li>I feel a lot more confident about myself and more happy with my hair.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought it, it makes my hair so smooth along with the Kertain smooth products, it is awesome.</li>
            <li>Yes...it heats quickly, straightens your hair, and is priced attractively.  </li>
            <li>Works great and heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>The plates do not go all the way out to the edge of the plastic, which causes your hair to snag very easily.</li>
            <li>This hair straightener is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>It gets very hot and it works great.  </li>
            <li>other than that it&#x27;s really great one and excellent bargain for the price.</li>
            <li>Have fun and Good Luck! :)</li>
            <li>GREAT product- works perfectly, made with good quality, and will hardly put a dent in your wallet.  </li>

            <li>and I&#x27;ve found they are more effective also.  </li>
            <li>The curve of the device, it makes it easier to use and more effective.</li>
            <li>Great product, heats up quick and works better than all the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>She has very fine hair</li>
            <li>I wanted a straightener with comb attachment because I have very fine curly hair and</li>
            <li>I have very fine but frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>It was so easy!  </li>
            <li>I love this straightener, and I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase! :)</li>

            <li>This is a great staightener for a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Heats up very fast and works great with straightening Indian Remy Hair wavy to curly without any problem using the heat setting of 25 with the turbo setting.</li>
            <li>arrived on time, heats very fast, great value</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this for 3 years now, and it works just as great as it did when I first bought it.  </li>
            <li>first i was happy with it</li>
            <li>(like I did the first time, lol).  </li>
            <li>it getz extremely hot and does a great job.</li>
            <li>I thought $21 was too good to be true, but believed the raving reviews.</li>
            <li>It comes along with a comb which is very comfortable.   </li>
            <li>it heats up extremely quick and straightens really good.</li>
            <li>it warm up really quickly!</li>
            <li>It gets hot very fast, has adjustable heat settings, swivel cord is a must have, and it&#x27;s perfect.  </li>
            <li>But its not terrible.</li>
            <li>I gifted it to my wife and she love it.</li>
            <li>This straightener is the best one that I&#x27;ve ever personally used.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>many</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so confident you will love this product.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;ok</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re all ok, but</li>
            <li>ot much more than that: it takes me about one hour to somewhat straighten my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works really well without damaging my hair, which was a welcome surprise considering the price.  </li>
            <li>Plus, I have tried so many straighteners and they all don&#x27;t do the job they intend to do.</li>
            <li>Until now, I have struggled with trying to straighten my hair with many straighteners.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I took the chance with this one.  </li>
            <li>I have bought many straighteners before.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of straightening and often my sisters will steal it from me because they like it so much.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I changed my mind.</li>
            <li>better--</li>
            <li>I love the finger rest on the end</li>
            <li>they know better.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think you can find a better straightener for this price.  </li>
            <li>I love Conair styling products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i love the heat settings (1-20), and i leave mine at about 11, and it does the job for me.</li>
            <li>i also love the safty-grip on the tip of the iron, so you can press the iron together on both sides as you glide it through your hair.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i just might buy one or two more of this straightening iron for my friends &amp; just to keep as a spare.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s big, bulky, but it is brilliant!  </li>
            <li>I cannot recommend this straighter more.</li>
            <li>I love this thing.  </li>
            <li>Having said both pros and cons, I really love it.</li>
            <li>Go spend twice or more on one if you must</li>
            <li>This unit works and most of us agree.</li>
            <li>I love it and have bought it for my family to to use it.</li>
            <li>They love it too.</li>
            <li>The best part is it only took about 15 minutes to do this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to straighten my hair myself --  until now.</li>
            <li>The ceramic straightener did all that and more.  </li>
            <li>It was her favorite Christmas gift.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know that all their hairdressers will give me as rewarding results until I tried this year three of their products, which are CONAIR CHV26IX, CS19JCS and CD 160DRCS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my hair doesnt stay striaght for more then 1 hour after straighting it.</li>
            <li>I have bought so many of these irons and never had any luck.</li>
            <li>Make sure to keep an eye on the lights to ensure it stays on while heating up and while straighting.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>Off to better brands which do not include anything made by Conair...</li>
            <li>My hair is so curly, i tried so many things to straighten my hair, i came across this ion and i m so amazed.  </li>
            <li>it looks so healthy.</li>
            <li>I get so many comments on it.  </li>
            <li>After reading many reviews i felt that I would take a chance and try this one out.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I was so happy when I bought the conair straightener because it made the work so much easier.</li>
            <li>This product is able to take out the wave I can&#x27;t get out by blow drying with a brush.  </li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>I have tried many straighteners before and nothing does the job like this one.</li>
            <li>I absolutly love it.</li>
            <li>I love it...</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this Hair Straightener.</li>
            <li>This straightener works like magic.</li>
            <li>Works for many hair types.</li>
            <li>but I just found one that is much better.</li>
            <li>The iron heats up fast, which is great, but it dries out my hair, Okay for the price.</li>
            <li>SPend more on a better iron if you use it often.</li>
            <li>I have had this for months and love it</li>
            <li>Takes more time to use this product but seems it is the type out there.</li>
            <li>Wont turn on, its over for sure.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>LOVE this item :)</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it works fabulously!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this iron.</li>
            <li>The Conair Straightener is a must-have for those of you who want beautiful smooth and sleek hair FAST!</li>
            <li>None of the three lasted more then 6 months.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that it shuts itself off after an hour</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>i MADE SURE that they were lit up.</li>
            <li>is still outstanding.  </li>
            <li>My sister shares it with our neices and they love it as well.</li>
            <li>I chose this product because of the many reviews and purchases.</li>
            <li>I have used it on dyed hair and it seems to not cause any more damage.  </li>
            <li>The 60 minute turn-off feature saved me so many times from when i forgot to turn it off.</li>
            <li>Its been working for over a year now :)</li>
            <li>This model is a sleeker version that has been reconstructed seemingly to hold the plates in better.</li>
            <li>and i get so many compliments on my hair.</li>
            <li>It makes it so shiny and smooth!</li>
            <li>I got this awesome product for $20 bucks back in 2011</li>
            <li>I like it much better than my friends&#x27; Sedu or Chi.</li>
            <li>I felt like it gave me more leverage to squeeze the plates together.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great item would recommend.</li>
            <li>I bought it more than a year ago and use it at home and traveling in Europe.</li>
            <li>Straightens my hair well, I just feel like it dries my hair out more than my Chi iron ever did.</li>
            <li>There is also no locking mechanism, which would have given it one more star.  </li>
            <li>It looks sleek, silky, and has a healthy shine.  </li>
            <li>It lets you cover more ground quicker.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Obviously, I can&#x27;t speak to the longevity of the product, but I&#x27;d feel a lot better about needing to replace a $20 straightener vs. a $100+ one.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to re-straighten it to make sure it is done correctly.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe I haven&#x27;t reviewed this before as I love it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know anything more about it.</li>
            <li>and I recommend it for everyone! :)</li>
            <li>which is a great plus when you are a mom of five and don&#x27;t have much time to cater to yourself.</li>
            <li>This is the straightest I&#x27;ve ever been able to get my hair.</li>
            <li>For the price, I guess I couldn&#x27;t expect much more than what I got out of this iron.  </li>
            <li>My sister has wavyish hair, and she is able to use this straightener to straighten her hair in about 10 minutes, so</li>
            <li>Heats up fast to a great temperature.</li>
            <li>Be sure to register it online.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update we have bought two more for our girls for Christmas.</li>
            <li>Is an ok product to travel i guess</li>

            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>The combs would just add more problems since it would get tangled up.</li>
            <li>I love my curly hair and I won&#x27;t bother w/ a straightener.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made by Vidal Sassoon, and it came with a blowdryer in this cute purple/silver color combo.</li>
            <li>I have to add, the reviewers also helped me to be more confident in buying this straightener...</li>
            <li>Ok</li>
            <li>Ok</li>
            <li>I checked all the settings and it was ok.</li>

            <li>Nice convenient size as well to fit in suitcase.</li>
            <li>I Love this straightner its works so much better then the chi</li>
            <li>I took it to Europe and with the appropriate adapter it worked like a charm.</li>
            <li>It straightens my hair better than the one I had before.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>

            <li>If you have been searching for the perfect flat iron, then buy this one.  </li>
            <li>This Conair Flat Iron is awesome.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to hold the flat iron to my hair because the wands have an excellent grip.</li>
            <li>This flat iron is perfect.  </li>
            <li>The flat iron is great!  </li>
            <li>This reliable flat iron worked perfectly overseas.....</li>
            <li>I have very straight hair as it is, but I wanted something that would smooth it out after blow drying, and this does a great job.</li>
            <li>It is so nice to be able to straighten hair much more quickly.</li>
            <li>so much!!&#x3D;)  Very Satisfied</li>
            <li>I now live in WA and even with all the rain it works great for the most part.  </li>
            <li>It is also very comfortable and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>But, even though it has some problems, it still does a pretty good job when you get accustomed to working around its problems.</li>
            <li>I loved this straightener when I first got it.</li>
            <li>It does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good.</li>
            <li>You can use it close to the scalp if need be and the heat unit is pretty good</li>
            <li>Serves me for 2 years already, traveled with me a lot, and never disappointed!</li>
            <li>It works great.. at least for my wife :) you can&#x27;t beat the price, and it works really good!</li>
            <li>Probably best with very long hair that is straighter at the scalp.</li>
            <li>I did the rest kind of quickly since I was just testing it.  </li>
            <li>and I was able to straighten it very quickly.  </li>
            <li>This heats up quickly and has a nice adjustable setting for the temperature.  </li>
            <li>I have been to so many family gatherings and people tell me how gorgeous my hair looks straight</li>
            <li>She was very happy with the hair straightener, light but enough heat to straighten her hair like her one at home.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping, excellent price and thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love touching my hair during the day now to feel how smooth and silky it feels.    </li>
            <li>She even had her own $100 professional straightener that was hardly as good as this one.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d</li>
            <li>This one is just as great as the old one!  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny... and more!</li>
            <li>I used this straightener for the first time with my new Revlon RV484 Ion 1875-Watt Hair Dryer, and I was very impressed with it!  </li>
            <li>Make sure you go for one with the comb attachment, otherwise if you have fine hair like me, it might just slip through.</li>
            <li>and It works just fine :-)</li>
            <li>Overall, very good.</li>
            <li>I have to admit the top of my hair is still a little frizzy, but for the most part it is awesome.</li>
            <li>I got so many compliments on it the very first day!</li>
            <li>I love the huge plates</li>
            <li>And more importantly, I am a guy with not-so-long hair.    </li>
            <li>works great, your hair is soft,, not fried,</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a great straightener, get the Revlon Professional 2&amp;quot;</li>
            <li>i love this straightener and would recommened it to anyone looking for a cheap iron.</li>
            <li>This is the best money I have ever spent.  </li>
            <li>The iron does heat up fast and the shape is good for handling.</li>
            <li>What good is straight hair if you have zillions of flyaways?</li>
            <li>I loved this straightener because it does the job fast, but i would suggest that you not buy it if you would like to save your money.</li>
            <li>It works really well and does a good job straightening my frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>and it does just as good of a job at my $150 straight iron.</li>
            <li>A good thing about this is that it shipped fast.</li>
            <li>I have fairly curly hair and even with hours invested in trying to straighten with this device, my hair did not get fully straight.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use and heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>I have that wonderful, wavy-in-the-back-and-underneath-but-straight-on-top hair (I know, lucky me), and I never even thought about using a straightener on it until a hair stylist did it for me once last year.</li>
            <li>right before I straighten my hair and the combination is amazing.</li>
            <li>:) This product was worth every penny of it!</li>
            <li>Other than that, it works great!</li>
            <li>But I would assume with other hair types this product would be excellent.</li>
            <li>A true bargain!</li>
            <li>Its design is excellent and, unlike some other Conair models, it does not cause cramping in the hands.</li>
            <li>But overall, a good purchase!</li>
            <li>This is so cool!</li>
            <li>Not a bad hair day!</li>
            <li>This is a great straightener for all hair types and great if you have thick hair.</li>
            <li>If you want a good straightener, then buy this one--If you don&#x27;t, go spend more for a professional one--</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is really easy to use...</li>
            <li>dressing has never been as easy.</li>

            <li>Makes using it so easy.</li>
            <li>It works so well, and heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li>This is so easy to use to accomplish the straightening of my hair.  </li>

            <li>becasue my hair was striaght, but tehn this strong oder started comming from it and my room started to havve a buringin smell to it every time i turned it on.</li>
            <li>it doesnt always stay on the highest power, even though it says it is, the heat isnt as strong.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend buying this product if you want to straighten your hair.</li>
            <li>It probably is a great flat iron for most people.</li>
            <li>I liked using it at first.</li>
            <li>Love the handles, easy to grasp and manuver through my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>It does get nice and hot quickly though!</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive and works great heats up very very fast</li>
            <li>In terms of durability, my girlfriend has had this model for over 3 years now, and it looks as good as new whenever she uses</li>
            <li>It worked perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and light.</li>
            <li>That part is fine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also light weight and easy to use.</li>
            <li>although mine which still works perfectly fine</li>
            <li>and it works just fine</li>
            <li>I have fine but unruly hair</li>
            <li>She also used it in Europe, and it was fine.</li>
            <li>Which is fine.</li>
            <li>I love the size of it and it goes really hot and has a turbo mode on top of that.</li>
            <li>They are great to use, and just as good if not better as they have fat paddles compared to my others here in the UK.  </li>
            <li>As a dual voltage product for travel it works fine, but the way it was designed make the plates stick to my hair and pulled some out.</li>
            <li>it is easy to use, it works in Europe and it is really cheap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best straightener I have owned, and I have owned two previously.</li>
            <li>I think this is a fine iron.  </li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and has so many setting levels.  </li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and makes my hair look sleek!  </li>
            <li>I love the color as well and it heats up really quick.</li>
            <li>I honestly think a majority of those positive comments were from people who have wavy--straight hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good, it heats up super quickly, stays very hot and does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li>Wow - It was great, heated up QUICK</li>
            <li>The Heat Ceramic Hair Straightened is quieter and faster also their hair are very straight and they look prettier!!</li>
            <li>Heats up very fast!!</li>
            <li>: 1) 2 minute heat up time 2) 25 temperature settings 3) huge plates 4)</li>
            <li>I am a huge frizz ball once again.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling like straw or looking fuzzy afterwards, which is a huge bonus.  </li>
            <li>The reviews were accurate.</li>
            <li>Very price reasonable and great product.</li>
            <li>in all a great value, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>My hairstylist recommended OPTIONS by framesi WAY SMOOTH stop frizz cream</li>
            <li>and it still worked amazing well and fast.  </li>
            <li>My sisters and I were amazed at the finished job, and I kept brushing my fingers through my hair because I&#x27;ve never felt it so smooth and shiny before.  </li>
            <li>It heats up fast and is effective on my wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>I have tried almost everything, but nothing really worked that nice.</li>
            <li>I also notice that it does not glide smoothly over the hair but sticks, and I suspect again it&#x27;s because of the difficulty in keeping the plates clamped shut.  </li>
            <li>These are fantastic straighteners for the price.</li>
            <li>Well, if you are looking for a cheap straightener-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the expense of a better quality iron to never have this happen again.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;~~I&#x27;d never straightened my hair before, but I found that practice and paitence are important...</li>
            <li>Overall, for the price, it is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>cause has a graduate for the heat, is ceramic and permite precise the temperature</li>
            <li>I had this on the highest setting (25) and it didn&#x27;t get it as straight as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>and I can get it looking smooth and shiny in about 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li>smooth n straightens like a pro..great for the m oney</li>
            <li>I think this is a fantastic product, just as the reviews led me to believe.</li>
            <li>It worked like a charm without burning me or my hair and the price was fantastic.</li>
            <li>It does not make the hair shine or smooth.</li>
            <li>straightens my hair so smoothly and silky.</li>
            <li>but this one is smooth, does the job and doesn&#x27;t break the bank.  </li>
            <li>and he said that the heating element had burned up, probably because it was cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I understand now why it was so cheap.</li>
            <li>What do you expect for a cheap straightener???</li>
            <li>it is a great product the cord is too short by a foot or two.</li>
            <li>Best one I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve tried a few.  </li>
            <li>My hair is amazingly shiny and pin straight from using this iron.</li>
            <li>my hair looked-- so shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>I may find it more useful once my hair gets longer again.    </li>
            <li>Fantastic straightener.</li>
            <li>But, just yesterday I plugged it up and the light was on and averything but there was no heat.</li>
            <li>making your hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li>It has been working as described; it is smooth and does not sticks to my hair</li>
            <li>It heat fast like in a minute, works really nice on my hair, I definitly will buy another</li>
            <li>, bc it was so cheap --</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for such a wonderful product Conair that everyone can afford.</li>
            <li>but I definitely recommend it to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money but wants to be happy with the results!</li>
            <li>The plates are smooth and warm the hair very efficiently.</li>
            <li>and this was used with good professional protective product.</li>
            <li>If you are traveling abroad and want to make sure you have the right tools to straighten your hair</li>
            <li>I cannot honestly say if I think it works better than the older model, because I prefer the older model better, sans the issue with the plates.</li>
            <li>Great flat iron!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Good: dual voltage, comfortable grip, long cord, great value</li>
            <li>straightener heats up quickly, and you have the choice of straightening \\&quot;power\\&quot;, so you don&#x27;t have to fry your hair if it is easily straightened.  </li>
            <li>It works pretty good on my hair, although I must say it does not work at the given heat setting (it said for straight hair use setting 10, whereas I got my desired results at 20).</li>
            <li>it was a good purchase and since my hair is long and needed something that could grab more hair.  </li>
            <li>Thankyou very much :)</li>
            <li>Because it is not a very expensive model, the ceramic irons are not sealed around the edges, therefore it is very easy to get your hair caught in it when you are trying to straightening your hair.  </li>
            <li>When I first got it, I was impressed at how hot it got in a very short time.</li>
            <li>Its worth it!</li>
            <li>great results for a long time.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Have been using it for about 2 years, worth every penny!</li>
            <li>then we went to Disney which was soo much fun!  </li>
            <li>your money for the other good things in life, and ignore the CHIs and Sedus and get this instead!</li>
            <li>it is worth the money!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a hair straightener that&#x27;s quick and leaves your hair super silky, pick up the Conair CS19CS!</li>
            <li>It was better than the 50 dollar hot tool I bought before this one.</li>
            <li>It really is worth buying!</li>
            <li>When i first got this product, i was in love with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure about durability but for the price this one makes an excellent job.</li>
            <li>i was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Never in my life have i been able to get my hair soooo stick straight!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen better hair straighteners, but usually at a much higher cost</li>
            <li>I made up a little test of my own to see how good it was.</li>
            <li>The version we wanted was no longer available, this unit in comparison is not as good but still better than any other we&#x27;ve found</li>
            <li>I have had 5 different irons and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>, their straightener is much better, it really straightens my hair, and my hair feel so smooth and shining.</li>
            <li>Still loving it and going to buy more for back up..</li>
            <li>It heated up fast and really did a good job.</li>
            <li>My daughter with very curly hair bought this straightener and loved it while it lasted; it worked really well straightening out her curls.</li>
            <li>Which is a good thing sort of, but I really wanted straight hair.</li>
            <li>This is by far the better straightener around!</li>
            <li>It is dual voltage which is perfect and heats up great for my thick, long hair.</li>
            <li>but if i spend $20 every 2 yrs thats fine this product is worth it</li>
            <li>If there are special instructions for use with 220 (as there is with hair dryers)</li>
            <li>Arrived right on time!</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s right!  </li>
            <li>This is one right for me!    </li>
            <li>Well, they were right!</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, I think it would work well on any type of hair because it has many different temperatures as well as a turbo function.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to set it very high either :)</li>
            <li>But  really this is a good product, I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>It does not get a good grip onto your hair, hair is still somewhat frizzy after going over hair twice and its very bulky looking and says it gets to 450 degrees on the highest setting which I highly doubt it does.</li>
            <li>Right now, I have held them together by a rubber band (and it works just fine).</li>
            <li>While temporary results are great, if you&#x27;re interested in lasting, repeated performances... try another product.</li>
            <li>really shows off the layers in my hair 8) 2 year warranty.</li>
            <li>As I said, I used it last night and it looked just as good this morning when I got out of bed.</li>
            <li>and I love it so much I decided to write a review.</li>
            <li>its true too.  </li>
            <li>well...nice heat settings...and cool attachments...</li>
            <li>But its really only good if you have wavy hair..  </li>
            <li>Definitely invest in some good hair products to protect your hair.</li>
            <li>I was delighted as I thought I would get what was pictured but did not - they shipped the same \\&quot;new\\&quot; model that I saw in the stores.  </li>
            <li>I love this one so much</li>
            <li>It is a good product and all the information set by amazon was the same when I got received the item</li>
            <li>good ans looks like it will last???</li>
            <li>When my old straightener broke, I thought I was not going to be able to find one just as good as the old one.</li>
            <li>So, I earlier had a Remington straightener which I loved, but as I was travelling to India, I needed a dual voltage straightener which would work there.</li>
            <li>I love how fast it is to heat up though.</li>
            <li>People will say it&#x27;s not as good because the plates are only ceramic plated.</li>
            <li>I have thick course hair and it smooths it perfectly!</li>
            <li>She loved the way this worked, and so did my younger daughter who kept taking it from her to use.  </li>
            <li>my hair for the most part flat/ straight</li>
            <li>I have used my last conair straightener for about 6 years and LOVED it.</li>
            <li>After a while, I just settled with my slightly straight, mostly wavy hair.</li>
            <li>: not enough temperature settings&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good product.</li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s not bad, if you don&#x27;t mind having crunchy hair.</li>
            <li>This is a not bad iron.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, love the large plates, so I&#x27;m able to do more of my long hair at a time.  </li>
            <li>It straightens hair beautifully and the comb attachment keeps hair from tangling as you slide it down the length of hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed that the hair can easily slip free of the panels when ironing, which can be a real pill.</li>
            <li>I have previously bought CONAIR Model CS19FCS for my friend in India, who loves it, because CONAIR Model CS19FCS could straighten and shine her Curly, frizzy, unmanageable hair, beautifully.</li>
            <li>It straightens my stubborn, curly hair very quickly, and it gets hot quickly.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly (about a minute) and is pretty easy to use.  </li>
            <li>If I were you, I&#x27;d invest money in a good ceramic flat iron like a CHI or Biosilk.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Thanks AMAZON for the quick delivery.</li>
            <li>..Heats up quickly &lt;br</li>
            <li>There are various settings you can choose from to accomodate different hair types and best of all it has an auto shut-off!</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and the attached comb helps keep my hair untangled as it goes between the ceramic plates.  </li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and won&#x27;t scorch your hair.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t expect a miracle from just running it over chunks of your hair quickly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for medium to long hair; run it through ONCE and your hair will be bone straight!</li>
            <li>heat quickly on both currents.  </li>
            <li>Dial to control heat level; heats up quickly</li>
            <li>It takes a bit more time than my older one.</li>
            <li>i like this iron tremendously.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly, smooths my hair and removes all the frizz.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, not that great for thick hair like mine.  </li>
            <li>On the plus side, it&#x27;s SUPER CHEAP, and it made my hair super straight and smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ideal for my short hair, but I&#x27;d use it frequently for touch ups when my hair was longer.  </li>
            <li>Does the straightening job quick.  </li>
            <li>It heats quickly yet the exterior surface doesn&#x27;t burn my hand.  </li>
            <li>Quick to heat up</li>
            <li>In about 10 minutes, I had this sleek, smooth, straight hair that looked fantastic,</li>
            <li>This straighter has adjustable heat and heats quickly.  </li>
            <li>Also nice because the iron part is wide. :)</li>
            <li>This straightener with dual voltage was perfect for our recent trip to Ireland--you only need an adaptor to use it.  </li>
            <li>But overall, an excellent purchase for my European travel.</li>
            <li>cause it heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>It glides smoothly over your hair and gets it very straight.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and gets very hot.</li>
            <li>Comfortable grip  4. Gets hot quickly.  </li>
            <li>My hair is frizz free and straight!</li>
            <li>Without the comb attachment, it works as well as the best regular flat irons, but with the comb and used correctly?</li>
            <li>And to think it is pretty cheap too.</li>
            <li>However it does get VERY hot at the highest setting</li>
            <li>This was one of the first straighteners I ever purchased - it worked fabulously but eventually the plates had some brown product build-up from my straightening cream</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been two days since I straightened my hair, and it&#x27;s still smooth and straight, even with the humidity!    </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this iron, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>But for the most part, I love this flat iron and it still surprises me sometimes at how well it works.  </li>
            <li>Now I can have more modern hairstyles and look more professional at work.  </li>
            <li>But when I did my hair after it totally dried and put nothing on it, the product worked beautifully.</li>
            <li>Nice curve to the handle helps with the use of this flat iron very quick to use and priced right.</li>
            <li>I am SO happy to have this iron and even am thinking of buying another one, just in case this one breaks down the road.  </li>
            <li>even on the most humid days (and I live in hot/humid NC).  </li>
            <li>and youll notice nothing afterward and never again on any new start ups :)</li>
            <li>I bought it about a year and half ago and it still works great.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product for those who have fussy hair and want to make them straight and shiny.</li>
            <li>I like the adjustable heat settings, but it&#x27;s easy to push the dial by mistake and end up with a much hotter (or cooler) setting than you intended.  </li>
            <li>The pictured flat iron, with comb attachment, is the greatest flat iron EVER.</li>
            <li>Fast and easy</li>
            <li>My hair was so hot when it came out of the plates that it hurt my hands!  </li>
            <li>You have a power on button and a turbo power on button and with that it gets turbo hot!</li>
            <li>Much to my surprise it worked!!</li>
            <li>I am completely untalented with fixing hair, but was able to use the iron on my first try to get fabulous results.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!!!       </li>
            <li>I burned my daughters face when I allowed her freshly straightened hair to fall in her face, the hair was very hot.</li>
            <li>No long waiting for it to warm up...</li>
            <li>And...it&#x27;s pretty, too!</li>
            <li>My hair is very delicate and I could never use straighteners before, but this ceramic one is great!!</li>
            <li>I have VERY thick hair and the size is perfect.</li>
            <li>Very plastic and cheap.</li>
            <li>I bought this 8-9 months back, and its amazing.</li>
            <li>my hair is straight and smooth</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth and straight it was after using this straightener.  </li>
            <li>works great on my medium heavy hair..</li>
            <li>, my bangs curled up on me while her hair remained straight and smooth.</li>
            <li>Totally reommendable for those who want to have good quality for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Worth every cent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny, believe you me.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth trying</li>
            <li>So far I love it and can&#x27;t wait to use it again.</li>
            <li>This is well worth 26 dollars.</li>
            <li>Even though I have longer hair, the straightener is almost too big to effectively straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>Just got this as a birthday present from my daughter, who has been straightening her hair for years and is quite the expert, and I am thrilled with this product.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>so far, i&#x27;ve only used it once, but it was so great</li>
            <li>Its the money worth.</li>
            <li>it was so much fun</li>
            <li>It snagged my hair, the plates were too big for my cut (which can be blamed on my own oversight.)  </li>
            <li>And if you have any kind of texture in your hair, it has to be put on the max settings, and even then your hair will only be a ball of frizz.</li>
            <li>I was able to completely straighten it in a  hour.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price for me.  </li>
            <li>but I think it is well worth it for the results it delivers.</li>
            <li>The older model would break relatively easily if you ever accidentally dropped it.</li>
            <li>It does get hot pretty fast but could be better.</li>
            <li>Worth the money</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not even worth</li>
            <li>Worth the money and has lasted.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so worth</li>
            <li>The heat settings are cool because you can make it as hot as you want depending on your hair type.</li>
            <li>But yes, that&#x27;s my hair success story.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so worth</li>
            <li>The heat settings are cool because you can make it as hot as you want depending on your hair type.</li>
            <li>But yes, that&#x27;s my hair success story.</li>
            <li>Its well worth the price.</li>
            <li>it really  worth .</li>
            <li>This is one of those rare occasions you get a quality product inexpensively.  </li>
            <li>Lastly, for travel it&#x27;s kind of bulky/heavy.</li>
            <li>This little guy gets super hot and is the most effective tool I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best flat iron i&#x27;ve purchased in anywhere near the price range.</li>
            <li>and it is the ONLY flat iron i can find anywhere with the comb attachment on it that really makes a HUGE difference on my tangly curly hair!!!!!</li>
            <li>I have used my friends staighteners which were way more expensive and this one does just as good as a job!</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and gets plenty hot.  </li>
            <li>It does not get super hot as I am used to(my</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and does exactly what I want.</li>
            <li>At first I loved it, it worked great on my thick coarse hair.</li>
            <li>I loved it at the first, it straightens my hair, however it doesn&#x27;t give you the shining smoothy look, it makes my hair very dry.</li>
            <li>This flat iron is amazing.</li>
            <li>I used a friend&#x27;s $100+ flat iron and was tempted to buy one of my own.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always wanted to get a nice flat iron, but couldn&#x27;t afford the fancy salon ones.  </li>
            <li>It gets very hot, and fast!</li>
            <li>and I opened it right away.</li>
            <li>I saw this one on Amazon, and bought it right away</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s what frizz lotion is for, right?  </li>
            <li>Therefore, as you start to flatten or curl, your hair slides right out of the iron before you can even flatten or curl.  </li>
            <li>I am in Europe right now</li>
            <li>This straightener is just right for my hair type.</li>
            <li>She was right.</li>
            <li>Some people would tell me to switch to a Chi or some other high end brand, but honestly, the $24.99 Conair works better than the $69.99 &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; one.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s overall nice, but does not get as hot as I want</li>
            <li>It plates are nice and wide (2\\&quot;) and it heats up fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>&amp; i was anxious to use it after i read all these great reviews on this site.  </li>
            <li>Ceramice plates in general are better for your hair.  </li>
            <li>I used the crimper and waver and they were pretty useful</li>
            <li>I received the product in time, good service, and I am so happy with the product is excelent to dry the hair wet or dry and is fast and easy.</li>
            <li>this iron glided right through my hair leaving it no only straight but nice and silky too.</li>
            <li>Other then that, this item is simple to use and works very well and heats up wonderfully which saves time.</li>
            <li>Since CONAIR CS19FCS was not available from AMAZON, I chose the next best CONAIR Model CS19VCSR, which is seen in the picture , for her and shipped to India.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>for something better, it&#x27;s worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>It got here super fast</li>
            <li>this one is just as good for half the price.</li>
            <li>This product is awesome and is worth the mere wat.</li>
            <li>(I am super klutzy and was expecting some injuries, haha).  </li>
            <li>but the common impression that my mother and girlfriend have given is that this is the best hair straightener anywhere near this price.     </li>
            <li>heats up fast and is easy to use my teenage daughters who are very picky love this straightener.</li>
            <li>This straightener heats super fast but it does not straighten well at all</li>
            <li>While I love the wider plates, I really miss the old model of this, where it had the comb attached to one of the plates.  </li>
            <li>It was delivered quickly and works really well.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and gets very hot.  </li>
            <li>This iron gets very hot fast.</li>
            <li>otherwise the handle is really too hot which i have to use a glove specially made for hot irons and hot curlers.</li>
            <li>This may be a good hot iron for people with slightly wavy hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is one case where the relatively inexpensive product works great (and maybe even better than the more expensive kinds).</li>
            <li>It even has a TURBO button on it for even faster start up, but Ive never used it as it is already very fast.</li>
            <li>My hair are curly and very very airy-fluffy.</li>
            <li>This item heats up very fast.</li>
            <li>This was bought for my 15 year old granddaughter and she says it&#x27;s just fine.</li>
            <li>I wanted the straightner&#x27;s for my holiday in the states ( visit most years due to family), knew nothing about Conair when I ordered them and have to admit for the price didn&#x27;t think they would be to hot, but what a fantastic surprise.  </li>
            <li>I like how it is slightly curved as well, so I can grab hair closer to my head  more easily.</li>
            <li>and when I use this flat iron my hair comes out looking smooth and shiny and straight!!!</li>
            <li>do think this is a good buy for the money (very inexpensive), but this particular Conair simply won&#x27;t make curly hair STRAIGHT . . .</li>
            <li>Yes, the turbo gets VERY hot very quickly, but I have mixed frizzy, curly hair and the first time I straighten</li>
            <li>Those expensive irons must either be magic or overrated, because this affordable one is amazing!</li>
            <li>Love this iron better than any of my more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>Only takes one stroke no need to go over it more then once.</li>
            <li>I first tried a temperature of 10.</li>
            <li>Decided to give it one more try myself after reading the reviews on this Conair, after all it was only $20.00.  </li>
            <li>Its safer to use a higher setting on your hair once, then go over one spot</li>
            <li>so I took it out for the first time</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I had been searching for.  </li>
            <li>It takes your hair from frizzy to SILKY STRAIGHT!</li>
            <li>so well I had to do the rest or my hair would look funny.  </li>
            <li>About two years ago I got a straightener by Conair almost exactly like this one.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s never failed me.</li>
            <li>I like this product pretty well.</li>
            <li>At  first I was thrown off by the handles because I&#x27;m used to V shaped handles.</li>
            <li>It has temperature control so you can get it really hot if needed.  </li>
            <li>Usually you will get a straightener that does not have the removeable comb or turbo on putton and there are also 25 heat settings, it is simple to use and works great!</li>
            <li>I was unsure at first, because I have purchased many irons prior to this one.</li>
            <li>then, when i get to the top layers, i use the boar-bristle comb, and it adds an extra bit of sheen.&lt;br</li>
            <li>its not difficult to use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but, like I said, its big and bulky.</li>
            <li>I would say GO AHEAD to any one who wants to buy this!</li>
            <li>This is the first flat-iron I have ever purchased and</li>
            <li>In 2002, I bought the first hairdresser from CONAIR - hair setter.</li>
            <li>its just the one that i own, but i am not really satisified with this product</li>
            <li>Thanks Iron Bod Studio!  &amp;</li>
            <li>We will be returning to Florida very soon!</li>
            <li>hair is one of my favorite parts of me, and now I am totally floored but the damage done to it by this product.  </li>
            <li>Hey everyone this really does work!</li>
            <li>And im SOOOOO glad i got it before i go  back to school!</li>
            <li>I never thought my hard-to-manage hair could become so straight!</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time today and the verdict is: meh.</li>
            <li>I have thick, wavy, course hair, and it doesn&#x27;t work great.</li>
            <li>I set the heat level to 20 (of 25), which is more than hot enough.</li>
            <li>My hair is extremely hot to the touch.  </li>
            <li>It looks sleeker, and my hair kind of curls in when I use, but not completely straight.</li>
            <li>Thats how hot this straightener gets</li>
            <li>It lasted for about 5 months and the plates just stopped getting hot.</li>
            <li>The CS19JCS instant heat is only $20 and works GREAT with silky straight results.</li>
            <li>and I can immediately start using it as it immediately becomes hot.</li>
            <li>When you first buy this and plug it in, it will have a noticeable smell but the smell burns away</li>
            <li>but it is definitely hyped up to be more than it is.</li>
            <li>I love this hair straightener... got it about 2 1/2 years ago and use it almost daily.  </li>
            <li>And it works so fast too!</li>
            <li>I personally think this does a better job than a CHI.</li>
            <li>I made sure I brushed my hair to get out any tangles before straightening.)  </li>
            <li>The first time it didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>Also, my hair is naturally pretty frizzy.</li>
            <li>, I highly recommend this item and the price cannot be beat!!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I was amazed.  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had this product for about a year now and it works just as well as it did when I first bought it.  </li>
            <li>Im glad it was only $20.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product highly!!</li>
            <li>I went with the wider model, and like it better than the smaller one I&#x27;ve been using at home.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s weaker, but definitely gives you a more cared look, shiny hair.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Probably won&#x27;t last more than a year, but</li>
            <li>gift for a teen who love it.</li>
            <li>I had mine exactly 3 years when it stopped heating the plates.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect it to match the much higher quality Sedu but thought it would be sufficient for travel.</li>
            <li>Since returning home have been looking in UK and sadly not found them here.  </li>
            <li>Works great, even on my incredibly thick hair.  </li>
            <li>also love the fact that it heats up instantly.  </li>
            <li>The product itself does exactly what it&#x27;s designed to do.</li>
            <li>but it looks exactly like the picture....</li>
            <li>First warning sign: this product arrived in a plastic bag.</li>
            <li>Well I was wrong, it worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li>It works efficiently but it sometimes burns my hair because it gets so hot.</li>
            <li>The first time I did it</li>
            <li>Her hair always looked so cute, even one day when we were stuck outside in a thunderstorm</li>
            <li>so thanks guys! &#x3D;</li>
            <li>I would suggest that you start with a lower setting first.</li>
            <li>and I noticed that the thing was not quite as hot.</li>
            <li>Other than that I&#x27;m glad I bought this!</li>
            <li>(fine, wavy, dry/frizzy).&lt;br /&gt;It heats up quickly and you can adjust to different temperatures (from 1 up to 25 - I use 15)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny b/c</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first</li>
            <li>It did not get as hot as it indicated and my hair kept getting caught under the plates.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s more compact than my last one was.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted and needed.</li>
            <li>This worked well - the first time we used it.  </li>
            <li>I find that if I don&#x27;t use the comb, my hair will constantly fall out of the super smooth plates.  </li>
            <li>Conair products are known to work great and last a long time!!</li>
            <li>Conair is good if something goes wrong to just send the appliance back and receive another in its place, and a two year warranty is better than most hair styling electrical tools.  </li>
            <li>Blowdry my hair dry and then use the flat iron to give my hair a beautiful, straight and shiny finish.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this flat iron.</li>
            <li>most flat irons don&#x27;t work we&#x27;ll for my hair type.  </li>
            <li>(I have thick, wavy hair that tends to frizz), and this product is 100 times better (being able to adjust the temp really helps)!</li>
            <li>I REALLY LOVE THIS FLAT IRON,</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve had curling irons and flat irons get fried when I&#x27;m overseas, even with the power converter.</li>
            <li>i love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>This flat iron is Fantastic!</li>
            <li>I have several straightening irons to get the kinks out of my frizz-in-the-humidity hair, and I can attest to the fact that high cost does not necessarily mean a better outcome!  </li>
            <li>It is one of few flat irons which has this capability, and it&#x27;s cheap, making it perfect for international travel.</li>
            <li>And I Im lucky ,because it is dual voltage as I m living in New Zealand 230V .</li>
            <li>Well times and technology have changed and  I must say I LOVE THIS FLAT IRON!  </li>
            <li>It heats up fast and my hair runs through smoothly, leaving it soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>i only spent 22 bucks on this great item and it works like a dream.</li>
            <li>However, Conair has created a great product that simply does what is expected.</li>
            <li>When it comes to beauty products, I have recently learned that when you try to cheap out and cut corners, what you end up with is worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It takes out all of my curl, and leaves me with soft, smooth, straight hair.  </li>
            <li>I love having straight hair again; my only regret is not getting it sooner!  </li>
            <li>My hair doesnt get stuck anywhere and gets hot pretty fast</li>
            <li>Got really really hot when I first bought it, and over time it lost a lot of heat to the point it didn&#x27;t straighten very well.</li>
            <li>Overall, good for international travel.</li>
            <li>Also it leaves it looking very shiny and healthy especially when I used the Tresemme Thermal Creations spray before.</li>
            <li>I love it so much I have continued to use it since I got back home!</li>
            <li>My first one was 1\\&quot;, and I certainly prefer the 2\\&quot; one.</li>
            <li>It heats up very fast and is ready in no time.</li>
            <li>One thing i did like very much was that it turns on really fast and has an option for &#x27;turbo&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Aside from that, it really does a pretty good job, especially considering the low price.</li>
            <li>previous ones worked better because they got hot quickly</li>
            <li>Light weight, and easy to use!I highly recommend it for very long hair!</li>
            <li>Nice wide plates work on large sections of hair at a time which is perfect for those with long, thick hair like me who don&#x27;t want to spend an hour on their hair.  </li>
            <li>I do not understand all of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I mistakenly purchased this based on the positive reviews here.</li>
            <li>You also cant get to close to your head as it lets out a lot of hot intense heat.</li>
            <li>It straightens my hair pretty fast.</li>
            <li>My old straightener made my hair oily after one day because I constantly had to smooth it over and over again, but with the Conair straightner, I just smooth it over my hair</li>
            <li>This flat iron is fast, and fabulous!</li>
            <li>I was looking for a good, yet unexpensive, flat iron and decided to look around the net before having to drive everywhere...</li>
            <li>and I loved how the small combs work with it.</li>
            <li>Also, I have taken relatively good care of it and store it in drawer, but I do admit that I have dropped it a few times!</li>
            <li>I think I am going to jump on the bandwagon and spend the money to get a good solid flat iron.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for people like myself who wants stick straight hair quickly without a lot of hassle.</li>
            <li>My hair is light, easy to manipulate but reacts to any slight change in the weather.      </li>
            <li>This straigtener warms up quickly, works on the first pass and leaves your hair feeling luxuriously soft and straight.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to remove by sliding out but stays in place when put back on, it is also easy to put back on.</li>
            <li>This iron gets my hair silky smooth usually in one swipe, but at most two.</li>
            <li>, my hair is naturally wavy but super easy to straighten and i felt like after just one use of this con-air it almost instantly fried the section of the hair i tried to go over.</li>
            <li>My hair stays straight all day long and it also takes the static out of it.</li>
            <li>I love the wide plates - it speeds up my straightening time and it stays consistently hot - no wait time for rewarming.      </li>
            <li>but I comb my fingers through it real quick and back to normal.</li>
            <li>It worked beautifully on the fine, thin parts of my hair, but on the coarser, thicker parts, it wasn&#x27;t enough.</li>
            <li>I have really long thick hair and a friend told me how ceramic is best for hair straighteners.</li>
            <li>Oh my God ,it is so good, it makes my long hair very smooth, and in the mean time it keeps my hair volume as it is.</li>
            <li>Also something could be heard rattling around inside when the unit is turned in certain ways -</li>
            <li>This product works really well even on my thick and curly hair, I was pleasantly suprised... until this week it BROKE.</li>
            <li>This hair straightener is EXACTLY what I needed: inexpensive, reliable, high enough temp, and easy to use.</li>
            <li>And probably not as hot as other better quality straighteners.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly with adjustable heat, the comb helps hold hair tame when straightening, and the results are fantastic!  </li>
            <li>This is a good little flat iron heats up quickly and can be adjusted.</li>
            <li>The straightener works very good, even with my difficult hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few straighteners out there, and for the price, this little number is AWESOME! &lt;</li>
            <li>This flat iron is easy to use and efficient.</li>
            <li>am so positive, Cousin would love it, as this model is an enhanced model than the previous one.&lt;br /&gt;I , very highly recommend CONAIR Model CS19VCSR and or Model CS19FCS to any one who wants hair to look like Barbie !</li>
            <li>This was just okay -- i&#x27;ve taken it on my trips to Europe and didn&#x27;t love it -- if you&#x27;re used to a high-quality ceramic straightener (Chi, GHD, Sedu brands, etc), this will be tough to get used to.</li>
            <li>and if you are looking at it, i recomend spending a little more money to buy a way better quality one that wil actually work.</li>
            <li>I had previously had a flat iron that did nothing in comparison, and this worked great.  </li>
            <li>The heating element got so hot is actually singed my hair right off!  </li>
            <li>The next morning, I had frizz all over and huge puffy waves.  </li>
            <li>straightener took only minutes to heat up, a huge plus.</li>
            <li>Unless you have HUGE hands, this makes it really difficlut to close and hold shut properly.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast, light weight and even works well when I travel outside of the US.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li>Heats up fast, straightens well, and the auto shut off</li>
            <li>managed to make it stick straight, unlike some of the irons I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>: 1) Gave my hair too much volume (but that could just be my hair)</li>
            <li>It really does.</li>
            <li>I loathed it so much, I refused to buy another one by this company.</li>
            <li>And, its very durable.</li>
            <li>It seemed that everyone was in agreement that it worked very well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I expected more than that from Conair.</li>
            <li>I took a nap for 2 hours soon after using it and when I woke up, it was still straight as before.  </li>
            <li>it is just as straight as when I styled it.  </li>
            <li>we&#x27;ll see how well it stays straight.    </li>
            <li>My hair stayed straight all day.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and works as advertised.</li>
            <li>Even though it does seem to take quite a while to heat up, I still recommend this product highly!</li>
            <li>really straightens in no time.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe it really works.</li>
            <li>you see, i have frizz-prone hair that sometimes and in someplaces is curly, and then in some is almost straight.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and maintains tempurature throughout useage.</li>
            <li>my hair is very course &amp; very curly.  </li>
            <li>i had shiny straight movie star</li>
            <li>I absolutely am a convert to having the comb attachment.  </li>
            <li>warms up fast, but I have problem with overheating, since I always manage to scroll the heater adjuster up while I am working on my hair...</li>
            <li>and I felt like it was really damaging.  </li>
            <li>Its made my hair look really shiny and took out all the frizz.</li>
            <li>My hair was pin straight when I was done.  </li>
            <li>It really does heat up in 60sec.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>so didn&#x27;t bother me all that much.  </li>
            <li>Fast heating and</li>
            <li>lt;&amp;lt; My hair is really curly still which is really hawt now</li>
            <li>bein curly AND straight</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
            <li>In my opinion, sometimes it&#x27;s well worth it to shell out the extra money for a much much better product that will last you much much longer.</li>
            <li>it stays straight all day, even with snow and rain.    </li>
            <li>It saves me so much time doing my untamed mane compared to a blow dryer.</li>
            <li>This hair straightener works very well.  </li>
            <li>Even after I had worked on it for hours it wouldn&#x27;t be completely straight and any contact with humidity would cause it to frizz up.  </li>
            <li>It made the process much faster.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and helpful tool for smoothing very curly hair.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to try that.  </li>
            <li>But it does work really well.</li>
            <li>so i don&#x27;t straighten much.</li>
            <li>Even when it rains or is really humid</li>
            <li>In 15 mins I have stick straight hair that is shiny and glossier than ever.</li>
            <li>actually haha</li>
            <li>I like this straigtener and all, but it doesn&#x27;t really &amp;quot;straigten&amp;quot; my hair.</li>
            <li>It heats up really fast.</li>
            <li>but it really helped to capture the hair and guide it through the plates.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>This product works really  well.</li>
            <li>- my hair was relatively straight, although frizzy.</li>
            <li>and it leaves my hair straight and shinny.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works really well on my daughters hair.</li>
            <li>and it still wouldn&#x27;t really leave it straight</li>
            <li>It heats up fast, too.</li>
            <li>I always had to go over one spot repeatedly in order for it to stay straight</li>
            <li>and whenever I try to protect my hair from the heat my hair would come out looking very stringy.</li>
            <li>but it looks promising.</li>
            <li>It took me only about 6-7 minutes to straighten my hair to be smooth and sleek.  </li>
            <li>so getting it straight isn&#x27;t the problem - getting rid of the frizz</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much fir 20 bucks.</li>
            <li>The adjuster really works for this product (not just decoration) and I haven&#x27;t had the problem of burnt hair</li>
            <li>This heats up fast.  </li>
            <li>They won&#x27;t damage it as much</li>
            <li>I have tried it myself and it really works.</li>
            <li>I had to o over each section twice to get it straight.</li>
            <li>It heats up in under a minute (more like 30 seconds) to the hottest setting and is so wide it takes No time to straighten.</li>
            <li>THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR A 5 STAR CUSTOMER SERVICE.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t use a straightener very often</li>
            <li>absolutely will not work.</li>
            <li>I would get a much smoother, and quicker, go of my hair, but with this one I have to use one hand to hold the straightener and another to hold a comb underneath</li>
            <li>it heats up much faster.</li>
            <li>but for the price and the results Ive gotten so far its definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recomend it!</li>
            <li>She is a real tender-head</li>
            <li>Fast heat.</li>
            <li>Straight hair in minutes.</li>
            <li>All I can say that she keeps her hair straight now.</li>
            <li>The iron heats up fast and works very well.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t complain too much about this one.  </li>
            <li>I guess it really just depends on your hair type.</li>
            <li>I bought this one for my wife and she really like it.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>It stays straight when it is humid, and it has these neat combs that attach to it.  </li>
            <li>and it is ready to go.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, this one works really well and heats up really fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product DOES however heat up fast</li>
            <li>I have straight hair but want to give it shine</li>
            <li>No matter how tempted you are to get a haircut, you know that would defeat the whole purpose of letting your hair grow out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a trusthworthy friend, and it makes my hair life so much easier.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a trusthworthy friend, and it makes my hair life so much easier.</li>
            <li>One of my dorm neighbors had this very flatiron, and keep in mind this was over 5 years ago.</li>
            <li>Very overrated if you ask me.</li>
            <li>It heats up in a couple of minutes, and does a fantastic job on medium to coarse hair.</li>
            <li>It does heat up really fast though.</li>
            <li>so I really cant rate this product.</li>
            <li>she really loves it</li>
            <li>I have really curly hair and a lot of hair.</li>
            <li>I got the bottom layer of hair straightened without too much problems.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Thanks amazon.</li>
            <li>I would really recommend this straightener.</li>
            <li>I suggest it highly!</li>
            <li>This straightener will won&#x27;t keep your hair straight.</li>
            <li>company was fast and efficient sending it</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>(The styles the hair straightener has made possible also make her appear more mature.)  </li>
            <li>I have naturally CURLY hair, but am blessed enough to be able to get it to straighten with some help.  </li>
            <li>Disregard negative reviews of this straightener - it lives up to its reputation, and is a really good deal.</li>
            <li>The only place the plates completely touch is towards the top of the iron.  </li>
            <li>I found the detachable comb to be more trouble than it was worth.  </li>
            <li>was particularly excited to see how tight of a grip the plates could get around my hair while the smooth ceramic surface prevents snagging and breakage--</li>
            <li>I know the flat iron is the problem because when i pay to have someone else do it, it comes out very smooth, soft, and shiny.</li>
            <li>so you can easily flatten all the hair in a bundle; right now if you have a thicker clump of hair, the other pieces don&#x27;t get flattened.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Basically, this straightener is fine, but it&#x27;s JUST a $20 flat iron, so please expect that.</li>
            <li>I use it for getting my hair to not get tangled easily (which it doesn&#x27;t after using), make it a little neater, and to make it shinier (which it does look after using this!)&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would say this is a good straightener, but the heat is slightly less than what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>It heats quickly and stays hot, and only takes about 15 minutes to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>I have had mine for 5 years and it still gets just as hot and works as well as a new one.</li>
            <li>Looked it up curious how high the heat goes on this thing, and realized my review didn&#x27;t really say anything about why I felt it wasn&#x27;t good enough for me.  </li>
            <li>But it is a nice flat iron, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>My old $10 flat Iron works much better than this cheap Flat Iron.</li>
            <li>This is a FANTASTIC flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many from other brands but none worked with me and gave me salon results as CONAIR</li>
            <li>She loves this one and says it works better than the other one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned several different straighteners in the past, but I must say this is the best one I&#x27;ve used to date.  </li>
            <li>My daughters and I have tried several other \\&quot;flat iron\\&quot; straighteners, including other models by Conair, but this is without a doubt THE BEST available.</li>
            <li>Never will i use any other straightener. :)</li>
            <li>Normally, I would be pissed off!</li>
            <li>As I am looking for a new straightener I was surprised to find my current one in the top 5 bestselling.</li>
            <li>I ran the straightener down again and I had shiny straight hair but more volume than I bargained for.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair, which I love to wear straight, after trying to straighten my hair once with another more expensive hair straightener and ending up with a scarecrow mop I gave up and just went to my hairdressers to get it blown out.  </li>
            <li>have thin, fine, almost straight hair, pretty easy to manage, so</li>
            <li>Ok so firstly, about a year ago, I guess I was going through some \\&quot;teenager angst\\&quot; hormonal stage, but I chopped off my long hair to a really boy short cut.</li>
            <li>Heat very quickly and the 2\\&quot; wide iron works very well.</li>
            <li>First of all let me start by saying I have naturally wavy, frizzy out of control hair.</li>
            <li>The true test is to straighten my hair before going out clubbing in Chicago where the clubs are open until 5am and after all that dancing</li>
            <li>I started off with a way to small one, so I&#x27;m loving it</li>
            <li>The only thing that can be a small con is that sometimes I have to hit the power on button 2-3 times to get it to turn on, which is easy to tell because the light comes right on.</li>
            <li>It actually takes more time to cool down (approx 15-20 minutes).</li>
            <li>I like that it has wide plates and it glides right through my hair, makes it super shiny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say this particular ConAir flat iron makes up for a multitude of past sins, and doesn&#x27;t put a dent in your budget.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s given me a whole new look.&lt;BR</li>
            <li>live in a very humid place</li>
            <li>I bought this because I needed a new iron fast.</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t know why I had so much faith in my new straightener, even though I had never used it before....</li>
            <li>however, the conair cs19jcs works much better and for much less money.</li>
            <li>ok so my dad bought me this striaghtner a year and a half ago.</li>
            <li>I like this product and the best thing about it is, it actually generates less heat and create a less damage to my hair</li>
            <li>Also features a \\&quot;power\\&quot; and \\&quot;turbo power\\&quot; button, which I can only assume means \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; is volcano-like hot, which is exactly what it felt like.</li>
            <li>I read alot of reviews about this particular straightener.</li>
            <li>I have an older 1 1/2 inch conair that still works, but I&#x27;ve been using this 2 inch one almost every day since I bought it.  </li>
            <li>I was told you need to spend a lot to get a decent ceramic hair iron.</li>
            <li>My hair burns really quickly, you can see smoke, and it doesn&#x27;t even straighten it enough.</li>
            <li>So  I wrote a review awhile ago when I first bought it but after using it only about three times I realized that yes first it straightens it</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t get caught in my hair, heated up quickly and stayed at a constant temperature, and I didn&#x27;t even burn myself</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t feel particularly sturdy.</li>
            <li>My next test was going out dancing at a club for 5 hours which causes my hair to get super frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I was unsure as to how I would like it since I had an older model.</li>
            <li>I do appreciate the fact that this model doesn&#x27;t grab your hair like the older model.</li>
            <li>Did a decent job of straightening my hair.</li>
            <li>This is a great straightener for thick and/or coarse hair.</li>
            <li>This is still a decent iron.</li>
            <li>I am not a big fan of this straightener (my multiple Remington straighteners are much more efficient for comparable price), however it is my go to when traveling abroad since it has the dual voltage function.</li>
            <li>Left my hair soft, smooth, and shiny.</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s older straightener was on</li>
            <li>Barely gets hot, doesn&#x27;t work very well at all.</li>
            <li>Next time I&#x27;ll spend the extra $30 for a better quality one.</li>
            <li>but you could definitely get a better one for the same price it took me hours to straighten my hair!</li>
            <li>there are several settings on it too, so you can get it just a little warm to very,very hot by turning the dial to the heat you want.</li>
            <li>I blow dry my hair, dye it, and use this flat iron and my hair seems to be pretty healthy with all I do to</li>
            <li>Plug it in, push button to turn on and when it&#x27;s hot enough the blinking light goes solid.</li>
            <li>These flat irons are horribly on thick hair bewarned perfect Remington flat irons.</li>
            <li>After about a year of owning the product, the clip that clips the scissors-like parts together came loose, and I started having to clamp it together with my free hand in addition to squeezing the handle.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this flat-iron.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast, works fast - no sitting there a long time to get each piece straight, it does it on the first try.</li>
            <li>straightener is highly inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this straightener</li>
            <li>I decided to buy this straightener based on its high reviews and the fact that I&#x27;m a fan of Conair curling irons.</li>
            <li>My hairstyle will stay all day even in high humidity (provided I have an umbrella).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Later that week, I picked up a proper UK ceramic/tourmaline iron for less than 20 GBP at Boots that worked great during my time there.</li>
            <li>I had brought it for a cousin in India, and probably due to the diff in voltage out there, I didnt find it as good as I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>Multiple heat settings - this baby gets HOT!  </li>
            <li>This is the second conair hair product (the other one is for making curls) and I have been very satisfied with both of them so far.</li>
            <li>Wow!!</li>
            <li>In all honesty, if I were to buy something for travel again, i might think about investing in something better for time&#x27;s sake, and for the sake of my hair, as this seemed to fry it a little.</li>
            <li>I liked that it held my hair as it straightened, but it was too hard to get my hair into the straightener with it on.</li>
            <li>I am looking to buy one for my neice for Christmas, and perhaps get myself a new one, just for the new features!</li>
            <li>So far I have had the straightener for about two weeks, it heats up fast, to a high heat if needed.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally straight, but I have some broken hair that likes to fly out in different directions.  </li>
            <li>Purchased for my very picky 15 year old daughter and she loves it.</li>
            <li>is marked thanks</li>
            <li>be careful to watch for the light.</li>
            <li>You can now see what my hair really looks like: shiny and soft with layers.</li>
            <li>It took no time at all to heat up, it gets super hot and HOLY COW</li>
            <li>She used the first one so much that it simply wore out!</li>
            <li>and she has never complained.     </li>
            <li>I may buy a few more of these just in case</li>
            <li>I used it a few times and it did the job okay for the price</li>
            <li>But hey, if you want to waste your money feel free to buy the conair!</li>
            <li>Normally I use a HAI with the highest heat setting, so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but so far so good.</li>
            <li>Not only was it fun to wash in the shower, but I didn&#x27;t dread having to sit for hours every weekend having my mom help me straighten my hair or go to the salon everytime</li>
            <li>Believe that if I finally found my miracle product that allows my hair to be the way I want without a bunch of stress, it&#x27;s worth a shot for anyone.</li>
            <li>Believe that if I finally found my miracle product that allows my hair to be the way I want without a bunch of stress, it&#x27;s worth a shot for anyone.</li>
            <li>that you turn based on what kind of hair you have, and for me with shoulder or just below shoulder length thick hair</li>
            <li>I found this product very user friendly, i was able to straighten all my hair in matter of a few minutes, results were instanteous...!!!!</li>
            <li>Blew me away!nyone that has thinner or less wavy hair is really, really gonna love this because it really will only take minutes for them.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this item though if you were in the market of looking for an affordable flat iron that gave you the same quality straightening power of a hot tools, now it doesn&#x27;t get that hot, but it&#x27;s pretty darn close.</li>
            <li>This straightener really does work as well as the $90 one I had before and much better than other irons with similar price tags that I have tried.</li>
            <li>but right after it poofs out again and its not just my hair its definitely the straightener.</li>
            <li>Lets just say i took it right back.</li>
            <li>But it seems to tame it, even in the most humid conditions, and that is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I would usually wash my hair and throw it back in a ponytail, and styling my own hair became the norm for me only for special occasions- until now.    </li>
            <li>it straightened my thick hair perfectly in just a few seconds, and i only had to iron each section of my hair once to get it stick straight.</li>
            <li>While I really really wish that Conair would go back to the built in combs, I am able to straighten my hair quicker than the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li>Rarely it frizzes, usually leaving my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>But then I tried ConAir&#x27;s new ceramic straightener.</li>
            <li>and it works just like new.</li>
            <li>Time for a new brand of straightening iron.</li>
            <li>I never used them until a new hairdresser persuaded me to try it again</li>
            <li>my hair is curly because I live in Florida.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a new straightener, keep looking.</li>
            <li>and I decided to try something new.</li>
            <li>I live in Vegas</li>
            <li>Im from New York</li>
            <li>Now I have to buy a new straightener</li>
            <li>They certainly don&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
            <li>I live in Argentina and it didn&#x27;t work here.</li>
            <li>If you have thin short hair, you might not need something this large and powerful, but for us thick wavy hair girls, it is AWESOME.</li>
            <li>All in all, this is probably fine for the average person</li>
            <li>I bought a lighter more expensive one, and I would say that this one still does a better job, though I like have a smaller one for me in particular.</li>
            <li>I love how it has big plates and how it heats up in 60 sec.</li>
            <li>I love the 2 inch plates, it makes straightening thick hair go much faster.</li>
            <li>I went out and bought my own a few weeks later.</li>
            <li>Again with a metal iron it would take 15 minutes to heat up and would consistently cool down making the whole straightening process take an hour.  </li>
            <li>flat iron does the job right</li>
            <li>It makes my hair very soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Very sensitive to plugs in.</li>
            <li>The design has a long skinny handle and a much fatter plate head and is heavy and much longer than most straighteners.  </li>
            <li>I was very surprised at how well this product worked for me.</li>
            <li>and it only takes me about 20 minutes to get my hair very straight.</li>
            <li>i have super wavy and thick hair, and with one stroke, my hair was flat, shiny, and smooth!</li>
            <li>This thing is large, bulky, and pulls my hair if I&#x27;m not very careful.</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s a 2 inch flat iron, it actually gives me huge and bouncy waves.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it possible, but I have pin straight hair!</li>
            <li>It gets extra hot.</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>I have used Conair appliances before that I was disappointed in, but this one impressed me with its performance.  </li>
            <li>How hot does it have to get to actually singe hair off?!  </li>
            <li>I have it set too (1-25), turbo on or off, it gets hot enough to damage my hair and even burn some off.  </li>
            <li>even if it&#x27;s this cheap, it&#x27;s not worth it</li>
            <li>I looked in all my local stores and could not find the exact replacement</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Doesnt get hot enough...</li>
            <li>Not to hot, just enough heat to press her hair and make manageable.</li>
            <li>This one&#x27;s cheap and not worth it.</li>
            <li>But when I used it I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>Ceramic Straightener Model RV045C. Does the EXACT SAME job as the conair, but lasts for years.&amp;#60;br /&amp;#62; &amp;#60;br /&amp;#62;</li>
            <li>At first I figured, eh my hair will frizz up again when I go outside (lived in WI where it&#x27;s humid).  </li>
            <li>It gets hot enough without the turbo.</li>
            <li>just didn&#x27;t get hot enough to fully straighten it out.</li>
            <li>The model I bought is almost exactly like this one, only there isn&#x27;t a turbo feature.</li>
            <li>Does not get hot enough.</li>
            <li>Did not become hot enough to do the job.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when I tried it!</li>
            <li>However it gets plenty hot enough to do the job.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough and the plates don&#x27;t close together all the way.  </li>
            <li>Your hair will look super shiny &amp; it only takes about 20 minutes or less to make your hair incredibly straight without blowdrying first.</li>
            <li>this product is so simple to use, heats up really fast, the turbo function is really awesome especially at hard to manage areas, and finally the 2 inch blades makes it easier and faster to finish all your hair-</li>
            <li>I felt FREE without all that hair weighing me down.</li>
            <li>It is probably a great flat iron for people who do not have very thick frizzy naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is very curly and it would normally take me around 2 hours to straighten because I would have to blow dry it straight then use a straightener.</li>
            <li>It typically straightens my hair with one pass over each section, and my hair stays straight all day (though my hair is pretty straight as is).</li>
            <li>I would dread waking up every morning to a big poofball on top of my head, knowing it would ruin the quiet, peaceful mornings I crave and turn it into a chaotic scenario where I have to lock myself in the bathroom, straining my neck and frying my hair with my blowdryer and flat iron, while my family stands outside knocking on the door, complaining that I hog the bathroom.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a reasonably priced way to straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair glides smoothly over it, and the coating on the ceramic plates hasn&#x27;t worn off like my previous (non-ceramic) hair straightener.  </li>
            <li>I had my doubts but it is hot instantly, unlike my old curling iron.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, and it only take about 10 minutes tops to have perfectly straight hair!</li>
            <li>: I have to edit this review because it actually IS better than any other $20 flat iron.</li>
            <li>The old one had guides to keep your hair on the hot plates where this one is open to the end</li>
            <li>That flat iron worked pretty well</li>
            <li>But even after using it in the morning, going out all day, going to bed and waking up, it was still just as flat as it was when I first did it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had nothing but frizzy trouble since moving to SW Florida, and my hair refuses to go flat without the use of a good flat iron.</li>
            <li>I needed a 2nd flat iron for a trip, and always liked my other Conair appliances.</li>
            <li>and whenever I have new growth I try to stay away from the salon for a two weeks by straightening my hair but the iron never got close enough to my roots to make it look totally straight</li>
            <li>If you live in a humid area, your hair will not remain straight the entire day....</li>
            <li>I would have liked it to be just a bit less wide.</li>
            <li>I found it hard to get close to my scalp which isn&#x27;t a problem if your hair isn&#x27;t super curly right at the scalp.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone that has a decent amount of hair and it seems like it would work for all hair types with how high you can get the heat.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s short on time and/or patience; and who has tried other straightening products before (such as chemically straightening: this iron gives me better results than chem.</li>
            <li>I am amazed at all the detailed comments on a ceramic hair straightener for a little over $22.</li>
            <li>The first lasted about two years, after that it&#x27;ll take a little longer to heat up and the heat doesn&#x27;t stay as consistent.  </li>
            <li>up quickly and gets the job done in a quarter of the time that it used to take me with other irons.</li>
            <li>This straightener works extremely quickly and extremely well.  </li>
            <li>I straighten my hair, non-chemically, so I typically use more than one flat iron.</li>
            <li>This is the only flat iron that gets my hair super straigth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to totally alter my cut and style to cover up the missing parts of my hair, and had to shell out money on products to repair the damage (dry, incredibly kinky and irreperable hair that time is not repairing [other than it falling out.])&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I still want a new CHI to cut straightening time in half, but anyone that has thinner or less wavy hair is really, really gonna love this because it really will only take minutes for them.</li>
            <li>- so my $100 was a waste (and my HUGE mistake was not keeping reciepts and boxes)</li>
            <li>so I thought I&#x27;d try something not as expensive, especially considering the great reviews.</li>
            <li>Now those of you who you who have ever experienced growing your hair out from a short cut, know that it gets difficult after a while.</li>
            <li>so much I threw it away after I got back.</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>Overall the product is way better than expected, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>And I almost paid $80-$150 for a professional straightener.  </li>
            <li>It heats up fast and you only have to run it through your har one time.</li>
            <li>The screw is already screwed up in my piece (after nearly 3 months of use).</li>
            <li>So, Ok, I have a pony tail and that sucker does straighten it quite well.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>hair gets caught in frequently and  </li>
            <li>My hair will stay straight for several days .</li>
            <li>It actually left my hair very shiny afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I purchased it when I cut my hair short, with every intention of maintaining it straight</li>
            <li>I can have my hair looking awesomely straight within ten minutes, whereas it use to take me twenty to thirty.  </li>
            <li>Like for example today I woke up and my hair was completely curly.</li>
            <li>I know there is a wide price range for straighteners, and I was at a crossroads of getting something more expensive thinking it would be of better quality.  </li>
            <li>but now it feels like the soft, shiny virgin hair of a 6 year old.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money</li>
            <li>but now it&#x27;s like 6 months old</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not often you get a product that really works for such an inexpensive price.</li>
            <li>Professionally it often takes 2-3 hours.</li>
            <li>WOW....</li>
            <li>Works well so far.</li>
            <li>And I have used it on my 12 year old daughter with no complaints from hair pulling.  </li>
            <li>I have a natural wave in my hair.  </li>
            <li>My 14 year old daughter loves this.</li>
            <li>function to get it completely board strait.</li>
            <li>and it just generally wasn&#x27;t as sleek as I normally get it with the Remington.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my daughter who has naturally wavy hair...</li>
            <li>Who knew hair could completely take over a person&#x27;s life?</li>
            <li>My old iron I got as a gift for my 16th birthday (</li>
            <li>but then when I used it I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>She is 11 and her goal is to get her hair as STRAIGHT as possible!!!!  </li>
            <li>Bought as a gift, has worked out well so far</li>
            <li>I never use it and just use my old one still</li>
            <li>Conair makes good straightening irons sometimes, and that&#x27;s what makes me so angry about the quality of this one--</li>
            <li>A lot of people on these reviews are saying that this straightener is just as good as expensive ones.</li>
            <li>I have long, thick, wavy hair that normally presses nicely.</li>
            <li>This straightener feels substantial, but is still easy to use (the metal plates always somehow manage to lay flat against each other, straightening a lot of hair in each stroke), and my hair comes out stick-straight after just one stroke.  </li>
            <li>With other straighteners the hair would slide around and fall off the straighener, but this wasnt a problem here, in fact it made the whole experience much quicker and effortless.  </li>
            <li>i had an expensive flat iron that was great</li>
            <li>So far I really like this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>It took over an hour to get through a first pass of my (completely dry) hair and the results were not satisfactory given the time invested.</li>
            <li>So worth buying this dual voltage flat iron for international travel.</li>
            <li>This flat iron works really well.</li>
            <li>I used this flat iron in Singapore and really serves the dual voltage function well.</li>
            <li>but I am wondering if I even need it, because this one does such a good job on my long, thick, wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I am happy because it replaces a hairdryer for me, and ends up making mymedium-long, fluffy, frizzy, crazy, wavy, thick and course hair smooth and straight, when done right.  </li>
            <li>it took less than five minutes total, and my hair feels smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll have to go over a section of hair multiple times to get a somewhat decent result.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE:  I&#x27;ve now been using this straightener daily for over five years, and it STILL WORKS just the same as when first purchased in 2005.</li>
            <li>The plates became hot in seconds, I used it at the highest setting (my hair is a bit difficult to work with) and when I would go over my hair with my hand to smooth it out, I was getting burned!  </li>
            <li>so i unplugged it and plugged it back in and made sure i turned on both buttons, the turbo and on button which i usually use, and</li>
            <li>Leaves my long hair straight, shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>( not like a big whoa one, but a decent rub your feet on carpet to get someone type of shock.</li>
            <li>I have long, thick, wavy hair with a mind of its own, and this straightener works like a charm.</li>
            <li>It is a little curved and it makes a big difference when you are straightening your hair because for some reason it glides on easily...</li>
            <li>but when I use the flat iron it flattens out &amp; stays that way. &lt;br /&gt;I would suggest this item for anyone who wants straight hair that stays that way all day long.</li>
            <li>Personally, you could purchase seven of these for the price of one of those high cost models  and have one for  every day of the week.  </li>
            <li>Bought this because of the high reviews here on Amazon, but it pulls my hair so I am sending it back.  </li>
            <li>It heats up fast, temprature ranges from low, for fine hair, to the highest tempreture for thick and kinky hair.</li>
            <li>I can say that its ceramic plates do not slide as easily over hair as other more expensive models do.</li>
            <li>If you have thick hair, it&#x27;s a must because it has a special turbo button that makes it extra hot.</li>
            <li>I have long hair, so this really helps.</li>
            <li>I ordered it to take on a trip to Europe and needed one that would work in both US/European plugs and wanted one that was small and light.</li>
            <li>For someone with very curly hair, it takes a long time to straighten.  </li>
            <li>It was my first and only flat iron and it works so well on my curly hair.</li>
            <li>Be careful though, it can get so hot, you can burn yourself.</li>
            <li>Within a few years, it was full of curls and was prone to frizz from rain and humidity.    </li>
            <li>If you have naturally frizzy, wavy hair like me, it could mean spending even more time styling because you dont have the option to just pull your hair back and tie it into a ponytail.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly, and hair glides smoothly past the plates, leaving hair not only straight, but shiny.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and (with the turbo turned on) is hot enough to flatten my thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li>Makes straightening very fast and has proven to last a long time.</li>
            <li>- it is the only kind that works for my very thick hair.</li>
            <li>and I after blow drying my (newly shortened)hair last night I thought \\&quot;hey, I should use that thing\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting fed up with having to buy a new straightener every year and am looking for a different brand to try....</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this flat iron.</li>
            <li>I did not want to pay $50 for a ceramic flat iron, but I wanted the high quality.</li>
            <li>But heats up fast although makes hair a bit dry.</li>
            <li>this straightener keeps it stick straight all day, and i can wake up the next morning, spend 2 minutes on the ends, and have it last 2 days...</li>
            <li>hairstylist said I&#x27;d never have straight hair unless I spent mega $ on a professional straightener.  </li>
            <li>I have bought numerous straighteners to try to make it straight, and this is the only one that has truly worked.  </li>
            <li>I have never ever been able to get my naturally wavy, thin, damaged hair to ever look like this.</li>
            <li>I tried many different straighteners and NONE of them worked as well on my extremely thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li>However, it not only didn&#x27;t do as good a job at straightening, but there was an acrid faint burning odor when in use.</li>
            <li>I have very thick, long hair, and this straightener didn&#x27;t do as well as my regular one does, but for the price it was a good straightener to have for when I travel abroad.</li>
            <li>for all those with naturally curly hair will know what I mean when I say nothing makes it smooth</li>
            <li>The dual voltage feature ensured that the straighter was hot enough to actually straighten my hair on several damp days in Amsterdam.</li>
            <li>It has one major design flaw however, one that makes me regret having bought it.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get much hotter than any other flat iron, and the 2\\&quot; plates don&#x27;t add much to the experience.</li>
            <li>I was BARELY USING (which was $30 VS gold-plated straightener that DOES NOTHING BUT BURNS HAIR!)</li>
            <li>At first it worked extremely well but after about 2 months it started to become slower at heating up.</li>
            <li>and maybe be a little more careful with it!</li>
            <li>When I first got the Conair straightener, I washed my hair in the morning, let it air dry, and then later in the evening, I tried the straightener.  </li>
            <li>and it was very small, so it took forever and took many times over the same spot to see improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have medium to thick slightly wavy hair that has only ever looked good after coming out of the hair salon after a $$$$cut and blow out.  </li>
            <li>An amazing replacement for my broken GHD!</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first because it felt cheep, light and that it would suck.</li>
            <li>Hoping they will not make me pay return shipping for what is clearly, even in basic appearance, unrelated to what I purchased.</li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised when it only took about 15 minutes to finish straightning!</li>
            <li>i was surprised that this straigntened my hair after passing my hair thru it only once.  </li>
            <li>I was looking to replace my old iron that finally died after about 4 years</li>
            <li>I can finally have hair that looks like it was professionally straightened.</li>
            <li>She told me that, to get the same look, I&#x27;d have to go out and buy a professional straightener for about $100.  </li>
            <li>I really like the wide width of this iron.  </li>
            <li>) professional hair straightener and the conair hair straightener gives the same result.</li>
            <li>It takes only minutes to straighten my hair and it is soft and shiny afterward.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve fallen asleep with wet hair, and have woken up to my hair in much disarray.</li>
            <li>It does shut off unexpectedly in the middle of use,&lt;br /&gt;so</li>
            <li>The Conair Instant Heat Flat Iron is the first flat iron I have ever bought.  </li>
            <li>It snags your hair and barely does the trick of straightening it.</li>
            <li>I was kind of skeptical</li>
            <li>cause the plate is really thick and smooth.</li>
            <li>My mom was kind of skeptical when getting this for me, because we got a crappy Conair straightener that didn&#x27;t work at all a couple years ago.</li>
            <li>I wore my hair down yesterday, after \\&quot;straightening\\&quot; it with a big-barrel curling iron, then today after using the Conair straightener-- first thing this morning, my boss said \\&quot;your hair looks so nice!\\&quot; &lt;br</li>
            <li>This item from Conair is cheaply made from plastic (besides the plates), my hair got caught in the plates because there is a small spaces at the edges, resulting in pulling out my hair - Ouch!  </li>
            <li>I will right another review if I find it works differently in a few months.</li>
            <li>and I watched a few tutorials on YouTube to get it right.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really used the other attachment.    </li>
            <li>but really for $20 average price who cares - the old one actually still works too</li>
            <li>When i got old enouhh and had my kwn money to buy a flat iron, i chose this one.</li>
            <li>I blow dry my hair straight with a barrel brush then run this flat iron over it.  </li>
            <li>The plastic feels cheap and the whole thing is clunky and difficult to maneuver.</li>
            <li>I have very think wavy hair and was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t be able to get the job done.</li>
            <li>sometimes (I have really thick, curly, unmanageable hair, keep in mind) and it will straighten the HUGE waves in less than 5 minutes for my whole head.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think there was enough different for anyone else to notice, but 9 people have said \\&quot;wow, your hair looks</li>
            <li>My first Conair Flat iron broke after 6 years due to accidentally dropping it.  </li>
            <li>trust me, its worth the few extra dollars.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how it would work on thick curly hair, but for wavy hair like mine that has a little frizz and mostly needs to be smoothed it was fantastic.</li>
            <li>Because she had previous positive experiences with the conair brand products.</li>
            <li>Can this hot iron be used on wet or dry hair or it makes no difference ?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how long this product will last, but will enjoy the results in the meantime.</li>
            <li>Not hot enough doesn&#x27;t straighten curly or wavy hair very well</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair and have used this flat iron for several years.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also pretty heavy.</li>
            <li>I have purchased 2 of these and my first one stopped heating a few days after i bought it.</li>
            <li>I have used other $40-$50 ones and yes, they work a little better but not much.</li>
            <li>A sweep over with the Conair ceramic flat iron left me with soft, shiny and straight hair in less than 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>I usually have to blow dry forever, use some sort of product to smooth it out and then go over and over and over with a straightening iron or big barrel curling iron.  </li>
            <li>It finally got so loose that it doesn&#x27;t do anything except make my hair hotter, so now I will be buying a new straightener... but probably not this one.</li>
            <li>wow, this is really long!</li>
            <li>wow, this is really long!</li>
            <li>I have major problems with flyaways and this flat iron</li>
            <li>Let it dry completely.</li>
            <li>I let my hair dry naturally and then take the iron to it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only found my hand messing with the dial a few times at first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried just about everything to straighten it (and I don&#x27;t care how good you are with a brush; straightening your hair with a blow dryer is impossible.)</li>
            <li>If they would have shipped what I wanted I would have given a 5 star as I loved the old model with the comb attachment - :(</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve had several of these and know how my hair reacts to different settings this is certainly not user error where the setting was too high.  </li>
            <li>It heats up fast and is wide enough for my long hair.</li>
            <li>The straighter never got hot enough to actually straighten my hair and the converter subsequently killed the straightener leaving me</li>
            <li>My hair not only straightened in HALF the time, but it STAYED straight ALL night.</li>
            <li>and it is straight and since the pads are larger I can do my hair in half the time.  </li>
            <li>the only con that i found is that the cord was not long enough for me</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely short, making it impossible to be too far away from the outlet unless I have an extension cord handy.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair perfectly straight with little hassle.</li>
            <li>Then the other day, I was telling my mom to buy me a new one</li>
            <li>The unit is very flimsy, it actually pulled my hair out while straightening, I think it got wrapped around the little screws or something.</li>

            <li> If you don&#x27;t have a lot of money to spend on a straightener but want great results, this is definately the one to get.</li>
            <li> Either way, its a great straightener for the price.</li>
            <li> It still works great.</li>
            <li> I would never pay $100+ for an iron since this one works so great.</li>
            <li> Price is great the product is great.</li>

            <li> Excellent  100 % positive</li>
            <li> my hair looks amazing.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve always had frizzy hair and the amazing ceramic heated iron</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a great straightener for a cheap price.</li>
            <li> It is amazing.</li>
            <li> anything ever happens to this one, its amazing.</li>
            <li> I thought it was amazing.</li>
            <li> the trasformation is amazing.  </li>
            <li> So I went onto amazon and read all these amazing reviews.</li>
            <li> The price is awesome for such a great quality.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of in shock about how well this works.  </li>
            <li> works really well on my hair though and it looks great!</li>
            <li> Nice and sturdy, and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather a nice slim straightener.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks just as good, and after months of useing this Conair model, my hair is still just as healthy ~ as when I used the one I paid $120.</li>
            <li> Also, when I did put a conditioner on my hair before I did it, it still was kind of fuffy.</li>
            <li> My daughter opened it and was thrilled.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great deal, especially for the price, I am so happy!</li>
            <li> Honestly, I use this to iron collars on my shirts.</li>
            <li> Looks nice too.</li>
            <li> So in conclusion, two women have said this model gives them the best hair straightening they can get, in the salon or out, and it is very durable.</li>
            <li> it really wworked great!</li>
            <li> I honestly cannot believe this costs $20.</li>
            <li> I am going to get another kind.</li>
            <li> I gave it a good try for two weeks to see if I just needed better technique.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you use a good protective serum for shiny, silky results.</li>
            <li> They have their own hair straighteners but they prefer this one.</li>
            <li> This product arrived fast and was in great condition!</li>
            <li> Also you might want to use some kind of shampoo/conditioner designed for heat treated hair or something that puts a lot of moisture into your hair.  </li>
            <li> Nice iron for the price.  </li>
            <li> professionals\\&quot; but, after coming to my senses, I decided to put my faith in fellow reviewers who liked this product.</li>
            <li> The heat settings are nice, though I find myself accidentally turning it up while straightening my hair because of the placement of the dial.</li>
            <li> I liked the size of the iron, as I thought it would speed up my styling time while overseas.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and she liked it.</li>
            <li> so I know what to kind of expect.....</li>
            <li> Although it shuts off automatically, I always make sure it&#x27;s off when I finish using it, but it&#x27;s good to have this feature in case</li>
            <li> I love it.it do a good job on my daughter hair</li>
            <li> Have fun and Good Luck! :</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definately worth your money!!!</li>
            <li> and it worked perfectly the first time, then after that it decided to not straighten any more.</li>
            <li> This product is very good in many ways, it heats up quickly and has an automatic shut-off if you forget to unplug it.</li>
            <li> I chose this one because of the positive reviews on amazon.com, and couldn&#x27;t be more happy with my decision!    </li>
            <li> and we were about to go out, I&#x27;d quickly smooth out my hair with her straightener, and It did an amazing job!</li>
            <li> I feel a lot more confident about myself and more happy with my hair.</li>
            <li> Glad I bought it, it makes my hair so smooth along with the Kertain smooth products, it is awesome.</li>
            <li> Yes...it heats quickly, straightens your hair, and is priced attractively.  </li>
            <li> Works great and heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> The plates do not go all the way out to the edge of the plastic, which causes your hair to snag very easily.</li>
            <li> This hair straightener is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> It gets very hot and it works great.  </li>
            <li> other than that it&#x27;s really great one and excellent bargain for the price.</li>
            <li> Have fun and Good Luck! :)</li>

            <li> I have very fine but frizzy hair.</li>

            <li> arrived on time, heats very fast, great value</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for 3 years now, and it works just as great as it did when I first bought it.  </li>
            <li> first i was happy with it</li>

            <li> it getz extremely hot and does a great job.</li>

            <li> it heats up extremely quick and straightens really good.</li>
            <li> it warm up really quickly!</li>
            <li> It gets hot very fast, has adjustable heat settings, swivel cord is a must have, and it&#x27;s perfect.  </li>
            <li> But its not terrible.</li>
            <li> I gifted it to my wife and she love it.</li>

            <li> many</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so confident you will love this product.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;ok</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re all ok, but</li>
            <li> ot much more than that: it takes me about one hour to somewhat straighten my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works really well without damaging my hair, which was a welcome surprise considering the price.  </li>
            <li> Plus, I have tried so many straighteners and they all don&#x27;t do the job they intend to do.</li>
            <li> Until now, I have struggled with trying to straighten my hair with many straighteners.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I took the chance with this one.  </li>
            <li> I have bought many straighteners before.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> It does a great job of straightening and often my sisters will steal it from me because they like it so much.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I changed my mind.</li>
            <li> better--</li>
            <li> I love the finger rest on the end</li>
            <li> they know better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you can find a better straightener for this price.  </li>
            <li> I love Conair styling products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i love the heat settings (1-20), and i leave mine at about 11, and it does the job for me.</li>
            <li> i also love the safty-grip on the tip of the iron, so you can press the iron together on both sides as you glide it through your hair.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i just might buy one or two more of this straightening iron for my friends &amp; just to keep as a spare.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s big, bulky, but it is brilliant!  </li>
            <li> I cannot recommend this straighter more.</li>
            <li> I love this thing.  </li>
            <li> Having said both pros and cons, I really love it.</li>
            <li> Go spend twice or more on one if you must</li>
            <li> This unit works and most of us agree.</li>
            <li> I love it and have bought it for my family to to use it.</li>
            <li> They love it too.</li>
            <li> The best part is it only took about 15 minutes to do this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to straighten my hair myself --  until now.</li>
            <li> The ceramic straightener did all that and more.  </li>
            <li> It was her favorite Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know that all their hairdressers will give me as rewarding results until I tried this year three of their products, which are CONAIR CHV26IX, CS19JCS and CD 160DRCS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my hair doesnt stay striaght for more then 1 hour after straighting it.</li>
            <li> I have bought so many of these irons and never had any luck.</li>
            <li> Make sure to keep an eye on the lights to ensure it stays on while heating up and while straighting.</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> Off to better brands which do not include anything made by Conair...</li>
            <li> My hair is so curly, i tried so many things to straighten my hair, i came across this ion and i m so amazed.  </li>
            <li> it looks so healthy.</li>
            <li> I get so many comments on it.  </li>
            <li> After reading many reviews i felt that I would take a chance and try this one out.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I was so happy when I bought the conair straightener because it made the work so much easier.</li>
            <li> This product is able to take out the wave I can&#x27;t get out by blow drying with a brush.  </li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> I have tried many straighteners before and nothing does the job like this one.</li>
            <li> I absolutly love it.</li>
            <li> I love it...</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this Hair Straightener.</li>
            <li> This straightener works like magic.</li>
            <li> Works for many hair types.</li>
            <li> but I just found one that is much better.</li>
            <li> The iron heats up fast, which is great, but it dries out my hair, Okay for the price.</li>
            <li> SPend more on a better iron if you use it often.</li>
            <li> I have had this for months and love it</li>
            <li> Takes more time to use this product but seems it is the type out there.</li>
            <li> Wont turn on, its over for sure.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> LOVE this item :)</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it works fabulously!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this iron.</li>
            <li> The Conair Straightener is a must-have for those of you who want beautiful smooth and sleek hair FAST!</li>
            <li> None of the three lasted more then 6 months.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that it shuts itself off after an hour</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> i MADE SURE that they were lit up.</li>
            <li> is still outstanding.  </li>
            <li> My sister shares it with our neices and they love it as well.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because of the many reviews and purchases.</li>
            <li> I have used it on dyed hair and it seems to not cause any more damage.  </li>
            <li> The 60 minute turn-off feature saved me so many times from when i forgot to turn it off.</li>
            <li> Its been working for over a year now :)</li>
            <li> This model is a sleeker version that has been reconstructed seemingly to hold the plates in better.</li>
            <li> and i get so many compliments on my hair.</li>
            <li> It makes it so shiny and smooth!</li>
            <li> I got this awesome product for $20 bucks back in 2011</li>
            <li> I like it much better than my friends&#x27; Sedu or Chi.</li>
            <li> I felt like it gave me more leverage to squeeze the plates together.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great item would recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought it more than a year ago and use it at home and traveling in Europe.</li>
            <li> Straightens my hair well, I just feel like it dries my hair out more than my Chi iron ever did.</li>
            <li> There is also no locking mechanism, which would have given it one more star.  </li>
            <li> It looks sleek, silky, and has a healthy shine.  </li>
            <li> It lets you cover more ground quicker.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Obviously, I can&#x27;t speak to the longevity of the product, but I&#x27;d feel a lot better about needing to replace a $20 straightener vs. a $100+ one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to re-straighten it to make sure it is done correctly.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe I haven&#x27;t reviewed this before as I love it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know anything more about it.</li>
            <li> and I recommend it for everyone! :)</li>
            <li> which is a great plus when you are a mom of five and don&#x27;t have much time to cater to yourself.</li>
            <li> This is the straightest I&#x27;ve ever been able to get my hair.</li>
            <li> For the price, I guess I couldn&#x27;t expect much more than what I got out of this iron.  </li>
            <li> My sister has wavyish hair, and she is able to use this straightener to straighten her hair in about 10 minutes, so</li>
            <li> Heats up fast to a great temperature.</li>
            <li> Be sure to register it online.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s made by Vidal Sassoon, and it came with a blowdryer in this cute purple/silver color combo.</li>
            <li> I have to add, the reviewers also helped me to be more confident in buying this straightener...</li>
            <li> Ok</li>

            <li> If you have been searching for the perfect flat iron, then buy this one.  </li>
            <li> This Conair Flat Iron is awesome.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to hold the flat iron to my hair because the wands have an excellent grip.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is perfect.  </li>
            <li> The flat iron is great!  </li>
            <li> This reliable flat iron worked perfectly overseas.....</li>
            <li> I have very straight hair as it is, but I wanted something that would smooth it out after blow drying, and this does a great job.</li>
            <li> It is so nice to be able to straighten hair much more quickly.</li>
            <li> so much!!&#x3D;)  Very Satisfied</li>
            <li> I now live in WA and even with all the rain it works great for the most part.  </li>
            <li> It is also very comfortable and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> But, even though it has some problems, it still does a pretty good job when you get accustomed to working around its problems.</li>
            <li> I loved this straightener when I first got it.</li>
            <li> It does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good.</li>
            <li> You can use it close to the scalp if need be and the heat unit is pretty good</li>
            <li> Serves me for 2 years already, traveled with me a lot, and never disappointed!</li>
            <li> It works great.. at least for my wife :) you can&#x27;t beat the price, and it works really good!</li>
            <li> Probably best with very long hair that is straighter at the scalp.</li>
            <li> I did the rest kind of quickly since I was just testing it.  </li>
            <li> and I was able to straighten it very quickly.  </li>
            <li> This heats up quickly and has a nice adjustable setting for the temperature.  </li>
            <li> I have been to so many family gatherings and people tell me how gorgeous my hair looks straight</li>
            <li> She was very happy with the hair straightener, light but enough heat to straighten her hair like her one at home.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping, excellent price and thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love touching my hair during the day now to feel how smooth and silky it feels.    </li>
            <li> She even had her own $100 professional straightener that was hardly as good as this one.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d</li>
            <li> This one is just as great as the old one!  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny... and more!</li>
            <li> I used this straightener for the first time with my new Revlon RV484 Ion 1875-Watt Hair Dryer, and I was very impressed with it!  </li>
            <li> Make sure you go for one with the comb attachment, otherwise if you have fine hair like me, it might just slip through.</li>
            <li> and It works just fine :-)</li>
            <li> Overall, very good.</li>
            <li> I have to admit the top of my hair is still a little frizzy, but for the most part it is awesome.</li>
            <li> I got so many compliments on it the very first day!</li>
            <li> I love the huge plates</li>
            <li> And more importantly, I am a guy with not-so-long hair.    </li>
            <li> works great, your hair is soft,, not fried,</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a great straightener, get the Revlon Professional 2&amp;quot;</li>
            <li> i love this straightener and would recommened it to anyone looking for a cheap iron.</li>
            <li> This is the best money I have ever spent.  </li>
            <li> The iron does heat up fast and the shape is good for handling.</li>
            <li> What good is straight hair if you have zillions of flyaways?</li>
            <li> I loved this straightener because it does the job fast, but i would suggest that you not buy it if you would like to save your money.</li>
            <li> It works really well and does a good job straightening my frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> and it does just as good of a job at my $150 straight iron.</li>
            <li> A good thing about this is that it shipped fast.</li>
            <li> I have fairly curly hair and even with hours invested in trying to straighten with this device, my hair did not get fully straight.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use and heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> I have that wonderful, wavy-in-the-back-and-underneath-but-straight-on-top hair (I know, lucky me), and I never even thought about using a straightener on it until a hair stylist did it for me once last year.</li>
            <li> right before I straighten my hair and the combination is amazing.</li>
            <li> :) This product was worth every penny of it!</li>
            <li> Other than that, it works great!</li>
            <li> But I would assume with other hair types this product would be excellent.</li>
            <li> A true bargain!</li>
            <li> Its design is excellent and, unlike some other Conair models, it does not cause cramping in the hands.</li>
            <li> But overall, a good purchase!</li>
            <li> This is so cool!</li>
            <li> Not a bad hair day!</li>
            <li> This is a great straightener for all hair types and great if you have thick hair.</li>
            <li> If you want a good straightener, then buy this one--If you don&#x27;t, go spend more for a professional one--</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is really easy to use...</li>
            <li> dressing has never been as easy.</li>

            <li> I have never used a straightening iron, but it was so easy.</li>
            <li> Heats very quickly with adjustable settings.</li>
            <li> so the hair falls off the plates too easy.</li>
            <li> Makes using it so easy.</li>
            <li> It works so well, and heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li> This is so easy to use to accomplish the straightening of my hair.  </li>

            <li> I liked using it at first.</li>

            <li> although mine which still works perfectly fine</li>
            <li> and it works just fine</li>
            <li> I have fine but unruly hair</li>
            <li> She also used it in Europe, and it was fine.</li>
            <li> Which is fine.</li>
            <li> I love the size of it and it goes really hot and has a turbo mode on top of that.</li>
            <li> They are great to use, and just as good if not better as they have fat paddles compared to my others here in the UK.  </li>
            <li> As a dual voltage product for travel it works fine, but the way it was designed make the plates stick to my hair and pulled some out.</li>
            <li> it is easy to use, it works in Europe and it is really cheap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best straightener I have owned, and I have owned two previously.</li>
            <li> I think this is a fine iron.  </li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and has so many setting levels.  </li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and makes my hair look sleek!  </li>
            <li> I love the color as well and it heats up really quick.</li>
            <li> I honestly think a majority of those positive comments were from people who have wavy--straight hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good, it heats up super quickly, stays very hot and does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li> Wow - It was great, heated up QUICK</li>
            <li> The Heat Ceramic Hair Straightened is quieter and faster also their hair are very straight and they look prettier!!</li>
            <li> Heats up very fast!!</li>
            <li> : 1) 2 minute heat up time 2) 25 temperature settings 3) huge plates 4)</li>
            <li> I am a huge frizz ball once again.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling like straw or looking fuzzy afterwards, which is a huge bonus.  </li>
            <li> The reviews were accurate.</li>
            <li> Very price reasonable and great product.</li>
            <li> in all a great value, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist recommended OPTIONS by framesi WAY SMOOTH stop frizz cream</li>
            <li> and it still worked amazing well and fast.  </li>
            <li> My sisters and I were amazed at the finished job, and I kept brushing my fingers through my hair because I&#x27;ve never felt it so smooth and shiny before.  </li>
            <li> It heats up fast and is effective on my wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> I have tried almost everything, but nothing really worked that nice.</li>
            <li> I also notice that it does not glide smoothly over the hair but sticks, and I suspect again it&#x27;s because of the difficulty in keeping the plates clamped shut.  </li>
            <li> These are fantastic straighteners for the price.</li>
            <li> Well, if you are looking for a cheap straightener-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the expense of a better quality iron to never have this happen again.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;~~I&#x27;d never straightened my hair before, but I found that practice and paitence are important...</li>
            <li> Overall, for the price, it is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> cause has a graduate for the heat, is ceramic and permite precise the temperature</li>
            <li> I had this on the highest setting (25) and it didn&#x27;t get it as straight as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> and I can get it looking smooth and shiny in about 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> smooth n straightens like a pro..great for the m oney</li>
            <li> I think this is a fantastic product, just as the reviews led me to believe.</li>
            <li> It worked like a charm without burning me or my hair and the price was fantastic.</li>
            <li> It does not make the hair shine or smooth.</li>
            <li> straightens my hair so smoothly and silky.</li>
            <li> but this one is smooth, does the job and doesn&#x27;t break the bank.  </li>
            <li> and he said that the heating element had burned up, probably because it was cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I understand now why it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> What do you expect for a cheap straightener???</li>
            <li> it is a great product the cord is too short by a foot or two.</li>
            <li> Best one I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve tried a few.  </li>
            <li> My hair is amazingly shiny and pin straight from using this iron.</li>
            <li> my hair looked-- so shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> I may find it more useful once my hair gets longer again.    </li>
            <li> Fantastic straightener.</li>
            <li> But, just yesterday I plugged it up and the light was on and averything but there was no heat.</li>
            <li> making your hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li> It has been working as described; it is smooth and does not sticks to my hair</li>
            <li> It heat fast like in a minute, works really nice on my hair, I definitly will buy another</li>
            <li> , bc it was so cheap --</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for such a wonderful product Conair that everyone can afford.</li>
            <li> but I definitely recommend it to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money but wants to be happy with the results!</li>
            <li> The plates are smooth and warm the hair very efficiently.</li>
            <li> and this was used with good professional protective product.</li>
            <li> If you are traveling abroad and want to make sure you have the right tools to straighten your hair</li>
            <li> I cannot honestly say if I think it works better than the older model, because I prefer the older model better, sans the issue with the plates.</li>
            <li> Great flat iron!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Good: dual voltage, comfortable grip, long cord, great value</li>
            <li> straightener heats up quickly, and you have the choice of straightening \\&quot;power\\&quot;, so you don&#x27;t have to fry your hair if it is easily straightened.  </li>
            <li> It works pretty good on my hair, although I must say it does not work at the given heat setting (it said for straight hair use setting 10, whereas I got my desired results at 20).</li>
            <li> it was a good purchase and since my hair is long and needed something that could grab more hair.  </li>
            <li> Thankyou very much :)</li>
            <li> Because it is not a very expensive model, the ceramic irons are not sealed around the edges, therefore it is very easy to get your hair caught in it when you are trying to straightening your hair.  </li>
            <li> When I first got it, I was impressed at how hot it got in a very short time.</li>
            <li> Its worth it!</li>
            <li> great results for a long time.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Have been using it for about 2 years, worth every penny!</li>
            <li> then we went to Disney which was soo much fun!  </li>
            <li> your money for the other good things in life, and ignore the CHIs and Sedus and get this instead!</li>
            <li> it is worth the money!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a hair straightener that&#x27;s quick and leaves your hair super silky, pick up the Conair CS19CS!</li>
            <li> It was better than the 50 dollar hot tool I bought before this one.</li>
            <li> It really is worth buying!</li>
            <li> When i first got this product, i was in love with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about durability but for the price this one makes an excellent job.</li>
            <li> i was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Never in my life have i been able to get my hair soooo stick straight!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen better hair straighteners, but usually at a much higher cost</li>
            <li> I made up a little test of my own to see how good it was.</li>
            <li> The version we wanted was no longer available, this unit in comparison is not as good but still better than any other we&#x27;ve found</li>
            <li> I have had 5 different irons and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> , their straightener is much better, it really straightens my hair, and my hair feel so smooth and shining.</li>
            <li> Still loving it and going to buy more for back up..</li>
            <li> It heated up fast and really did a good job.</li>
            <li> My daughter with very curly hair bought this straightener and loved it while it lasted; it worked really well straightening out her curls.</li>
            <li> Which is a good thing sort of, but I really wanted straight hair.</li>
            <li> This is by far the better straightener around!</li>
            <li> It is dual voltage which is perfect and heats up great for my thick, long hair.</li>
            <li> but if i spend $20 every 2 yrs thats fine this product is worth it</li>
            <li> If there are special instructions for use with 220 (as there is with hair dryers)</li>
            <li> Arrived right on time!</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s right!  </li>
            <li> This is one right for me!    </li>
            <li> Well, they were right!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, I think it would work well on any type of hair because it has many different temperatures as well as a turbo function.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to set it very high either :)</li>
            <li> But  really this is a good product, I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> It does not get a good grip onto your hair, hair is still somewhat frizzy after going over hair twice and its very bulky looking and says it gets to 450 degrees on the highest setting which I highly doubt it does.</li>
            <li> Right now, I have held them together by a rubber band (and it works just fine).</li>
            <li> While temporary results are great, if you&#x27;re interested in lasting, repeated performances... try another product.</li>
            <li> really shows off the layers in my hair 8) 2 year warranty.</li>
            <li> As I said, I used it last night and it looked just as good this morning when I got out of bed.</li>
            <li> and I love it so much I decided to write a review.</li>
            <li> its true too.  </li>
            <li> well...nice heat settings...and cool attachments...</li>
            <li> But its really only good if you have wavy hair..  </li>
            <li> Definitely invest in some good hair products to protect your hair.</li>
            <li> I was delighted as I thought I would get what was pictured but did not - they shipped the same \\&quot;new\\&quot; model that I saw in the stores.  </li>
            <li> I love this one so much</li>
            <li> It is a good product and all the information set by amazon was the same when I got received the item</li>
            <li> good ans looks like it will last???</li>
            <li> When my old straightener broke, I thought I was not going to be able to find one just as good as the old one.</li>
            <li> So, I earlier had a Remington straightener which I loved, but as I was travelling to India, I needed a dual voltage straightener which would work there.</li>
            <li> I love how fast it is to heat up though.</li>
            <li> People will say it&#x27;s not as good because the plates are only ceramic plated.</li>
            <li> I have thick course hair and it smooths it perfectly!</li>
            <li> She loved the way this worked, and so did my younger daughter who kept taking it from her to use.  </li>
            <li> my hair for the most part flat/ straight</li>
            <li> I have used my last conair straightener for about 6 years and LOVED it.</li>
            <li> After a while, I just settled with my slightly straight, mostly wavy hair.</li>
            <li> : not enough temperature settings&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good product.</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s not bad, if you don&#x27;t mind having crunchy hair.</li>
            <li> This is a not bad iron.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, love the large plates, so I&#x27;m able to do more of my long hair at a time.  </li>
            <li> It straightens hair beautifully and the comb attachment keeps hair from tangling as you slide it down the length of hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed that the hair can easily slip free of the panels when ironing, which can be a real pill.</li>
            <li> I have previously bought CONAIR Model CS19FCS for my friend in India, who loves it, because CONAIR Model CS19FCS could straighten and shine her Curly, frizzy, unmanageable hair, beautifully.</li>
            <li> It straightens my stubborn, curly hair very quickly, and it gets hot quickly.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly (about a minute) and is pretty easy to use.  </li>
            <li> If I were you, I&#x27;d invest money in a good ceramic flat iron like a CHI or Biosilk.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Thanks AMAZON for the quick delivery.</li>
            <li> ..Heats up quickly &lt;br</li>
            <li> There are various settings you can choose from to accomodate different hair types and best of all it has an auto shut-off!</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and the attached comb helps keep my hair untangled as it goes between the ceramic plates.  </li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and won&#x27;t scorch your hair.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t expect a miracle from just running it over chunks of your hair quickly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for medium to long hair; run it through ONCE and your hair will be bone straight!</li>
            <li> heat quickly on both currents.  </li>
            <li> Dial to control heat level; heats up quickly</li>
            <li> It takes a bit more time than my older one.</li>
            <li> i like this iron tremendously.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly, smooths my hair and removes all the frizz.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, not that great for thick hair like mine.  </li>
            <li> On the plus side, it&#x27;s SUPER CHEAP, and it made my hair super straight and smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ideal for my short hair, but I&#x27;d use it frequently for touch ups when my hair was longer.  </li>
            <li> Does the straightening job quick.  </li>
            <li> It heats quickly yet the exterior surface doesn&#x27;t burn my hand.  </li>
            <li> Quick to heat up</li>
            <li> In about 10 minutes, I had this sleek, smooth, straight hair that looked fantastic,</li>
            <li> This straighter has adjustable heat and heats quickly.  </li>
            <li> Also nice because the iron part is wide. :)</li>
            <li> This straightener with dual voltage was perfect for our recent trip to Ireland--you only need an adaptor to use it.  </li>
            <li> But overall, an excellent purchase for my European travel.</li>
            <li> cause it heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> It glides smoothly over your hair and gets it very straight.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and gets very hot.</li>
            <li> Comfortable grip  4. Gets hot quickly.  </li>
            <li> My hair is frizz free and straight!</li>
            <li> Without the comb attachment, it works as well as the best regular flat irons, but with the comb and used correctly?</li>
            <li> And to think it is pretty cheap too.</li>
            <li> However it does get VERY hot at the highest setting</li>
            <li> This was one of the first straighteners I ever purchased - it worked fabulously but eventually the plates had some brown product build-up from my straightening cream</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been two days since I straightened my hair, and it&#x27;s still smooth and straight, even with the humidity!    </li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this iron, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> But for the most part, I love this flat iron and it still surprises me sometimes at how well it works.  </li>
            <li> Now I can have more modern hairstyles and look more professional at work.  </li>
            <li> But when I did my hair after it totally dried and put nothing on it, the product worked beautifully.</li>
            <li> Nice curve to the handle helps with the use of this flat iron very quick to use and priced right.</li>
            <li> I am SO happy to have this iron and even am thinking of buying another one, just in case this one breaks down the road.  </li>
            <li> even on the most humid days (and I live in hot/humid NC).  </li>
            <li> and youll notice nothing afterward and never again on any new start ups :)</li>
            <li> I bought it about a year and half ago and it still works great.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this product for those who have fussy hair and want to make them straight and shiny.</li>
            <li> I like the adjustable heat settings, but it&#x27;s easy to push the dial by mistake and end up with a much hotter (or cooler) setting than you intended.  </li>
            <li> The pictured flat iron, with comb attachment, is the greatest flat iron EVER.</li>
            <li> Fast and easy</li>
            <li> My hair was so hot when it came out of the plates that it hurt my hands!  </li>
            <li> You have a power on button and a turbo power on button and with that it gets turbo hot!</li>
            <li> Much to my surprise it worked!!</li>
            <li> I am completely untalented with fixing hair, but was able to use the iron on my first try to get fabulous results.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!!!       </li>
            <li> I burned my daughters face when I allowed her freshly straightened hair to fall in her face, the hair was very hot.</li>
            <li> No long waiting for it to warm up...</li>
            <li> And...it&#x27;s pretty, too!</li>
            <li> My hair is very delicate and I could never use straighteners before, but this ceramic one is great!!</li>
            <li> I have VERY thick hair and the size is perfect.</li>
            <li> Very plastic and cheap.</li>
            <li> I bought this 8-9 months back, and its amazing.</li>
            <li> my hair is straight and smooth</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth and straight it was after using this straightener.  </li>
            <li> works great on my medium heavy hair..</li>
            <li> , my bangs curled up on me while her hair remained straight and smooth.</li>
            <li> Totally reommendable for those who want to have good quality for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Worth every cent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny, believe you me.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth trying</li>
            <li> So far I love it and can&#x27;t wait to use it again.</li>
            <li> This is well worth 26 dollars.</li>
            <li> Even though I have longer hair, the straightener is almost too big to effectively straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> Just got this as a birthday present from my daughter, who has been straightening her hair for years and is quite the expert, and I am thrilled with this product.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> so far, i&#x27;ve only used it once, but it was so great</li>
            <li> Its the money worth.</li>
            <li> it was so much fun</li>
            <li> It snagged my hair, the plates were too big for my cut (which can be blamed on my own oversight.)  </li>
            <li> And if you have any kind of texture in your hair, it has to be put on the max settings, and even then your hair will only be a ball of frizz.</li>
            <li> I was able to completely straighten it in a  hour.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price for me.  </li>
            <li> but I think it is well worth it for the results it delivers.</li>
            <li> The older model would break relatively easily if you ever accidentally dropped it.</li>
            <li> It does get hot pretty fast but could be better.</li>
            <li> Worth the money</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not even worth</li>
            <li> Worth the money and has lasted.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so worth</li>
            <li> The heat settings are cool because you can make it as hot as you want depending on your hair type.</li>
            <li> But yes, that&#x27;s my hair success story.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so worth</li>
            <li> The heat settings are cool because you can make it as hot as you want depending on your hair type.</li>
            <li> But yes, that&#x27;s my hair success story.</li>
            <li> Its well worth the price.</li>
            <li> it really  worth .</li>
            <li> This is one of those rare occasions you get a quality product inexpensively.  </li>
            <li> Lastly, for travel it&#x27;s kind of bulky/heavy.</li>
            <li> This little guy gets super hot and is the most effective tool I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best flat iron i&#x27;ve purchased in anywhere near the price range.</li>
            <li> and it is the ONLY flat iron i can find anywhere with the comb attachment on it that really makes a HUGE difference on my tangly curly hair!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used my friends staighteners which were way more expensive and this one does just as good as a job!</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and gets plenty hot.  </li>
            <li> It does not get super hot as I am used to(my</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and does exactly what I want.</li>
            <li> At first I loved it, it worked great on my thick coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I loved it at the first, it straightens my hair, however it doesn&#x27;t give you the shining smoothy look, it makes my hair very dry.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is amazing.</li>
            <li> I used a friend&#x27;s $100+ flat iron and was tempted to buy one of my own.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to get a nice flat iron, but couldn&#x27;t afford the fancy salon ones.  </li>
            <li> It gets very hot, and fast!</li>
            <li> and I opened it right away.</li>
            <li> I saw this one on Amazon, and bought it right away</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s what frizz lotion is for, right?  </li>
            <li> Therefore, as you start to flatten or curl, your hair slides right out of the iron before you can even flatten or curl.  </li>
            <li> I am in Europe right now</li>
            <li> This straightener is just right for my hair type.</li>
            <li> She was right.</li>
            <li> Some people would tell me to switch to a Chi or some other high end brand, but honestly, the $24.99 Conair works better than the $69.99 &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; one.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s overall nice, but does not get as hot as I want</li>
            <li> It plates are nice and wide (2\\&quot;) and it heats up fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> &amp; i was anxious to use it after i read all these great reviews on this site.  </li>
            <li> Ceramice plates in general are better for your hair.  </li>
            <li> I used the crimper and waver and they were pretty useful</li>
            <li> I received the product in time, good service, and I am so happy with the product is excelent to dry the hair wet or dry and is fast and easy.</li>
            <li> this iron glided right through my hair leaving it no only straight but nice and silky too.</li>
            <li> Other then that, this item is simple to use and works very well and heats up wonderfully which saves time.</li>
            <li> Since CONAIR CS19FCS was not available from AMAZON, I chose the next best CONAIR Model CS19VCSR, which is seen in the picture , for her and shipped to India.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> for something better, it&#x27;s worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> It got here super fast</li>
            <li> this one is just as good for half the price.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome and is worth the mere wat.</li>
            <li> (I am super klutzy and was expecting some injuries, haha).  </li>
            <li> but the common impression that my mother and girlfriend have given is that this is the best hair straightener anywhere near this price.     </li>
            <li> heats up fast and is easy to use my teenage daughters who are very picky love this straightener.</li>
            <li> This straightener heats super fast but it does not straighten well at all</li>
            <li> While I love the wider plates, I really miss the old model of this, where it had the comb attached to one of the plates.  </li>
            <li> It was delivered quickly and works really well.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and gets very hot.  </li>
            <li> This iron gets very hot fast.</li>
            <li> otherwise the handle is really too hot which i have to use a glove specially made for hot irons and hot curlers.</li>
            <li> This may be a good hot iron for people with slightly wavy hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is one case where the relatively inexpensive product works great (and maybe even better than the more expensive kinds).</li>
            <li> It even has a TURBO button on it for even faster start up, but Ive never used it as it is already very fast.</li>
            <li> My hair are curly and very very airy-fluffy.</li>
            <li> This item heats up very fast.</li>
            <li> This was bought for my 15 year old granddaughter and she says it&#x27;s just fine.</li>
            <li> I wanted the straightner&#x27;s for my holiday in the states ( visit most years due to family), knew nothing about Conair when I ordered them and have to admit for the price didn&#x27;t think they would be to hot, but what a fantastic surprise.  </li>
            <li> I like how it is slightly curved as well, so I can grab hair closer to my head  more easily.</li>
            <li> and when I use this flat iron my hair comes out looking smooth and shiny and straight!!!</li>
            <li> do think this is a good buy for the money (very inexpensive), but this particular Conair simply won&#x27;t make curly hair STRAIGHT . . .</li>
            <li> Yes, the turbo gets VERY hot very quickly, but I have mixed frizzy, curly hair and the first time I straighten</li>
            <li> Those expensive irons must either be magic or overrated, because this affordable one is amazing!</li>
            <li> Love this iron better than any of my more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> Only takes one stroke no need to go over it more then once.</li>
            <li> I first tried a temperature of 10.</li>
            <li> Decided to give it one more try myself after reading the reviews on this Conair, after all it was only $20.00.  </li>
            <li> Its safer to use a higher setting on your hair once, then go over one spot</li>
            <li> so I took it out for the first time</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I had been searching for.  </li>
            <li> It takes your hair from frizzy to SILKY STRAIGHT!</li>
            <li> so well I had to do the rest or my hair would look funny.  </li>
            <li> About two years ago I got a straightener by Conair almost exactly like this one.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s never failed me.</li>
            <li> I like this product pretty well.</li>
            <li> At  first I was thrown off by the handles because I&#x27;m used to V shaped handles.</li>
            <li> It has temperature control so you can get it really hot if needed.  </li>
            <li> Usually you will get a straightener that does not have the removeable comb or turbo on putton and there are also 25 heat settings, it is simple to use and works great!</li>
            <li> I was unsure at first, because I have purchased many irons prior to this one.</li>
            <li> then, when i get to the top layers, i use the boar-bristle comb, and it adds an extra bit of sheen.&lt;br</li>
            <li> its not difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but, like I said, its big and bulky.</li>
            <li> I would say GO AHEAD to any one who wants to buy this!</li>
            <li> This is the first flat-iron I have ever purchased and</li>
            <li> In 2002, I bought the first hairdresser from CONAIR - hair setter.</li>
            <li> its just the one that i own, but i am not really satisified with this product</li>
            <li> Thanks Iron Bod Studio!  &amp;</li>
            <li> We will be returning to Florida very soon!</li>
            <li> hair is one of my favorite parts of me, and now I am totally floored but the damage done to it by this product.  </li>
            <li> Hey everyone this really does work!</li>
            <li> And im SOOOOO glad i got it before i go  back to school!</li>
            <li> I never thought my hard-to-manage hair could become so straight!</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time today and the verdict is: meh.</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy, course hair, and it doesn&#x27;t work great.</li>
            <li> I set the heat level to 20 (of 25), which is more than hot enough.</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely hot to the touch.  </li>
            <li> It looks sleeker, and my hair kind of curls in when I use, but not completely straight.</li>
            <li> Thats how hot this straightener gets</li>
            <li> It lasted for about 5 months and the plates just stopped getting hot.</li>
            <li> The CS19JCS instant heat is only $20 and works GREAT with silky straight results.</li>
            <li> and I can immediately start using it as it immediately becomes hot.</li>
            <li> When you first buy this and plug it in, it will have a noticeable smell but the smell burns away</li>
            <li> but it is definitely hyped up to be more than it is.</li>
            <li> I love this hair straightener... got it about 2 1/2 years ago and use it almost daily.  </li>
            <li> And it works so fast too!</li>
            <li> I personally think this does a better job than a CHI.</li>
            <li> I made sure I brushed my hair to get out any tangles before straightening.)  </li>
            <li> The first time it didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Also, my hair is naturally pretty frizzy.</li>
            <li> , I highly recommend this item and the price cannot be beat!!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I was amazed.  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had this product for about a year now and it works just as well as it did when I first bought it.  </li>
            <li> Im glad it was only $20.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product highly!!</li>
            <li> I went with the wider model, and like it better than the smaller one I&#x27;ve been using at home.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s weaker, but definitely gives you a more cared look, shiny hair.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Probably won&#x27;t last more than a year, but</li>
            <li> gift for a teen who love it.</li>
            <li> I had mine exactly 3 years when it stopped heating the plates.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it to match the much higher quality Sedu but thought it would be sufficient for travel.</li>
            <li> Since returning home have been looking in UK and sadly not found them here.  </li>
            <li> Works great, even on my incredibly thick hair.  </li>
            <li> also love the fact that it heats up instantly.  </li>
            <li> The product itself does exactly what it&#x27;s designed to do.</li>
            <li> but it looks exactly like the picture....</li>
            <li> First warning sign: this product arrived in a plastic bag.</li>
            <li> Well I was wrong, it worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li> It works efficiently but it sometimes burns my hair because it gets so hot.</li>
            <li> The first time I did it</li>
            <li> Her hair always looked so cute, even one day when we were stuck outside in a thunderstorm</li>
            <li> so thanks guys! &#x3D;</li>
            <li> I would suggest that you start with a lower setting first.</li>
            <li> and I noticed that the thing was not quite as hot.</li>
            <li> Other than that I&#x27;m glad I bought this!</li>
            <li> (fine, wavy, dry/frizzy).&lt;br /&gt;It heats up quickly and you can adjust to different temperatures (from 1 up to 25 - I use 15)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny b/c</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first</li>
            <li> It did not get as hot as it indicated and my hair kept getting caught under the plates.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s more compact than my last one was.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted and needed.</li>
            <li> This worked well - the first time we used it.  </li>
            <li> I find that if I don&#x27;t use the comb, my hair will constantly fall out of the super smooth plates.  </li>
            <li> Conair products are known to work great and last a long time!!</li>
            <li> Conair is good if something goes wrong to just send the appliance back and receive another in its place, and a two year warranty is better than most hair styling electrical tools.  </li>
            <li> Blowdry my hair dry and then use the flat iron to give my hair a beautiful, straight and shiny finish.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this flat iron.</li>
            <li> most flat irons don&#x27;t work we&#x27;ll for my hair type.  </li>
            <li> (I have thick, wavy hair that tends to frizz), and this product is 100 times better (being able to adjust the temp really helps)!</li>
            <li> I REALLY LOVE THIS FLAT IRON,</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve had curling irons and flat irons get fried when I&#x27;m overseas, even with the power converter.</li>
            <li> i love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is Fantastic!</li>
            <li> I have several straightening irons to get the kinks out of my frizz-in-the-humidity hair, and I can attest to the fact that high cost does not necessarily mean a better outcome!  </li>
            <li> It is one of few flat irons which has this capability, and it&#x27;s cheap, making it perfect for international travel.</li>
            <li> And I Im lucky ,because it is dual voltage as I m living in New Zealand 230V .</li>
            <li> Well times and technology have changed and  I must say I LOVE THIS FLAT IRON!  </li>
            <li> It heats up fast and my hair runs through smoothly, leaving it soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> i only spent 22 bucks on this great item and it works like a dream.</li>
            <li> However, Conair has created a great product that simply does what is expected.</li>
            <li> When it comes to beauty products, I have recently learned that when you try to cheap out and cut corners, what you end up with is worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes out all of my curl, and leaves me with soft, smooth, straight hair.  </li>
            <li> I love having straight hair again; my only regret is not getting it sooner!  </li>
            <li> My hair doesnt get stuck anywhere and gets hot pretty fast</li>
            <li> Got really really hot when I first bought it, and over time it lost a lot of heat to the point it didn&#x27;t straighten very well.</li>
            <li> Overall, good for international travel.</li>
            <li> Also it leaves it looking very shiny and healthy especially when I used the Tresemme Thermal Creations spray before.</li>
            <li> I love it so much I have continued to use it since I got back home!</li>
            <li> My first one was 1\\&quot;, and I certainly prefer the 2\\&quot; one.</li>
            <li> It heats up very fast and is ready in no time.</li>
            <li> One thing i did like very much was that it turns on really fast and has an option for &#x27;turbo&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Aside from that, it really does a pretty good job, especially considering the low price.</li>
            <li> previous ones worked better because they got hot quickly</li>
            <li> Light weight, and easy to use!I highly recommend it for very long hair!</li>
            <li> Nice wide plates work on large sections of hair at a time which is perfect for those with long, thick hair like me who don&#x27;t want to spend an hour on their hair.  </li>
            <li> I do not understand all of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I mistakenly purchased this based on the positive reviews here.</li>
            <li> You also cant get to close to your head as it lets out a lot of hot intense heat.</li>
            <li> It straightens my hair pretty fast.</li>
            <li> My old straightener made my hair oily after one day because I constantly had to smooth it over and over again, but with the Conair straightner, I just smooth it over my hair</li>
            <li> This flat iron is fast, and fabulous!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good, yet unexpensive, flat iron and decided to look around the net before having to drive everywhere...</li>
            <li> and I loved how the small combs work with it.</li>
            <li> Also, I have taken relatively good care of it and store it in drawer, but I do admit that I have dropped it a few times!</li>
            <li> I think I am going to jump on the bandwagon and spend the money to get a good solid flat iron.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for people like myself who wants stick straight hair quickly without a lot of hassle.</li>
            <li> My hair is light, easy to manipulate but reacts to any slight change in the weather.      </li>
            <li> This straigtener warms up quickly, works on the first pass and leaves your hair feeling luxuriously soft and straight.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to remove by sliding out but stays in place when put back on, it is also easy to put back on.</li>
            <li> This iron gets my hair silky smooth usually in one swipe, but at most two.</li>
            <li> , my hair is naturally wavy but super easy to straighten and i felt like after just one use of this con-air it almost instantly fried the section of the hair i tried to go over.</li>
            <li> My hair stays straight all day long and it also takes the static out of it.</li>
            <li> I love the wide plates - it speeds up my straightening time and it stays consistently hot - no wait time for rewarming.      </li>
            <li> but I comb my fingers through it real quick and back to normal.</li>
            <li> It worked beautifully on the fine, thin parts of my hair, but on the coarser, thicker parts, it wasn&#x27;t enough.</li>
            <li> I have really long thick hair and a friend told me how ceramic is best for hair straighteners.</li>
            <li> Oh my God ,it is so good, it makes my long hair very smooth, and in the mean time it keeps my hair volume as it is.</li>
            <li> Also something could be heard rattling around inside when the unit is turned in certain ways -</li>
            <li> This product works really well even on my thick and curly hair, I was pleasantly suprised... until this week it BROKE.</li>
            <li> This hair straightener is EXACTLY what I needed: inexpensive, reliable, high enough temp, and easy to use.</li>
            <li> And probably not as hot as other better quality straighteners.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly with adjustable heat, the comb helps hold hair tame when straightening, and the results are fantastic!  </li>
            <li> This is a good little flat iron heats up quickly and can be adjusted.</li>
            <li> The straightener works very good, even with my difficult hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few straighteners out there, and for the price, this little number is AWESOME! &lt;</li>
            <li> This flat iron is easy to use and efficient.</li>
            <li> am so positive, Cousin would love it, as this model is an enhanced model than the previous one.&lt;br /&gt;I , very highly recommend CONAIR Model CS19VCSR and or Model CS19FCS to any one who wants hair to look like Barbie !</li>
            <li> This was just okay -- i&#x27;ve taken it on my trips to Europe and didn&#x27;t love it -- if you&#x27;re used to a high-quality ceramic straightener (Chi, GHD, Sedu brands, etc), this will be tough to get used to.</li>
            <li> and if you are looking at it, i recomend spending a little more money to buy a way better quality one that wil actually work.</li>
            <li> I had previously had a flat iron that did nothing in comparison, and this worked great.  </li>
            <li> The heating element got so hot is actually singed my hair right off!  </li>
            <li> The next morning, I had frizz all over and huge puffy waves.  </li>
            <li> straightener took only minutes to heat up, a huge plus.</li>
            <li> Unless you have HUGE hands, this makes it really difficlut to close and hold shut properly.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast, light weight and even works well when I travel outside of the US.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> Heats up fast, straightens well, and the auto shut off</li>
            <li> managed to make it stick straight, unlike some of the irons I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> : 1) Gave my hair too much volume (but that could just be my hair)</li>
            <li> It really does.</li>
            <li> I loathed it so much, I refused to buy another one by this company.</li>
            <li> And, its very durable.</li>
            <li> It seemed that everyone was in agreement that it worked very well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I expected more than that from Conair.</li>
            <li> I took a nap for 2 hours soon after using it and when I woke up, it was still straight as before.  </li>
            <li> it is just as straight as when I styled it.  </li>
            <li> we&#x27;ll see how well it stays straight.    </li>
            <li> My hair stayed straight all day.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Even though it does seem to take quite a while to heat up, I still recommend this product highly!</li>
            <li> really straightens in no time.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it really works.</li>
            <li> you see, i have frizz-prone hair that sometimes and in someplaces is curly, and then in some is almost straight.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and maintains tempurature throughout useage.</li>
            <li> my hair is very course &amp; very curly.  </li>
            <li> i had shiny straight movie star</li>
            <li> I absolutely am a convert to having the comb attachment.  </li>
            <li> warms up fast, but I have problem with overheating, since I always manage to scroll the heater adjuster up while I am working on my hair...</li>
            <li> and I felt like it was really damaging.  </li>
            <li> Its made my hair look really shiny and took out all the frizz.</li>
            <li> My hair was pin straight when I was done.  </li>
            <li> It really does heat up in 60sec.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> so didn&#x27;t bother me all that much.  </li>
            <li> Fast heating and</li>
            <li> lt;&amp;lt; My hair is really curly still which is really hawt now</li>
            <li> bein curly AND straight</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
            <li> In my opinion, sometimes it&#x27;s well worth it to shell out the extra money for a much much better product that will last you much much longer.</li>
            <li> it stays straight all day, even with snow and rain.    </li>
            <li> It saves me so much time doing my untamed mane compared to a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> This hair straightener works very well.  </li>
            <li> Even after I had worked on it for hours it wouldn&#x27;t be completely straight and any contact with humidity would cause it to frizz up.  </li>
            <li> It made the process much faster.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and helpful tool for smoothing very curly hair.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to try that.  </li>
            <li> But it does work really well.</li>
            <li> so i don&#x27;t straighten much.</li>
            <li> Even when it rains or is really humid</li>
            <li> In 15 mins I have stick straight hair that is shiny and glossier than ever.</li>
            <li> actually haha</li>
            <li> I like this straigtener and all, but it doesn&#x27;t really &amp;quot;straigten&amp;quot; my hair.</li>
            <li> It heats up really fast.</li>
            <li> but it really helped to capture the hair and guide it through the plates.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This product works really  well.</li>
            <li> - my hair was relatively straight, although frizzy.</li>
            <li> and it leaves my hair straight and shinny.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works really well on my daughters hair.</li>
            <li> and it still wouldn&#x27;t really leave it straight</li>
            <li> It heats up fast, too.</li>
            <li> I always had to go over one spot repeatedly in order for it to stay straight</li>
            <li> and whenever I try to protect my hair from the heat my hair would come out looking very stringy.</li>
            <li> but it looks promising.</li>
            <li> It took me only about 6-7 minutes to straighten my hair to be smooth and sleek.  </li>
            <li> so getting it straight isn&#x27;t the problem - getting rid of the frizz</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much fir 20 bucks.</li>
            <li> The adjuster really works for this product (not just decoration) and I haven&#x27;t had the problem of burnt hair</li>
            <li> This heats up fast.  </li>
            <li> They won&#x27;t damage it as much</li>
            <li> I have tried it myself and it really works.</li>
            <li> I had to o over each section twice to get it straight.</li>
            <li> It heats up in under a minute (more like 30 seconds) to the hottest setting and is so wide it takes No time to straighten.</li>
            <li> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR A 5 STAR CUSTOMER SERVICE.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t use a straightener very often</li>
            <li> absolutely will not work.</li>
            <li> I would get a much smoother, and quicker, go of my hair, but with this one I have to use one hand to hold the straightener and another to hold a comb underneath</li>
            <li> it heats up much faster.</li>
            <li> but for the price and the results Ive gotten so far its definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recomend it!</li>
            <li> She is a real tender-head</li>
            <li> Fast heat.</li>
            <li> Straight hair in minutes.</li>
            <li> All I can say that she keeps her hair straight now.</li>
            <li> The iron heats up fast and works very well.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t complain too much about this one.  </li>
            <li> I guess it really just depends on your hair type.</li>
            <li> I bought this one for my wife and she really like it.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> It stays straight when it is humid, and it has these neat combs that attach to it.  </li>
            <li> and it is ready to go.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, this one works really well and heats up really fast.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product DOES however heat up fast</li>
            <li> I have straight hair but want to give it shine</li>
            <li> No matter how tempted you are to get a haircut, you know that would defeat the whole purpose of letting your hair grow out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a trusthworthy friend, and it makes my hair life so much easier.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a trusthworthy friend, and it makes my hair life so much easier.</li>
            <li> One of my dorm neighbors had this very flatiron, and keep in mind this was over 5 years ago.</li>
            <li> Very overrated if you ask me.</li>
            <li> It heats up in a couple of minutes, and does a fantastic job on medium to coarse hair.</li>
            <li> It does heat up really fast though.</li>
            <li> so I really cant rate this product.</li>
            <li> she really loves it</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair and a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> I got the bottom layer of hair straightened without too much problems.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Thanks amazon.</li>
            <li> I would really recommend this straightener.</li>
            <li> I suggest it highly!</li>
            <li> This straightener will won&#x27;t keep your hair straight.</li>
            <li> company was fast and efficient sending it</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> (The styles the hair straightener has made possible also make her appear more mature.)  </li>
            <li> I have naturally CURLY hair, but am blessed enough to be able to get it to straighten with some help.  </li>
            <li> Disregard negative reviews of this straightener - it lives up to its reputation, and is a really good deal.</li>
            <li> The only place the plates completely touch is towards the top of the iron.  </li>
            <li> I found the detachable comb to be more trouble than it was worth.  </li>
            <li> was particularly excited to see how tight of a grip the plates could get around my hair while the smooth ceramic surface prevents snagging and breakage--</li>
            <li> I know the flat iron is the problem because when i pay to have someone else do it, it comes out very smooth, soft, and shiny.</li>
            <li> so you can easily flatten all the hair in a bundle; right now if you have a thicker clump of hair, the other pieces don&#x27;t get flattened.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Basically, this straightener is fine, but it&#x27;s JUST a $20 flat iron, so please expect that.</li>
            <li> I use it for getting my hair to not get tangled easily (which it doesn&#x27;t after using), make it a little neater, and to make it shinier (which it does look after using this!)&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would say this is a good straightener, but the heat is slightly less than what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> It heats quickly and stays hot, and only takes about 15 minutes to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> I have had mine for 5 years and it still gets just as hot and works as well as a new one.</li>
            <li> Looked it up curious how high the heat goes on this thing, and realized my review didn&#x27;t really say anything about why I felt it wasn&#x27;t good enough for me.  </li>
            <li> But it is a nice flat iron, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> My old $10 flat Iron works much better than this cheap Flat Iron.</li>
            <li> This is a FANTASTIC flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many from other brands but none worked with me and gave me salon results as CONAIR</li>
            <li> She loves this one and says it works better than the other one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several different straighteners in the past, but I must say this is the best one I&#x27;ve used to date.  </li>
            <li> My daughters and I have tried several other \\&quot;flat iron\\&quot; straighteners, including other models by Conair, but this is without a doubt THE BEST available.</li>
            <li> Never will i use any other straightener. :)</li>
            <li> Normally, I would be pissed off!</li>
            <li> As I am looking for a new straightener I was surprised to find my current one in the top 5 bestselling.</li>
            <li> I ran the straightener down again and I had shiny straight hair but more volume than I bargained for.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair, which I love to wear straight, after trying to straighten my hair once with another more expensive hair straightener and ending up with a scarecrow mop I gave up and just went to my hairdressers to get it blown out.  </li>
            <li> have thin, fine, almost straight hair, pretty easy to manage, so</li>
            <li> Ok so firstly, about a year ago, I guess I was going through some \\&quot;teenager angst\\&quot; hormonal stage, but I chopped off my long hair to a really boy short cut.</li>
            <li> Heat very quickly and the 2\\&quot; wide iron works very well.</li>
            <li> First of all let me start by saying I have naturally wavy, frizzy out of control hair.</li>
            <li> The true test is to straighten my hair before going out clubbing in Chicago where the clubs are open until 5am and after all that dancing</li>
            <li> I started off with a way to small one, so I&#x27;m loving it</li>
            <li> The only thing that can be a small con is that sometimes I have to hit the power on button 2-3 times to get it to turn on, which is easy to tell because the light comes right on.</li>
            <li> It actually takes more time to cool down (approx 15-20 minutes).</li>
            <li> I like that it has wide plates and it glides right through my hair, makes it super shiny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to say this particular ConAir flat iron makes up for a multitude of past sins, and doesn&#x27;t put a dent in your budget.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s given me a whole new look.&lt;BR</li>
            <li> live in a very humid place</li>
            <li> I bought this because I needed a new iron fast.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t know why I had so much faith in my new straightener, even though I had never used it before....</li>
            <li> however, the conair cs19jcs works much better and for much less money.</li>
            <li> ok so my dad bought me this striaghtner a year and a half ago.</li>
            <li> I like this product and the best thing about it is, it actually generates less heat and create a less damage to my hair</li>
            <li> Also features a \\&quot;power\\&quot; and \\&quot;turbo power\\&quot; button, which I can only assume means \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; is volcano-like hot, which is exactly what it felt like.</li>
            <li> I read alot of reviews about this particular straightener.</li>
            <li> I have an older 1 1/2 inch conair that still works, but I&#x27;ve been using this 2 inch one almost every day since I bought it.  </li>
            <li> I was told you need to spend a lot to get a decent ceramic hair iron.</li>
            <li> My hair burns really quickly, you can see smoke, and it doesn&#x27;t even straighten it enough.</li>
            <li> So  I wrote a review awhile ago when I first bought it but after using it only about three times I realized that yes first it straightens it</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t get caught in my hair, heated up quickly and stayed at a constant temperature, and I didn&#x27;t even burn myself</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t feel particularly sturdy.</li>
            <li> My next test was going out dancing at a club for 5 hours which causes my hair to get super frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I was unsure as to how I would like it since I had an older model.</li>
            <li> I do appreciate the fact that this model doesn&#x27;t grab your hair like the older model.</li>
            <li> Did a decent job of straightening my hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great straightener for thick and/or coarse hair.</li>
            <li> This is still a decent iron.</li>
            <li> I am not a big fan of this straightener (my multiple Remington straighteners are much more efficient for comparable price), however it is my go to when traveling abroad since it has the dual voltage function.</li>
            <li> Left my hair soft, smooth, and shiny.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s older straightener was on</li>
            <li> Barely gets hot, doesn&#x27;t work very well at all.</li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;ll spend the extra $30 for a better quality one.</li>
            <li> but you could definitely get a better one for the same price it took me hours to straighten my hair!</li>
            <li> there are several settings on it too, so you can get it just a little warm to very,very hot by turning the dial to the heat you want.</li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair, dye it, and use this flat iron and my hair seems to be pretty healthy with all I do to</li>
            <li> Plug it in, push button to turn on and when it&#x27;s hot enough the blinking light goes solid.</li>
            <li> These flat irons are horribly on thick hair bewarned perfect Remington flat irons.</li>
            <li> After about a year of owning the product, the clip that clips the scissors-like parts together came loose, and I started having to clamp it together with my free hand in addition to squeezing the handle.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this flat-iron.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast, works fast - no sitting there a long time to get each piece straight, it does it on the first try.</li>
            <li> straightener is highly inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this straightener</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this straightener based on its high reviews and the fact that I&#x27;m a fan of Conair curling irons.</li>
            <li> My hairstyle will stay all day even in high humidity (provided I have an umbrella).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Later that week, I picked up a proper UK ceramic/tourmaline iron for less than 20 GBP at Boots that worked great during my time there.</li>
            <li> I had brought it for a cousin in India, and probably due to the diff in voltage out there, I didnt find it as good as I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> Multiple heat settings - this baby gets HOT!  </li>
            <li> This is the second conair hair product (the other one is for making curls) and I have been very satisfied with both of them so far.</li>
            <li> Wow!!</li>
            <li> In all honesty, if I were to buy something for travel again, i might think about investing in something better for time&#x27;s sake, and for the sake of my hair, as this seemed to fry it a little.</li>
            <li> I liked that it held my hair as it straightened, but it was too hard to get my hair into the straightener with it on.</li>
            <li> I am looking to buy one for my neice for Christmas, and perhaps get myself a new one, just for the new features!</li>
            <li> So far I have had the straightener for about two weeks, it heats up fast, to a high heat if needed.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally straight, but I have some broken hair that likes to fly out in different directions.  </li>
            <li> Purchased for my very picky 15 year old daughter and she loves it.</li>
            <li> is marked thanks</li>
            <li> be careful to watch for the light.</li>
            <li> You can now see what my hair really looks like: shiny and soft with layers.</li>
            <li> It took no time at all to heat up, it gets super hot and HOLY COW</li>
            <li> She used the first one so much that it simply wore out!</li>
            <li> and she has never complained.     </li>
            <li> I may buy a few more of these just in case</li>
            <li> I used it a few times and it did the job okay for the price</li>
            <li> But hey, if you want to waste your money feel free to buy the conair!</li>
            <li> Normally I use a HAI with the highest heat setting, so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Not only was it fun to wash in the shower, but I didn&#x27;t dread having to sit for hours every weekend having my mom help me straighten my hair or go to the salon everytime</li>
            <li> Believe that if I finally found my miracle product that allows my hair to be the way I want without a bunch of stress, it&#x27;s worth a shot for anyone.</li>
            <li> Believe that if I finally found my miracle product that allows my hair to be the way I want without a bunch of stress, it&#x27;s worth a shot for anyone.</li>
            <li> that you turn based on what kind of hair you have, and for me with shoulder or just below shoulder length thick hair</li>
            <li> I found this product very user friendly, i was able to straighten all my hair in matter of a few minutes, results were instanteous...!!!!</li>
            <li> Blew me away!nyone that has thinner or less wavy hair is really, really gonna love this because it really will only take minutes for them.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this item though if you were in the market of looking for an affordable flat iron that gave you the same quality straightening power of a hot tools, now it doesn&#x27;t get that hot, but it&#x27;s pretty darn close.</li>
            <li> This straightener really does work as well as the $90 one I had before and much better than other irons with similar price tags that I have tried.</li>
            <li> but right after it poofs out again and its not just my hair its definitely the straightener.</li>
            <li> Lets just say i took it right back.</li>
            <li> But it seems to tame it, even in the most humid conditions, and that is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I would usually wash my hair and throw it back in a ponytail, and styling my own hair became the norm for me only for special occasions- until now.    </li>
            <li> it straightened my thick hair perfectly in just a few seconds, and i only had to iron each section of my hair once to get it stick straight.</li>
            <li> While I really really wish that Conair would go back to the built in combs, I am able to straighten my hair quicker than the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Rarely it frizzes, usually leaving my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> But then I tried ConAir&#x27;s new ceramic straightener.</li>
            <li> and it works just like new.</li>
            <li> Time for a new brand of straightening iron.</li>
            <li> I never used them until a new hairdresser persuaded me to try it again</li>
            <li> my hair is curly because I live in Florida.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a new straightener, keep looking.</li>
            <li> and I decided to try something new.</li>
            <li> I live in Vegas</li>
            <li> Im from New York</li>
            <li> Now I have to buy a new straightener</li>
            <li> They certainly don&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> I live in Argentina and it didn&#x27;t work here.</li>
            <li> If you have thin short hair, you might not need something this large and powerful, but for us thick wavy hair girls, it is AWESOME.</li>
            <li> All in all, this is probably fine for the average person</li>
            <li> I bought a lighter more expensive one, and I would say that this one still does a better job, though I like have a smaller one for me in particular.</li>
            <li> I love how it has big plates and how it heats up in 60 sec.</li>
            <li> I love the 2 inch plates, it makes straightening thick hair go much faster.</li>
            <li> I went out and bought my own a few weeks later.</li>
            <li> Again with a metal iron it would take 15 minutes to heat up and would consistently cool down making the whole straightening process take an hour.  </li>
            <li> flat iron does the job right</li>
            <li> It makes my hair very soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Very sensitive to plugs in.</li>
            <li> The design has a long skinny handle and a much fatter plate head and is heavy and much longer than most straighteners.  </li>
            <li> I was very surprised at how well this product worked for me.</li>
            <li> and it only takes me about 20 minutes to get my hair very straight.</li>
            <li> i have super wavy and thick hair, and with one stroke, my hair was flat, shiny, and smooth!</li>
            <li> This thing is large, bulky, and pulls my hair if I&#x27;m not very careful.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s a 2 inch flat iron, it actually gives me huge and bouncy waves.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it possible, but I have pin straight hair!</li>
            <li> It gets extra hot.</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> I have used Conair appliances before that I was disappointed in, but this one impressed me with its performance.  </li>
            <li> How hot does it have to get to actually singe hair off?!  </li>
            <li> I have it set too (1-25), turbo on or off, it gets hot enough to damage my hair and even burn some off.  </li>
            <li> even if it&#x27;s this cheap, it&#x27;s not worth it</li>
            <li> I looked in all my local stores and could not find the exact replacement</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Doesnt get hot enough...</li>
            <li> Not to hot, just enough heat to press her hair and make manageable.</li>
            <li> This one&#x27;s cheap and not worth it.</li>
            <li> But when I used it I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> Ceramic Straightener Model RV045C. Does the EXACT SAME job as the conair, but lasts for years.&amp;#60;br /&amp;#62; &amp;#60;br /&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> At first I figured, eh my hair will frizz up again when I go outside (lived in WI where it&#x27;s humid).  </li>
            <li> It gets hot enough without the turbo.</li>
            <li> just didn&#x27;t get hot enough to fully straighten it out.</li>
            <li> The model I bought is almost exactly like this one, only there isn&#x27;t a turbo feature.</li>
            <li> Does not get hot enough.</li>
            <li> Did not become hot enough to do the job.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I tried it!</li>
            <li> However it gets plenty hot enough to do the job.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough and the plates don&#x27;t close together all the way.  </li>
            <li> Your hair will look super shiny &amp; it only takes about 20 minutes or less to make your hair incredibly straight without blowdrying first.</li>
            <li> this product is so simple to use, heats up really fast, the turbo function is really awesome especially at hard to manage areas, and finally the 2 inch blades makes it easier and faster to finish all your hair-</li>
            <li> I felt FREE without all that hair weighing me down.</li>
            <li> It is probably a great flat iron for people who do not have very thick frizzy naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is very curly and it would normally take me around 2 hours to straighten because I would have to blow dry it straight then use a straightener.</li>
            <li> It typically straightens my hair with one pass over each section, and my hair stays straight all day (though my hair is pretty straight as is).</li>
            <li> I would dread waking up every morning to a big poofball on top of my head, knowing it would ruin the quiet, peaceful mornings I crave and turn it into a chaotic scenario where I have to lock myself in the bathroom, straining my neck and frying my hair with my blowdryer and flat iron, while my family stands outside knocking on the door, complaining that I hog the bathroom.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a reasonably priced way to straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair glides smoothly over it, and the coating on the ceramic plates hasn&#x27;t worn off like my previous (non-ceramic) hair straightener.  </li>
            <li> I had my doubts but it is hot instantly, unlike my old curling iron.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, and it only take about 10 minutes tops to have perfectly straight hair!</li>
            <li> : I have to edit this review because it actually IS better than any other $20 flat iron.</li>
            <li> The old one had guides to keep your hair on the hot plates where this one is open to the end</li>
            <li> That flat iron worked pretty well</li>
            <li> But even after using it in the morning, going out all day, going to bed and waking up, it was still just as flat as it was when I first did it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had nothing but frizzy trouble since moving to SW Florida, and my hair refuses to go flat without the use of a good flat iron.</li>
            <li> I needed a 2nd flat iron for a trip, and always liked my other Conair appliances.</li>
            <li> and whenever I have new growth I try to stay away from the salon for a two weeks by straightening my hair but the iron never got close enough to my roots to make it look totally straight</li>
            <li> If you live in a humid area, your hair will not remain straight the entire day....</li>
            <li> I would have liked it to be just a bit less wide.</li>
            <li> I found it hard to get close to my scalp which isn&#x27;t a problem if your hair isn&#x27;t super curly right at the scalp.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone that has a decent amount of hair and it seems like it would work for all hair types with how high you can get the heat.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s short on time and/or patience; and who has tried other straightening products before (such as chemically straightening: this iron gives me better results than chem.</li>
            <li> I am amazed at all the detailed comments on a ceramic hair straightener for a little over $22.</li>
            <li> The first lasted about two years, after that it&#x27;ll take a little longer to heat up and the heat doesn&#x27;t stay as consistent.  </li>
            <li> up quickly and gets the job done in a quarter of the time that it used to take me with other irons.</li>
            <li> This straightener works extremely quickly and extremely well.  </li>
            <li> I straighten my hair, non-chemically, so I typically use more than one flat iron.</li>
            <li> This is the only flat iron that gets my hair super straigth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to totally alter my cut and style to cover up the missing parts of my hair, and had to shell out money on products to repair the damage (dry, incredibly kinky and irreperable hair that time is not repairing [other than it falling out.])&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still want a new CHI to cut straightening time in half, but anyone that has thinner or less wavy hair is really, really gonna love this because it really will only take minutes for them.</li>
            <li> - so my $100 was a waste (and my HUGE mistake was not keeping reciepts and boxes)</li>
            <li> so I thought I&#x27;d try something not as expensive, especially considering the great reviews.</li>
            <li> Now those of you who you who have ever experienced growing your hair out from a short cut, know that it gets difficult after a while.</li>
            <li> so much I threw it away after I got back.</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> Overall the product is way better than expected, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> And I almost paid $80-$150 for a professional straightener.  </li>
            <li> It heats up fast and you only have to run it through your har one time.</li>
            <li> The screw is already screwed up in my piece (after nearly 3 months of use).</li>
            <li> So, Ok, I have a pony tail and that sucker does straighten it quite well.</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> hair gets caught in frequently and  </li>
            <li> My hair will stay straight for several days .</li>
            <li> It actually left my hair very shiny afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I purchased it when I cut my hair short, with every intention of maintaining it straight</li>
            <li> I can have my hair looking awesomely straight within ten minutes, whereas it use to take me twenty to thirty.  </li>
            <li> Like for example today I woke up and my hair was completely curly.</li>
            <li> I know there is a wide price range for straighteners, and I was at a crossroads of getting something more expensive thinking it would be of better quality.  </li>
            <li> but now it feels like the soft, shiny virgin hair of a 6 year old.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money</li>
            <li> but now it&#x27;s like 6 months old</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not often you get a product that really works for such an inexpensive price.</li>
            <li> Professionally it often takes 2-3 hours.</li>
            <li> WOW....</li>
            <li> Works well so far.</li>
            <li> And I have used it on my 12 year old daughter with no complaints from hair pulling.  </li>
            <li> I have a natural wave in my hair.  </li>
            <li> My 14 year old daughter loves this.</li>
            <li> function to get it completely board strait.</li>
            <li> and it just generally wasn&#x27;t as sleek as I normally get it with the Remington.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter who has naturally wavy hair...</li>
            <li> Who knew hair could completely take over a person&#x27;s life?</li>
            <li> My old iron I got as a gift for my 16th birthday (</li>
            <li> but then when I used it I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> She is 11 and her goal is to get her hair as STRAIGHT as possible!!!!  </li>
            <li> Bought as a gift, has worked out well so far</li>
            <li> I never use it and just use my old one still</li>
            <li> Conair makes good straightening irons sometimes, and that&#x27;s what makes me so angry about the quality of this one--</li>
            <li> A lot of people on these reviews are saying that this straightener is just as good as expensive ones.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy hair that normally presses nicely.</li>
            <li> This straightener feels substantial, but is still easy to use (the metal plates always somehow manage to lay flat against each other, straightening a lot of hair in each stroke), and my hair comes out stick-straight after just one stroke.  </li>
            <li> With other straighteners the hair would slide around and fall off the straighener, but this wasnt a problem here, in fact it made the whole experience much quicker and effortless.  </li>
            <li> i had an expensive flat iron that was great</li>
            <li> So far I really like this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> It took over an hour to get through a first pass of my (completely dry) hair and the results were not satisfactory given the time invested.</li>
            <li> So worth buying this dual voltage flat iron for international travel.</li>
            <li> This flat iron works really well.</li>
            <li> I used this flat iron in Singapore and really serves the dual voltage function well.</li>
            <li> but I am wondering if I even need it, because this one does such a good job on my long, thick, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I am happy because it replaces a hairdryer for me, and ends up making mymedium-long, fluffy, frizzy, crazy, wavy, thick and course hair smooth and straight, when done right.  </li>
            <li> it took less than five minutes total, and my hair feels smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll have to go over a section of hair multiple times to get a somewhat decent result.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE:  I&#x27;ve now been using this straightener daily for over five years, and it STILL WORKS just the same as when first purchased in 2005.</li>
            <li> The plates became hot in seconds, I used it at the highest setting (my hair is a bit difficult to work with) and when I would go over my hair with my hand to smooth it out, I was getting burned!  </li>
            <li> so i unplugged it and plugged it back in and made sure i turned on both buttons, the turbo and on button which i usually use, and</li>
            <li> Leaves my long hair straight, shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> ( not like a big whoa one, but a decent rub your feet on carpet to get someone type of shock.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy hair with a mind of its own, and this straightener works like a charm.</li>
            <li> It is a little curved and it makes a big difference when you are straightening your hair because for some reason it glides on easily...</li>
            <li> but when I use the flat iron it flattens out &amp; stays that way. &lt;br /&gt;I would suggest this item for anyone who wants straight hair that stays that way all day long.</li>
            <li> Personally, you could purchase seven of these for the price of one of those high cost models  and have one for  every day of the week.  </li>
            <li> Bought this because of the high reviews here on Amazon, but it pulls my hair so I am sending it back.  </li>
            <li> It heats up fast, temprature ranges from low, for fine hair, to the highest tempreture for thick and kinky hair.</li>
            <li> I can say that its ceramic plates do not slide as easily over hair as other more expensive models do.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair, it&#x27;s a must because it has a special turbo button that makes it extra hot.</li>
            <li> I have long hair, so this really helps.</li>
            <li> I ordered it to take on a trip to Europe and needed one that would work in both US/European plugs and wanted one that was small and light.</li>
            <li> For someone with very curly hair, it takes a long time to straighten.  </li>
            <li> It was my first and only flat iron and it works so well on my curly hair.</li>
            <li> Be careful though, it can get so hot, you can burn yourself.</li>
            <li> Within a few years, it was full of curls and was prone to frizz from rain and humidity.    </li>
            <li> If you have naturally frizzy, wavy hair like me, it could mean spending even more time styling because you dont have the option to just pull your hair back and tie it into a ponytail.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly, and hair glides smoothly past the plates, leaving hair not only straight, but shiny.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and (with the turbo turned on) is hot enough to flatten my thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Makes straightening very fast and has proven to last a long time.</li>
            <li> - it is the only kind that works for my very thick hair.</li>
            <li> and I after blow drying my (newly shortened)hair last night I thought \\&quot;hey, I should use that thing\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting fed up with having to buy a new straightener every year and am looking for a different brand to try....</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I did not want to pay $50 for a ceramic flat iron, but I wanted the high quality.</li>
            <li> But heats up fast although makes hair a bit dry.</li>
            <li> this straightener keeps it stick straight all day, and i can wake up the next morning, spend 2 minutes on the ends, and have it last 2 days...</li>
            <li> hairstylist said I&#x27;d never have straight hair unless I spent mega $ on a professional straightener.  </li>
            <li> I have bought numerous straighteners to try to make it straight, and this is the only one that has truly worked.  </li>
            <li> I have never ever been able to get my naturally wavy, thin, damaged hair to ever look like this.</li>
            <li> I tried many different straighteners and NONE of them worked as well on my extremely thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> However, it not only didn&#x27;t do as good a job at straightening, but there was an acrid faint burning odor when in use.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, long hair, and this straightener didn&#x27;t do as well as my regular one does, but for the price it was a good straightener to have for when I travel abroad.</li>
            <li> for all those with naturally curly hair will know what I mean when I say nothing makes it smooth</li>
            <li> The dual voltage feature ensured that the straighter was hot enough to actually straighten my hair on several damp days in Amsterdam.</li>
            <li> It has one major design flaw however, one that makes me regret having bought it.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get much hotter than any other flat iron, and the 2\\&quot; plates don&#x27;t add much to the experience.</li>
            <li> I was BARELY USING (which was $30 VS gold-plated straightener that DOES NOTHING BUT BURNS HAIR!)</li>
            <li> At first it worked extremely well but after about 2 months it started to become slower at heating up.</li>
            <li> and maybe be a little more careful with it!</li>
            <li> When I first got the Conair straightener, I washed my hair in the morning, let it air dry, and then later in the evening, I tried the straightener.  </li>
            <li> and it was very small, so it took forever and took many times over the same spot to see improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have medium to thick slightly wavy hair that has only ever looked good after coming out of the hair salon after a $$$$cut and blow out.  </li>
            <li> An amazing replacement for my broken GHD!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because it felt cheep, light and that it would suck.</li>
            <li> Hoping they will not make me pay return shipping for what is clearly, even in basic appearance, unrelated to what I purchased.</li>
            <li> and I was pleasantly surprised when it only took about 15 minutes to finish straightning!</li>
            <li> i was surprised that this straigntened my hair after passing my hair thru it only once.  </li>
            <li> I was looking to replace my old iron that finally died after about 4 years</li>
            <li> I can finally have hair that looks like it was professionally straightened.</li>
            <li> She told me that, to get the same look, I&#x27;d have to go out and buy a professional straightener for about $100.  </li>
            <li> I really like the wide width of this iron.  </li>
            <li> ) professional hair straightener and the conair hair straightener gives the same result.</li>
            <li> It takes only minutes to straighten my hair and it is soft and shiny afterward.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve fallen asleep with wet hair, and have woken up to my hair in much disarray.</li>
            <li> It does shut off unexpectedly in the middle of use,&lt;br /&gt;so</li>
            <li> The Conair Instant Heat Flat Iron is the first flat iron I have ever bought.  </li>
            <li> It snags your hair and barely does the trick of straightening it.</li>
            <li> I was kind of skeptical</li>
            <li> cause the plate is really thick and smooth.</li>
            <li> My mom was kind of skeptical when getting this for me, because we got a crappy Conair straightener that didn&#x27;t work at all a couple years ago.</li>
            <li> I wore my hair down yesterday, after \\&quot;straightening\\&quot; it with a big-barrel curling iron, then today after using the Conair straightener-- first thing this morning, my boss said \\&quot;your hair looks so nice!\\&quot; &lt;br</li>
            <li> This item from Conair is cheaply made from plastic (besides the plates), my hair got caught in the plates because there is a small spaces at the edges, resulting in pulling out my hair - Ouch!  </li>
            <li> I will right another review if I find it works differently in a few months.</li>
            <li> and I watched a few tutorials on YouTube to get it right.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really used the other attachment.    </li>
            <li> but really for $20 average price who cares - the old one actually still works too</li>
            <li> When i got old enouhh and had my kwn money to buy a flat iron, i chose this one.</li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair straight with a barrel brush then run this flat iron over it.  </li>
            <li> The plastic feels cheap and the whole thing is clunky and difficult to maneuver.</li>
            <li> I have very think wavy hair and was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t be able to get the job done.</li>
            <li> sometimes (I have really thick, curly, unmanageable hair, keep in mind) and it will straighten the HUGE waves in less than 5 minutes for my whole head.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think there was enough different for anyone else to notice, but 9 people have said \\&quot;wow, your hair looks</li>
            <li> My first Conair Flat iron broke after 6 years due to accidentally dropping it.  </li>
            <li> trust me, its worth the few extra dollars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it would work on thick curly hair, but for wavy hair like mine that has a little frizz and mostly needs to be smoothed it was fantastic.</li>
            <li> Because she had previous positive experiences with the conair brand products.</li>
            <li> Can this hot iron be used on wet or dry hair or it makes no difference ?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long this product will last, but will enjoy the results in the meantime.</li>
            <li> Not hot enough doesn&#x27;t straighten curly or wavy hair very well</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair and have used this flat iron for several years.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also pretty heavy.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 2 of these and my first one stopped heating a few days after i bought it.</li>
            <li> I have used other $40-$50 ones and yes, they work a little better but not much.</li>
            <li> A sweep over with the Conair ceramic flat iron left me with soft, shiny and straight hair in less than 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> I usually have to blow dry forever, use some sort of product to smooth it out and then go over and over and over with a straightening iron or big barrel curling iron.  </li>
            <li> It finally got so loose that it doesn&#x27;t do anything except make my hair hotter, so now I will be buying a new straightener... but probably not this one.</li>
            <li> wow, this is really long!</li>
            <li> wow, this is really long!</li>
            <li> I have major problems with flyaways and this flat iron</li>
            <li> Let it dry completely.</li>
            <li> I let my hair dry naturally and then take the iron to it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only found my hand messing with the dial a few times at first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about everything to straighten it (and I don&#x27;t care how good you are with a brush; straightening your hair with a blow dryer is impossible.)</li>
            <li> If they would have shipped what I wanted I would have given a 5 star as I loved the old model with the comb attachment - :(</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve had several of these and know how my hair reacts to different settings this is certainly not user error where the setting was too high.  </li>
            <li> It heats up fast and is wide enough for my long hair.</li>
            <li> The straighter never got hot enough to actually straighten my hair and the converter subsequently killed the straightener leaving me</li>
            <li> My hair not only straightened in HALF the time, but it STAYED straight ALL night.</li>
            <li> and it is straight and since the pads are larger I can do my hair in half the time.  </li>
            <li> the only con that i found is that the cord was not long enough for me</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely short, making it impossible to be too far away from the outlet unless I have an extension cord handy.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair perfectly straight with little hassle.</li>
            <li> Then the other day, I was telling my mom to buy me a new one</li>
            <li> The unit is very flimsy, it actually pulled my hair out while straightening, I think it got wrapped around the little screws or something.</li>
            <li> I mean it doesnt work like PERFECTLY but its not that bad either.</li>
            <li> Now I have to get a new one, this iron is not worth the stress of replacing it every 3 months.</li>
            <li> The 2\\&quot; plates allow you to put a decent amount a hair through and the little plastic teeth help to keep them in place (not to mention you aren&#x27;t constantly brushing your hair!)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting a new straightener only because I need one that works wet and dry, although I&#x27;ll continue to use this one if it&#x27;s needed.</li>
            <li> ConAir&#x27;s last flat iron was a big fat lemon.</li>
            <li> This Conair Flat Iron 2\\&quot; Ceramic  Straightener  is much better than the expensive brands.</li>
            <li> But even if it was a little bit humid or rainy outside, my hair would curl back up into it&#x27;s normal self.</li>
            <li> My old one died after 5 years, so I tried researching other brands.  </li>
            <li> It heats fast and actually works, especially compared to non-ceramic straighteners I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a big flat iron....</li>
            <li> I wanted a simple, easy-to-use flat iron without having to spend over $100.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several Conair flat irons over the years.  </li>
            <li> I initially searched for flat iron with comb attachment  </li>
            <li> I finally decided to get a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several flat irons from retail outlets (just to have a back-up) and there is no comparison to the Conair.</li>
            <li> This flat iron works so well especially for the cost.fessional at work.  </li>
            <li> This flat iron works so well especially for the cost.</li>
            <li> i have to go over my hair with the flat iron several times and still will not get straightened.</li>
            <li> Conair Instant Heat Dual Voltage Flat Iron 2&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> used a standard U.S. flat iron with a converter and it blew their iron out.</li>
            <li> recently cut my hair a lot shorter &amp; am grateful I have this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> The price is right, but since I have a comparison with a more expensive product (I spent $70 on a straightener in the past)</li>
            <li> I love that it is so wide and that I can get a lot of my very thick hair in the straightener at once so straightening my hair doesn&#x27;t take very long.  </li>
            <li> are surprised when I tell them I don&#x27;t use any special products or a ridiculously expensive iron!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a big flat iron that is durable, this is it!</li>
            <li> i was slightly reluctant to buy this straightener after reading several bad reviews, along with some great ones, too.</li>
            <li> Until now, I recently bought this Conair ceramic heater and was amazed and shocked to see that it so easily straightened my hair and it remained straight.</li>
            <li> , the only thing is that the electricity cord is not so long, it is short.</li>
            <li> It works just as good if not better than the rediculously expensive one the lady that cuts my hair has.  </li>
            <li> Most straighteners are really small and would take all day to do thick hair.</li>
            <li> Pretty hard to use it without having your hair pulled out</li>
            <li> Also, when you heat it up the handle gets hot as well so its hard to hold.</li>
            <li> The second conair straightener i bought heated well for the first few months, but then started shutting down while i was in the middle of straightening my hair.</li>
            <li> (the real test will come this weekend when I flat iron a head full of very long, thick hair), but one complaint I do have is the length of the cord.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had conair straighteners in the past, but this one REALLY works...</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair that is past my shoulders</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron because I needed the dual voltage for a trip.</li>
            <li> You can find the video on YouTube by searching curling hair with a 2 inch flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this flat iron for about 6 years now.</li>
            <li> But I got this flat iron for my birthday</li>
            <li> Forgot my flat iron on vacation.</li>
            <li> So, Two weeks of vacation without a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> so I needed a Dual Voltage Flat Iron</li>
            <li> I have had this straightener for as long as I can remember, and it finally just blew out a couple of days ago.  </li>
            <li> i tried to flat iron my hair lots of times before</li>
            <li> Ceramic flat irons are the way to go.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron from Fred&#x27;s for around twenty bucks.</li>
            <li> As of now I&#x27;m using the Remington Wet-to-Straight flat iron.</li>
            <li> No matter how you angle the flat iron, it still finds a way to pull you hair out.  </li>
            <li> We bought this flat iron because it is dual voltage</li>
            <li> The problem is  that the hinge of the flat iron is close to where you pull your hair through the flat iron.  </li>
            <li> This causes it to catch and then break hair as you are trying to pull your hair flat.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for the Conair flat iron with the comb attachment as is shown in the picture - DO NOT PURCHASE it here.  </li>
            <li> &quot; I&#x27;ve looked into the the Andis Ceremic flat iron</li>
            <li> and she bought this Conair flat iron in a store..  </li>
            <li> My hair stayed flat all night.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest using a hair product you apply before using the flat iron, just to help protect your hair.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Conair flat irons for years.</li>
            <li> i do not recommend this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Conair Flat Iron for 7 years.  </li>
            <li> This flat iron does the job.  </li>
            <li> This Flat Iron Is Everything</li>
            <li> But as soon as I put my ceramic flat iron to it</li>
            <li> I dont know how long it will last</li>
            <li> but sometimes when you buy things like this and you start flat ironing your hair</li>
            <li> you feel your hair getting pull, this is one of the flat irons that would do that</li>
            <li> It heats up in no time flat.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for over five years now</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this model will last as long, but I think it will.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron to replace one that I had for years but broke.</li>
            <li> Ordered the Conair Flat Iron 2\\&quot; Ceramic Straightener - Dual Voltage.&lt;br /&gt;Because it was SUPPOSED to have an attachable comb with it...</li>
            <li> I did not like this flat iron at all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long it will last, but at this price we could buy another one.</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener because I have misplaced my normal one.</li>
            <li> A little bit frizzy still, but nothing I can&#x27;t live with for a 20 dollar straightener.</li>
            <li> The fifteen year old girl to whom I gave the Conair straightener has hair that reaches her lower back, and it curls tightly.  </li>
            <li> To do all of my hair would take 30-45 minutes, which was pretty typical of my previous straighteners</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually surprised by the reviewers that said that their product broke down in one or two months.  </li>
            <li> The pad is large enough that it doesn&#x27;t take forever for thick haired people.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the purpose of the 25 heat settings is though; I think low, medium, and high would suffice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this flat iron for over a year now, and it still works like a charm!  </li>
            <li> Make my hair look flat!</li>
            <li> Extra long cord and 2 year warranty!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few weeks now and can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> My previous Conair straightener died after nearly 10 yrs.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times since I got it, and thus far, it seems to do the trick</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the more expensive smaller models and they are not worth it.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your 50 bucks on those salon professional ceramic flat irons.</li>
            <li> i have bought other straightener that were more expensive that did not work as well</li>
            <li> , I used it for the first time one day before school and it took me only 10 minutes, and I have THICK hair!</li>
            <li> The other drawback of this is that it feels so cheap: the plastic handles feel as if they  will break if you press down too hard --</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant because I come from the old days of burnt hair from curling and crimping irons.</li>
            <li> and I found it hard to get my hair as straight as I like.</li>
            <li> , at least for the weekends (I have naturally very curly hair.)  </li>
            <li> I have to pass the wand over each segment at least 3 times to make it straight.  </li>
            <li> With other flat irons my hair falls out of the plates and I have to go over the same spot over and over again.  </li>
            <li> I gave it to my daughter and she has long hair and doesn&#x27;t like it either.</li>
            <li> No abnormally long cord &lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish there was a smaller version of this iron, like a 1/2 to 1 inch wide plate.</li>
            <li> If you have long, wavey and/or unmanageable hair, pick up one of these today.</li>
            <li> Now remains to be seen how long it lasts...</li>
            <li> It takes me about 45 minutes to do my long hair.  </li>
            <li> you had to push it open and hold it closed with your hands which was a pain ..</li>
            <li> I would have rather spent the 60 bucks and got one that would have had a warranty and would last longer.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t take a long time to use.  </li>
            <li> Its made out of the cheapest plastic and takes twice as long to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take long to heat up, but it does take a while to straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li> &quot; I needed a dual voltage iron to do my hair for a long stay in the UK.</li>
            <li> It never felt feminine and I missed the feeling of long hair.</li>
            <li> 2 hours before I had to go there to some sort of strange mullet afro.</li>
            <li> It takes soo long to do my hair.</li>
            <li> Con air has come a long way.</li>
            <li> With this straighter it doesn&#x27;t take as long to finish my hair</li>
            <li> I bought same brand , but with the wet setting from target long time ago, but they dont stock it anymore.</li>
            <li> i have curly thick long hair and it takes alot to get my hair straight.</li>
            <li> I had long thick semi-straight hair &amp; when I ordered this item I didn&#x27;t believe it would really work as well as everyone said.  </li>
            <li> Had to return this unit, I dont feel like it worked very well on my thick hair.</li>
            <li> It only takes 5-10 minutes to turn my unruly shoulder-length hair into a sleek mane half-way down my back.</li>
            <li> I have tried other conair straighteners in the past and even though it did the job it left it frizzy, even  the older model that uses steam.</li>
            <li> My review is this: if you&#x27;ve ever owned a really nice flat iron, you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have very thick and long wavy hair, and this made it stick straight after only going through it once.</li>
            <li> From the way the other review were written, I assumed it worked like a miracle for only 22$.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t review other brands because this was the second iron I ever bought (even then it was a bargain probably $29.99)</li>
            <li> OFF buttons allow you to have it plugged in (unlike some other ones where you have to un-plug the entire unit in order to shut it off)&lt;BR&gt;2.  </li>
            <li> One problem that I always have is that it is not hot enough.  </li>
            <li> I have alot of friends that have spent over $100 on a salon quality flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Get something a little more expensive and durable</li>
            <li> Also, when the straightener does heat, it is not nearly hot enough.</li>
            <li> Several other girls</li>
            <li> All of that being said, I didn&#x27;t feel like I had to worry about ruining this straightener due to differences in electricity/voltage from one country to the next</li>
            <li> Since I have very long hair, it works well for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Conair products a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I bought one for around 18 dollars, and was SO shocked that it worked dramatically better than a 150 dollar model i hade purchased a year earlier.</li>
            <li> it didnt dry out my hair at all or leave the ends of the hair looking like &#x27;what the heck happened there&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> I have also noticed that when I do wash my hair and dry it, it drys straighter too.</li>
            <li> Even now after I wash my hair it looks damaged and dry.  </li>
            <li> To make it work, with hair like mine, you have to start with completely dry, combed hair, put a heat protectant gel on, and then section off hair with clips and get to work, a layer at a time.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your $$ on anything more expensive, this is all you need, trust me.</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t waste your money on a more expensive one.</li>
            <li> It is just an average product and the straightened hair does not last long.</li>
            <li> I should note,  however, that my hair is thin and relatively straight with a slight natural wave.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel the plates heat up as much as they should, and the teeth on the detachable comb are too widely spaced for thick or curly hair.  </li>
            <li> it can be heated up to, I was concerned about this b/c I have coarse thick hair that is naturally wavy.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t do a single swipe of the iron without it snagging some of the hair in the border around the heated iron section.</li>
            <li> because I didn&#x27;t buy it off of their site any limited warranty was void.</li>
            <li> This one does not have one single speck of product anywhere on the plates.  </li>
            <li> It heats up and the straightening time is cut down by almost a half from what my old straightener used to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other ConAir flat irons, but this one is the easiest to use.  </li>
            <li> even at very low heat it can make my hair dead straight and doesn&#x27;t damage my delicate hair.</li>
            <li> My husband bought the 1\\&quot; Conair for me a few years ago and it worked pretty well, but I think my hair was too thick and long to use it anymore.  </li>
            <li> My other friend has very thin and fine hair.</li>
            <li> I actually had to turn it down to 15</li>
            <li> I finally sat down and straightened my frizzy, curly hair beginning to end.</li>
            <li> The only down side is that this iron is a bulky-sized for handling and traveling.  </li>
            <li> my only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t open wide enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now on the hunt for a new one that lasts at least a year...</li>
            <li> If your hair is truly dry and combed, in 10 minutes you will be transformed!</li>
            <li> My hair is very curly and it usually takes me at least three passes to get the curl out, but with this one it was basically completely straight on one long, slow pass.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d only had it for less than a year</li>
            <li> And like the previous reviewers mentioned, the cord is a bit too short.  </li>
            <li> Totally agree w/ the previous comments written for this product.  </li>
            <li> It also makes my hair look very dry, it does not make it look &amp;#34;sleek and shiny&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always taken me this long with other straighteners.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, Conair has come a long way since the crappy days of that other hair straightener (you may have seen it</li>
            <li> Only complaint is the size and that is only because I have very long hair.</li>
            <li> Plus, because of my hair, it was left a little frizzy, but I think using a product before straightening can fix this.</li>
            <li> I was a little dissapointed about the plastic look of the product when i took it out of the box, but the second i try it...</li>
            <li> This little gem has been over to europe several times without issue.</li>
            <li> it let it sit for a little bit and plug it back in.</li>
            <li> I have relatively thick and long asian hair and this flat iron</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and has a little wave to it, I&#x27;ve tried everything to rid myself of frizzies and to make it straight.  </li>
            <li> Amazing product-- I&#x27;ve tried using straighteners before, and it either took forever, or they were too difficult to use on my hair (which is very thick).  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this product and bought two of them here to stock up - then I read the bad reviews that the picture was deceptive and what was shipped</li>
            <li> The light would turn on, but the plates would stay cold, so I think it has something to do with the wiring.</li>
            <li> but that expensive one from Sally&#x27;s went straight to the trash because it simply stopped heating up</li>
            <li> But the product will likely work well on tresses that are merely wavy or already on the straight side.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not really a protective coating on the plates either.</li>
            <li> I went out and spent about eighty bucks for a HAI straighter instead.</li>
            <li> I like the way it straightens my hair, but after maybe a year it either gets stuck when it&#x27;s closed</li>
            <li> You see that the photo shows a \\&quot;scissor\\&quot; style straightener, with the hinge in the center.</li>
            <li> this straightener was money well spent.</li>
            <li> But it is fairly heavy and too big for my medium length hair.  </li>
            <li> One thing though, I would not recommend using this straighter on your hair while your hair is even a bit wet or  damp.</li>
            <li> Heats up in only a few minutes and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Wide surface area allows you to get alot done w/ minimal repetition.</li>
            <li> Now about 2 years later it is dead.</li>
            <li> /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, after 2 1/2 years of use, it&#x27;s now getting stuck in the closed position when I use it.  </li>
            <li> and it has a wide range of heat settings to accomodate anyone.</li>
            <li> Yeah, if my hair gets too wet from the rain then it does frizz up, but that happens after a shower too.  </li>
            <li> Cannot use on wet hair.</li>
            <li> They cannot believe what I tell them I have spent on mine from Wal-Mart.  </li>
            <li> Money well spent.</li>
            <li> The scissor like handles just opened up too wide and could not work well with it.</li>
            <li> After only a few months, it stopped working altogether so have to return it to the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> Some people think they have to rush it through their hair then wonder why it&#x27;s not straight.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick with a natural wave and tons of frizz.    </li>
            <li> I love to use it because it saves time without being annoying like some products with extra features.</li>
            <li> She said it is a little difficult to use the handle or something, but it does the job and was priced right and had dual voltage that she needed in her travels outside USA</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone with hard to straighten hair!</li>
            <li> just rub on a little heat-protectant serum before using this and my hair stays flat and shiny for a day or two...</li>
            <li> I used it about 5 times or less and had a long 6month streak of braiding my hair.</li>
            <li> This flat iron works well in straightening out the uneven waves caused by sleeping with wet hair.</li>
            <li> Cord is too limited and is hard to flat iron long hair.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s different: The thing that sold me on this is that I straightened my hair 2 days ago, have slept on it, have had it blown around by the wind, have had it in hot AND cold weather (it&#x27;s crazy in IL right now), and it still looks the SAME.</li>
            <li> I straightened half of HALF of my hair, and that alone took ten minutes.</li>
            <li> The end result leaves my hair looking a bit like straw, whereas my older expensive straightener always left my hair looking (and feeling) silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Combine the weight with the over-long, unbalanced design and it is impossible to grasp and maneuver easily without having to use two hands...</li>
            <li> I used it for less than two weeks and noticed my hair was extremely dry</li>
            <li> Worked in foreign hotels and on the cruise ship.</li>
            <li> with other straightening irons, i had to pass it thru over 5 times before i even began to see parts of it start to straighten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I stuck it in a drawer after two uses and ordered the other model.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent 100&#x27;s on hair straightener&#x27;s, and yes I bought the one over $100!  </li>
            <li> I think it works as well as any other straightener.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it stopped working after the first use.</li>
            <li> Now I dont have to hold a comb with one hand and iron with the other...</li>
            <li> Usually I try to use products such as Aussie and things in it.  </li>
            <li> I still prefer it over my other straighteners....</li>
            <li> You know how with the other straighteners you have to do one strand of hair like 20 times?</li>
            <li> Please, I implore you, go out and get a CHI or other high-end straightener if you have a lot of hair like me.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine using any other straightener.  </li>
            <li> Be careful if you do!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a while now but reading the other reviews made me wonder about mine</li>
            <li> I have tried other straighteners</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these straighteners for my daughter for Christmas, after reading the favorable reviews from other customers.  </li>
            <li> IT works but not as well as other straightners i&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> but my hair is extremely curly at the roots.</li>
            <li> Having said all this, there are other Conairs on the market suited well to curls.</li>
            <li> other straighteners I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li> With other straighteners, I have had problems with product buildup on the plates, affecting the heat distribution.  </li>
            <li> Now I can focus on other things too.</li>
            <li> Now I can focus on other things too.</li>
            <li> then other straighters I&#x27;ve owed.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is the handles--they are unusually large and awkward.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m South Asian with very thick, coarse, curly hair and this iron</li>
            <li> It did take me a very long time to straighten my hair (40 minutes), but if you&#x27;re just relaxing watching TV anyway, not a huge deal.</li>
            <li> My hair after 1- 1 and 1/2 hours still remains with great frizz, poof, and it looks really bad if you have semi-straight hair with noticeable curls in random places..  </li>
            <li> My results from blow-drying with many expensive straightening serums or creams were never totally great, and my hair was still a bit frizzy.  </li>
            <li> However the handle is quite awkward and it didn&#x27;t seem to get very hot.</li>
            <li> I bought this iron for a trip overseas since my usual flat iron (Remington Wet2Straight) isn&#x27;t dual voltage</li>
            <li> I hate the thin flat irons cause my hair is thick but with this one it is way much easier :)</li>
            <li> I wish they would make a small version of 1\\&quot; or less for my short nape hair that was this efficient!</li>
            <li> But it was very weak, does not heat up properly, no indicator like the other one to tell you it reached the desired temperature and of course no wet setting.  </li>
            <li> I have thin hair by the way, and last Christmas, my aunt gave me a Wigo flat iron.  </li>
            <li> For those who haven&#x27;t used this item and are intimidated (it feels awkward) about the comb/brush attachments, or just can&#x27;t see any purpose in it, the comb, when on the downside while ironing the hair, combs it straight down for the heat of the flat iron to do its job</li>
            <li> I recommend it, especially for hard to straighten hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too big, and its hard to get your hair in it.</li>
            <li> This is a terribly cheap and painful product.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s always been really difficult to find an iron that works well and doesn&#x27;t damage my hair too much.  </li>
            <li> And I staighten my hair on average twice a week</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the automatic shut off...</li>
            <li> but I found that this iron was heavy and difficult to use during hot weather.</li>
            <li> I have REALLY THICK HAIR that I got permed (BIG MISTAKE).</li>
            <li> I have tried smaller plates, but they just don&#x27;t work with my thick hair.</li>
            <li> This is the only straightener I have found that works on my THICK hair.</li>
            <li> I have thin naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> Would not recommend for daily use, or for use on thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is extra thick too.  </li>
            <li> If you have coarse or thick hair I would look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> You just have to remember to go slow enough that the hair gets heated.</li>
            <li> I have black asian hair medium thickness, and should not be hard to glide down while it irons them.</li>
            <li> Maybe my hands are too small, maybe I&#x27;m not strong enough, maybe it&#x27;s just me...but look at the design of this product and all the others pictures on Amazon</li>
            <li> I have 4a-4b hair, really thick and kinky, and though I don&#x27;t typically straighten my hair often, I wanted to try something different.</li>
            <li> and I have seriously thick, coarse hair - previous irons I had</li>
            <li> I was shipped a \\&quot;tongs\\&quot; style straightener with the hinge down at one end.</li>
            <li> one to grasp the handle and another to hold down the plates.  </li>
            <li> so you could manually press down on the plates.</li>
            <li> Also when Im dragging it down my hair</li>
            <li> I cant go all the way down without it ripping my hair out.</li>
            <li> When I was a child it came down in ringlets.</li>
            <li> Even if I have to buy one again down the road.</li>
            <li> Does so well i have hair that takes a hour to strighten cut my time down to 15 minutes</li>
            <li> No what I expected !!</li>
            <li> have it break while in my suitcase or accidentally get fried while trying to plug it into the adapter and foreign outlets!  </li>
            <li> Having short hair doesn&#x27;t neccesarily mean easier styling.</li>
            <li> The only thing that can really control my frizzy thick curly hair was going to the salon, but that is way too expensive to go everyday...</li>
            <li> straightening and is much less damaging.)</li>
            <li> I have been using it for half a year now</li>
            <li> The Amazon price is about $5 bucks less then Walmart&#x27;s price where I got mine and</li>
            <li> It heated up in less than 60 seconds</li>
            <li> It tames the frizz in my slightly wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> Previously when traveling abroad, I used a straightener (made for U.S. plugs) and a converter to power it.</li>
            <li> I have never had any problems with my two previous straighteners</li>
            <li> and it takes me less then a half hour now to straighten it all.  </li>
            <li> She used it for less than two weeks before it quit heating up</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was a sudden death due voltage surge or a slow death due to few days of 50hz freq..</li>
            <li> so I would suggest that anyone looking to invest in a straightener should look for one that&#x27;s less \\&quot;clunky.\\</li>
            <li> It works just as well as her previous iron, but it is half the price.  </li>
            <li> It heated up in less than 30 seconds, and it held up through 3 years of a lot of travel and abuse.</li>
            <li> and it takes less than 5 minutes to do my hair.</li>
            <li> Now, it took me less than 10 minutes every morning just straightening my bangs</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s done, so my hair is less damanged</li>
            <li> one, so my hair is less damanged</li>
            <li> I am black with relaxed hair and before my visit to the hairdresser, people were amazed that my hair looked</li>
            <li> But now using this flat iron no more!  </li>
            <li> I usually do not style my hair after washing because I am very impatient and hate perspiring from running the hot blow-dryer.  </li>
            <li> It gets extremely hot, which in my opinion, is half the battle with straightening hair (especially thick hair with some wave).</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that for less than a third of the price, this Conair flat iron could work as well, but my wallet</li>
            <li> This one isn&#x27;t as small as I expected and it didn&#x27;t work as well as my home unit (Sedu brand).</li>
            <li> bought for 13 yo - didn&#x27;t heat up to full temperature and frustrated her (not what you want in the morning) ,  returned for refund.</li>
            <li> It was a complete waste of my time waiting for it to be delivered only to be unhappy with its performance.</li>
            <li> I have thick, long hair with a wave in it.</li>
            <li> I did a few stands on one side with the infinity and a few strands on the other with the one rated here and</li>
            <li> I have thick, long, wavy hair that gets frizzy in the Florida humidity, and</li>
            <li> I have always had long, thick wavy hair that&#x27;s prone to frizz.</li>
            <li> It cost a little less then straighteners that do not work as well.</li>
            <li> I have thick, long, wavy hair and with this straightener I&#x27;m done in 15 minutes!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad, they were super portable.</li>
            <li> It took me only about 20 minutes to do hers, and its just as thick as mine, if not more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried HAI, but because I have thick hair, it took forever because it only straightened small sections at a time.</li>
            <li> The waves disappeared immediately but the hair was still a little puffy.</li>
            <li> Gone are the little frizzies and flyaways.</li>
            <li> There is a little booklet that tells you what to put the setting on based on your hair type.  </li>
            <li> It came with a little comb that you insert on the side of the plate, which I LOOOOVED.</li>
            <li> Once I get a little bit of hair in it</li>
            <li> There was no original packaging.  </li>
            <li> If you use hair protector spray, the edges of the heated part may get a little brown, but you can wipe it off.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve this thin delicate hair,i used the least temperature setting on it,and my hair has been straight n shinier since 5 days!</li>
            <li> Again due to my small hands.</li>
            <li> Little technologically, makeup, hair challenged me did it, so anyone could do it.</li>
            <li> Oh yeah, it also comes with a little detachable comb that untangles your hair as you straighten it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Oh yeah, it also comes with a little detachable comb that untangles your hair as you straighten it.       </li>
            <li> I feel like my gaur is a little brittle after using it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my little sister when she went off to college</li>
            <li> I wish the plates had a little give</li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse hair</li>
            <li> I have crazy curly hair and this iron REALLY WORKS.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightener for a few months now and when I close the hinge mechanism and run it through my hair</li>
            <li> I washed my hair, waited until it dried into a frizzy puff, then put in braids and slept on it.</li>
            <li> I have dropped it a few times (ooops) and its still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;ll take a few uses to get used to it.</li>
            <li> Also, I have had trouble with my hair getting caught in some of the grooves.</li>
            <li> My hair did not have that dead</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this on an everyday basis, though</li>
            <li> In fact, I pulled out quite a few hairs trying to use it</li>
            <li> for a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few years now.</li>
            <li> But it went kaput after few days using in 220-250V range with 50Hz freq.</li>
            <li> stars because I guess it would have worked for few years in 110V</li>
            <li> I prefer not to use it everyday because it can be damaging.</li>
            <li> So if you want trouble buy this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on one of these.</li>
            <li> Hated the curly bottoms of my hair, now I need a couple of minutes to get the hair I love before leaving for work or party.</li>
            <li> I purchased it in August of 2013 and use it everyday.</li>
            <li> All that time straightening my hair was a waste.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on anything else.</li>
            <li> My time and Christmas has been wasted.  </li>
            <li> I bought the chi a few years ago and it stopped working.so i bought this</li>
            <li> The only thing that is frustrating is that after a few passes, the iron cools, and it needs to reheat itself to achieve optimal straightening.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about purchasing this iron at first because I purchased a ConAir iron when flat irons first came out (when you had to put water in the steamer part) and it was horrible.</li>
            <li> (ran that bad boy right through).</li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly, in less than a minute!</li>
            <li> And it heats up in less than 5 minutes!</li>
            <li> Works in less then 30 seconds!</li>
            <li> These were not hot in the least...</li>
            <li> Not great if you regularly flat iron your hair.</li>
            <li> This Flat Iron is poorly made.</li>
            <li> 2) couldn&#x27;t tame all the frizz 3)</li>
            <li> If it can tame my hair, it can  help anyone.  </li>
            <li> I also have another expensive flat iron (by solano) and this one works extremely well in comparison.</li>
            <li> Even with this in mind I was still skeptical because I have this same brand but in a smaller size about 1\\&quot; width and it worked alright but not great.  </li>
            <li> I have very difficult to manage hair but this straightener really helps to keep it under control.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s quite tough to straighten hair of medium length, especially around ear, because the plate size is too thick.</li>
            <li> Super annoying.</li>
            <li> All my old  make my hair thin , and I get annoyed.</li>
            <li> This little gadget does the trick!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that bad for me, but it doesn&#x27;t fully get the job done, and that&#x27;s largely in part because of my hair type.</li>
            <li> but during this time of year i get very very little frizz.</li>
            <li> I actually had borrowed this straightener from a friend before deciding to buy it and it works just as well, if not better, than a $80 straightener another friend of mine owns!!!</li>
            <li> However, it quit working after a few years, and there went my hard earned money.  </li>
            <li> would have saved me a whole lot of bad hair days.  </li>
            <li> I wash my hair as usual and apply a product from \\&quot;Bed Head\\&quot; to protect my hair from the heat of the blow dryer and the iron.  </li>
            <li> not one of those small skinny ones.</li>
            <li> Over the past two years I&#x27;ve used it 2-4 times a week</li>
            <li> i heard that wit scissor straighteners ur hair usually gets caught in the mechanics...</li>
            <li> Not sure if this one comes with a comb or not.</li>
            <li> Straightening your hair with this thing is torture and a waste of time!  </li>
            <li> My hair is usually curly</li>
            <li> and i usually braid my hair</li>
            <li> and this works just as well as they do, if not better.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell how it works on difficult hair (I&#x27;ll ask my friends and update this if possible).</li>
            <li> Im not sure why or how, but i thought that it was just  a defect in that one straightener.</li>
            <li> I have small hands.</li>
            <li> If you have small hands buy one that has a tong style to it.</li>
            <li> Since I had used Conair appliances in the past, I decided to try this one.</li>
            <li> I like this, but I do not love this.</li>
            <li> have very small hands and scrawny little arms</li>
            <li> I have almost straight hair, but I was sick of it</li>
            <li> and I think it would rank right up there with those expensive flat irons.  </li>
            <li> The flat iron has a flawed design.</li>
            <li> If I tucked my hair behind my ear there would almost immediately be a sharp bend that I&#x27;d have to iron out again.</li>
            <li> The only thing I HATE, but the problem would have been the same with any brand I would&#x27;ve purchased, is that it is a scissor-style straightener.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick, has medium courseness, and usually dries slightly wavy.</li>
            <li> This product worked for me for roughly 5 months, but never ideal.  </li>
            <li> They are subbing a worthless flat iron without a comb attachment... same as you could pick up at any CVS or Target for $17.</li>
            <li> The curved handle makes it hard to use.</li>
            <li> The one con I have is that it is a bit hard to handle and bulky.  </li>
            <li> --it&#x27;s curved and makes it hard to turn under the ends.</li>
            <li> This product is cumbersone and hard to use.  </li>
            <li> My hairdresser says my hair strands are thin, but I have a LOT of them, which makes for very thick fluffy hair, even when I use a round brush...</li>
            <li> It is also heavy and awkward compared to the CS25 model, harder to manuever to the root of your hair and easier to burn yourself.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is somewhat awkward to hold and also the</li>
            <li> Even at the max heat setting, always on turbo, it takes at least three hours to straighten my hair and even then it is still curly.</li>
            <li> It heats up the fastest and takes the least time.  </li>
            <li> I was so desperate - this iron was my last resort.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit bulky and clumsy to handle.  </li>
            <li> I had to use the turbo button each time to straighten my thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> (I have thick hair that is shoulder length).</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> cuz&#x27; I have really thick uncontrollable hair.</li>
            <li> She brought it home for me to use because I have thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> With my thick hair, I find the ceramic plates on this model get \\&quot;caught\\&quot;</li>
            <li> have thick, wavy, hard-to-straighten hair... which also tends to get frizzy when it&#x27;s humid..</li>
            <li> I have thick and wavy hair</li>
            <li> I just bought this straightener tonight (12-18-04), and I have thick hair</li>
            <li> One of my friends has thick course hair (she is Chineese).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have thick, curly hair and use the highest setting</li>
            <li> and I have thick frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well on thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair don&#x27;t purchase this iron.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair and it does close to nothing.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, course, and wavy/curly.</li>
            <li> I bought a Conair straightener about 6 years ago, and only used it once because it never got hot and failed miserably at straightening my hair.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because I have used other ceramic irons that cost $100, $150 and up</li>
            <li> I mean it snagged, ripped, broke and burned my hair</li>
            <li> I plan on getting one for my sister for her birthday in a few months!!</li>
            <li> Heats up fast, glides through your hair like a dream, and the result is impossibly shiny, stick-straight hair! &lt;</li>
            <li> Seriously my hair always feels like straw, hay,</li>
            <li> The price is unbeatable, seriously.</li>
            <li> The price is unbeatable, seriously.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and hard to straighten</li>
            <li> Bummed at such bad craftsmanship.</li>
            <li> This product is just not good at all.</li>
            <li> ehh not a good idea.</li>
            <li> and I found that running my fingers over my hair as I straightened it was not really a good idea.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time on expensive straigteners - this is the one you need.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some bad experiences with flat irons and vowed never to buy another...</li>
            <li> There is a setting but the first time I used this I burnt my hair BAD!!!</li>
            <li> It was too weak for my stubborn hair.</li>
            <li> For those of us with thick curly hair this is a must have!  </li>
            <li> , i couldn&#x27;t believe it got a single bad review.</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly frizzy hair</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> - you might want to keep it at a lower level unless you have very thick, unruly hair.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of very thick, wavy/curly hair.  </li>
            <li> and I do mean CUUUUUUUURLY!</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this straightner to anyone with thin hair</li>
            <li> The pros stop here however as the cons are the fact that it is poorly made because there is a gap in the ceramic plate and frame, where hair gets snagged as you pull it through and the hair just literally breaks off.</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> Horrible!&lt;br /&gt;After months of trying to recondition my poor hair that didn&#x27;t have to be cut off</li>
            <li> Not happy with it</li>
            <li> a piece of plastic is broken off inside.</li>
            <li> Poor quality all around.  </li>
            <li> So a lot of times I&#x27;d go into work with extremely frizzy and/or ugly wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought this based on the other reviews, and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product after reading other reviews and I have not been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> but it MIGHT be a bit of a disappointment to thick hair.</li>
            <li> The last one I had however malfunctioned in a very bad way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that it lasted less than a year.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace my Conair CS25 model that I left in a hotel room by accident, and was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> My hair dresser said you can never go wrong with Conair --</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several straightening irons before, and this is the worst one ever.</li>
            <li> All in all, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this iron.  </li>
            <li> well at frist i was skeptical about this straightner coz</li>
            <li> I have an expensive chi straightener</li>
            <li> It also shuts off randomly after 5 minutes or so.</li>
            <li> I find it difficult to get any amount of hair in it.  </li>
            <li> I had read all the reviews and did not want to spend the money on an expensive straightener and settled for this one.</li>
            <li> Useless to me.  </li>
            <li> Works well and was not so expensive.  </li>
            <li> Buy it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 expensive ($100</li>
            <li> This product is NO good!!</li>
            <li> What a useless piece of junk.</li>
            <li> This is a mediocre straightener...</li>
            <li> It is useless...</li>
            <li> I know a lot of items will work on 120/240 volts, but I didn&#x27;t want to bring my expensive straightener from home and</li>
            <li> It would randomly turn itself off.</li>
            <li> Since my hair is short, it flips horribly</li>
            <li> For the price, it wasn&#x27;t a terrible option, but I received a CHI for Christmas and I will never go back.</li>
            <li> if it had broken i wouldn&#x27;t have been devastated, so there&#x27;s the benefit!</li>
            <li> I had gone to sleep with just-from-the-shower wet hair and woke up with a horrible resmeblance to some feathery 70&#x27;s boufant do.</li>
            <li> Because your hair grows out into all these weird layers and it looks extremely awkward.</li>
            <li> Curly, Frizzy, Thick haired guys/girls read this!!!  </li>
            <li> and don&#x27;t be afraid to up the setting either.</li>
            <li> I borrowed a friend&#x27;s CHI flatiron a few months ago, and it was HORRIBLE.</li>
            <li> No need to spend tons of money on an expensive straightener; this one does the job!</li>
            <li> and i was sad &#x3D;( .  </li>
            <li> Well, she was wrong!  </li>
            <li> After using very expensive straighteners I decided to give this one a try.</li>
            <li> She has yearned for years for a straightener that would not damage her hair and allow her to wear it in styles hitherto impossible.  </li>
            <li> Bad design.</li>
            <li> &quot; (gee, did it look that bad before?)</li>
            <li> Too bad</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve had a bad experience with a straightener before, do yourself a favor, and try this one.</li>
            <li> I used the straigtener and it gave me bad results.  </li>
            <li> There is nothing to say bad about this straightener.</li>
            <li> This straightener wasn&#x27;t that bad</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I was a bit disappointed with this straightener.</li>
            <li> This straightener works wonders even on my crazy, wavy, frizzy hair!  </li>
            <li> and I promise you that you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I returned it. :(</li>
            <li> then it died and so did my money :(&lt;br</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed if you purchase this.</li>
            <li> Disappointed</li>
            <li> Makes my hair smell burnt :(</li>
            <li> It just stopped heating up while I was using it :(.</li>
            <li> Totally disappointed in this version made in China instead of USA.</li>
            <li> &amp; I keep forgetting to turn it on (stupid</li>
            <li> but I hate when my hair is frizzy and awful.  </li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I am very DISAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li> The worst part is the snagging though.</li>
            <li> Worst straightener I have ever had!</li>
            <li> By the way..there are HORRIBLE fumes from this straightener after over 2 years of use..</li>
            <li> this straightener is terrible  </li>
            <li> Tried it this morning and its awful.</li>
            <li> friend who has insanely curly hair tried this straightener, and her hair was straighter than it had ever been!  </li>
            <li> This one is terrible.</li>
            <li> Disappointed!!</li>
            <li> This straightener is horrible.</li>
            <li> I hate this!</li>
            <li> This straightener is the worst I&#x27;ve had.</li>

            <li> I bought it for my wife so that she could benefit from the dual voltage. She wasn&#x27;t contempt with the results when compared to the CHI and Hai straighteners she uses at home.The dual voltage was the only reason we bought this, so she can use it on trips abroad.</li>
            <li> I got a product that was completely different than the one pictured and described. I returned it immediately.</li>
            <li> Smaller then it looks</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron because I needed the dual voltage for a trip. I ended up hating it so much I threw it away after I got back. The plates do not go all the way out to the edge of the plastic, which causes your hair to snag very easily. The plastic feels cheap and the whole thing is clunky and difficult to maneuver. The worst part is the snagging though. I would never recommend this to anyone. I do not understand all of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> The curved handle makes it hard to use.I gave it to my daughter and she has long hair and doesn&#x27;t like it either.</li>
            <li> Used it in the UK and it worked perfectly. I had to use the turbo button each time to straighten my thick wavy hair. This also works in the US, and I still have to press the turbo button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Update 3/16/2014--&lt;br /&gt;It died! There was no warning or any signs before it died... It worked perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> I have previously bought CONAIR Model CS19FCS for my friend in India, who loves it, because CONAIR Model CS19FCS could straighten and shine her Curly, frizzy, unmanageable hair, beautifully. Soon, her cousin got to taste the same result for her hair (with Model CS19FCS) and wanted to get one. Since CONAIR CS19FCS was not available from AMAZON, I chose the next best CONAIR Model CS19VCSR, which is seen in the picture , for her and shipped to India.&lt;br /&gt;I am so positive, Cousin would love it, as this model is an enhanced model than the previous one.&lt;br /&gt;I , very highly recommend CONAIR Model CS19VCSR and or Model CS19FCS to any one who wants hair to look like Barbie !&lt;br /&gt;Thanks AMAZON for the quick delivery.</li>
            <li> It met all my expectations, excellent product. Easy to use and light. Totally reommendable for those who want to have good quality for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Love this iron better than any of my more expensive brands. It makes my hair very soft and silky. Plus it has dual voltage that is why I bought it.</li>
            <li> It does the job but not as big as my t-studio remington one. Very plastic and cheap. Not my fave straightener. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to a friend or repurchase. It&#x27;s just so cheapy! There&#x27;s not really a protective coating on the plates either. And probably not as hot as other better quality straighteners. But its not terrible.</li>
            <li> I gifted it to my wife and she love it. She has very fine hair and it takes just 5 min to straighten hair. Its good quality straightener and the best part is its dual voltage so she can always use it anywhere or where ever she go.....</li>
            <li> OMG!!    I&#x27;ve been using this flat iron for over a year now, and it still works like a charm!  And for the price??? Amazing :)  I wash my hair as usual and apply a product from \\&quot;Bed Head\\&quot; to protect my hair from the heat of the blow dryer and the iron.  Blowdry my hair dry and then use the flat iron to give my hair a beautiful, straight and shiny finish.  I have very thick, coarse hair and it&#x27;s always been really difficult to find an iron that works well and doesn&#x27;t damage my hair too much.  Lets be honest, heat isn&#x27;t the best thing for your hair :)  And I staighten my hair on average twice a week and it looks great.  Would highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> This straightener will get the job done, but I would not purchase another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used a Sedu for about 3 years until it finally kicked the bucket. I was low on cash so I thought I&#x27;d try something not as expensive, especially considering the great reviews. This thing is large, bulky, and pulls my hair if I&#x27;m not very careful. The end result leaves my hair looking a bit like straw, whereas my older expensive straightener always left my hair looking (and feeling) silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save for something better, it&#x27;s worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> This straightener is the best one that I&#x27;ve ever personally used. It straightens my stubborn, curly hair very quickly, and it gets hot quickly. I love this straightener, and I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase! :)</li>
            <li> Arrived right on time! My wife loves it, says it works great! Only takes one stroke no need to go over it more then once. Also has a very good price.. Great gift idea..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightener for a few months now and when I close the hinge mechanism and run it through my hair I then have to pry it back open with force. Super annoying. And my hair gets caught up in it all the time. Bad design.</li>
            <li> Good for travel purposes</li>
            <li> Great flat iron!  Love the tilt; it keeps me from burning myself!</li>
            <li> My old one died after 5 years, so I tried researching other brands.  My hair dresser said you can never go wrong with Conair -- so I bought it again.  She&#x27;s right!  This one is just as great as the old one!  Heats up fast, straightens well, and the auto shut off is wonderful!</li>
            <li> This flat iron works really well. I have relatively thick and long asian hair and this flat iron managed to make it stick straight, unlike some of the irons I&#x27;ve used. Although it&#x27;s a 2 inch flat iron, it actually gives me huge and bouncy waves. You can find the video on YouTube by searching curling hair with a 2 inch flat iron.  I would totally recommend it for it&#x27;s price. I used this flat iron in Singapore and really serves the dual voltage function well.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I was a bit disappointed with this straightener. From the way the other review were written, I assumed it worked like a miracle for only 22$. I made up a little test of my own to see how good it was. I washed my hair, waited until it dried into a frizzy puff, then put in braids and slept on it. The next morning, I had frizz all over and huge puffy waves.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The straightener took only minutes to heat up, a huge plus. I love the huge plates so I can straighten faster. I first tried a temperature of 10. It worked beautifully on the fine, thin parts of my hair, but on the coarser, thicker parts, it wasn&#x27;t enough. I set it on 15 and straightened. The waves disappeared immediately but the hair was still a little puffy. I ran the straightener down again and I had shiny straight hair but more volume than I bargained for. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pros: 1) 2 minute heat up time 2) 25 temperature settings 3) huge plates 4) made hair shiny 5) straightened hair great 6) tamed some frizz 7) really shows off the layers in my hair 8) 2 year warranty. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cons: 1) Gave my hair too much volume (but that could just be my hair) 2) couldn&#x27;t tame all the frizz 3) i keep bumping the temperature dial on the iron, thus making the iron heat up all over again, but I think I can just scotch tape it so it doesn&#x27;t move. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All in all a great value, especially for the price. I think it would benefit those with curly hair but it MIGHT be a bit of a disappointment to thick hair.</li>
            <li> ..Heats up quickly &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;..No abnormally long cord &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;..Big paddles &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It works well. It really does. Worth every cent.</li>
            <li> ConAir&#x27;s last flat iron was a big fat lemon. I loathed it so much, I refused to buy another one by this company. I went out and spent about eighty bucks for a HAI straighter instead. It&#x27;s worth every penny, believe you me. But then I tried ConAir&#x27;s new ceramic straightener. And man, was I floored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I had to borrow a friend&#x27;s, since I&#x27;d left mine at home. What a surprise! Heats up quickly, and hair glides smoothly past the plates, leaving hair not only straight, but shiny. I had gone to sleep with just-from-the-shower wet hair and woke up with a horrible resmeblance to some feathery 70&#x27;s boufant do. A sweep over with the Conair ceramic flat iron left me with soft, shiny and straight hair in less than 15 minutes. I&#x27;ve had nothing but frizzy trouble since moving to SW Florida, and my hair refuses to go flat without the use of a good flat iron. I&#x27;m happy to say this particular ConAir flat iron makes up for a multitude of past sins, and doesn&#x27;t put a dent in your budget. Comes with 2 brush attachments that slide on the side of the plates. Also features a \\&quot;power\\&quot; and \\&quot;turbo power\\&quot; button, which I can only assume means \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; is volcano-like hot, which is exactly what it felt like.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair, which I love to wear straight, after trying to straighten my hair once with another more expensive hair straightener and ending up with a scarecrow mop I gave up and just went to my hairdressers to get it blown out.  Decided to give it one more try myself after reading the reviews on this Conair, after all it was only $20.00.  WOW I loved it, my hair looks awesome, this is a great buy.</li>
            <li> Trust me on this one. Especially for $20. When I bought mine almost 10 months ago, it was more and was still a bargain! It was my 2nd straightener. My 1st one would catch my hair (OUCH!) and it was very small, so it took forever and took many times over the same spot to see improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then at a video shoot I was in, my roommate took this one out and started to straighten her incredibly curly, kinky hair with ease. I asked her if I could try it and ended up using that one! LOL! I threw mine out and that weekend ordered mine! I LOVE IT. And, its very durable. I have dropped it a few times (ooops) and its still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you dont think it straightens the way you want, let it heat up another min. and don&#x27;t be afraid to up the setting either. Its safer to use a higher setting on your hair once, then go over one spot many times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so confident you will love this product. It made this stay at home mom of 2 toddlers on the go feel wonderful quickly and easily!!!!</li>
            <li> I read alot of reviews about this particular straightener. It seemed that everyone was in agreement that it worked very well. I bought one for around 18 dollars, and was SO shocked that it worked dramatically better than a 150 dollar model i hade purchased a year earlier. I have very thick and long wavy hair, and this made it stick straight after only going through it once. ITS AMAZING! My hair has never looked like this in my entire life. I didn&#x27;t think it possible, but I have pin straight hair! THIS THING IS AMAZING!!</li>
            <li> I actually got this for Christmas 2004 (because I asked for it) and I after blow drying my (newly shortened)hair last night I thought \\&quot;hey, I should use that thing\\&quot; so I took it out for the first time 9/15/05. It took no time at all to heat up, it gets super hot and HOLY COW my hair looks amazing. Gone are the little frizzies and flyaways. Hello perfectly flipped ends and smooth, shiney hair. I didn&#x27;t think there was enough different for anyone else to notice, but 9 people have said \\&quot;wow, your hair looks awesome\\&quot; (gee, did it look that bad before?) today at work. As I said, I used it last night and it looked just as good this morning when I got out of bed. I didn&#x27;t even have to brush it, just ran my fingers thru it (I have thick hair that is shoulder length). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this one. It will now have a permanent home on my vanity rather than in a basket in the linen closet!</li>
            <li> I bought it thinking \\&quot;ok so why not try another one?!\\&quot; I have several straightening irons at home and they&#x27;re all ok, but ot much more than that: it takes me about one hour to somewhat straighten my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, imagine my surprise when it now takes me 20 minutes to fully straighten my hair!  I highly recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s short on time and/or patience; and who has tried other straightening products before (such as chemically straightening: this iron gives me better results than chem. straightening and is much less damaging.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had conair straighteners in the past, but this one REALLY works...My hairdresser says my hair strands are thin, but I have a LOT of them, which makes for very thick fluffy hair, even when I use a round brush...this straightener keeps it stick straight all day, and i can wake up the next morning, spend 2 minutes on the ends, and have it last 2 days...I give it 5 stars, I am thinking about buying another one for a backup!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this flat iron for about 6 years now. I&#x27;ve only replaced it once. I use it anywhere from once a week to 5 times. The comb attachment makes this a winner in my book. It helps to straighten my hair even better! I haven&#x27;t really used the other attachment.    There are many settings, which is a plus! I&#x27;ve only found my hand messing with the dial a few times at first. But not anymore. It&#x27;s a big flat iron....not one of those small skinny ones. So it&#x27;ll take a few uses to get used to it. But once you do, it&#x27;s a breeze. Since I have very long hair, it works well for me. Makes straightening very fast and has proven to last a long time. Forget buying the ones that cost $50-$150! This is one right for me!    If you&#x27;re looking for a big flat iron that is durable, this is it!</li>
            <li> This is a FANTASTIC flat iron.  I have never had a heating product that worked as well as this one.  It deserves all of the rave reviews. This is exactly what I had been searching for.  It heats up very quickly, in less than a minute! It takes your hair from frizzy to SILKY STRAIGHT! The price is awesome for such a great quality.  If you have been searching for the perfect flat iron, then buy this one.  You will not regret it!</li>
            <li> This straightener works wonders even on my crazy, wavy, frizzy hair!  It works really well without damaging my hair, which was a welcome surprise considering the price.  I would definitely buy another one of these if it ever wears out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 11/13/2007  I&#x27;ve had this for 3 years now, and it works just as great as it did when I first bought it.  Still a great value for the money!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase.  I have been using it for half a year now and it still works great and does an amazing job.  It heats up fast and my hair runs through smoothly, leaving it soft and shiny.  I highly recommend it!  It&#x27;s so inexpensive too!</li>
            <li> I have owned this straightener for about 2 years. When I first got it, I was impressed at how hot it got in a very short time. After about a year of owning the product, the clip that clips the scissors-like parts together came loose, and I started having to clamp it together with my free hand in addition to squeezing the handle. I tried tightening the only screw that is visible without actually taking the thing apart, to no avail. It finally got so loose that it doesn&#x27;t do anything except make my hair hotter, so now I will be buying a new straightener... but probably not this one.</li>
            <li> This Conair Flat Iron is awesome. It was my first and only flat iron and it works so well on my curly hair. I have very thick curly frizzy hair and when I use this flat iron my hair comes out looking smooth and shiny and straight!!! My hairstylist recommended OPTIONS by framesi WAY SMOOTH stop frizz cream and I use the frizz cream right before I straighten my hair and the combination is amazing. My hair is frizz free and straight! Once you straighten it could last for weeks! I&#x27;ve had it for years now and I have no problem with it and it works just like new. There are various settings you can choose from to accomodate different hair types and best of all it has an auto shut-off! I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Well, it was great while it lasted!  I have moderately wavy hair and it did the trick...even on the most humid days (and I live in hot/humid NC).  I bought this 11 months ago and today, it died.  I have an older 1 1/2 inch conair that still works, but I&#x27;ve been using this 2 inch one almost every day since I bought it.  I&#x27;m disappointed that it lasted less than a year.  I expected more than that from Conair.</li>
            <li> Make my hair look flat! I would not recommend this straightner to anyone with thin hair</li>
            <li> First of all let me start by saying I have naturally wavy, frizzy out of control hair. Plus, I have tried so many straighteners and they all don&#x27;t do the job they intend to do. Until now, I have struggled with trying to straighten my hair with many straighteners. They always look good once I leave the house and then as soon as humidity or moisture comes around I am a huge frizz ball once again. I have been to so many family gatherings and people tell me how gorgeous my hair looks straight and then an hour later look at me like what happened to her head. Until now, I recently bought this Conair ceramic heater and was amazed and shocked to see that it so easily straightened my hair and it remained straight. My frizzies are gone and my hair looks awesome. I was sceptical about purchasing this item because it was on the cheaper end until I started to read the reviews. Now a month later, I am one of those reviewers raving about this straightener. It is definitely worth trying and I promise you that you won&#x27;t be disappointed. It definitely will pay for itself over and over and the comments you will receive from others will blow you away. Thank you so much for such a wonderful product Conair that everyone can afford.</li>
            <li> When I was ordering this item I based it off of all of the great reviews.  Even with this in mind I was still skeptical because I have this same brand but in a smaller size about 1\\&quot; width and it worked alright but not great.  Once I got this item I used it the next day.  I tested it on a section of my hair and it worked so well I had to do the rest or my hair would look funny.  I did the rest kind of quickly since I was just testing it.  There is a little booklet that tells you what to put the setting on based on your hair type.  I actually had to turn it down to 15 and it still worked amazing well and fast.  My hair is thick with a natural wave and tons of frizz.    My sisters and I were amazed at the finished job, and I kept brushing my fingers through my hair because I&#x27;ve never felt it so smooth and shiny before.  I took a nap for 2 hours soon after using it and when I woke up, it was still straight as before.  Later when I went to bed for 8 hours and woke up it is just as straight as when I styled it.  I&#x27;m kind of in shock about how well this works.  The true test is to straighten my hair before going out clubbing in Chicago where the clubs are open until 5am and after all that dancing we&#x27;ll see how well it stays straight.    Overall the product is way better than expected, especially for the price.  And I almost paid $80-$150 for a professional straightener.  I&#x27;m so glad I took the chance with this one.  So far I love it and can&#x27;t wait to use it again.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about purchasing this iron at first because I purchased a ConAir iron when flat irons first came out (when you had to put water in the steamer part) and it was horrible. I read all the good reviews, though, and I have to say that I am really impressed! I have crazy curly hair and this iron REALLY WORKS. I have had 5 different irons and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I have bought many straighteners before. I have thick hair and I always straighten my hair at night then again in the morning and still through out the say, my hair begins to kink. But I got this flat iron for my birthday and I love it. I was skeptical at first because it felt cheep, light and that it would suck. I LOVE IT! My hair not only straightened in HALF the time, but it STAYED straight ALL night. All I had to do was touche it up. My hair stayed straight all day. This is well worth 26 dollars. Why pay 100&#x27;s of dollars for something that will give the same results?    5 Stars!</li>
            <li> About two years ago I got a straightener by Conair almost exactly like this one. Over the past two years I&#x27;ve used it 2-4 times a week and it&#x27;s never failed me. I have VERY thick hair and the size is perfect. I always put it on the highest settings but I&#x27;ve never burned my hair or myself. Rarely it frizzes, usually leaving my hair soft and smooth. I&#x27;m getting a new straightener only because I need one that works wet and dry, although I&#x27;ll continue to use this one if it&#x27;s needed. This is a great straightener for all hair types and great if you have thick hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because of the good reviews and the bargain price. It heats up fast and works as advertised. But it&#x27;s quite tough to straighten hair of medium length, especially around ear, because the plate size is too thick.</li>
            <li> I like this product pretty well. It does a great job of straightening and often my sisters will steal it from me because they like it so much. The only problem I have with it is it&#x27;s size. Even though I have longer hair, the straightener is almost too big to effectively straighten my hair. I will often have to go over the same section of hair again. Also, I have had trouble with my hair getting caught in some of the grooves. But, even though it has some problems, it still does a pretty good job when you get accustomed to working around its problems.</li>
            <li> I love that it is so wide and that I can get a lot of my very thick hair in the straightener at once so straightening my hair doesn&#x27;t take very long.  Even though it does seem to take quite a while to heat up, I still recommend this product highly!</li>
            <li> The iron does heat up fast and the shape is good for handling. The pros stop here however as the cons are the fact that it is poorly made because there is a gap in the ceramic plate and frame, where hair gets snagged as you pull it through and the hair just literally breaks off. Worst straightener I have ever had!</li>
            <li> it warm up really quickly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some bad experiences with flat irons and vowed never to buy another... and I&#x27;m glad I changed my mind. I LOVE this flat iron. At  first I was thrown off by the handles because I&#x27;m used to V shaped handles. Now I actually like these wands better-- I don&#x27;t have to hold the flat iron to my hair because the wands have an excellent grip. My only complaint is the automatic shut off... I just prefer to keep it on while I&#x27;m using it, but a press of the power button solves that.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my mother-in-law before she went on a cruise.  She was very happy with the hair straightener, light but enough heat to straighten her hair like her one at home.  Worked in foreign hotels and on the cruise ship.</li>
            <li> Very sensitive to plugs in. Ive had it for a year now but it turns on and off by itself. works really well on my hair though and it looks great!</li>
            <li> It is a great product</li>
            <li> Just got this as a birthday present from my daughter, who has been straightening her hair for years and is quite the expert, and I am thrilled with this product.  Nice wide plates work on large sections of hair at a time which is perfect for those with long, thick hair like me who don&#x27;t want to spend an hour on their hair.  Multiple heat settings - this baby gets HOT!  My hair was so hot when it came out of the plates that it hurt my hands!  My hair is very curly and it usually takes me at least three passes to get the curl out, but with this one it was basically completely straight on one long, slow pass.  Nice and sturdy, and I love the finger rest on the end so you can use two hands to work.  No need to spend tons of money on an expensive straightener; this one does the job!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several straightening irons before, and this is the worst one ever. Conair makes good straightening irons sometimes, and that&#x27;s what makes me so angry about the quality of this one--they know better. You can&#x27;t do a single swipe of the iron without it snagging some of the hair in the border around the heated iron section. What good is straight hair if you have zillions of flyaways? Time for a new brand of straightening iron.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you can find a better straightener for this price.  Ceramic plates are a MUST!  It heats up fast and is effective on my wavy hair.  Make sure you go for one with the comb attachment, otherwise if you have fine hair like me, it might just slip through.</li>
            <li> Forgot my flat iron on vacation. I bought this one but it freakin fried my hair!!!!!!  i had to get an inch cut off when I got home.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve boughten two of these already... and I&#x27;ve had the same problem both times. I like the way it straightens my hair, but after maybe a year it either gets stuck when it&#x27;s closed or it just stops heating up. I&#x27;m getting fed up with having to buy a new straightener every year and am looking for a different brand to try....</li>
            <li> You see that the photo shows a \\&quot;scissor\\&quot; style straightener, with the hinge in the center. I was shipped a \\&quot;tongs\\&quot; style straightener with the hinge down at one end. I wanted the scissor style. Not happy.</li>
            <li> I wanted a simple, easy-to-use flat iron without having to spend over $100.  This flat iron is perfect.  It has temperature control so you can get it really hot if needed.  It also turns off automatically if you forget about it, which is great.  I would highly recommend this flat iron.</li>
            <li> The flat iron is great!  Too bad the reason I bought it was for a trip to England and the converter/ multi plug unit a bought didn&#x27;t.  So, Two weeks of vacation without a flat iron.  However, I now have a great back-up iron at home.</li>
            <li> I love the straightener! Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> So far this has been the best straightener that I have ever used. It heats up fast and you only have to run it through your har one time. I can now straighten my hair in just minutes. It gets extra hot. You have a power on button and a turbo power on button and with that it gets turbo hot! The removeable comb in awesome!! I love to use it because it saves time without being annoying like some products with extra features. It is easy to remove by sliding out but stays in place when put back on, it is also easy to put back on. This has been the hottest straightener that I have ever used. I love Conair styling products. I have no bad things to say about this wonderful product. The only thing that can be a small con is that sometimes I have to hit the power on button 2-3 times to get it to turn on, which is easy to tell because the light comes right on. Other then that, this item is simple to use and works very well and heats up wonderfully which saves time. The Amazon price is about $5 bucks less then Walmart&#x27;s price where I got mine and this straightener was money well spent. It cost a little less then straighteners that do not work as well. Conair products are known to work great and last a long time!! With the removeable comb and all the features this deserves 5 STARS! Usually you will get a straightener that does not have the removeable comb or turbo on putton and there are also 25 heat settings, it is simple to use and works great!</li>
            <li> I bought this straightner a couple weeks ago and I love it so much I decided to write a review. It got here super fast and I opened it right away. My hair is very thick and hard to straighten so I assumed it would take about 30-45 mins. to be finished. It heated up in less than 60 seconds and I was pleasantly surprised when it only took about 15 minutes to finish straightning! My hair did not have that dead, fried look to it after, in fact it looked shiny and sleek :) This product was worth every penny of it! I could have bought a high-end straightener and would have gotten the same results! This is my second time using a ConAir straightener and I have to say that I am very pleased. I reccomend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I was traveling to Europe so I needed a Dual Voltage Flat Iron, I got the Conair 2\\&quot; Ceramic Straightener for the trip and it worked great.  It took me some time to get used to the 2\\&quot; plates, since I&#x27;m so used to my 1\\&quot; Iron, but once I got the hang of it I loved it!!!</li>
            <li> I have had this straightener for as long as I can remember, and it finally just blew out a couple of days ago.  I am SOOOO lost without it!  I bought a different straightener, because I couldn&#x27;t find this one at the stores, and I&#x27;m so unimpressed with what I&#x27;ve found.  I saw this one on Amazon, and bought it right away, it works great on longer hair, and I LOVE the attached comb.  This is a great product, and I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just bought this iron and i simply loved it. i tried to flat iron my hair lots of times before but i couldn&#x27;t manage to do even my bangs. this product is so simple to use, heats up really fast, the turbo function is really awesome especially at hard to manage areas, and finally the 2 inch blades makes it easier and faster to finish all your hair- i finished doing all my hair in 20 minutes-. the only con that i found is that the cord was not long enough for me, i think a foot longer would be just great. other than that it&#x27;s really great one and excellent bargain for the price.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your 50 bucks on those salon professional ceramic flat irons. this one is just as good for half the price. i only spent 22 bucks on this great item and it works like a dream. i&#x27;ve always had frizzy hair and the amazing ceramic heated iron really straightens in no time. Ceramic flat irons are the way to go. I highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it really works. I was kind of skeptical cuz&#x27; I have really thick uncontrollable hair. I have tried almost everything, but nothing really worked that nice. The only thing that can really control my frizzy thick curly hair was going to the salon, but that is way too expensive to go everyday...well, until now. I have to admit the top of my hair is still a little frizzy, but for the most part it is awesome. I definately would recommend it esp. for the price it is going for. Its worth it!</li>
            <li> My daughter had used this iron at a friends house and wanted to purchase it. I was unsure at first, because I have purchased many irons prior to this one. She brought it home for me to use because I have thick curly hair. Much to my surprise it worked!! Now the iron gets twice the work!! I would recommend this iron to anyone. The price is awesome and it works awesome!!</li>
            <li> and to think i thought i&#x27;d have to wear my hair in a messy-bun for the rest of my life! you see, i have frizz-prone hair that sometimes and in someplaces is curly, and then in some is almost straight. so i thought i was cursed, and doomed- but no! i bought this iron, and wow! what an awesome job! my hair is silky and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;i love the heat settings (1-20), and i leave mine at about 11, and it does the job for me. i also love the safty-grip on the tip of the iron, so you can press the iron together on both sides as you glide it through your hair. i also love the comb plate which i leave in, and it grips wonderfully without snagging or breaking my hair. then, when i get to the top layers, i use the boar-bristle comb, and it adds an extra bit of sheen.&lt;br /&gt;if you&#x27;ve had a bad experience with a straightener before, do yourself a favor, and try this one. you&#x27;ll get great results, i promise.&lt;br /&gt;what can i say? i just love this product!</li>
            <li> I was told you need to spend a lot to get a decent ceramic hair iron. I thought $21 was too good to be true, but believed the raving reviews. Well, they were right! I am completely untalented with fixing hair, but was able to use the iron on my first try to get fabulous results. It only takes 5-10 minutes to turn my unruly shoulder-length hair into a sleek mane half-way down my back. I have received lots of complements. It&#x27;s given me a whole new look.&lt;BR&gt;No need to spend a lot--this iron rocks!</li>
            <li> Pros:  It heats up quickly and has so many setting levels.  It tames the frizz in my slightly wavy hair.  The one con I have is that it is a bit hard to handle and bulky.  I wish there was a smaller version of this iron, like a 1/2 to 1 inch wide plate.</li>
            <li> This product works GREAT! Heats up fast and maintains tempurature throughout useage. Leaves hair shiney and frizz-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE IT.  My daughters keep asking me to use it.  I will be getting one for each of them.</li>
            <li> i recieved this product a while ago &amp; i was anxious to use it after i read all these great reviews on this site.  it influenced my purchase of the straigntening iron.  i must say, i was not dissapointed.  my hair is very course &amp; very curly.  i was surprised that this straigntened my hair after passing my hair thru it only once.  with other straightening irons, i had to pass it thru over 5 times before i even began to see parts of it start to straighten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i wish i had found this product years ago.  would have saved me a whole lot of bad hair days.  i even used it on my sister &amp; cousin&#x27;s hair.  they both were stunned at how their hair looked.  my cousin said she now has movie star hair.  its true too.  it didnt dry out my hair at all or leave the ends of the hair looking like &#x27;what the heck happened there&#x27;.  i had shiny straight movie star hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i just might buy one or two more of this straightening iron for my friends &amp; just to keep as a spare.  its just that good.  its not difficult to use.  read the instruction booklet.  &amp; given proper use &amp; care, this should bring me (&amp; you)  great results for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have several straightening irons to get the kinks out of my frizz-in-the-humidity hair, and I can attest to the fact that high cost does not necessarily mean a better outcome!  A $120 iron sits at the bottom of my closet and never gets use!  This Conair model does everything at a budget price.  It&#x27;s big, bulky, but it is brilliant!  I absolutely am a convert to having the comb attachment.  I never used them until a new hairdresser persuaded me to try it again -- now I insist on having a comb on the side of the iron -- it&#x27;s such an asset I don&#x27;t want to be without it.  I have used Conair appliances before that I was disappointed in, but this one impressed me with its performance.  Conair is good if something goes wrong to just send the appliance back and receive another in its place, and a two year warranty is better than most hair styling electrical tools.  Personally, you could purchase seven of these for the price of one of those high cost models  and have one for  every day of the week.  Also, this has dual voltage, which has been helpful to me.  All in all, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this iron.  I wish they would make a small version of 1\\&quot; or less for my short nape hair that was this efficient!</li>
            <li> I decided to get this after reading the reviews.  All I can say is AWESOME.  Now I can shower the night before and run this through my hair.  It&#x27;s straighter and shinier than I could ever imagine!  Worth every penny... and more!</li>
            <li> Excellent  100 % positive</li>
            <li> A very good product for the price. This is the second conair hair product (the other one is for making curls) and I have been very satisfied with both of them so far. Heat very quickly and the 2\\&quot; wide iron works very well. I strongly recommend this product for those who have fussy hair and want to make them straight and shiny.</li>
            <li> This straightener was a godsend when I was traveling abroad for work. The dual voltage feature ensured that the straighter was hot enough to actually straighten my hair on several damp days in Amsterdam. Previously when traveling abroad, I used a straightener (made for U.S. plugs) and a converter to power it. The straighter never got hot enough to actually straighten my hair and the converter subsequently killed the straightener leaving me straighner-less while traveling in a humid region of France. If you are traveling abroad and want to make sure you have the right tools to straighten your hair I cannot recommend this straighter more. It was perfect!</li>
            <li> The very best hair straightener for the money on the market! This is my daughter&#x27;s second one. She used the first one so much that it simply wore out! You don&#x27;t have to spend a fortune to straighten your hair, just buy one of these. you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I love this thing.  I blow dry my hair straight with a barrel brush then run this flat iron over it.  It plates are nice and wide (2\\&quot;) and it heats up fairly quickly.  It doesn&#x27;t fry my hair or leave it frizzed out.  Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This is a great staightener for a very reasonable price.  It heats up quickly and the attached comb helps keep my hair untangled as it goes between the ceramic plates.  I always get a lot of compliments when I use it!</li>
            <li> warms up fast, but I have problem with overheating, since I always manage to scroll the heater adjuster up while I am working on my hair...Other than that, it works great!</li>
            <li> Have been using it for about 2 years, worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I bought this 8-9 months back, and its amazing. And more importantly, I am a guy with not-so-long hair.    Pros:  1. It comes along with a comb which is very comfortable.   2. Auto power off. I always tend to forget switching it off, and it shuts off automatically. No worries.  3. Comfortable grip  4. Gets hot quickly.  5. The comb is detachable. I just take it out and wash it regularly.    Cons:  1. The plastic handle is flimsy. Each handle is made of 2 pieces held together by a screw. The screw is already screwed up in my piece (after nearly 3 months of use). Right now, I have held them together by a rubber band (and it works just fine). I used to travel with this a lot though.  2. It actually takes more time to cool down (approx 15-20 minutes). So if you are traveling, and use the straightner just before heading out, then you need to wait for atleast 10-15 minutes before packing this.     Having said both pros and cons, I really love it. And believe me, it works well for guys too!</li>
            <li> These flat irons are horribly on thick hair bewarned perfect Remington flat irons.</li>
            <li> Not so great for course curly hair. I needed to repeat working on the same hair part repeatedly.the good part was that it heats up in no time.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product and bought two of them here to stock up - then I read the bad reviews that the picture was deceptive and what was shipped didn&#x27;t have the comb attachment. I thought I was going to have to return them, but they had the attachments!!!     For those who haven&#x27;t used this item and are intimidated (it feels awkward) about the comb/brush attachments, or just can&#x27;t see any purpose in it, the comb, when on the downside while ironing the hair, combs it straight down for the heat of the flat iron to do its job well - without repeated use. Without the comb attachment, it works as well as the best regular flat irons, but with the comb and used correctly? Awesome!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for the dual voltage to use last summer specifically for an overseas trip to the Mediterranean.  It worked like a charm.  The width of the plates makes your work a lot faster.  I don&#x27;t use this on an everyday basis, though so I don&#x27;t know about longer term hair condition as others said.  However, for the price and the dual voltage, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I purchased this iron in hopes to be able to nicely straighten my hair after blowdrying. This product is just not good at all. I cannot getas close to the root as I would like. It doesn&#x27;t straighten well. You&#x27;ll have to go over a section of hair multiple times to get a somewhat decent result. If I were you, I&#x27;d invest money in a good ceramic flat iron like a CHI or Biosilk. Both of those work great.</li>
            <li> Not hot enough doesn&#x27;t straighten curly or wavy hair very well</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace my Conair CS25 model that I left in a hotel room by accident, and was very disappointed.  Although this model does have a comb on the side of it, it did not glide through my hair well - my hair got caught and seemed to stick to the plates.  In fact, I pulled out quite a few hairs trying to use it and I felt like it was really damaging.  It is also heavy and awkward compared to the CS25 model, harder to manuever to the root of your hair and easier to burn yourself.  I stuck it in a drawer after two uses and ordered the other model.    The CS25 is the ultra slim model with 1 5/8 inch plates.  I&#x27;m not sure how it would work on thick curly hair, but for wavy hair like mine that has a little frizz and mostly needs to be smoothed it was fantastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but, like I said, its big and bulky. I&#x27;d rather a nice slim straightener.  Well, it does do the job...so if you like it, buy it.</li>
            <li> I am amazed at all the detailed comments on a ceramic hair straightener for a little over $22. So, Ok, I have a pony tail and that sucker does straighten it quite well. Maybe if I had a big ol&#x27; bouffant it would be different-whatever--This straightener works for me and works for everyone who uses it (don&#x27;t ask...). Go spend twice or more on one if you must but I have no idea why you would. This unit works and most of us agree. Some people should join a chat room to discuss their preferences on hair products I suppose. If you want a good straightener, then buy this one--If you don&#x27;t, go spend more for a professional one--I don&#x27;t care. Fast shipping, excellent price and thanks Amazon. I&#x27;m outta here~~</li>
            <li> This straightner is very good, i already have one and buy this one for my sister......i recomend it</li>
            <li> I wish I would have bought one of these a couple years back when I started growing out my hair. And to think it is pretty cheap too. Wow.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My hair looks great now! I feel a lot more confident about myself and more happy with my hair. Doesn&#x27;t get rid of all the frizz but that&#x27;s what frizz lotion is for, right?  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is really easy to use...the comb pick works wonders, while I wasn&#x27;t too impressed with the bristle pick.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Still, my hair has never looked this good and I owe it all to this gizmo. If you have long, wavey and/or unmanageable hair, pick up one of these today.</li>
            <li> This thing is the best because of the comb and brush inserts, leaves your hair super slik! I love it and have bought it for my family to to use it. They love it too.</li>
            <li> I have REALLY THICK HAIR that I got permed (BIG MISTAKE). This is the only flat iron that gets my hair super straigth. Its made my hair look really shiny and took out all the frizz. The best part is it only took about 15 minutes to do this. I would say GO AHEAD to any one who wants to buy this!</li>
            <li> This is the first flat-iron I have ever purchased and WOW am I impressed.  My hair was pin straight when I was done.  I have shoulder length curly hair and I was able to straighten it very quickly.  It really does heat up in 60sec. I had my doubts but it is hot instantly, unlike my old curling iron. I highly recommend this flat-iron.</li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY thick, curly hair. This thing works. I&#x27;ve never been able to straighten my hair myself --  until now. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t straighten my hair that well.</li>
            <li> well at frist i was skeptical about this straightner coz i heard that wit scissor straighteners ur hair usually gets caught in the mechanics...but besides the occasional lost hair...it works realli well...nice heat settings...and cool attachments... &lt;br /&gt;good job conair!</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair straightener last week. It&#x27;s pretty good, it heats up super quickly, stays very hot and does a pretty good job. The only thing I HATE, but the problem would have been the same with any brand I would&#x27;ve purchased, is that it is a scissor-style straightener. Unless you have HUGE hands, this makes it really difficlut to close and hold shut properly. It&#x27;s also pretty heavy. Aside from that, it really does a pretty good job, especially considering the low price. Now remains to be seen how long it lasts...</li>
            <li> I have another straightener that pulled my hair - had a comb on it. this one has a comb that you can add whenever you want to. I have long hair, so this really helps. It heats up fast, works fast - no sitting there a long time to get each piece straight, it does it on the first try. there are several settings on it too, so you can get it just a little warm to very,very hot by turning the dial to the heat you want. I highly recommend this product to anyone with hard to straighten hair!</li>
            <li> The fifteen year old girl to whom I gave the Conair straightener has hair that reaches her lower back, and it curls tightly.  She has yearned for years for a straightener that would not damage her hair and allow her to wear it in styles hitherto impossible.  The ceramic straightener did all that and more.  It was easy  to use and has made her very happy.  (The styles the hair straightener has made possible also make her appear more mature.)  It was her favorite Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> I have an expensive chi straightener however, the conair cs19jcs works much better and for much less money. My hair comes out great using the product. The only drawback is the handles--they are unusually large and awkward. I&#x27;m not sure how long this product will last, but will enjoy the results in the meantime.</li>
            <li> In 2002, I bought the first hairdresser from CONAIR - hair setter. In fact, I fall in love with it, as it was my best friend since then. I didn&#x27;t know that all their hairdressers will give me as rewarding results until I tried this year three of their products, which are CONAIR CHV26IX, CS19JCS and CD 160DRCS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair dressing has never been as easy. I&#x27;ve tried many from other brands but none worked with me and gave me salon results as CONAIR, I thought the problem was with my curly hair until I tried CONAIR ones. Their products are life saving!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you CONAIR, you&#x27;ve always been my best friend wherever I go.. : )</li>
            <li> ok so my dad bought me this striaghtner a year and a half ago. &lt;br /&gt;at first i was happy with it becasue my hair was striaght, but tehn this strong oder started comming from it and my room started to havve a buringin smell to it every time i turned it on. &lt;br /&gt;my hair gets caught in frequently and  it doesnt always stay on the highest power, even though it says it is, the heat isnt as strong. &lt;br /&gt;also my hair doesnt stay striaght for more then 1 hour after straighting it. &lt;br /&gt;maybe its just the one that i own, but i am not really satisified with this product and if you are looking at it, i recomend spending a little more money to buy a way better quality one that wil actually work. trust me, its worth the few extra dollars.</li>
            <li> I have bought so many of these irons and never had any luck. My step-daughter came to visit and I tried hers and loved it. So when I saw this one for sale I bought it. It works great! My hair will stay straight for several days . I have also noticed that when I do wash my hair and dry it, it drys straighter too. I would recommend this iron to every one!!</li>
            <li> I have had mine for 5 years and it still gets just as hot and works as well as a new one. I purchased this one for a friend at work. She had the $129.00 designer one (I can&#x27;t remember the brand) and it died on her after one year. She loves this one and says it works better than the other one. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent 100&#x27;s on hair straightener&#x27;s, and yes I bought the one over $100!  However, it quit working after a few years, and there went my hard earned money.  So ~ read the reviews here and decided to try this Conair model.  Worth every penny.  My hair looks just as good, and after months of useing this Conair model, my hair is still just as healthy ~ as when I used the one I paid $120. for a few years ago.  It gets hot very fast, has adjustable heat settings, swivel cord is a must have, and it&#x27;s perfect.  Great price, fast shipping, excellent on my hair ~ everyone thinks I paid over $100. for a straightener ~ and i&#x27;m not telling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several different straighteners in the past, but I must say this is the best one I&#x27;ve used to date.  It heats up quickly and won&#x27;t scorch your hair.  It actually left my hair very shiny afterwards.  Also, at $20, it&#x27;s a steal!</li>
            <li> This straightener is awesome. I have very think wavy hair and was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t be able to get the job done. I have used my friends staighteners which were way more expensive and this one does just as good as a job! I was so happy with the results. If you don&#x27;t have a lot of money to spend on a straightener but want great results, this is definately the one to get.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron from Fred&#x27;s for around twenty bucks. It came with a little comb that you insert on the side of the plate, which I LOOOOVED. Not sure if this one comes with a comb or not. Either way, its a great straightener for the price. It glides smoothly over your hair and gets it very straight. I think it works as well as any other straightener. I don&#x27;t know why anyone would complain. It&#x27;s very cheap and does a GREAT job. As of now I&#x27;m using the Remington Wet-to-Straight flat iron. It&#x27;s also a great straightener for a cheap price.</li>
            <li> This product is very good in many ways, it heats up quickly and has an automatic shut-off if you forget to unplug it. The price is right, but since I have a comparison with a more expensive product (I spent $70 on a straightener in the past) I can say that its ceramic plates do not slide as easily over hair as other more expensive models do. With my thick hair, I find the ceramic plates on this model get \\&quot;caught\\&quot; and I have to release and start again. But I would assume with other hair types this product would be excellent. Overall, very good.</li>
            <li> Yes...it heats quickly, straightens your hair, and is priced attractively.  It has one major design flaw however, one that makes me regret having bought it.  The design has a long skinny handle and a much fatter plate head and is heavy and much longer than most straighteners.  Combine the weight with the over-long, unbalanced design and it is impossible to grasp and maneuver easily without having to use two hands...one to grasp the handle and another to hold down the plates.  They even anticipated that you would need to use two hands by placing a halfmoon tab on the ends of the plate heads so you could manually press down on the plates. I have never had any problems with my two previous straighteners but then they were designed as one, (not-as)long rectangular &#x27;stick&#x27;. I also notice that it does not glide smoothly over the hair but sticks, and I suspect again it&#x27;s because of the difficulty in keeping the plates clamped shut.  Maybe my hands are too small, maybe I&#x27;m not strong enough, maybe it&#x27;s just me...but look at the design of this product and all the others pictures on Amazon and you&#x27;ll note the difference.  And that difference makes all the difference in how this product performs.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic straighteners for the price.</li>
            <li> The flat iron has a flawed design. No matter how you angle the flat iron, it still finds a way to pull you hair out.  Because it is not a very expensive model, the ceramic irons are not sealed around the edges, therefore it is very easy to get your hair caught in it when you are trying to straightening your hair.  It also shuts off randomly after 5 minutes or so. Make sure to keep an eye on the lights to ensure it stays on while heating up and while straighting.</li>
            <li> Amazing product-- I&#x27;ve tried using straighteners before, and it either took forever, or they were too difficult to use on my hair (which is very thick).  This straightener feels substantial, but is still easy to use (the metal plates always somehow manage to lay flat against each other, straightening a lot of hair in each stroke), and my hair comes out stick-straight after just one stroke.  It now takes 5 minutes in the morning to straighten my hair, and it&#x27;s a heck of a lot easier than I ever believed it would be.    GREAT product- works perfectly, made with good quality, and will hardly put a dent in your wallet.  Will recommend this to everyone I know!</li>
            <li> So far I have had the straightener for about two weeks, it heats up fast, to a high heat if needed. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with this device. I would recommend this item though if you were in the market of looking for an affordable flat iron that gave you the same quality straightening power of a hot tools, now it doesn&#x27;t get that hot, but it&#x27;s pretty darn close. I have very thick hair and it takes me less then a half hour now to straighten it all.  I gave it four stars just because I wasn&#x27;t blown away by the product, now if it was a singing straightener maybe we&#x27;d be on to something. just kidding.    But  really this is a good product, I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. The straightener works very good, even with my difficult hair. Would recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li> We bought this flat iron because it is dual voltage and we need that for traveling.   That part is fine.  The problem is  that the hinge of the flat iron is close to where you pull your hair through the flat iron.  This causes it to catch and then break hair as you are trying to pull your hair flat.  Not great if you regularly flat iron your hair.</li>
            <li> Well, if you are looking for a cheap straightener- this is it. Unfortunately, it stopped working after the first use. Also, it states that it works in all 120/240v - don&#x27;t plan on it- it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> i was slightly reluctant to buy this straightener after reading several bad reviews, along with some great ones, too. i decided to buy it, because with such a low price, well, who wouldn&#x27;t? so far, i&#x27;ve only used it once, but it was so great, i couldn&#x27;t believe it got a single bad review. it straightened my thick hair perfectly in just a few seconds, and i only had to iron each section of my hair once to get it stick straight. it took less than five minutes total, and my hair feels smooth and soft. this works perfectly! it would make a perfect gift for anyone!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good, yet unexpensive, flat iron and decided to look around the net before having to drive everywhere... Well I came across this one and read all these good reviews about this straightner so I headed out to buy it, got home, and tried it... It worked magic!! Wow - It was great, heated up QUICK and I loved how the small combs work with it. Now I dont have to hold a comb with one hand and iron with the other... I love this and I recommend it to anyone who is looking for good results without spending a lot of money. Try it out for yourself!</li>
            <li> This straightener really does work as well as the $90 one I had before and much better than other irons with similar price tags that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several Conair flat irons over the years.  They last about a year and eventually give out so I buy another.  It&#x27;s cheap so didn&#x27;t bother me all that much.  The last one I had however malfunctioned in a very bad way.  The heating element got so hot is actually singed my hair right off!  Since I&#x27;ve had several of these and know how my hair reacts to different settings this is certainly not user error where the setting was too high.  How hot does it have to get to actually singe hair off?!  Horrible!&lt;br /&gt;After months of trying to recondition my poor hair that didn&#x27;t have to be cut off it&#x27;s worth the expense of a better quality iron to never have this happen again.  Off to better brands which do not include anything made by Conair...</li>
            <li> I have had this iron for over 6  years. It still works great. It leaves my hair perfectly straight with little hassle. I would never pay $100+ for an iron since this one works so great.</li>
            <li> Curly, Frizzy, Thick haired guys/girls read this!!!  I honestly think a majority of those positive comments were from people who have wavy--straight hair.  Straightening your hair with this thing is torture and a waste of time!  My hair burns really quickly, you can see smoke, and it doesn&#x27;t even straighten it enough. My hair after 1- 1 and 1/2 hours still remains with great frizz, poof, and it looks really bad if you have semi-straight hair with noticeable curls in random places..  The good thing about is that it is a 2 in. You don&#x27;t have to section your hair out into 20 + pieces or w/e..But its really only good if you have wavy hair..  By the way..there are HORRIBLE fumes from this straightener after over 2 years of use..It smells like pancakes and then it smells like smoke...ehh not a good idea.</li>
            <li> My hair is so curly, i tried so many things to straighten my hair, i came across this ion and i m so amazed.  Fast heating and my hair is straight and smooth it looks so healthy. Everytime i wanna straighten my hair i just use a heat protector spray to keep my hair healty.   Its the money worth. Price is great the product is great.</li>
            <li> My hair is usually curly so i decided to buy this.  my hair is curly because I live in Florida.  Usually I try to use products such as Aussie and things in it.  Then, after struggling with it i went to the hair stylist and they just went to town on my hair!  I love my hair!  I get so many comments on it.  Thanks Iron Bod Studio!  &amp;lt;&amp;lt; My hair is really curly still which is really hawt now &gt;&gt; I LUVV MY HAIR!!! IT DIDNT EVEN FRIZZ IN FL!!  And that is something.  See, we went to Orlando and it was sooooo much FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  We went to Universal Studios and ALL!!  it was so much fun then we went to Disney which was soo much fun!  We saw \\&quot;The mouse\\&quot;!  LOL.  Yeah.. So then after that we had to come home and i was sad &#x3D;( .  We will be returning to Florida very soon!</li>
            <li> I have almost straight hair, but I was sick of it bein curly AND straight, I used it for the first time one day before school and it took me only 10 minutes, and I have THICK hair! Also, my Mom&#x27;s hair is CURLY and I do mean CUUUUUUUURLY! It took me only about 20 minutes to do hers, and its just as thick as mine, if not more. This product is awesome and is worth the mere wat. 20 dollars, i paid for it! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lauren Finis</li>
            <li> So  I wrote a review awhile ago when I first bought it but after using it only about three times I realized that yes first it straightens it but right after it poofs out again and its not just my hair its definitely the straightener.</li>
            <li> ~~My hairstylist said I&#x27;d never have straight hair unless I spent mega $ on a professional straightener.  Well, she was wrong!  I got this straightener about 6 months ago and I love it!  I have very curly hair that is past my shoulders and I couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth and straight it was after using this straightener.  For once I could actually run my fingers through my hair without running into tangles! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;~~I have very small hands and scrawny little arms and I did not find this straightener bulky/heavy/awkward.  It didn&#x27;t get caught in my hair, heated up quickly and stayed at a constant temperature, and I didn&#x27;t even burn myself (I am super klutzy and was expecting some injuries, haha).  However it does get VERY hot at the highest setting and I found that running my fingers over my hair as I straightened it was not really a good idea. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;~~I&#x27;d never straightened my hair before, but I found that practice and paitence are important... don&#x27;t expect a miracle from just running it over chunks of your hair quickly (like I did the first time, lol).  It takes me about 45 minutes to do my long hair.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;~~I don&#x27;t straighten very often so it is not damaging to my hair, but I can&#x27;t speak for everyday users.  Definitely invest in some good hair products to protect your hair.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this from  Amazon. She&#x27;s very happy with it.  It works on all kinds of voltages, so you can take it around the world.  Sturdy, good quality item.</li>
            <li> Man, is this thing good! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have thick, wavy, hard-to-straighten hair... which also tends to get frizzy when it&#x27;s humid.. I&#x27;ve tried a few straighteners out there, and for the price, this little number is AWESOME! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Heats up quickly and gets the job done in a quarter of the time that it used to take me with other irons. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I just rub on a little heat-protectant serum before using this and my hair stays flat and shiny for a day or two... I HIGHLY recommend it! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Save your money for the other good things in life, and ignore the CHIs and Sedus and get this instead! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener based on the reviews that said it worked great, and it does.  But it is fairly heavy and too big for my medium length hair.  I had previously had a flat iron that did nothing in comparison, and this worked great.  I bought a lighter more expensive one, and I would say that this one still does a better job, though I like have a smaller one for me in particular.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a way to straighten my hair for years, well with this product I finally found it. One thing though, I would not recommend using this straighter on your hair while your hair is even a bit wet or  damp. Let it dry completely. It will only take a total of 10 minutes. Also, when I did put a conditioner on my hair before I did it, it still was kind of fuffy. But when I did my hair after it totally dried and put nothing on it, the product worked beautifully. Well, use your own judgement, but either way, the product works great. I strongly recommend buying this product if you want to straighten your hair.</li>
            <li> I have had this iron for probably 4 years now and it still works perfectly! I don&#x27;t use it too often but everytime I do I get a lot of compliments and people are surprised when I tell them I don&#x27;t use any special products or a ridiculously expensive iron!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in a very humid place and I can be outdoors for hours without worrying about my hair getting ruined after an hour (like with the old-fashioned irons). I have considered getting a CHI but I am wondering if I even need it, because this one does such a good job on my long, thick, wavy hair. I can&#x27;t review other brands because this was the second iron I ever bought (even then it was a bargain probably $29.99) but I definitely recommend it to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money but wants to be happy with the results!</li>
            <li> I received this product in a timely fashion and wrapped it for a Christmas gift.  My daughter opened it and was thrilled.  She used it for less than two weeks before it quit heating up so I will need to purchase her another one--another brand no doubt.</li>
            <li> I received the product in time, good service, and I am so happy with the product is excelent to dry the hair wet or dry and is fast and easy. fully recommended.</li>
            <li> When it comes to beauty products, I have recently learned that when you try to cheap out and cut corners, what you end up with is worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This straightener is highly inexpensive.  I purchased it when I cut my hair short, with every intention of maintaining it straight, at least for the weekends (I have naturally very curly hair.)  This product worked for me for roughly 5 months, but never ideal.  It snagged my hair, the plates were too big for my cut (which can be blamed on my own oversight.)  However, very recently, it gained two heat settings: off and burning my hair off.  No matter what setting on the dial I have it set too (1-25), turbo on or off, it gets hot enough to damage my hair and even burn some off.  I&#x27;ve had to totally alter my cut and style to cover up the missing parts of my hair, and had to shell out money on products to repair the damage (dry, incredibly kinky and irreperable hair that time is not repairing [other than it falling out.])&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is one of my favorite parts of me, and now I am totally floored but the damage done to it by this product.  And yes, I was using a pre-treatment to try and prevent such a thing from occuring, and it still happened on heat setting 1.  I have now thrown this in the garbage and done my proper research on Follica.com to choose the best (and best priced) straightener.  In my opinion, sometimes it&#x27;s well worth it to shell out the extra money for a much much better product that will last you much much longer.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I needed a new iron fast. For the price, it&#x27;s not bad, if you don&#x27;t mind having crunchy hair. The other drawback of this is that it feels so cheap: the plastic handles feel as if they  will break if you press down too hard -- I prefer the Vidal Sassoon ceramic straightener and can&#x27;t wait for the order to come in!</li>
            <li> this straightener is terrible  it burns my hair and makes it frizzy  plus when you turn the heat level to 25, you can smell the burn/smoke  please do not buy it  even if it&#x27;s this cheap, it&#x27;s not worth it</li>
            <li> This is one of thee best straightening irons ever. I&#x27;ve owned about ten different brands &amp; models and have been straightening my hair since the crimper (ran that bad boy right through). I bought this because I often travel and work in Korea. It works like a champ. I even use it over my CHI and FHI when I&#x27;m at home. It&#x27;s great for medium to long hair; run it through ONCE and your hair will be bone straight! It&#x27;s also light weight and easy to use. It&#x27;s a great deal, especially for the price, I am so happy!</li>
            <li> Honestly, I use this to iron collars on my shirts. Faster and easier than a regular iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want hair specs, can&#x27;t help you there.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a friend here in Afghanistan and it works good as advertised at 120V or 220V. Looks nice too.</li>
            <li> I have been using hair straightener for years and on almost daily basis. I used this for a few times and realized that it doesn&#x27;t glide very well as it pulls my hair once in a while.  I have black asian hair medium thickness, and should not be hard to glide down while it irons them. I returned it. :(</li>
            <li> I recently bought this hair straightener for my mother after it got rave reviews from my girlfriend. I have never used this hair straightener (hair is too short, I am a guy, etc.) but the common impression that my mother and girlfriend have given is that this is the best hair straightener anywhere near this price.     In terms of durability, my girlfriend has had this model for over 3 years now, and it looks as good as new whenever she uses and she has never complained.     So in conclusion, two women have said this model gives them the best hair straightening they can get, in the salon or out, and it is very durable. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for the Conair flat iron with the comb attachment as is shown in the picture - DO NOT PURCHASE it here.  You will NOT receive what is pictured.  You will get a \\&quot;new\\&quot; Conair model that DOES NOT have the attachment.  I was looking to replace my old iron that finally died after about 4 years and I loved this unit.  I looked in all my local stores and could not find the exact replacement so I assumed Conair had updated this model when I checked Amazon.com I was delighted as I thought I would get what was pictured but did not - they shipped the same \\&quot;new\\&quot; model that I saw in the stores.  Therefore I am giving a one star review as they did not ship what was pictured (I have returned what they shipped).  If they would have shipped what I wanted I would have given a 5 star as I loved the old model with the comb attachment - :(</li>
            <li> I lived all over Europe for 2 months and never had a problem, you just need a converter plug, but even when I came back to the U.S.A I still prefer it over my other straighteners....Buy it! it is worth the money!</li>
            <li> I initially searched for flat iron with comb attachment  and this product came up.  After reading many reviews i felt that I would take a chance and try this one out. I wanted a straightener with comb attachment because I have very fine curly hair and most flat irons don&#x27;t work we&#x27;ll for my hair type.  The comb attachment would have worked to hold the hair in place as it went through the iron.  But there was no comb. I tried it anyway, but it did not work for me.  I had to return it.</li>
            <li> When I find something I like, I always buy a back-up.  This was a back-up to one I already had.</li>
            <li> This item is a piece of junk. It broke after two uses. And if you have any kind of texture in your hair, it has to be put on the max settings, and even then your hair will only be a ball of frizz. Don&#x27;t buy this product!</li>
            <li> Hey everyone this really does work! You know how with the other straighteners you have to do one strand of hair like 20 times? Well this one did it perfectly the 1st try and it wasnt even on the highest temp.! I&#x27;m not makin this up at all it really wworked great! And im SOOOOO glad i got it before i go  back to school! I hope you all get it! Its the best one out there!</li>
            <li> I am impressed with this product. It heats up quickly and makes my hair look sleek!  I have major problems with flyaways and this flat iron takes care of that, I am very pleased!</li>
            <li> I have had problems with humidity frizzing and curling my hair for years, this straightener totally solved that!  My hair is very delicate and I could never use straighteners before, but this ceramic one is great!!</li>
            <li> My hair used to be straight, but a few years ago, it started to get curly.  Within a few years, it was full of curls and was prone to frizz from rain and humidity.    I tried every shampoo and balm that promised to \\&quot;give me the hair science didn&#x27;t,\\&quot; but had no luck.  I finally decided to get a flat iron.  I chose this one because of the positive reviews on amazon.com, and couldn&#x27;t be more happy with my decision!    The Conair Hair Straightener heats up in 30 seconds and is very quick to staighten my hair.  It takes out all of my curl, and leaves me with soft, smooth, straight hair.  I don&#x27;t even need hairspray to maintain the style - it stays straight all day, even with snow and rain.    I&#x27;ve had this for a few weeks now and can&#x27;t live without it.  I love having straight hair again; my only regret is not getting it sooner!  If you&#x27;re looking for a hair straightener that&#x27;s quick and leaves your hair super silky, pick up the Conair CS19CS!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the honest truth!  I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a reasonably priced way to straighten my hair.  I have naturally CURLY hair, but am blessed enough to be able to get it to straighten with some help.  I usually have to blow dry forever, use some sort of product to smooth it out and then go over and over and over with a straightening iron or big barrel curling iron.  This iron gets my hair silky smooth usually in one swipe, but at most two. I can have my hair looking awesomely straight within ten minutes, whereas it use to take me twenty to thirty.  It also doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling like straw or looking fuzzy afterwards, which is a huge bonus.  I am SO happy to have this iron and even am thinking of buying another one, just in case this one breaks down the road.  You won&#x27;t regret buying this iron!!</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews on this iron, I decided to try it for myself. What a great product. I have never used a straightening iron, but it was so easy. I absolutely love it. It saves me so much time doing my untamed mane compared to a blow dryer. I have naturally curly hair, and it only take about 10 minutes tops to have perfectly straight hair!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my daughters!!! What a great article!!! Before this Ceramic Hair Straightened they where using a hair dryer and it was to noisy and it consume so much more WATS!! The Heat Ceramic Hair Straightened is quieter and faster also their hair are very straight and they look prettier!!</li>
            <li> This hair straightener works very well.  I recommend it, especially for hard to straighten hair.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at how well this product worked for me. My hair is very curly and it would normally take me around 2 hours to straighten because I would have to blow dry it straight then use a straightener. Even after I had worked on it for hours it wouldn&#x27;t be completely straight and any contact with humidity would cause it to frizz up.  &lt;br /&gt;I was so happy when I bought the conair straightener because it made the work so much easier. I was really happy with the size of it. It made the process much faster. Like for example today I woke up and my hair was completely curly. I was able to completely straighten it in a  hour. And I got caught in a drizzle and my hair didn&#x27;t frizz.  I was really happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair straightener back in July and have used it every week since.  It heats fast and actually works, especially compared to non-ceramic straighteners I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  I should note,  however, that my hair is thin and relatively straight with a slight natural wave.  This product is able to take out the wave I can&#x27;t get out by blow drying with a brush.  And, the results seem to last throughout the day.  My only complaint is that it is somewhat awkward to hold and also the \\&quot;on\\&quot; light indicator isn&#x27;t very bright.  I sometimes have to turn the lights out to check to make sure it is on!  Overall, for the price, it is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I&#x27;ve now been using this straightener daily for over five years, and it STILL WORKS just the same as when first purchased in 2005. One key to its longevity may be that I do not put any product on my hair before using it. Also, I have taken relatively good care of it and store it in drawer, but I do admit that I have dropped it a few times!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product!!! I had been using a basic hair straightener by conair for years that never quite did the trick (I have thick, wavy hair that tends to frizz), and this product is 100 times better (being able to adjust the temp really helps)! Do yourself a favor and save tons of money by not buying a more expensive straightener. I actually had borrowed this straightener from a friend before deciding to buy it and it works just as well, if not better, than a $80 straightener another friend of mine owns!!! I never thought my hard-to-manage hair could become so straight! I love it!</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for Christmas and love it! I have used other $40-$50 ones and yes, they work a little better but not much. Save your money and buy this. It is amazing. Also, considering the fact that all together there are only 5 reviews under 3 stars. That is a good sign. I love this and IF it ever breaks I will buy another in a heartbeat!</li>
            <li> This straightener works extremely quickly and extremely well.  I know there is a wide price range for straighteners, and I was at a crossroads of getting something more expensive thinking it would be of better quality.  But I got this straightener instead, just to try the product out.  It works great!   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The straightener heats up quickly, and you have the choice of straightening \\&quot;power\\&quot;, so you don&#x27;t have to fry your hair if it is easily straightened.  It typically straightens my hair with one pass over each section, and my hair stays straight all day (though my hair is pretty straight as is). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is one case where the relatively inexpensive product works great (and maybe even better than the more expensive kinds).</li>
            <li> I bought before one ceramic iron $34.00 and I found this one $19 and it works the same way.</li>
            <li> This straightener is great! If you have thick hair, it&#x27;s a must because it has a special turbo button that makes it extra hot. Also the bigger plates are necessary for thicker hair. I have tried smaller plates, but they just don&#x27;t work with my thick hair. I highly recommend this straightener</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Heats very quickly with adjustable settings. Maintains set temperature.  I plan on using for a trip abroad, will give those results as well. This reliable flat iron worked perfectly overseas.....heat quickly on both currents.  Very sturdy and helpful tool for smoothing very curly hair.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time today and the verdict is: meh. I have thick, wavy, course hair, and it doesn&#x27;t work great. I owned a CHI before which was GREAT. It broke only after a month because it fell off my sink, and because I didn&#x27;t buy it off of their site any limited warranty was void. Please, I implore you, go out and get a CHI or other high-end straightener if you have a lot of hair like me. A lot of people on these reviews are saying that this straightener is just as good as expensive ones. It&#x27;s not, not if you have hair like me. I straightened half of HALF of my hair, and that alone took ten minutes. To do all of my hair would take 30-45 minutes, which was pretty typical of my previous straighteners (CHI took 20-25 minutes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, this straightener is fine, but it&#x27;s JUST a $20 flat iron, so please expect that. It doesn&#x27;t get much hotter than any other flat iron, and the 2\\&quot; plates don&#x27;t add much to the experience. Plus, because of my hair, it was left a little frizzy, but I think using a product before straightening can fix this. My review is this: if you&#x27;ve ever owned a really nice flat iron, you&#x27;ll be disappointed. If not, then you&#x27;ll be happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I have to edit this review because it actually IS better than any other $20 flat iron. I finally sat down and straightened my frizzy, curly hair beginning to end. Verdict: It did take me a very long time to straighten my hair (40 minutes), but if you&#x27;re just relaxing watching TV anyway, not a huge deal. It&#x27;s always taken me this long with other straighteners. What&#x27;s different: The thing that sold me on this is that I straightened my hair 2 days ago, have slept on it, have had it blown around by the wind, have had it in hot AND cold weather (it&#x27;s crazy in IL right now), and it still looks the SAME. I have not had to touch up my hair ONCE since I straightened it on Saturday, and that hasn&#x27;t happened since my CHI. I still want a new CHI to cut straightening time in half, but anyone that has thinner or less wavy hair is really, really gonna love this because it really will only take minutes for them. Blew me away!nyone that has thinner or less wavy hair is really, really gonna love this because it really will only take minutes for them. Blew me away!</li>
            <li> This product DOES NOT come with the comb and brush attachment as decribed. I paid for shipping on an item I literally could have bought across the street at Target.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast, temprature ranges from low, for fine hair, to the highest tempreture for thick and kinky hair. Affordable and arrived a week after my order. Recomended for all hair-types.</li>
            <li> So far, this straightener has been the best I&#x27;ve used to date. My hair is naturally straight, but I have some broken hair that likes to fly out in different directions.  This straightener keeps doesn&#x27;t pull out my hair and it straightens my hair without frying it. I will right another review if I find it works differently in a few months. I would recommend this product. It was better than the 50 dollar hot tool I bought before this one.</li>
            <li> Still working well! I&#x27;ve had this for a few years now.</li>
            <li> gift for my daughter..she loves it.</li>
            <li> Bought because it was dual voltage. But it went kaput after few days using in 220-250V range with 50Hz freq. Not sure if it was a sudden death due voltage surge or a slow death due to few days of 50hz freq..&lt;br /&gt;3 stars because I guess it would have worked for few years in 110V, 60Hz U.S</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and gets very hot.  However it doesnt look anything like the picture.  The handle is one of those V shaped handles that is open at the end ---&amp;lt; and I cant seem to hold it all the way open to grab my hair.  I find it difficult to get any amount of hair in it.  Once I get a little bit of hair in it It snags my hair in the hinge and rips it out.  Also when Im dragging it down my hair I cant go all the way down without it ripping my hair out.</li>
            <li> This iron gets very hot fast. I have thick and wavy hair and it only takes me about 20 minutes to get my hair very straight. It is also very comfortable and easy to hold. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and has a little wave to it, I&#x27;ve tried everything to rid myself of frizzies and to make it straight.  I used my Conair CS19CS straightener and my hair is absolutley beautiful.  I have a layered cut and now you can actually see the layers!!!  I highly recommend this product for people like myself who wants stick straight hair quickly without a lot of hassle.</li>
            <li> I have tried many straighteners before and nothing does the job like this one. I absolutly love it. Heats up in only a few minutes and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I have thick, long hair with a wave in it. I&#x27;ve tried just about everything to straighten it (and I don&#x27;t care how good you are with a brush; straightening your hair with a blow dryer is impossible.) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This thing WORKS. Wow! Heats up fast, glides through your hair like a dream, and the result is impossibly shiny, stick-straight hair! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend this highly enough, esp. for the price. A true bargain!</li>
            <li> I found this product very user friendly, i was able to straighten all my hair in matter of a few minutes, results were instanteous...!!!! i am very pleased</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use and heats up quickly. The plates are smooth and warm the hair very efficiently. It leaves my hair smooth and shiny. Cannnot beat it for the price! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> This straightener is awesome! I have very fine but frizzy hair. This straightens it in no time, plus NO DAMAGE!</li>
            <li> My daughter with very curly hair bought this straightener and loved it while it lasted; it worked really well straightening out her curls. However, after two months it just stopped working. I would expect a hair straightener to last longer than that and do not reccommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought a Conair straightener about 6 years ago, and only used it once because it never got hot and failed miserably at straightening my hair. I decided to buy this straightener based on its high reviews and the fact that I&#x27;m a fan of Conair curling irons. The reviews were accurate. I have long, thick, wavy hair with a mind of its own, and this straightener works like a charm. I set the heat level to 20 (of 25), which is more than hot enough. It heats quickly and stays hot, and only takes about 15 minutes to straighten my hair. The attached comb works great at guiding my hair through the straightener. I can finally have hair that looks like it was professionally straightened. Disregard negative reviews of this straightener - it lives up to its reputation, and is a really good deal.</li>
            <li> This straightener is the best!  I&#x27;ve tried other ConAir flat irons, but this one is the easiest to use.  The 2\\&quot; plates allow you to put a decent amount a hair through and the little plastic teeth help to keep them in place (not to mention you aren&#x27;t constantly brushing your hair!)  I have thick, long, wavy hair and with this straightener I&#x27;m done in 15 minutes!  With other flat irons my hair falls out of the plates and I have to go over the same spot over and over again.  The cool-touch tips are great too, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever burned myself.  I love this one so much, it&#x27;s my second time buying it.  The first lasted about two years, after that it&#x27;ll take a little longer to heat up and the heat doesn&#x27;t stay as consistent.  Well worth the price for me.  I can&#x27;t imagine using any other straightener.  I strongly recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I have very difficult to manage hair but this straightener really helps to keep it under control. The only thing I am upset about is there was no bristle attachment with it. I really wanted to try that.  But it does work really well. I have to put it at the highest setting.  Be careful if you do!  My hair is extremely hot to the touch.  But it seems to tame it, even in the most humid conditions, and that is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I bought this at amazon and i usually braid my hair so i don&#x27;t straighten much. I used it about 5 times or less and had a long 6month streak of braiding my hair. Then i tried to use it and it heated up and shut off by itself. That was the end of the relaxer. I&#x27;d only had it for less than a year and i couldn&#x27;t find the receipt to do anything about it. It&#x27;s kinda made me leary bout buying straightners and while i am serching for one now, i think i&#x27;ll try a different brand. Hopefully, that will last longer.</li>
            <li> for the longest time I have been suffering with trying to duplicate what my hair salonist does with a blow dryer and a hairbrush and I could never do it!  My hair is light, easy to manipulate but reacts to any slight change in the weather.      So a lot of times I&#x27;d go into work with extremely frizzy and/or ugly wavy hair.  But now using this flat iron no more!  Even when it rains or is really humid it doesn&#x27;t get all frizzy!  I love touching my hair during the day now to feel how smooth and silky it feels.    I ordered this one based off of all the great reviews, and it was cheap!  Now I&#x27;m adding my own raving review!  This is a great product, I recommend it to anyone.  It takes some getting used to, but once you know how to handle it, its great!</li>
            <li> I love it...cause has a graduate for the heat, is ceramic and permite precise the temperature, i dont know how straightener can be cause my hair is lise, but for me works just great! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Doesnt get hot enough...</li>
            <li> I used these on my daughter&#x27;s hair and they worked great. Not to hot, just enough heat to press her hair and make manageable.</li>
            <li> I had this on the highest setting (25) and it didn&#x27;t get it as straight as I would have liked. I have 4a-4b hair, really thick and kinky, and though I don&#x27;t typically straighten my hair often, I wanted to try something different. Plus, the hairs can get caught on the plates when you run it through. And like the previous reviewers mentioned, the cord is a bit too short.  I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> It is a good product and all the information set by amazon was the same when I got received the item&lt;br /&gt;the product is original and amazon services was so good</li>
            <li> Totally agree w/ the previous comments written for this product.  Received it as a christmas present from my sister after hearing my constant complaints and frustration with the one I was BARELY USING (which was $30 VS gold-plated straightener that DOES NOTHING BUT BURNS HAIR!) &lt;br /&gt;This flat iron does the job right and there is no hassle about it.  Good features include: &lt;br /&gt;1.  ON/OFF buttons allow you to have it plugged in (unlike some other ones where you have to un-plug the entire unit in order to shut it off)&lt;BR&gt;2.  Wide surface area allows you to get alot done w/ minimal repetition. &lt;BR&gt;3.  Dial to control heat level; heats up quickly</li>
            <li> I have been through a million curling irons.  One problem that I always have is that it is not hot enough.  This iron is PERFECT! It gets very hot and it works great.  You do not have to spend a fortune for a good straighting iron.</li>
            <li> I just bought this straightener tonight (12-18-04), and I have thick hair w/lots of fly-aways! OMG this straightener is so awesome! Only took it one minute to heat all the way up, and it only took me about 10 min. to straighten my hair! It rocks! My hair looks like those in the commercials! Buy this straightener!</li>
            <li> I honestly cannot believe this costs $20. I was skeptical because I have used other ceramic irons that cost $100, $150 and up and this works just as well as they do, if not better. I have never ever been able to get my naturally wavy, thin, damaged hair to ever look like this. In 15 mins I have stick straight hair that is shiny and glossier than ever. Seriously my hair always feels like straw, hay, actually haha but now it feels like the soft, shiny virgin hair of a 6 year old. I may buy a few more of these just in case anything ever happens to this one, its amazing. Don&#x27;t waste your $$ on anything more expensive, this is all you need, trust me.</li>
            <li> I like this straigtener and all, but it doesn&#x27;t really &amp;quot;straigten&amp;quot; my hair. It looks sleeker, and my hair kind of curls in when I use, but not completely straight. It heats up really fast. Which is a good thing sort of, but I really wanted straight hair. It makes your hair look neater. It looks good after I use it, plus it lasts until you take a shower. Over all its good/okay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightener for about 4 months. At first it worked extremely well but after about 2 months it started to become slower at heating up. Now it doesn&#x27;t work at all. It was good at a time but now I wonder why I bought it. If you&#x27;re looking for a new straightener, keep looking. This one&#x27;s cheap and not worth it.</li>
            <li> I used this straightener for the first time with my new Revlon RV484 Ion 1875-Watt Hair Dryer, and I was very impressed with it!  I didnt think I would like the brush attachment but it really helped to capture the hair and guide it through the plates.  With other straighteners the hair would slide around and fall off the straighener, but this wasnt a problem here, in fact it made the whole experience much quicker and effortless.  The plates became hot in seconds, I used it at the highest setting (my hair is a bit difficult to work with) and when I would go over my hair with my hand to smooth it out, I was getting burned!  Thats how hot this straightener gets - you might want to keep it at a lower level unless you have very thick, unruly hair.  I would definitely recommend this iron to anyone!</li>
            <li> Worked for about 8 months then promptly fell apart. I&#x27;m now on the hunt for a new one that lasts at least a year...</li>
            <li> this straightener is great. it heats up extremely quick and straightens really good. it getz extremely hot and does a great job. would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I loved it at the first, it straightens my hair, however it doesn&#x27;t give you the shining smoothy look, it makes my hair very dry. I went to salon, their straightener is much better, it really straightens my hair, and my hair feel so smooth and shining. I am going to get another kind.</li>
            <li> I have that wonderful, wavy-in-the-back-and-underneath-but-straight-on-top hair (I know, lucky me), and I never even thought about using a straightener on it until a hair stylist did it for me once last year. I was amazed.  She told me that, to get the same look, I&#x27;d have to go out and buy a professional straightener for about $100.  Well, I decided to try this one instead and I love it!  I have a lot of hair and I can get it looking smooth and shiny in about 15 minutes.  I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t listen to her!</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this Hair Straightener. I see them in the store for over $100.00 and this does everything that the more expensive ones say they will do.   I am very happy with it and would purchase another one when this one wears out.</li>
            <li> works great on my medium heavy hair..smooth n straightens like a pro..great for the m oney</li>
            <li> This straightener works like magic. I purchased it after using one that belonged to a friend. And another friend of mine has purchased one after using mine. Works for many hair types. My hair is very thick, has medium courseness, and usually dries slightly wavy. One of my friends has thick course hair (she is Chineese). My other friend has very thin and fine hair. It works great for all of us. I prefer not to use it everyday because it can be damaging. However, one of my friends does use it almost every day and it does not appear to have damaged her hair at all.</li>
            <li> My daughters and I have tried several other \\&quot;flat iron\\&quot; straighteners, including other models by Conair, but this is without a doubt THE BEST available. This flat iron is easy to use and efficient. Its design is excellent and, unlike some other Conair models, it does not cause cramping in the hands. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I loved this straightener when I first got it. I thought it was amazing. It lasted for about 5 months and the plates just stopped getting hot. My friend had the straightener and the same thing happened to her.</li>
            <li> It does the job well. my only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t open wide enough. If it did I would have given it 5 stars. Otherwise it straightens hair very nicely.</li>
            <li> This product works really  well. I bought this from amazon when I was visiting USA. I was scared if it will work in India. Biut all it took was a plug point converter and It works just fine :-)</li>
            <li> As I am looking for a new straightener I was surprised to find my current one in the top 5 bestselling. I had read all the reviews and did not want to spend the money on an expensive straightener and settled for this one. I used it a few times and it did the job okay for the price - my hair was relatively straight, although frizzy. However the handle is quite awkward and it didn&#x27;t seem to get very hot. I began using my roommate&#x27;s Chi and was VERY impressed. I used her straightener all of the time and now that we are no longer roommates I think I am going to jump on the bandwagon and spend the money to get a good solid flat iron. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with this straightener (used it maybe 5 times??) but I just found one that is much better.</li>
            <li> works good ans looks like it will last???</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s overall nice, but does not get as hot as I want&lt;br /&gt;my previous ones worked better because they got hot quickly</li>
            <li> When my old straightener broke, I thought I was not going to be able to find one just as good as the old one. However, Conair has created a great product that simply does what is expected. The heat level can be adjusted, it does not over heat and it leaves my hair straight and shinny. It is indeed a great product worth every penny.</li>
            <li> this straightener works great i have bought other straightener that were more expensive that did not work as well heats up fast and is easy to use my teenage daughters who are very picky love this straightener.</li>
            <li> The version we wanted was no longer available, this unit in comparison is not as good but still better than any other we&#x27;ve found</li>
            <li> works great, your hair is soft,, not fried,</li>
            <li> So, I earlier had a Remington straightener which I loved, but as I was travelling to India, I needed a dual voltage straightener which would work there. This was suited to my requirements perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thin, fine, almost straight hair, pretty easy to manage, so I can&#x27;t tell how it works on difficult hair (I&#x27;ll ask my friends and update this if possible). It works pretty good on my hair, although I must say it does not work at the given heat setting (it said for straight hair use setting 10, whereas I got my desired results at 20). I use it for getting my hair to not get tangled easily (which it doesn&#x27;t after using), make it a little neater, and to make it shinier (which it does look after using this!)&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would say this is a good straightener, but the heat is slightly less than what I was expecting. It takes a bit more time than my older one. Also, that one was digital, and had a lock (I miss the lock) and was cheaper so I deducted a poit for this one. But overall, a good purchase! I recommend it.</li>
            <li> The iron heats up fast, which is great, but it dries out my hair, Okay for the price. SPend more on a better iron if you use it often.</li>
            <li> i like this iron tremendously. even at very low heat it can make my hair dead straight and doesn&#x27;t damage my delicate hair.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair. When I was a child it came down in ringlets. I have tried other conair straighteners in the past and even though it did the job it left it frizzy, even  the older model that uses steam. I took a chance and bought this one months ago and let me say IT ROCKS!! for all those with naturally curly hair will know what I mean when I say nothing makes it smooth but this does. Highly recommend it!!!       Update: I have had this for months and love it but I decided to try one of the newer ones with Tourmaline so I got CS31T The infinity ceramic with tourmaline 1\\&quot;..Tried it this morning and its awful. I did a few stands on one side with the infinity and a few strands on the other with the one rated here and the infinity did nothing but frizz even on the highest setting and it was double what the instant heat cost. So don&#x27;t waste your money on a more expensive one. The CS19JCS instant heat is only $20 and works GREAT with silky straight results. Still loving it and going to buy more for back up..</li>
            <li> This works good but I was hoping to find a replacement just like the one I had. The old one had guides to keep your hair on the hot plates where this one is open to the end so the hair falls off the plates too easy. Takes more time to use this product but seems it is the type out there.</li>
            <li> Bought this and it worked perfectly the first time, then after that it decided to not straighten any more. Do not waste your money</li>
            <li> I started having problems with this 4 months in to using it. It would shut off over and over throughout one session. Now about 2 years later it is dead. Wont turn on, its over for sure. So if you want trouble buy this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works really well on my daughters hair. Every morning we start it up and I can immediately start using it as it immediately becomes hot. Love it. Be careful though, it can get so hot, you can burn yourself. I burned my daughters face when I allowed her freshly straightened hair to fall in her face, the hair was very hot. You also cant get to close to your head as it lets out a lot of hot intense heat. I love how fast it is to heat up though. It even has a TURBO button on it for even faster start up, but Ive never used it as it is already very fast. Straightens perfectly. When you first buy this and plug it in, it will have a noticeable smell but the smell burns away and youll notice nothing afterward and never again on any new start ups :)</li>
            <li> I think this is a fantastic product, just as the reviews led me to believe. It worked like a charm without burning me or my hair and the price was fantastic. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m traveling to a 220 volt country in a week therefore need a dual voltage straightener.  So far, I&#x27;ve tried it with my 110 voltage and it works as expected.  Not sure what the purpose of the 25 heat settings is though; I think low, medium, and high would suffice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was shipped to me in a plastic bag with the model number handwritten on a 3x5 index card.  There was no original packaging.  Made me wonder if it was used or refurbished.  If there are special instructions for use with 220 (as there is with hair dryers) I am unaware of it since I did not get any info with the straightener.</li>
            <li> This straightener heats super fast but it does not straighten well at all, I had to go over the same strand over and over and it still wouldn&#x27;t really leave it straight, my hair is naturally wavy but super easy to straighten and i felt like after just one use of this con-air it almost instantly fried the section of the hair i tried to go over. I bought this because I read so many great reviews on it but it is definitely hyped up to be more than it is.</li>
            <li> The item was Just as described. It heats up very fast and is ready in no time. My hair stays straight all day long and it also takes the static out of it. LOVE this item :)Thankyou very much :)</li>
            <li> These were not hot in the least...at best they were warm. I returned them. It&#x27;s too bad, they were super portable. But, they are of no use when your hair dryer is hotter than the straighteners. Move on...keep looking....</li>
            <li> I bought same brand , but with the wet setting from target long time ago, but they dont stock it anymore. I needed a dual voltage one for travelling and that is why i got this one thinking it is the same. But it was very weak, does not heat up properly, no indicator like the other one to tell you it reached the desired temperature and of course no wet setting.  The part above the plates was scratched and sort of color bleached and patchy.  It does not make the hair shine or smooth. Would not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> The only place the plates completely touch is towards the top of the iron.  Therefore, as you start to flatten or curl, your hair slides right out of the iron before you can even flatten or curl.  I gave it a good try for two weeks to see if I just needed better technique.  No such luck.  Useless to me.  I returned it for a refund.</li>
            <li> Works well and was not so expensive.  Just what you want from a hair appliance. I would have liked it to be just a bit less wide.</li>
            <li> straightens my hair so smoothly and silky. i love it.</li>
            <li> i had an expensive flat iron that was great then it died and so did my money :(&lt;br /&gt;so then i went to the store and bought this one based on amazon reviews and it IS GREAT! I would give it 4 stars because it only lasted me 2 yrs then i had to replace it but really for $20 average price who cares - the old one actually still works too but it just got stuck at the closing part you had to push it open and hold it closed with your hands which was a pain ..so i still have that one too - just for an emergency- im a pack rat) but that expensive one from Sally&#x27;s went straight to the trash because it simply stopped heating up - so my $100 was a waste (and my HUGE mistake was not keeping reciepts and boxes) but if i spend $20 every 2 yrs thats fine this product is worth it and it is the ONLY flat iron i can find anywhere with the comb attachment on it that really makes a HUGE difference on my tangly curly hair!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter to bring to Europe since her knock-off CHI only worked in the U.S. Now that we are home I can&#x27;t even tell which iron she is using; they both produce the same results. I wish I had bought this one to begin with!</li>
            <li> I love this hair straightener... got it about 2 1/2 years ago and use it almost daily.  My hair glides smoothly over it, and the coating on the ceramic plates hasn&#x27;t worn off like my previous (non-ceramic) hair straightener.  I like the adjustable heat settings, but it&#x27;s easy to push the dial by mistake and end up with a much hotter (or cooler) setting than you intended.  It heats up fast, too. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, after 2 1/2 years of use, it&#x27;s now getting stuck in the closed position when I use it.  It&#x27;s still usable, but it&#x27;s time for a replacement.  Friends of mine have purchased the $150+ irons and have had theirs wear out faster, so I guess I can&#x27;t complain. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a while now but reading the other reviews made me wonder about mine although mine which still works perfectly fine but I found that this iron was heavy and difficult to use during hot weather. I always had to go over one spot repeatedly in order for it to stay straight and whenever I try to protect my hair from the heat my hair would come out looking very stringy.I&#x27;m 16 with relaxed (permed) hair and whenever I have new growth I try to stay away from the salon for a two weeks by straightening my hair but the iron never got close enough to my roots to make it look totally straight so I would suggest that anyone looking to invest in a straightener should look for one that&#x27;s less \\&quot;clunky.\\&quot; I&#x27;ve looked into the the Andis Ceremic flat iron and I have yet to use it but it looks promising.</li>
            <li> My friends spend almost $100 to receive the same results I did w/less than $20.  If it can tame my hair, it can  help anyone.  My hair looks as good as before I had the kids (we all know what having kids does to your hair)....</li>
            <li> I used a friend&#x27;s $100+ flat iron and was tempted to buy one of my own.  I was skeptical that for less than a third of the price, this Conair flat iron could work as well, but my wallet and I are glad that it did!  The only down side is that this iron is a bulky-sized for handling and traveling.  Otherwise, it works fabulously!</li>
            <li> I have had this straightener for about two years now and it&#x27;s been the best. Yes, the turbo gets VERY hot very quickly, but I have mixed frizzy, curly hair and the first time I straighten I use the turbo. For touch ups I just lower the temp.  I have tried other straighteners but this one is smooth, does the job and doesn&#x27;t break the bank.  Make sure you use a good protective serum for shiny, silky results.</li>
            <li> This was one of the first straighteners I ever purchased - it worked fabulously but eventually the plates had some brown product build-up from my straightening cream and I decided to try something new. I tried many different straighteners and NONE of them worked as well on my extremely thick wavy hair. This is the only straightener I have found that works on my THICK hair. And it works so fast too! I just run it through once and my hair is perfect. The best part is that this straightener is cheaper than most of them out there - (hint - you can find it at Target for $19.99). It is big and bulky which may bother some people but I think it is well worth it for the results it delivers. Those sleek tiny 1 inch straighteners don&#x27;t do anything on my hair! If you have thin short hair, you might not need something this large and powerful, but for us thick wavy hair girls, it is AWESOME.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this iron. I have been using the same one since 2003!!! Daily!! I personally think this does a better job than a CHI. I like that it has wide plates and it glides right through my hair, makes it super shiny. Love the handles, easy to grasp and manuver through my hair quickly. People will say it&#x27;s not as good because the plates are only ceramic plated. It has not damamged my hair at all and it has a wide range of heat settings to accomodate anyone. Buy it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I usually do not style my hair after washing because I am very impatient and hate perspiring from running the hot blow-dryer.  My results from blow-drying with many expensive straightening serums or creams were never totally great, and my hair was still a bit frizzy.  I have thick, long, wavy hair that gets frizzy in the Florida humidity, and blow-drying takes me 20-25 minutes and is so cumbersome.  I would usually wash my hair and throw it back in a ponytail, and styling my own hair became the norm for me only for special occasions- until now.    When I first got the Conair straightener, I washed my hair in the morning, let it air dry, and then later in the evening, I tried the straightener.  It took me only about 6-7 minutes to straighten my hair to be smooth and sleek.  It was so easy!  (I did not find the straightener to be cumbersome at all.  I made sure I brushed my hair to get out any tangles before straightening.)  It&#x27;s been two days since I straightened my hair, and it&#x27;s still smooth and straight, even with the humidity!    I absolutely love this straightener!  It&#x27;s also great for those who want to put finishing smoothness to their hair after blow drying.  It heats up quickly with adjustable heat, the comb helps hold hair tame when straightening, and the results are fantastic!  The Conair Straightener is a must-have for those of you who want beautiful smooth and sleek hair FAST!</li>
            <li> I have purchased two of these and i have bought my sister one also and they all fell apart. None of the three lasted more then 6 months. I would have rather spent the 60 bucks and got one that would have had a warranty and would last longer.</li>
            <li> This product was for my wife and she loves it!  It arrived on time and well boxed, so all in all a good value purchase.</li>
            <li> I have thin naturally curly hair so getting it straight isn&#x27;t the problem - getting rid of the frizz is my problem.  I haven&#x27;t used a straightener in years and I bought this one because of all the great reviews.  It heats up quickly, smooths my hair and removes all the frizz. I have gotten numerous comments on how \\&quot;silky\\&quot; my hair looks.  I found the detachable comb to be more trouble than it was worth.  I liked that it held my hair as it straightened, but it was too hard to get my hair into the straightener with it on.</li>
            <li> I really like the wide width of this iron.  It heats up quickly and gets plenty hot.  I am so glad that it shuts itself off after an hour so I never have to worry if I forget to unplug it.  It has a range of temperatures plus a &amp;#34;turbo&amp;#34; button.  I don&#x27;t have thick, curly hair and use the highest setting so I can&#x27;t comment on if it would work on that type of hair.  I am in Europe right now and it works just fine withe European voltages.  I am very satisfied with this iron, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much fir 20 bucks. But when I used it I was pleasantly surprised! Love it. Works great. I have thick course hair and it smooths it perfectly!</li>
            <li> This is a good little flat iron heats up quickly and can be adjusted. It is too big to create curls with though.</li>
            <li> Works Great. Makes using it so easy. I started off with a way to small one, so I&#x27;m loving it</li>
            <li> This is so cool! i ordered it sep.15 and i got it the next day.I love how it has big plates and how it heats up in 60 sec.It really is worth buying!</li>
            <li> When i first got this product, i was in love with it. It heated up fast and really did a good job. I had finally found a straightener that could make my ringlets pin-straight. After a month it was still heating up wonderfully, but when it hit the 1 1/2 month benchmark it stopped working! The first time it didn&#x27;t work i thought maybe i just forgot to turn it on so i unplugged it and plugged it back in and made sure i turned on both buttons, the turbo and on button which i usually use, and i MADE SURE that they were lit up. Still no luck! I took it to my dad and he said that the heating element had burned up, probably because it was cheaply made. I loved this straightener because it does the job fast, but i would suggest that you not buy it if you would like to save your money. If you are looking for a great straightener, get the Revlon Professional 2&amp;quot; Ceramic Straightener Model RV045C. Does the EXACT SAME job as the conair, but lasts for years.&amp;#60;br /&amp;#62; &amp;#60;br /&amp;#62; But hey, if you want to waste your money feel free to buy the conair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually surprised by the reviewers that said that their product broke down in one or two months.  I&#x27;ve had mine for almost a year and it&#x27;s operation is still outstanding.  Here are the highlights:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Temperature control is perfect.  I have fine but unruly hair so the metal iron I used before singed my hair constantly.  The adjuster really works for this product (not just decoration) and I haven&#x27;t had the problem of burnt hair since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) This heats up fast.  Again with a metal iron it would take 15 minutes to heat up and would consistently cool down making the whole straightening process take an hour.  This takes about 3 minutes to heat up and a minute to reheat.  I straighten my hair in 15 minutes now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3)  Ceramice plates in general are better for your hair.  They won&#x27;t damage it as much and I&#x27;ve found they are more effective also.  My hairstyle will stay all day even in high humidity (provided I have an umbrella).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definately worth your money!!!</li>
            <li> So, here&#x27;s my story.  I have bought the Conair hair straigtener/crimper/waver one before last year.  I used the crimper and waver and they were pretty useful but I hate when my hair is frizzy and awful.  I used the straigtener and it gave me bad results.  I have thin hair by the way, and last Christmas, my aunt gave me a Wigo flat iron.  That flat iron worked pretty well but now it&#x27;s like 6 months old and it stopped working.  Then the other day, I was telling my mom to buy me a new one and she did and she bought this Conair flat iron in a store..  It&#x27;s actually really good.. no frizzes... sleek hair... shiny hair... This is what you want for those girls out there.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair straightener for my sister and she loves it. My sister shares it with our neices and they love it as well. They have their own hair straighteners but they prefer this one.I have tried it myself and it really works. I bought 2 expensive ($100+) professional hair straightener and the conair hair straightener gives the same result.I bought it about a year and half ago and it still works great.</li>
            <li> This is a great iron for the price. I also have another expensive flat iron (by solano) and this one works extremely well in comparison. I&#x27;ve purchased several flat irons from retail outlets (just to have a back-up) and there is no comparison to the Conair. This is by far the best flat iron i&#x27;ve purchased in anywhere near the price range. It gets extremely hot, which in my opinion, is half the battle with straightening hair (especially thick hair with some wave). It does a great job. You won&#x27;t be disappointed if you purchase this.</li>
            <li> This product arrived fast and was in great condition! Works awesome! Straightens even the toughest hair!</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these straighteners for my daughter for Christmas, after reading the favorable reviews from other customers.  She loved the way this worked, and so did my younger daughter who kept taking it from her to use.  Subsequently purchased another one.  It&#x27;s not often you get a product that really works for such an inexpensive price.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because of the many reviews and purchases. I was a little dissapointed about the plastic look of the product when i took it out of the box, but the second i try it...ba-boom! awsome. My friends order one for them inmediatrly after trying mine. I&#x27;m not sure about durability but for the price this one makes an excellent job. Your hair will look super shiny &amp; it only takes about 20 minutes or less to make your hair incredibly straight without blowdrying first. I&#x27;m very happy with my flat iron, no need to spend more in a fancy one...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times since I got it, and thus far, it seems to do the trick (the real test will come this weekend when I flat iron a head full of very long, thick hair), but one complaint I do have is the length of the cord. It&#x27;s extremely short, making it impossible to be too far away from the outlet unless I have an extension cord handy. It also doesn&#x27;t feel particularly sturdy. The one I had before this -also Conair- was heavier and sturdier and it lasted me well over 6 years. I&#x27;ve also noticed that the hair can easily slip free of the panels when ironing, which can be a real pill.</li>
            <li> Very good price and quality product very happy with purchase thank you very much excellent material for easy grip and handling&lt;br /&gt;excellent product</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and gets very hot. My hair is curly, coarse, med length. I love the 2 inch plates, it makes straightening thick hair go much faster. I had to o over each section twice to get it straight. It does a pretty good job. A little bit frizzy still, but nothing I can&#x27;t live with for a 20 dollar straightener. Also, my hair is naturally pretty frizzy.</li>
            <li> This is the best straightener/iron out there! It heats up in under a minute (more like 30 seconds) to the hottest setting and is so wide it takes No time to straighten. Love it!</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a replacement for my wife.  It works just as well as her previous iron, but it is half the price.  She also used it in Europe, and it was fine.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of very thick, wavy/curly hair.  This straigtener warms up quickly, works on the first pass and leaves your hair feeling luxuriously soft and straight.  Works even when the weather is damp and rainy, I highly recommend this item and the price cannot be beat!!</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the other reviews, and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed.  It takes only minutes to straighten my hair and it is soft and shiny afterward.  It heats up quickly (about a minute) and is pretty easy to use.  Good product.</li>
            <li> I bought this item based on reviews and price. i was not disappointed. i have curly thick long hair and it takes alot to get my hair straight. this iron glided right through my hair leaving it no only straight but nice and silky too. i love this straightener and would recommened it to anyone looking for a cheap iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to get a nice flat iron, but couldn&#x27;t afford the fancy salon ones.  My husband bought the 1\\&quot; Conair for me a few years ago and it worked pretty well, but I think my hair was too thick and long to use it anymore.  The smaller one is nicer for thinner hair or touch ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part of me wasn&#x27;t sure about buying this product, but based on all of the good reviews and for the great price, I ordered it.  The first time I used it, I was amazed.  It worked so well and I have thick frizzy hair.  At first I figured, eh my hair will frizz up again when I go outside (lived in WI where it&#x27;s humid).  But even after using it in the morning, going out all day, going to bed and waking up, it was still just as flat as it was when I first did it.  My next test was going out dancing at a club for 5 hours which causes my hair to get super frizzy.  My hair stayed flat all night.  And it doesn&#x27;t take a long time to use.  There is a temp setting that you turn based on what kind of hair you have, and for me with shoulder or just below shoulder length thick hair, it takes me about 10 minutes to use.  I have used it on dyed hair and it seems to not cause any more damage.  I would suggest using a hair product you apply before using the flat iron, just to help protect your hair.  Also you might want to use some kind of shampoo/conditioner designed for heat treated hair or something that puts a lot of moisture into your hair.  I blow dry my hair, dye it, and use this flat iron and my hair seems to be pretty healthy with all I do to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had this product for about a year now and it works just as well as it did when I first bought it.  I now live in WA and even with all the rain it works great for the most part.  Yeah, if my hair gets too wet from the rain then it does frizz up, but that happens after a shower too.  But for the most part, I love this flat iron and it still surprises me sometimes at how well it works.  Now I can have more modern hairstyles and look more professional at work.  This flat iron works so well especially for the cost.fessional at work.  This flat iron works so well especially for the cost.</li>
            <li> No what I expected !! Cord is too limited and is hard to flat iron long hair. I guess it was a ok buy!</li>
            <li> Purchased for my very picky 15 year old daughter and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Growing up i always heard how great conair products were for people with hair like mine, and i never thought to question it. When i got old enouhh and had my kwn money to buy a flat iron, i chose this one. But i noticed it never worked well. Even at the max heat setting, always on turbo, it takes at least three hours to straighten my hair and even then it is still curly. It also makes my hair look very dry, it does not make it look &amp;#34;sleek and shiny&amp;#34;. I know the flat iron is the problem because when i pay to have someone else do it, it comes out very smooth, soft, and shiny. It is probably a great flat iron for people who do not have very thick frizzy naturally curly hair. Im glad it was only $20.  EDIT: Looked it up curious how high the heat goes on this thing, and realized my review didn&#x27;t really say anything about why I felt it wasn&#x27;t good enough for me.  It probably is a great flat iron for most people. It&#x27;s not that bad for me, but it doesn&#x27;t fully get the job done, and that&#x27;s largely in part because of my hair type. I just managed to do it today in an hour and 40 minutes as a rushed job. And it still has curls in it. Professionally it often takes 2-3 hours. They shortened the time now though by having 2-3 people work on it at the same time lol That&#x27;s on turbo setting and 25.</li>
            <li> Good quality. I love the color as well and it heats up really quick.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good. Cannot use on wet hair. Which is fine.</li>
            <li> This product is NO good!! Disappointed</li>
            <li> This purchase was the best I have honestly ever made. I love the size of it and it goes really hot and has a turbo mode on top of that. The 60 minute turn-off feature saved me so many times from when i forgot to turn it off. If you use hair protector spray, the edges of the heated part may get a little brown, but you can wipe it off. Its been working for over a year now :)</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my persnickety daughter and it works well for her. She said it is a little difficult to use the handle or something, but it does the job and was priced right and had dual voltage that she needed in her travels outside USA so she did not have to buy and carry a costly bulky converter.</li>
            <li> I have been using Conair flat irons for years. I straighten my hair, non-chemically, so I typically use more than one flat iron. This, however, is one of my staples. I was unsure as to how I would like it since I had an older model. This model is a sleeker version that has been reconstructed seemingly to hold the plates in better. The older model would break relatively easily if you ever accidentally dropped it. I cannot honestly say if I think it works better than the older model, because I prefer the older model better, sans the issue with the plates. I do appreciate the fact that this model doesn&#x27;t grab your hair like the older model. Maybe I need to kick the temperature up a bit. But it is a nice flat iron, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Very price reasonable and great product. Instantly heats up and works on the hair. I would recommend this product highly!!</li>
            <li> Had to return this unit, I dont feel like it worked very well on my thick hair. The unit is very flimsy, it actually pulled my hair out while straightening, I think it got wrapped around the little screws or something. Makes my hair smell burnt :( Not happy with it</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!!! I hate the thin flat irons cause my hair is thick but with this one it is way much easier :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, not that great for thick hair like mine.  But heats up fast although makes hair a bit dry.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t meet my expectations. It doesn&#x27;t straighten hair well. I understand now why it was so cheap. I don&#x27;t recommend it!</li>
            <li> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR A 5 STAR CUSTOMER SERVICE. I COULD NOT BELEIVE I RECEIVED MY ORDER ON A SUNDAY AS PROMISED. I REALLY LOVE THIS FLAT IRON, IT&#x27;S GOOD QUALITY. I AM SO VERY PLEASED.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR REALLY GREAT SERVICE IN EVERY ASPECT. I ORDERED ON FRIDAY AND RECEIVED SUNDAY. WOW....&lt;br /&gt;BETTY</li>
            <li> One thing i did like very much was that it turns on really fast and has an option for &#x27;turbo&#x27;. otherwise the handle is really too hot which i have to use a glove specially made for hot irons and hot curlers. i have to go over my hair with the flat iron several times and still will not get straightened. my hair for the most part flat/ straight but during this time of year i get very very little frizz. i do not recommend this flat iron. i&#x27;m saving up to buy another one from a different maker.</li>
            <li> Its been over a year though I don&#x27;t use this that often. My hair doesnt get stuck anywhere and gets hot pretty fast</li>
            <li> Works well so far. I&#x27;ve fallen asleep with wet hair, and have woken up to my hair in much disarray. This flat iron works well in straightening out the uneven waves caused by sleeping with wet hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well on thick, curly hair. Didn&#x27;t use it in Europe yet.</li>
            <li> Works great. I needed a 2nd flat iron for a trip, and always liked my other Conair appliances. I went with the wider model, and like it better than the smaller one I&#x27;ve been using at home.</li>
            <li> I like this straightener cause the plate is really thick and smooth. Bought it cause it worked overseas. Worked like a charm. Very happy!</li>
            <li> This Flat Iron is poorly made. It does not get a good grip onto your hair, hair is still somewhat frizzy after going over hair twice and its very bulky looking and says it gets to 450 degrees on the highest setting which I highly doubt it does. It does get hot pretty fast but could be better. I guess you  get what you paid for. My old $10 flat Iron works much better than this cheap Flat Iron. If you have thick hair don&#x27;t purchase this iron.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my wife to use on a trip. She won&#x27;t use it. The squeeze handles are flexible and don&#x27;t allow her to put enough pressure on her hair, they just bend instead. Found a Revlon dual voltage from another supplier that works great.</li>
            <li> OMG! this item is probably the best thing you could ever get! i have super wavy and thick hair, and with one stroke, my hair was flat, shiny, and smooth! it heats up within a minute which is awesome in cause you&#x27;re in a hurry...i&#x27;m just speechless...if you want a straightener, GET THIS ONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1</li>
            <li> I love this straightener! I live in Vegas and I cant find this in any of the stores nearby. So i bought one that cost me $60 at some beauty store. Lets just say i took it right back. The heat is perfect for my hair type and i get so many compliments on my hair. It makes it so shiny and smooth! Never will i use any other straightener. :)</li>
            <li> Serves me for 2 years already, traveled with me a lot, and never disappointed! My hair are curly and very very airy-fluffy. This straightener doesn&#x27;t of course give you salon effect, it&#x27;s weaker, but definitely gives you a more cared look, shiny hair.&lt;br /&gt;The biggest advantage I must say is the option to turn off automatically after 60 minutes. It saved my time (and probably the apartment as well) once when I forgot to turn it off and commuted to work which is 1.5 hours away from my apartment!</li>
            <li> Got really really hot when I first bought it, and over time it lost a lot of heat to the point it didn&#x27;t straighten very well. And also, it snags/pulls some strands at the edge. What do you expect for a cheap straightener??? Did what it was supposed to do. Probably won&#x27;t last more than a year, but neither did my $100 Chi straightener!</li>
            <li> Conair Ceramic Instant Heat 2&amp;#34; Straightener</li>
            <li> all good, I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product is marked thanks</li>
            <li> What a useless piece of junk. It won&#x27;t even hold a charge for a week unused. Don&#x27;t waste your money on one of these. Wish I hadn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Pretty hard to use it without having your hair pulled out</li>
            <li> it is a great product the cord is too short by a foot or two. Think of a woman using this come on man</li>
            <li> If girls want to look fancy and with style, I recommend to buy this product for your hair. Good quality</li>
            <li> we have been using it for 3 years now and it is working great. I got this awesome product for $20 bucks back in 2011</li>
            <li> Conair Instant Heat Dual Voltage Flat Iron 2&amp;#34; Ceramic Straightener CS19VCSR...gift for a teen who love it. word word word</li>
            <li> I purchased this straighter because of the comb attachment (I had an identical one from amazon 2 years ago but I dropped it and it broke) - it is the only kind that works for my very thick hair. When it arrived there was no comb - I will be returning it.</li>
            <li> I had mine exactly 3 years when it stopped heating the plates. The light would turn on, but the plates would stay cold, so I think it has something to do with the wiring. It happened when I took it on vacation, so it might have something to do with twisting and wrapping the cord around the handle (but what else are you supposed to do with it?)    On the plus side, it&#x27;s SUPER CHEAP, and it made my hair super straight and smooth. I like it much better than my friends&#x27; Sedu or Chi. I also like the scissor handles... I felt like it gave me more leverage to squeeze the plates together. It heated up in less than 30 seconds, and it held up through 3 years of a lot of travel and abuse. So for that reason, I&#x27;m going to buy it again... and maybe be a little more careful with it!</li>
            <li> This hair straightener is very easy to use. Plug it in, push button to turn on and when it&#x27;s hot enough the blinking light goes solid. Did a decent job of straightening my hair. Only complaint is the size and that is only because I have very long hair. It took forever to straighten.</li>
            <li> This is a mediocre straightener...I ordered it to take on a trip to Europe and needed one that would work in both US/European plugs and wanted one that was small and light. This one isn&#x27;t as small as I expected and it didn&#x27;t work as well as my home unit (Sedu brand). I didn&#x27;t expect it to match the much higher quality Sedu but thought it would be sufficient for travel. However, it not only didn&#x27;t do as good a job at straightening, but there was an acrid faint burning odor when in use. Also something could be heard rattling around inside when the unit is turned in certain ways - almost sounds like a piece of plastic is broken off inside. I regret buying this unit and should have just taken my home unit with me. I will stick this one in the guest bathroom vanity in case someone needs an emergency straightener but I won&#x27;t use it again myself. If I hadn&#x27;t had to hack the plastic enclosure into pieces to get the straightener out I would have returned it. t would not recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I wanted the straightner&#x27;s for my holiday in the states ( visit most years due to family), knew nothing about Conair when I ordered them and have to admit for the price didn&#x27;t think they would be to hot, but what a fantastic surprise.  They are great to use, and just as good if not better as they have fat paddles compared to my others here in the UK.  Since returning home have been looking in UK and sadly not found them here.  Thanks for a great item would recommend.</li>
            <li> Very nice for the price!</li>
            <li> Like the size of the plate!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, love the large plates, so I&#x27;m able to do more of my long hair at a time.  Worth the money, I don&#x27;t use a straightener very often so I didn&#x27;t want to pay a lot.</li>
            <li> This is the best straightener on the market. I&#x27;ve tried HAI, but because I have thick hair, it took forever because it only straightened small sections at a time. In addition, HAI&#x27;s plates were tiny. This is a great straightener for thick and/or coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Very good. I bought it more than a year ago and use it at home and traveling in Europe. It woks perfectly in both voltages.</li>
            <li> The pictured flat iron, with comb attachment, is the greatest flat iron EVER. However, THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU WILL RECEIVE!! They are subbing a worthless flat iron without a comb attachment... same as you could pick up at any CVS or Target for $17. It is useless... absolutely will not work. Hoping they will not make me pay return shipping for what is clearly, even in basic appearance, unrelated to what I purchased.</li>
            <li> All good, works great for shorter hair</li>
            <li> Good device.  It does shut off unexpectedly in the middle of use,&lt;br /&gt;so be careful to watch for the light.</li>
            <li> The niece was going overseas and concerned about the different power plugs and power output.  This product works great here in the US and in Coventry UK.  She loves it!</li>
            <li> This product is okayy.. I mean it doesnt work like PERFECTLY but its not that bad either. IT works but not as well as other straightners i&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> Straightens my hair well, I just feel like it dries my hair out more than my Chi iron ever did. This is still a decent iron.</li>
            <li> So I am on my fourth or so hair straightener from Conair.  Some people would tell me to switch to a Chi or some other high end brand, but honestly, the $24.99 Conair works better than the $69.99 &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; one.  While I love the wider plates, I really miss the old model of this, where it had the comb attached to one of the plates.  I would get a much smoother, and quicker, go of my hair, but with this one I have to use one hand to hold the straightener and another to hold a comb underneath so I can keep the hair in.  I find that if I don&#x27;t use the comb, my hair will constantly fall out of the super smooth plates.  While I really really wish that Conair would go back to the built in combs, I am able to straighten my hair quicker than the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price! This is the best straightener I have had in years! It gets very hot, and fast!</li>
            <li> This may be a good hot iron for people with slightly wavy hair but my hair is extremely curly at the roots. I used it for less than two weeks and noticed my hair was extremely dry and i had a lot of fly aways.</li>
            <li> It was delivered quickly and works really well. It straightens my hair pretty fast. There is also a turbo boost to get it even hotter, but I don&#x27;t use it. It gets hot enough without the turbo.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time on expensive straigteners - this is the one you need. With the attached comb that untangles hair as you glide the straigtener through, you get the smoothest look possible without paying an arm in a leg. This little guy gets super hot and is the most effective tool I&#x27;ve ever used. I actually returned a CHI one time in lieu of this Conair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Conair Flat Iron for 7 years.  My first Conair Flat iron broke after 6 years due to accidentally dropping it.  This flat iron does the job.  It heats up fast, light weight and even works well when I travel outside of the US.  No need to buy an adapter.  This model is duel voltage. Note!  When using it overseas on 220 it heats up much faster. You will NOT want to keep it unattended.  Nice iron for the price.  The results are great.</li>
            <li> This Flat Iron Is Everything Lol I Love The Fact That I Can Get To My Roots Without Burning Myself</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!!!  Works great, even on my incredibly thick hair.  And it heats up in less than 5 minutes!</li>
            <li> excellent product arrived very quickly and is of good quality.E probe and had very good experience with it. I recommend</li>
            <li> I am not a big fan of this straightener (my multiple Remington straighteners are much more efficient for comparable price), however it is my go to when traveling abroad since it has the dual voltage function. It is one of few flat irons which has this capability, and it&#x27;s cheap, making it perfect for international travel. It does not get super hot as I am used to(my others go up to 410 and I use the 390 setting) and I found it hard to get my hair as straight as I like. There is also no locking mechanism, which would have given it one more star.  Overall, good for international travel. Would not recommend for daily use, or for use on thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> Heats up very fast and works great with straightening Indian Remy Hair wavy to curly without any problem using the heat setting of 25 with the turbo setting.</li>
            <li> This item heats up very fast. Very easy to handle.  I like this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! It straightens your hair magically!</li>
            <li> I was trying everything to manage my frizzy out of control hair.  Even now after I wash my hair it looks damaged and dry.  But as soon as I put my ceramic flat iron to it the trasformation is amazing.  It looks sleek, silky, and has a healthy shine.  I let my hair dry naturally and then take the iron to it.  Best one I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve tried a few.  It works just as good if not better than the rediculously expensive one the lady that cuts my hair has.  Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> The Conair Instant Heat Flat Iron is the first flat iron I have ever bought.  I was a little hesitant because I come from the old days of burnt hair from curling and crimping irons. Well times and technology have changed and  I must say I LOVE THIS FLAT IRON!  I have medium to thick slightly wavy hair that has only ever looked good after coming out of the hair salon after a $$$$cut and blow out.  My hair is amazingly shiny and pin straight from using this iron. You can now see what my hair really looks like: shiny and soft with layers. I use it at about a 15 setting and I am never dissapointed from the results. I like the attachable comb(leaves a neat combed section) and the width of the iron. It lets you cover more ground quicker.I have alot of friends that have spent over $100 on a salon quality flat iron.  They cannot believe what I tell them I have spent on mine from Wal-Mart.  I dont know how long it will last Ive had a it about 2 months but for the price and the results Ive gotten so far its definitely worth it.Even if I have to buy one again down the road.</li>
            <li> Wow!! this straightner works very good. I have had this straightner for about a year and it has never gaven up! It works so well, and heats up very quickly. Once I got it, all my friends got one and they all agreed on how good it was. It is a good straightner and has a really good price. I would highly recomend it!</li>
            <li> I believe that any product works great if you take the time to use it correctly. It&#x27;s neither especially great, nor especially bad. It straightens hair. It does get nice and hot quickly though!</li>
            <li> I read several reviews on amazon.com before deciding which straightening iron to buy. I had considered paying over $100 for some that were \\&quot;recommended by professionals\\&quot; but, after coming to my senses, I decided to put my faith in fellow reviewers who liked this product. Believe me, they weren&#x27;t kidding! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was particularly excited to see how tight of a grip the plates could get around my hair while the smooth ceramic surface prevents snagging and breakage-- my hair just slid right through perfectly. I couldn&#x27;t believe what a difference it made in the way my hair looked-- so shiny and smooth. I wore my hair down yesterday, after \\&quot;straightening\\&quot; it with a big-barrel curling iron, then today after using the Conair straightener-- first thing this morning, my boss said \\&quot;your hair looks so nice!\\&quot; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Obviously, I can&#x27;t speak to the longevity of the product, but I&#x27;d feel a lot better about needing to replace a $20 straightener vs. a $100+ one. Those expensive irons must either be magic or overrated, because this affordable one is amazing!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after reading other reviews and I have not been disappointed.  It straightens hair beautifully and the comb attachment keeps hair from tangling as you slide it down the length of hair.  I don&#x27;t have to re-straighten it to make sure it is done correctly.  And I have used it on my 12 year old daughter with no complaints from hair pulling.  She is a real tender-head too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the fact that it heats up instantly.  No long waiting for it to warm up...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will be very pleased with this hair straightener, price + quality &#x3D; the perfect bargain!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe I haven&#x27;t reviewed this before as I love it.  It&#x27;s ideal for my short hair, but I&#x27;d use it frequently for touch ups when my hair was longer.  Can also be used  in europe-another big plus.</li>
            <li> Fast heat. Straight hair in minutes. Hated the curly bottoms of my hair, now I need a couple of minutes to get the hair I love before leaving for work or party.</li>
            <li> GF ordered it. I don&#x27;t use it myself. All I can say that she keeps her hair straight now. I like that, so 5 stars. I don&#x27;t know anything more about it.</li>
            <li> bought for 13 yo - didn&#x27;t heat up to full temperature and frustrated her (not what you want in the morning) ,  returned for refund.</li>
            <li> My hair used to be waving and unruly, but after I used this straightener the difference was amazing!&lt;br /&gt;It also suprisingly, made my hair appear silkier and softer.&lt;br /&gt;My friend who has insanely curly hair tried this straightener, and her hair was straighter than it had ever been!  She even had her own $100 professional straightener that was hardly as good as this one.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give this item 6 stars if I could and I recommend it for everyone! :)</li>
            <li> Can this hot iron be used on wet or dry hair or it makes no difference ?</li>
            <li> I have used my last conair straightener for about 6 years and LOVED it. This one is terrible. Its made out of the cheapest plastic and takes twice as long to straighten my hair. Bummed at such bad craftsmanship.</li>
            <li> i love this product! its so.. inexpensive and also does a great job! i&#x27;ve this thin delicate hair,i used the least temperature setting on it,and my hair has been straight n shinier since 5 days! Easy to use and works wonders on all types of hair!!</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive and works great heats up very very fast which is a great plus when you are a mom of five and don&#x27;t have much time to cater to yourself.</li>
            <li> For those of us with thick curly hair this is a must have!  And for the price you just can&#x27;t beat it.  I&#x27;ve tried the more expensive smaller models and they are not worth it.  With the Conair I only have to go over a section once and it is straight and since the pads are larger I can do my hair in half the time.  I&#x27;ve already recommended it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> I have a natural wave in my hair.  My hair is extra thick too.  Never in my life have i been able to get my hair soooo stick straight! This baby is awesome and I think it would rank right up there with those expensive flat irons.  The iron heats up fast and works very well.  This is the straightest I&#x27;ve ever been able to get my hair. I got so many compliments on it the very first day!</li>
            <li> For the price, I guess I couldn&#x27;t expect much more than what I got out of this iron.  It doesn&#x27;t take long to heat up, but it does take a while to straighten my hair.  I often have to go over the same section of hair 5 or 6 times to get it iron-straight. For someone with very curly hair, it takes a long time to straighten.  I&#x27;ve seen better hair straighteners, but usually at a much higher cost so I can&#x27;t complain too much about this one.  My sister has wavyish hair, and she is able to use this straightener to straighten her hair in about 10 minutes, so I guess it really just depends on your hair type.</li>
            <li> This product works really well even on my thick and curly hair, I was pleasantly suprised... until this week it BROKE. It just stopped heating up while I was using it :(. Now I have to get a new one, this iron is not worth the stress of replacing it every 3 months. Get something a little more expensive and durable</li>
            <li> Bought this because of the high reviews here on Amazon, but it pulls my hair so I am sending it back.  Disappointed!!</li>
            <li> The product itself does exactly what it&#x27;s designed to do. The heat settings are nice, though I find myself accidentally turning it up while straightening my hair because of the placement of the dial. I have very straight hair as it is, but I wanted something that would smooth it out after blow drying, and this does a great job. If I were to purchase again I would get the 1\\&quot; [or whatever the smaller one is] size because this is a bit too big for my shoulder length hair. I may find it more useful once my hair gets longer again.    Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone that has a decent amount of hair and it seems like it would work for all hair types with how high you can get the heat.</li>
            <li> I havent used it yet but it looks exactly like the picture....should not be the best but not the worst either! You get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> Works great! Does the straightening job quick.  I don&#x27;t like handle design--it&#x27;s curved and makes it hard to turn under the ends.</li>
            <li> Much more expensive straightners can be found, but this one meets my needs quite well.  It heats quickly yet the exterior surface doesn&#x27;t burn my hand.  I like how it is slightly curved as well, so I can grab hair closer to my head  more easily.</li>
            <li> My 14 year old daughter loves this.</li>
            <li> Works great. Quick to heat up and it takes less than 5 minutes to do my hair. Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Love this straightener! Left my hair soft, smooth, and shiny. Heats up fast to a great temperature. Extra long cord and 2 year warranty! Be sure to register it online. An amazing replacement for my broken GHD!</li>
            <li> I bought this item to use while on holiday in Europe.  I bought it specifically because it was advertised as a Dual Voltage straightener.  I know a lot of items will work on 120/240 volts, but I didn&#x27;t want to bring my expensive straightener from home and have it break while in my suitcase or accidentally get fried while trying to plug it into the adapter and foreign outlets!  Great product for the price!</li>
            <li> I had brought it for a cousin in India, and probably due to the diff in voltage out there, I didnt find it as good as I expected it to be. It is just an average product and the straightened hair does not last long.</li>
            <li> I ordered two of them for my cousins..great one for a reduced price..its been a year and its still working well...</li>
            <li> This is a not bad iron. The only thing that is frustrating is that after a few passes, the iron cools, and it needs to reheat itself to achieve optimal straightening.</li>
            <li> As a dual voltage product for travel it works fine, but the way it was designed make the plates stick to my hair and pulled some out.</li>
            <li> I mistakenly purchased this based on the positive reviews here. I \\&quot;thought\\&quot; I needed a dual voltage iron to do my hair for a long stay in the UK. I have long, thick, wavy hair that normally presses nicely. I liked the size of the iron, as I thought it would speed up my styling time while overseas. First warning sign: this product arrived in a plastic bag. No box. No instructions. I chalked that up to Amazon saving money or something. I took it with me to the UK and the one and only time I used it, with a plug adapter (not voltage, since it&#x27;s supposed to be dual voltage) it destroyed my hair. I mean it snagged, ripped, broke and burned my hair--there were shard-like strands everywhere and it hurt to try to pull it through--and this was used with good professional protective product. Normally I use a HAI with the highest heat setting, so I know this iron wasn&#x27;t too hot--since it wasn&#x27;t even straightening my hair. I had to stop using it halfway through and toss my hair up into a pony tail. Later that week, I picked up a proper UK ceramic/tourmaline iron for less than 20 GBP at Boots that worked great during my time there. It&#x27;s not even worth the bother to buy this, if you were only planning to use it abroad. Just buy one when you get there--you know it will work.</li>
            <li> After using very expensive straighteners I decided to give this one a try. I absolutely love it. Leaves my long hair straight, shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother for a Christmas present and it died within 2 months.  You get what you pay for.  Avoid this product.</li>
            <li> Heats up very fast!! Doesn&#x27;t make my hair frizzy and give a very nice shine!!! I plan on getting one for my sister for her birthday in a few months!!</li>
            <li> Great price, great product. Money well spent.</li>
            <li> So far I really like this flat iron.  I have used it off and on for several months now.  It does a great job straightening hair.&lt;br /&gt;Update we have bought two more for our girls for Christmas. Would recommend and would buy again</li>
            <li> This is so easy to use to accomplish the straightening of my hair.  And it is compact enough for travel!!</li>
            <li> Great for travel , used in England  for 2 weeks with a converter plug Then use it at home.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s older straightener was on it&#x27;s last leg so we looked around and found this one. She likes the adjustable temps and the wider plates.  A great value and a happy wife... who could ask for more?</li>
            <li> multi - heat levels, dual voltage, I find it efficient for my short hair, it doesnt take time and effeort to get my hair done.</li>
            <li> Great flat-iron for the money.  Works as stated.  I have medium textured hair that is wavy, and this works well.  I do have to use the &amp;#34;turbo heat&amp;#34; function to get it completely board strait.</li>
            <li> Is an ok product to travel i guess but sometimes when you buy things like this and you start flat ironing your hair you feel your hair getting pull, this is one of the flat irons that would do that</li>
            <li> I love this. Glad I bought it, it makes my hair so smooth along with the Kertain smooth products, it is awesome.</li>
            <li> Conair at the end of the day, the best hair stylist products at affordable price. Recommended 100% easy to handle and to store.</li>
            <li> Great product, heats up quick and works better than all the others I&#x27;ve tried. would totally recommend!</li>
            <li> good to seal mylar bags</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY. Broke after one use and won&#x27;t turn on</li>
            <li> All hair appliances should be dual voltage!  This is perfect for my wife when we travel!  Great quality, she loves it.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 2 of these and my first one stopped heating a few days after i bought it. Im not sure why or how, but i thought that it was just  a defect in that one straightener. The second conair straightener i bought heated well for the first few months, but then started shutting down while i was in the middle of straightening my hair. It would randomly turn itself off. Also, when the straightener does heat, it is not nearly hot enough.</li>
            <li> So worth buying this dual voltage flat iron for international travel. I used this in Ireland and London and didn&#x27;t need a power converter. Several other girls I was with used a standard U.S. flat iron with a converter and it blew their iron out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel the plates heat up as much as they should, and the teeth on the detachable comb are too widely spaced for thick or curly hair.  But the product will likely work well on tresses that are merely wavy or already on the straight side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think this is a good buy for the money (very inexpensive), but this particular Conair simply won&#x27;t make curly hair STRAIGHT . . . only STRAIGHTER.  Having said all this, there are other Conairs on the market suited well to curls.</li>
            <li> The cord is too short and it does not work as well as other straighteners I&#x27;ve had.  i guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Good straightener. Probably best with very long hair that is straighter at the scalp. I found it hard to get close to my scalp which isn&#x27;t a problem if your hair isn&#x27;t super curly right at the scalp. I like that there are multiple heat settings. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but so far so good. I haven&#x27;t noticed any damage to my hair using this straightener along with Tressume Thermal Heat Tamer spray.</li>
            <li> I bought this one for my wife and she really like it.</li>
            <li> I bought this iron for a trip overseas since my usual flat iron (Remington Wet2Straight) isn&#x27;t dual voltage and I burned one out the last time I tried to use it in Europe with a transformer. I&#x27;m South Asian with very thick, coarse, curly hair and this iron just didn&#x27;t get hot enough to fully straighten it out. It took over an hour to get through a first pass of my (completely dry) hair and the results were not satisfactory given the time invested. It got my hair straight-ish but there were still crimps and it just generally wasn&#x27;t as sleek as I normally get it with the Remington. If I tucked my hair behind my ear there would almost immediately be a sharp bend that I&#x27;d have to iron out again. All in all, this is probably fine for the average person but it just isn&#x27;t up to the job for extra stubborn curls. If you have coarse or thick hair I would look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I like this product and the best thing about it is, it actually generates less heat and create a less damage to my hair</li>
            <li> I bought this because I need a dual voltage straightener to take to Eurpoe.  It works really well and does a good job straightening my frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Fantastic straightener. Best I&#x27;ve found for the price</li>
            <li> There is nothing to say bad about this straightener. I bought it being it&#x27;s Dual Voltage so my wife could use it on our european vacation. It worked in every country.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, I think it would work well on any type of hair because it has many different temperatures as well as a turbo function. Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> this iron burned my head so I sent it back for a refund. which, of course Amazon did promptly</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter who has naturally wavy hair... Not curly...wavy. She said it does wrk but she has to use it on the highest setting</li>
            <li> I got this hair straightner because of its dual voltage feature. Im from New York but I will be going to amsterdam next week and I want to be able to straighten my hair. Ive used it here in the US and it works great. I like the bigger irons. I don&#x27;t need to set it very high either :)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve had curling irons and flat irons get fried when I&#x27;m overseas, even with the power converter. This little gem has been over to europe several times without issue. I purchased it in August of 2013 and use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Barely gets hot, doesn&#x27;t work very well at all. I would spend the extra $10 and get the Remington salon grade.</li>
            <li> i love this flat iron. it does what it claims to do. the price was great also. my curling iron I thought could b used to straighten by not curling hair around it but doesn&#x27;t straighten. my curling iron comes on when u plug it in but this product has an on/off setting &amp; I keep forgetting to turn it on (stupid I know)! it also has a good feature that if u forget to turn it off it automatically shuts off.</li>
            <li> I have a-little-past-shoulder-length, curly, blond hair.  I have bought numerous straighteners to try to make it straight, and this is the only one that has truly worked.  It stays straight when it is humid, and it has these neat combs that attach to it.  The boar bristle one makes hair shiny and the comb untangles hair for the fastest straightening.  It heats up in no time flat.  Straightening my hair used to take an hour or so.  Now, it takes 15 minutes.  I let it heat for a minute and it is ready to go.  It has up to 25 heat settings, too.  For convenience, I leave mine on 25.  It heats up the fastest and takes the least time.  With other straighteners, I have had problems with product buildup on the plates, affecting the heat distribution.  This one does not have one single speck of product anywhere on the plates.  I am a teenager and I don&#x27;t have a job, so I watch my money and how I spend it.  This is the best money I have ever spent.  I higly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> At first I loved it, it worked great on my thick coarse hair. But, just yesterday I plugged it up and the light was on and averything but there was no heat. I even left it plugged in for an extra hour hoping maybe it would heat up but it never did! Now I have to buy a new straightener and it won&#x27;t be this one because there was a review similar to mine therefore I know it wasn&#x27;t just my straightener.</li>
            <li> My mom was kind of skeptical when getting this for me, because we got a crappy Conair straightener that didn&#x27;t work at all a couple years ago. Let me tell you, Conair has come a long way since the crappy days of that other hair straightener (you may have seen it, it&#x27;s purpley-blue and has crimper and stuff.) Anyway, this one works really well and heats up really fast. I wear my hair in braids sometimes (I have really thick, curly, unmanageable hair, keep in mind) and it will straighten the HUGE waves in less than 5 minutes for my whole head. I love this thing. I recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I bought this product but did not work well for me b/c I have small hands. The scissor like handles just opened up too wide and could not work well with it. The combs would just add more problems since it would get tangled up. Again due to my small hands. &lt;br /&gt;The product DOES however heat up fast and I like the dial heat settings. If you have small hands buy one that has a tong style to it. I bought a hair dryer instead w/ions/ceramic. I love my curly hair and I won&#x27;t bother w/ a straightener.</li>
            <li> I had long thick semi-straight hair &amp; when I ordered this item I didn&#x27;t believe it would really work as well as everyone said.  Well I was wrong, it worked wonderfully. &lt;br /&gt;I recently cut my hair a lot shorter &amp; am grateful I have this flat iron.  Since my hair is short, it flips horribly but when I use the flat iron it flattens out &amp; stays that way. &lt;br /&gt;I would suggest this item for anyone who wants straight hair that stays that way all day long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased two Conair Instant Heat Ceramic Hair Straighteners and even recommended it to a friend and all have provided similar results. If you live in a humid area, your hair will not remain straight the entire day.... not even the entire morning. Walking out your front door will cause instant waves, just be warned. Also it is not a lasting product. After a couple of months, all three products broke in the handle area and, in the majority of cases, exposed the inner wires. While temporary results are great, if you&#x27;re interested in lasting, repeated performances... try another product.</li>
            <li> I loved this product. it is easy to use, it works in Europe and it is really cheap.</li>
            <li> Nice curve to the handle helps with the use of this flat iron very quick to use and priced right.</li>
            <li> Worth the money and has lasted.  I love this iron use it everyday and still works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> It is a good Hair Straightener. It works efficiently but it sometimes burns my hair because it gets so hot. There is a setting but the first time I used this I burnt my hair BAD!!! I have straight hair but want to give it shine I put the setting on 15. The first time I did it I put it on 25. Good Product!</li>
            <li> Ok so firstly, about a year ago, I guess I was going through some \\&quot;teenager angst\\&quot; hormonal stage, but I chopped off my long hair to a really boy short cut. I felt FREE without all that hair weighing me down. Not only was it fun to wash in the shower, but I didn&#x27;t dread having to sit for hours every weekend having my mom help me straighten my hair or go to the salon everytime an event came up. Now, it took me less than 10 minutes every morning just straightening my bangs and I was set! Well, that joy slowly wore off and after a while, I found myself amazingly insecure about my short hair. It never felt feminine and I missed the feeling of long hair. I decided to grow my hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Now those of you who you who have ever experienced growing your hair out from a short cut, know that it gets difficult after a while. Because your hair grows out into all these weird layers and it looks extremely awkward. No matter how tempted you are to get a haircut, you know that would defeat the whole purpose of letting your hair grow out. Even a trim is out of the question. Having short hair doesn&#x27;t neccesarily mean easier styling. If you have naturally frizzy, wavy hair like me, it could mean spending even more time styling because you dont have the option to just pull your hair back and tie it into a ponytail. I would dread waking up every morning to a big poofball on top of my head, knowing it would ruin the quiet, peaceful mornings I crave and turn it into a chaotic scenario where I have to lock myself in the bathroom, straining my neck and frying my hair with my blowdryer and flat iron, while my family stands outside knocking on the door, complaining that I hog the bathroom. But it had to be done! Who knew hair could completely take over a person&#x27;s life? My old iron I got as a gift for my 16th birthday (yeah, dont ask) That was two years ago, and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since. It&#x27;s made by Vidal Sassoon, and it came with a blowdryer in this cute purple/silver color combo. I liked using it at first. But I noticed it never did the job I wanted. After a while, I just settled with my slightly straight, mostly wavy hair. Atleast it got rid of the frizz. But even if it was a little bit humid or rainy outside, my hair would curl back up into it&#x27;s normal self. All that time straightening my hair was a waste. I realized my iron was to blame. It was too weak for my stubborn hair. I remember whenever I went over my best friend&#x27;s house and we were about to go out, I&#x27;d quickly smooth out my hair with her straightener, and It did an amazing job! Her hair always looked so cute, even one day when we were stuck outside in a thunderstorm, my bangs curled up on me while her hair remained straight and smooth. It was definitely her hair straightener that was allowing her to not worry about her hair every 10 seconds. Mind you, she also cut her hair boy short and is letting it grow out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The next day, I called her up and asked her what type of straightener she had. She said it&#x27;s by Conair (this one) So I went onto amazon and read all these amazing reviews. I have to add, the reviewers also helped me to be more confident in buying this straightener...so thanks guys! &#x3D;o) Anyway, I was planning to order it here on amazon, but then I saw it at another store, and I had to get it. Thank god, the next day I had a job interview and I woke up 2 hours before I had to go there to some sort of strange mullet afro. Normally, I would be pissed off! But I don&#x27;t know why I had so much faith in my new straightener, even though I had never used it before....YAY!!! In about 10 minutes, I had this sleek, smooth, straight hair that looked fantastic, like I just walked out of a salon, and I did it myself! Little technologically, makeup, hair challenged me did it, so anyone could do it. My old straightener made my hair oily after one day because I constantly had to smooth it over and over again, but with the Conair straightner, I just smooth it over my hair onceand it&#x27;s done, so my hair is less damanged and I dont have to wash it as often as I used to. It&#x27;s like a trusthworthy friend, and it makes my hair life so much easier. Now I can focus on other things too. The price is unbeatable, seriously. It&#x27;s so worth it just to give it a try. The heat settings are cool because you can make it as hot as you want depending on your hair type. And it automatically shuts off for all those people who seem to always forget, like me. Oh yeah, it also comes with a little detachable comb that untangles your hair as you straighten it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Ok wow, this is really long! But yes, that&#x27;s my hair success story. Believe that if I finally found my miracle product that allows my hair to be the way I want without a bunch of stress, it&#x27;s worth a shot for anyone. Have fun and Good Luck! :)one, so my hair is less damanged and I dont have to wash it as often as I used to. It&#x27;s like a trusthworthy friend, and it makes my hair life so much easier.

            <li> Works in less then 30 seconds! This flat iron is fast, and fabulous! Light weight, and easy to use!I highly recommend it for very long hair!</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair and have used this flat iron for several years.  Its wonderful.  I can&#x27;t believe people are throwing away money on the $100 \\&quot;Chi\\&quot;.  This straighter has adjustable heat and heats quickly.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on anything else.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the reviews were so great.  However, I dont like this iron. It takes soo long to do my hair. it&#x27;s too big, and its hard to get your hair in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for over five years now and it&#x27;s just now on its last legs.         Everyone knows that FL has killer humidity and I have seriously thick, coarse hair - previous irons I had didn&#x27;t work at keeping the frizz at bay.  A couple hours after straightening my hair it would be puffy like I never ironed it.  I was so desperate - this iron was my last resort.  It turned out to be the best iron ever!  I love the wide plates - it speeds up my straightening time and it stays consistently hot - no wait time for rewarming.      I would DEFINITELY recommend this iron to others. I just bought my 2nd one!</li>
            <li> I gave this to my wife and here&#x27;s her feedback \\&quot;It is a good product and  like the end result on my hair. It is a bit bulky and clumsy to handle.  A sleeker design would be preferred.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> When I started college in 2002, I had just begun to learn the wonders of the flatiron. I have always had long, thick wavy hair that&#x27;s prone to frizz. One of my dorm neighbors had this very flatiron, and keep in mind this was over 5 years ago. I used it once, and was amazed with the results. I went out and bought my own a few weeks later. The model I bought is almost exactly like this one, only there isn&#x27;t a turbo feature. Regardless, I am still using the same flatiron to this day. It has lasted through being dropped, borrowed and used almost every day for over 5 years. This is unheard of for a flatiron. I don&#x27;t know if this model will last as long, but I think it will. I am looking to buy one for my neice for Christmas, and perhaps get myself a new one, just for the new features! Anyway, before you go out and purchase a HAI or a CHI, give this flatiron a try. It&#x27;s amazing!    Note: I borrowed a friend&#x27;s CHI flatiron a few months ago, and it was HORRIBLE. It didn&#x27;t straighten my hair at all. She paid 100 dollars for it, and the track record on those things is just under a year. Very overrated if you ask me. They certainly don&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> I did not want to pay $50 for a ceramic flat iron, but I wanted the high quality. Since I had used Conair appliances in the past, I decided to try this one. This product was designed for easy handling. It heats up in a couple of minutes, and does a fantastic job on medium to coarse hair. I would suggest that you start with a lower setting first.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and she liked it. Got it for a very good price from Amazon.</li>
            <li> It works great.. at least for my wife :) you can&#x27;t beat the price, and it works really good!</li>
            <li> This flat iron is amazing. Its well worth the price. It is a little curved and it makes a big difference when you are straightening your hair because for some reason it glides on easily...making your hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I got this straightener after reading all the great reviews. I am very DISAPPOINTED. I have thick curly hair. This straightener cannot straighten it. The heat level isn&#x27;t enough.</li>
            <li> This product is cumbersone and hard to use.  I have lightened hair that is frizzy.  I have to pass the wand over each segment at least 3 times to make it straight.  It does heat up really fast though.</li>
            <li> This picture is the straightner AI ordered but, not the one I received so I really cant rate this product. The one I recieved came with no box or instructions.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this flat iron.  Does not get hot enough. It was a complete waste of my time waiting for it to be delivered only to be unhappy with its performance.</li>
            <li> i bought this for a friend of mine and as she got it, she ran and tested it! nw, she uses it alot! she really loves it and i would recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet but it&#x27;s a great size</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair and a lot of hair. Have found this straighter to be great. highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Excellent and prompt service by this seller. Item as advertised. I would recommend this person to anyone looking for great quality and exceptional customer service!</li>
            <li> arrived on time, heats very fast, great value</li>
            <li> This heats up quickly and has a nice adjustable setting for the temperature.  I have dropped it many times and it still works great!</li>
            <li> Did not become hot enough to do the job.  Poor quality all around.  Returned this item after one attempt to use.</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener because I have misplaced my normal one. I was so excited to get it after all the wonderful reviews that I have read about it. I try to go through a good amount of reviews before buying any product so I know what to kind of expect.....well I opened it up this morning and started working on my hair. I got the bottom layer of hair straightened without too much problems. I start on the middle section of hair and I noticed that the thing was not quite as hot. I checked all the settings and it was ok. I go to unplug it and it shocks me. ( not like a big whoa one, but a decent rub your feet on carpet to get someone type of shock. Before I get the thing unplugged it shocks me 2 more times! I unplug it let it sit for a little bit and plug it back in. Both lights are blinking....it won&#x27;t turn on. I said forget it and I clicked return to amazon....boo crappy straighteners!</li>
            <li> I live in Argentina and it didn&#x27;t work here. It just went BUM and never turned on again. Not recomendable for 220 v</li>
            <li> This is an excellent curling iron.  I am black with relaxed hair and before my visit to the hairdresser, people were amazed that my hair looked so straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well done Conair</li>
            <li> I bought this for my move to Germany. It works amazing! Sometimes it makes my hair static-y but I comb my fingers through it real quick and back to normal. I would recommend this. Also nice because the iron part is wide. :)</li>
            <li> I was a touch hesitant buying this iron. I was pleasantly surprised when I tried it! All I have to say is I love this iron! The only nuisance is that the cord is a bit short. Other than that I&#x27;m glad I bought this!</li>
            <li> Way better then I thought. Con air has come a long way. I have very curly hair and it does just as good of a job at my $150 straight iron.</li>
            <li> It left my hair frizzy and it didn&#x27;t look like I had put heat to my head at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron to replace one that I had for years but broke. My first one was 1\\&quot;, and I certainly prefer the 2\\&quot; one. It has been working as described; it is smooth and does not sticks to my hair (fine, wavy, dry/frizzy).&lt;br /&gt;It heats up quickly and you can adjust to different temperatures (from 1 up to 25 - I use 15) and it has a turbo on/off button.&lt;br /&gt;It is convenient that it has a dual voltage (you don&#x27;t need to set it - It adjusts itself) as I travel to countries using 210-220v. Although it shuts off automatically, I always make sure it&#x27;s off when I finish using it, but it&#x27;s good to have this feature in case I ever forget.&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with this purchase and hope it will be long-lasting!</li>
            <li> I received this product on tuesday...it&#x27;s friday and i&#x27;ve put my request for a refund through already. This is a terribly cheap and painful product. It snags your hair and barely does the trick of straightening it. i fry my hair trying to get the end result. Use your money elsewhere!</li>
            <li> This straightner dosent work!! I had it all the way up and it still wouldnt straighten my hair. Also, when you heat it up the handle gets hot as well so its hard to hold. A good thing about this is that it shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Oh my God ,it is so good, it makes my long hair very smooth, and in the mean time it keeps my hair volume as it is. All my old  make my hair thin , and I get annoyed. This Conair Flat Iron 2\\&quot; Ceramic  Straightener  is much better than the expensive brands. And I Im lucky ,because it is dual voltage as I m living in New Zealand 230V . it really  worth . Thank you AMAZON.</li>
            <li> I love it.it do a good job on my daughter hair</li>
            <li> It has 25 settings, a regular heat and a turbo heat that heats in seconds!  This flat iron is Fantastic!</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because this is a great product. It heats up fast and is wide enough for my long hair. With this straighter it doesn&#x27;t take as long to finish my hair then other straighters I&#x27;ve owed. I would recommend this for anyone that uses a straighter on their hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a trip I was going on with my school to Santiago, Chile. I didn&#x27;t want to bring my regular straightener because it isn&#x27;t dual voltage. This straightener basically got the job done over the 4 days I was there. I have very thick, long hair, and this straightener didn&#x27;t do as well as my regular one does, but for the price it was a good straightener to have for when I travel abroad. I would recommend it for someone going either on a short trip, or for someone who doesn&#x27;t have such difficult-to-straighten hair. I give it four stars because it did what I needed it to do while I was there, and I will keep it for my next trip abroad, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> This hair straightener is EXACTLY what I needed: inexpensive, reliable, high enough temp, and easy to use. It&#x27;s funny b/c it is so lightweight that you almost think it&#x27;s going to be a piece of junk...but then when I used it I was pleasantly surprised. I would say the best two things about it are 1) The curve of the device, it makes it easier to use and more effective. and 2) the temp. it can be heated up to, I was concerned about this b/c I have coarse thick hair that is naturally wavy. However it gets plenty hot enough to do the job. I would recommend this :)</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to worry about setting the correct voltage for this iron.  The unit automatically sets to the correct voltage to prevent burnout.  Works great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Conair products a very long time.  My previous Conair straightener died after nearly 10 yrs.  It was well made and sturdy.  This item from Conair is cheaply made from plastic (besides the plates), my hair got caught in the plates because there is a small spaces at the edges, resulting in pulling out my hair - Ouch!  After only a few months, it stopped working altogether so have to return it to the manufacturer.  Totally disappointed in this version made in China instead of USA.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive. You get what you pay for. It&#x27;s not bad. It does the job but it doesn&#x27;t leave a shine. I feel like my gaur is a little brittle after using it. Next time I&#x27;ll spend the extra $30 for a better quality one. I&#x27;ll save this one for a travel one or just to have an extra one on hand.</li>
            <li> Ordered the Conair Flat Iron 2\\&quot; Ceramic Straightener - Dual Voltage.&lt;br /&gt;Because it was SUPPOSED to have an attachable comb with it... It came up in the search for straightener with a comb and a comb was discussed in the reviews.... Yet I see no comb.  The comb was the ONLY reason that i had bought it.  My time and Christmas has been wasted.  Thanks amazon.</li>
            <li> This was bought for my 15 year old granddaughter and she says it&#x27;s just fine. The wand is a good size.</li>
            <li> It works beautifully on my hair</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my daughter for Christmas.  She is 11 and her goal is to get her hair as STRAIGHT as possible!!!!  This little gadget does the trick!  And...it&#x27;s pretty, too!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my little sister when she went off to college and she has loved it. Great product for a great price.</li>
            <li> Doesnt work as great as i was hoping but oh well still gets job done</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift, has worked out well so far and I would definitely buy it again. Arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a great straightener and the size is fabulous! It is so nice to be able to straighten hair much more quickly. Also it leaves it looking very shiny and healthy especially when I used the Tresemme Thermal Creations spray before. I would really recommend this straightener.</li>
            <li> Very good condition. Fast and easy</li>
            <li> This straightener wasn&#x27;t that bad but you could definitely get a better one for the same price it took me hours to straighten my hair! I have thick wavy hair and it does close to nothing.</li>
            <li> This straightener is just right for my hair type. It heats up and the straightening time is cut down by almost a half from what my old straightener used to. The 2&amp;#34; is much better for thicker hair and it works perfectly. It&#x27;s the best straightener I have owned, and I have owned two previously. This is by far the better straightener around! I suggest it highly!</li>
            <li> Works great and heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> This straightener is horrible. Do yourself a favor and buy a Babyliss.</li>
            <li> I think this is a fine iron.  It&#x27;s my first and I watched a few tutorials on YouTube to get it right.  I am happy because it replaces a hairdryer for me, and ends up making mymedium-long, fluffy, frizzy, crazy, wavy, thick and course hair smooth and straight, when done right.  It&#x27;s also easy, if you do all the steps.  To make it work, with hair like mine, you have to start with completely dry, combed hair, put a heat protectant gel on, and then section off hair with clips and get to work, a layer at a time.  If your hair is damp, the iron will lose heat and start blinking and it takes longer.  If your hair is truly dry and combed, in 10 minutes you will be transformed!</li>
            <li> I did not like this flat iron at all. It did not get as hot as it indicated and my hair kept getting caught under the plates. I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I hate this! It catches my hair at the plates!!! I never use it and just use my old one still</li>
            <li> It works well and it&#x27;s more compact than my last one was. I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have fairly curly hair and even with hours invested in trying to straighten with this device, my hair did not get fully straight. But a ceramic one.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough and the plates don&#x27;t close together all the way.  I&#x27;ve already replaced it with a different brand.</li>
            <li> This is one of those rare occasions you get a quality product inexpensively.  This was bought for a birthday gift and it works great for my daughter and is better built than you might things.  I don&#x27;t know how long it will last, but at this price we could buy another one.</li>
            <li> It heat fast like in a minute, works really nice on my hair, I definitly will buy another, the only thing is that the electricity cord is not so long, it is short.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my GF. She likes the product and especially wanted it from the conair brand. Because she had previous positive experiences with the conair brand products.</li>
            <li> This straightener with dual voltage was perfect for our recent trip to Ireland--you only need an adaptor to use it.  I love it so much I have continued to use it since I got back home!</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, course, and wavy/curly. I straightened my hair with this straightener and my hair looked great, my hair had volume, it was shiny, it had definition. Within an hour my hair needed to be straightened again. This straightener is the worst I&#x27;ve had. This straightener will won&#x27;t keep your hair straight.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my trip to Ireland. It is dual voltage which is perfect and heats up great for my thick, long hair. Nice convenient size as well to fit in suitcase.</li>
            <li> Worked as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good: dual voltage, comfortable grip, long cord, great value&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad: not enough temperature settings&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good product.</li>
            <li> it was a good purchase and since my hair is long and needed something that could grab more hair.  You can use it close to the scalp if need be and the heat unit is pretty good</li>
            <li> The straightener did not heat up enough to remove kinks in my hair. Also, it would not heat up after around 9 months. For the price, it wasn&#x27;t a terrible option, but I received a CHI for Christmas and I will never go back.</li>
            <li> I like this, but I do not love this.</li>
            <li> I Love this straightner its works so much better then the chi I bought the chi a few years ago and it stopped working.so i bought this and wow I am so Impressed how smooth and sleek it makes my hair look,,,, it really works great and for the price too!!  company was fast and efficient sending it thanks so much!!&#x3D;)  Very Satisfied</li>
            <li> I have really long thick hair and a friend told me how ceramic is best for hair straighteners. She was right. It heats up quickly and does exactly what I want. You just have to remember to go slow enough that the hair gets heated. Some people think they have to rush it through their hair then wonder why it&#x27;s not straight. The pad is large enough that it doesn&#x27;t take forever for thick haired people. Most straighteners are really small and would take all day to do thick hair. This is exactly what I wanted and needed.</li>
            <li> Does so well i have hair that takes a hour to strighten cut my time down to 15 minutes</li>
            <li> I took it to Europe and with the appropriate adapter it worked like a charm. Not a bad hair day!</li>
            <li> Good, great, love it! Good, great, love it! My hair is fabulously awesome and beautiful! I like it a lot!</li>
            <li> This was just okay -- i&#x27;ve taken it on my trips to Europe and didn&#x27;t love it -- if you&#x27;re used to a high-quality ceramic straightener (Chi, GHD, Sedu brands, etc), this will be tough to get used to. I guess it got me through in a pinch, but it does take forever and is a bit clunky -- i sort of felt like i was using a Playskool toy. In all honesty, if I were to buy something for travel again, i might think about investing in something better for time&#x27;s sake, and for the sake of my hair, as this seemed to fry it a little. All of that being said, I didn&#x27;t feel like I had to worry about ruining this straightener due to differences in electricity/voltage from one country to the next, bc it was so cheap -- if it had broken i wouldn&#x27;t have been devastated, so there&#x27;s the benefit! Lastly, for travel it&#x27;s kind of bulky/heavy.</li>
            <li> I love it! It straightens my hair better than the one I had before.</li>
            <li> This worked well - the first time we used it.  About a month later (using this on occasion to straighten my daughter&#x27;s hair) it would not turn on.  Bummer.</li>
            <li> Used in Germany, UK and Switzerland. Heats up quickly and (with the turbo turned on) is hot enough to flatten my thick wavy hair. I wish the plates had a little give so you can easily flatten all the hair in a bundle; right now if you have a thicker clump of hair, the other pieces don&#x27;t get flattened. But overall, an excellent purchase for my European travel.</li>
            <li> This works great for the price. I love it. My hair is done in minutes cause it heats up quickly. Use  both voltage so whether I&#x27;m home or not, I can plug it in and do my hair.</li>
