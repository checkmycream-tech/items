            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found these!  </li>
            <li>I used this for the first time tonight and it worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Great price and fit the Mia 2 perfectly./</li>
            <li>They fit my clarisonic plus great.</li>
            <li>They work great and fit my clearisonic Mia 2.</li>
            <li>These fit my Clarisonic and work great, I can&#x27;t tell a difference between the these and the Clarisonic brand.</li>
            <li>Priced nice however they rattle when in use</li>
            <li>We own 2 Clarisonic Mia2s and these replacements do the job just like the originals.</li>
            <li>Works just as great as the original.</li>
            <li>They were a great price, they fit my Clarsonic perfectly and so far, have lasted well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This seller was great and sent these out quickly.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t use it more than a week.</li>
            <li>Also I want to make sure it&#x27;s working the way it is supposed to.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more.</li>
            <li>Love the replacement heads for my Mia Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>Cheap!</li>
            <li>Just what I have been looking for with a much better price.</li>
            <li>I love them</li>
            <li>Okay.  </li>
            <li>You sure can&#x27;t beat the price, though, which may explain the difference from the branded heads.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t want to spend the big $$ on the clarsonic brand replacement heads, these are a great alternative!</li>
            <li>My face was washed better than ever</li>
            <li>and I could not be more satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Comparing the design to a clairsonic brand there is zero difference.&lt;br /&gt;Possibly will need to change out more often than name brand brush, but 4 heads for $5 will make that ok!&lt;br /&gt;Ordered</li>
            <li>But I had to spend it to get the full benefits of my clarisonic that I love!</li>
            <li>The reviews for these were pretty good</li>
            <li>just like the original!</li>
            <li>I bought better replacements and it works fine now.</li>
            <li>You are much better off spending the money on the original brush heads.</li>
            <li>I have never used any kind of brush but the Clarasonic original sensitive skin brush so these kind of hurt my face.</li>
            <li>The bristles feel fine too.</li>
            <li>They work perfectly fine with my Clarisonic Pro.  </li>
            <li>Works fine with clarisonic</li>
            <li>Great product without the high retail price fast shipping will order from here when ready to replace!!!!</li>
            <li>They fit perfectly with my Clarisonic without any rattling or odd oscillation.  </li>
            <li>The heads fit well and seem to be of fine quality.  </li>
            <li>I am guessing, the real Clarisonic brush head was made much more smooth and is easily able to bypass that and spin without getting caught.</li>
            <li>its cheap and</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t fit at all.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t hear a rattling sound or anything like</li>
            <li>They do not go on as smoothly as the name brand head that came with my clarisonic</li>
            <li>While they fit my Clairisonic, you can tell they&#x27;re made with lower quality.</li>
            <li>They are not cheaply made and 4 for the price point is awesome if they work for you, hence the two stars.</li>
            <li>I thought for $5, if they didn&#x27;t fit if just throw them out.&lt;br /&gt;Fits</li>
            <li>The brushes i received fit snugly onto my device and clean my face just fine.</li>
            <li>Excited I found them when I did.</li>
            <li>The brush heads were, i guess, originally in a sandwich bag (the fold over flap sandwich bag).  </li>
            <li>Still cheaper then original brushes</li>
            <li>NOT like the original from the brand name.</li>
            <li>The deep pore head much more effective (for me) than the original.</li>
            <li>very well made), I can change my brush heads more often, thus washing my skin with cleaner brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>thats good enough for me.</li>
            <li>Love them looks and work just like the real ones you get 4 for 8.00 as a posed to 1 for 27.00 shipped fas</li>
            <li>Not quite as good as the brand ones but close enough and the price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li>Same thing compared to clareisonic brushes,but at a reasonably good price,I will bye again if availability continues,I highly recommend this item.:-)</li>
            <li>Awesome, just like the ridiculously over priced Clarasonic brush..</li>
            <li>It does indeed fit into my Clarisonic mia, but when I first bought it, the brush head would not rotate.</li>
            <li>Its great that they are 4 brushes for a lot less than what you could buy at Ulta or Sephora.</li>
            <li>These work just like the expensive brand name ones and fit on my mia perfectly!</li>
            <li>low quality, doesn&#x27;t exfoliate skin effectively</li>
            <li>These are probably worth what I paid for them, which was not a lot.</li>
            <li>They really do give a nice deep clean and my face just glows.</li>
            <li>They would work really well if you have super oily skin and were using maybe three times per week.</li>
            <li>identical to the higher priced name brand</li>
            <li>Needed some replacements and these were exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still glad I got them though, will continue to use, just not on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>I actually like these better since the bristles are firmer.</li>
            <li>just as good as the regular brand only thing is when you first use them a lot of brissels come out so you should wash them off first.</li>
            <li>No clacking, no loose fit.  </li>
            <li>The brush was too rough on my skin and it made my face turn bright red.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars because they don&#x27;t fit my Mia properly</li>
            <li>For the price though, I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li>again buy the real deal because these work just as well at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>They fit my Clarisonic however they do not work the same.  </li>
            <li>But the real thing.</li>
            <li>The real sonic heads have an antibacterial aspect it appears</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Compared to the real Clarisonic brushes which would cost $100.After using the brush twice a day for a couple of days</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much difference to the Clarisonic brand brush head.</li>
            <li>I saved so much money.  </li>
            <li>I pay that much for just one....</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Saves me much on replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how fast they got here</li>
            <li>These are very abrasive.  </li>
            <li>I had so much hope these would work in my clarisonic</li>
            <li>You can buy original brushed (2 for 22.00) at a department store like Dillard&#x27;s or Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I love the cost effectiveness of these brushes over any other nonOEMs.</li>
            <li>I was expecting these to be similar to the original brushes and thought there would be some decrease in quality, but these shouldn&#x27;t even be sold as a replacement for the brushes.</li>
            <li>The only major difference is again the cost which is dramatically much more affordable.</li>
            <li>Seems just as good as name brand, only much less costly.</li>
            <li>The brushes arrived promptly and are decent brushes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using these instead.  </li>
            <li>I decided it wouldn&#x27;t hurt if I tried to lubricate it with a little bit of my jojoba oil, which I think is safe for the face and skin like Argan Oil would be.</li>
            <li>Fit and work as expected.</li>
            <li>I am so disappointed because I read the reviews and most people seemed to have a good experience with them.</li>
            <li>n my two nieces need a new brush head too</li>
            <li>and it made my machine feel like new again.</li>
            <li>but they do fit, I would definitely purchase in the future.</li>
            <li>They are very soft.</li>
            <li>They work exactly the same as the Clarisonic brushes, but at a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li>These are exactly like the clarisonic deep pore brushes!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t pay because the high quality ones last much much longer.</li>
            <li>I am not sure what the real clarisonic brushes are supposed to be like,but these four brushes @ $8.60 were a huge bargain.</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure but for the price definitely wasn&#x27;t easy afraid to gamble and get it a try.</li>
            <li>I ordered the &amp;#34;Deep Pore Cleansing&amp;#34; version and expected the slightly stiffer bristles for effective cleaning.</li>
            <li>Some reviewers said the brush bristles were a bit too firm but the ones I got were fine and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.  </li>
            <li>At this price with the same quality, you certainly won&#x27;t be sorry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the same price I got four, and they last much longer!!</li>
            <li>It’s clear the brush and the device are not speaking to one another.</li>
            <li>They were soft and looked well made but on my Clarisonic Mia they didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Must say I was pleasantly surprised at how well they work.  </li>
            <li>They also last very well.</li>
            <li>This product&#x27;s bristles seem too soft in comparison.</li>
            <li>Decided they has become too soft and wanted to replace .</li>
            <li>.. spend the money for the real deal, I am next time.</li>
            <li>I guess my daughter just got some refills since she uses the sensitive brushes.</li>
            <li>I have a clairsonic pro about 4yrs old.</li>
            <li>also want to note that the quality of the brush was soft when it arrived, but it gets kind of hard and bristle-ly to use after awhile (I am unsure of how to get brushes to soften again), and I can&#x27;t say what it feels like long term yet</li>
            <li>Thank you very much Amazon for carrying alternatives to the more expensive brand names.</li>
            <li>These generic brush heads are essentially exactly the same as the Clarisonic brand.</li>
            <li>ones.will definitely get more especially when the budgets tight</li>
            <li>my skin was soft and my pores appeared smaller.</li>
            <li>My 3rd set of these ordered, complete godsend.</li>
            <li>I can now finally afford to replace my brush heads as often as recommended instead of bleaching my old ones and trying to get every last use out of them!</li>
            <li>I would actually say they are about the same as a clarisonic sensitive brush.  </li>
            <li>Not remotely the same as the Brand item.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it did not fit correctly and made a noise.  </li>
            <li>I carefully looked at how it compared to an actual Clarisonic brush head and found that the construction of it was almost completely spot on, some features were either smaller or bigger, but I don&#x27;t think they were real problems, except for 1 tiny little detail.</li>

            <li> My face was washed better than ever</li>
            <li> and I could not be more satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Comparing the design to a clairsonic brand there is zero difference.&lt;br /&gt;Possibly will need to change out more often than name brand brush, but 4 heads for $5 will make that ok!&lt;br /&gt;Ordered</li>
            <li> But I had to spend it to get the full benefits of my clarisonic that I love!</li>
            <li> The reviews for these were pretty good</li>
            <li> just like the original!</li>
            <li> I bought better replacements and it works fine now.</li>
            <li> You are much better off spending the money on the original brush heads.</li>
            <li> I have never used any kind of brush but the Clarasonic original sensitive skin brush so these kind of hurt my face.</li>
            <li> The bristles feel fine too.</li>
            <li> They work perfectly fine with my Clarisonic Pro.  </li>
            <li> Works fine with clarisonic</li>
            <li> Great product without the high retail price fast shipping will order from here when ready to replace!!!!</li>
            <li> They fit perfectly with my Clarisonic without any rattling or odd oscillation.  </li>
            <li> The heads fit well and seem to be of fine quality.  </li>
            <li> I am guessing, the real Clarisonic brush head was made much more smooth and is easily able to bypass that and spin without getting caught.</li>
            <li> its cheap and</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t fit at all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hear a rattling sound or anything like</li>
            <li> They do not go on as smoothly as the name brand head that came with my clarisonic</li>
            <li> While they fit my Clairisonic, you can tell they&#x27;re made with lower quality.</li>
            <li> They are not cheaply made and 4 for the price point is awesome if they work for you, hence the two stars.</li>
            <li> I thought for $5, if they didn&#x27;t fit if just throw them out.&lt;br /&gt;Fits</li>
            <li> The brushes i received fit snugly onto my device and clean my face just fine.</li>
            <li> Excited I found them when I did.</li>
            <li> The brush heads were, i guess, originally in a sandwich bag (the fold over flap sandwich bag).  </li>
            <li> Still cheaper then original brushes</li>
            <li> NOT like the original from the brand name.</li>
            <li> The deep pore head much more effective (for me) than the original.</li>
            <li> very well made), I can change my brush heads more often, thus washing my skin with cleaner brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> thats good enough for me.</li>
            <li> Love them looks and work just like the real ones you get 4 for 8.00 as a posed to 1 for 27.00 shipped fas</li>
            <li> Not quite as good as the brand ones but close enough and the price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> Same thing compared to clareisonic brushes,but at a reasonably good price,I will bye again if availability continues,I highly recommend this item.:-)</li>
            <li> Awesome, just like the ridiculously over priced Clarasonic brush..</li>
            <li> It does indeed fit into my Clarisonic mia, but when I first bought it, the brush head would not rotate.</li>
            <li> Its great that they are 4 brushes for a lot less than what you could buy at Ulta or Sephora.</li>
            <li> These work just like the expensive brand name ones and fit on my mia perfectly!</li>
            <li> low quality, doesn&#x27;t exfoliate skin effectively</li>
            <li> These are probably worth what I paid for them, which was not a lot.</li>
            <li> They really do give a nice deep clean and my face just glows.</li>
            <li> They would work really well if you have super oily skin and were using maybe three times per week.</li>
            <li> identical to the higher priced name brand</li>
            <li> Needed some replacements and these were exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still glad I got them though, will continue to use, just not on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I actually like these better since the bristles are firmer.</li>
            <li> just as good as the regular brand only thing is when you first use them a lot of brissels come out so you should wash them off first.</li>
            <li> No clacking, no loose fit.  </li>
            <li> The brush was too rough on my skin and it made my face turn bright red.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars because they don&#x27;t fit my Mia properly</li>
            <li> For the price though, I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li> again buy the real deal because these work just as well at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> They fit my Clarisonic however they do not work the same.  </li>
            <li> But the real thing.</li>
            <li> The real sonic heads have an antibacterial aspect it appears</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Compared to the real Clarisonic brushes which would cost $100.After using the brush twice a day for a couple of days</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much difference to the Clarisonic brand brush head.</li>
            <li> I saved so much money.  </li>
            <li> I pay that much for just one....</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Saves me much on replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how fast they got here</li>
            <li> These are very abrasive.  </li>
            <li> I had so much hope these would work in my clarisonic</li>
            <li> You can buy original brushed (2 for 22.00) at a department store like Dillard&#x27;s or Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I love the cost effectiveness of these brushes over any other nonOEMs.</li>
            <li> I was expecting these to be similar to the original brushes and thought there would be some decrease in quality, but these shouldn&#x27;t even be sold as a replacement for the brushes.</li>
            <li> The only major difference is again the cost which is dramatically much more affordable.</li>
            <li> Seems just as good as name brand, only much less costly.</li>
            <li> The brushes arrived promptly and are decent brushes.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using these instead.  </li>
            <li> I decided it wouldn&#x27;t hurt if I tried to lubricate it with a little bit of my jojoba oil, which I think is safe for the face and skin like Argan Oil would be.</li>
            <li> Fit and work as expected.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed because I read the reviews and most people seemed to have a good experience with them.</li>
            <li> n my two nieces need a new brush head too</li>
            <li> and it made my machine feel like new again.</li>
            <li> but they do fit, I would definitely purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> They are very soft.</li>
            <li> They work exactly the same as the Clarisonic brushes, but at a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li> These are exactly like the clarisonic deep pore brushes!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pay because the high quality ones last much much longer.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what the real clarisonic brushes are supposed to be like,but these four brushes @ $8.60 were a huge bargain.</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure but for the price definitely wasn&#x27;t easy afraid to gamble and get it a try.</li>
            <li> I ordered the &amp;#34;Deep Pore Cleansing&amp;#34; version and expected the slightly stiffer bristles for effective cleaning.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers said the brush bristles were a bit too firm but the ones I got were fine and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.  </li>
            <li> At this price with the same quality, you certainly won&#x27;t be sorry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the same price I got four, and they last much longer!!</li>
            <li> It’s clear the brush and the device are not speaking to one another.</li>
            <li> They were soft and looked well made but on my Clarisonic Mia they didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Must say I was pleasantly surprised at how well they work.  </li>
            <li> They also last very well.</li>
            <li> This product&#x27;s bristles seem too soft in comparison.</li>
            <li> Decided they has become too soft and wanted to replace .</li>
            <li> .. spend the money for the real deal, I am next time.</li>
            <li> I guess my daughter just got some refills since she uses the sensitive brushes.</li>
            <li> I have a clairsonic pro about 4yrs old.</li>
            <li> also want to note that the quality of the brush was soft when it arrived, but it gets kind of hard and bristle-ly to use after awhile (I am unsure of how to get brushes to soften again), and I can&#x27;t say what it feels like long term yet</li>
            <li> Thank you very much Amazon for carrying alternatives to the more expensive brand names.</li>
            <li> These generic brush heads are essentially exactly the same as the Clarisonic brand.</li>
            <li> ones.will definitely get more especially when the budgets tight</li>
            <li> my skin was soft and my pores appeared smaller.</li>
            <li> My 3rd set of these ordered, complete godsend.</li>
            <li> I can now finally afford to replace my brush heads as often as recommended instead of bleaching my old ones and trying to get every last use out of them!</li>
            <li> I would actually say they are about the same as a clarisonic sensitive brush.  </li>
            <li> Not remotely the same as the Brand item.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it did not fit correctly and made a noise.  </li>
            <li> I carefully looked at how it compared to an actual Clarisonic brush head and found that the construction of it was almost completely spot on, some features were either smaller or bigger, but I don&#x27;t think they were real problems, except for 1 tiny little detail.</li>
            <li> They smelled sour after a few uses and my Mias battery started to die quickly.</li>
            <li> So in the long run I realized it is cheaper to get the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> I will say that at first I was skeptical that these brush heads would fit my Clarisonic Mia 2 because in the past I bought a generic version</li>
            <li> I knew I was buying a generic product, however I expected it to work properly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using one for about a month and the ONLY thing I suspect might be different is the level of quality, as it appears to be deteriorating only slightly faster than the name brand (which I don&#x27;t even mind because of the ridiculously low price).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin at all, but these made my face raw after only two uses.  </li>
            <li> I purchased these hoping they would be a somewhat suitable replacement for the very expensive brush heads for my Clairsonic.</li>
            <li> Works fabulous with my expensive face brush.</li>
            <li> I am actually giving the  product 3.5 stars, because its an average brush head and it works.</li>
            <li> These work just like the name brand but only for a LOT less.  </li>
            <li> I was actually in a store a few days ago about to pick up a single brush head for $29 and something told me to check Amazon.  </li>
            <li> the center doesn&#x27;t spin.</li>
            <li> and I tjink the bristles maybe a bit harder.</li>
            <li> I have now used them for a few months and have noticed absolutely no difference between this generic brand and the Clarisonic brand.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> These are really stiff and rough on my face.  </li>
            <li> This generic version is very abrasive and irritates my skin badly.</li>
            <li> Four of these brushes cost less than one Clarisonic and that includes shipping.</li>
            <li> I now have a years supply (4 brush heads, which I change every 2-3 months) for less than $12.  </li>
            <li> But there is a little indent notch, that when the brush spins, one of the plastic pieces catches on, which causes the brush head to not spin.</li>
            <li> Not sure why other people are having problems.</li>
            <li> I mean, $4 for a four pack compared to $25 for a single Clarisonic brand brush?</li>
            <li> Wasted money.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I ordered these months ago and can no longer return them - they were that bad that I would have made the effort to return something so cheap!</li>
            <li> Very sad because price and quality of bristles was good. :(</li>
            <li> However I have a heavy hand if I pay attention to not pushing to hard</li>
            <li> These work just as well as the expensive brushes and seem to last a bit longer.  </li>
            <li> the brush head has been spinning without incident for the past month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Clarisonic replacement heads usually cost 25 bucks a pop minimum.</li>
            <li> As I was searching for an alternative to the rather expensive option that the actual Clarisonic brand sells; I found this.</li>
            <li> The plastic base is made out of a lighter plastic that the brand name brushes and make a rattle noise when in use, which is only a minor annoyance.</li>
            <li> Terrible cheap alternative.</li>
            <li> others reviewers have complained about.</li>
            <li> I will be attaching images into the Amazon product images to show what I mean.</li>
            <li> Was hesitant to buy these, but sick of paying ridiculous amounts of money for a single replacement head made by the name brand.</li>
            <li> These are really rough , abrasive and irritates my  face  badly.</li>
            <li> but alas they did not.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on expensive brushes!!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s literally no difference between these and the expensive name brand one.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they Are not working for me.</li>
            <li> That Is crazy</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> I just replaced the brush head and when I attempted to use it this AM to wash my face, I was shocked at how bad these were.</li>
            <li> Scratchy and painful.</li>
            <li> Too bad!</li>
            <li> I am disgusted at the packaging and don&#x27;t want to use because I don&#x27;t know if they are used or not.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Awesome price compared to the Clarisonic brand</li>
            <li> Great price and fit the Mia 2 perfectly./</li>
            <li> This generic version is very abrasive and irritates my skin badly. Couldn&#x27;t use it more than a week. Wish I could get a ruffled since I bought 3 brushed. You can buy original brushed (2 for 22.00) at a department store like Dillard&#x27;s or Macy&#x27;s. I do not recommend this product</li>
            <li> The brushes arrived promptly and are decent brushes. I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars because they don&#x27;t fit my Mia properly so I can&#x27;t twist and lock them into place all the way otherwise the center doesn&#x27;t spin. For the price though, I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li> works perfectly. identical to the higher priced name brand</li>
            <li> Not quite the same quality as the Clarisonic replacement heads even though sold as such.</li>
            <li> Great product without the high retail price fast shipping will order from here when ready to replace!!!!</li>
            <li> They fit my clarisonic plus great. Priced nice however they rattle when in use and I tjink the bristles maybe a bit harder. However I have a heavy hand if I pay attention to not pushing to hard they work just like the brand ones.will definitely get more especially when the budgets tight n my two nieces need a new brush head too</li>
            <li> These replacement brushes work just as well as the original/manufacture brushes at a 10th of the price!!!! Can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> These work just as well as the expensive brushes and seem to last a bit longer.  I love the cost effectiveness of these brushes over any other nonOEMs.</li>
            <li> just as good as the regular brand only thing is when you first use them a lot of brissels come out so you should wash them off first.</li>
            <li> I purchased these hoping they would be a somewhat suitable replacement for the very expensive brush heads for my Clairsonic. Holy crow, I could not have been more wrong. I just replaced the brush head and when I attempted to use it this AM to wash my face, I was shocked at how bad these were. I actually checked to see if the brush head was attached properly because nothing happened when I turned on the device. I was expecting these to be similar to the original brushes and thought there would be some decrease in quality, but these shouldn&#x27;t even be sold as a replacement for the brushes. It felt like nothing was happening and I was just holding a stationary brush against my face. Unfortunately I ordered these months ago and can no longer return them - they were that bad that I would have made the effort to return something so cheap! You are much better off spending the money on the original brush heads.</li>
            <li> Great brush heads. I will&lt;br /&gt;Never again buy the real deal because these work just as well at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> Seems just as good as name brand, only much less costly.</li>
            <li> Save your money and buy the brand name brush.  I ordered these for my replacement stash.  They fit my Clarisonic however they do not work the same.  I knew I was buying a generic product, however I expected it to work properly.  The device will only function on a lower setting and will not adjust up.  It’s clear the brush and the device are not speaking to one another. I missed my return window by two days, or else I would have returned them.  Wasted money.</li>
            <li> This seller was great and sent these out quickly. But these brushes do not translate the vibration patterns at all. They were soft and looked well made but on my Clarisonic Mia they didn&#x27;t work. Too bad!</li>
            <li> Needed some replacements and these were exactly what I was looking for.  Great deal!  Excited I found them when I did.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and thought I would give these generic brush heads a try.  Must say I was pleasantly surprised at how well they work.  Some reviewers said the brush bristles were a bit too firm but the ones I got were fine and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.  Loved the price and would buy them again.</li>
            <li> I am actually giving the  product 3.5 stars, because its an average brush head and it works. It does indeed fit into my Clarisonic mia, but when I first bought it, the brush head would not rotate. I carefully looked at how it compared to an actual Clarisonic brush head and found that the construction of it was almost completely spot on, some features were either smaller or bigger, but I don&#x27;t think they were real problems, except for 1 tiny little detail. I will be attaching images into the Amazon product images to show what I mean. But there is a little indent notch, that when the brush spins, one of the plastic pieces catches on, which causes the brush head to not spin. I am guessing, the real Clarisonic brush head was made much more smooth and is easily able to bypass that and spin without getting caught. I decided it wouldn&#x27;t hurt if I tried to lubricate it with a little bit of my jojoba oil, which I think is safe for the face and skin like Argan Oil would be. I wouldn&#x27;t use something that would clog pores though! And hallelujah! the brush head has been spinning without incident for the past month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to note that the quality of the brush was soft when it arrived, but it gets kind of hard and bristle-ly to use after awhile (I am unsure of how to get brushes to soften again), and I can&#x27;t say what it feels like long term yet since I&#x27;ve only owned it for about 1 month. Also would like to note, the hair bristles are also likely to fall out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it doesn&#x27;t cost $20/brush, so its cheap and if you find ways to to get the head spinning, it works like its suppose to.</li>
            <li> Scratchy and painful. Don&#x27;t do it. But the real thing. Since using the generic I head I also began breaking out. The real sonic heads have an antibacterial aspect it appears these do  not.</li>
            <li> The brush heads arrived in a manila envelope.  Opened envelope and brush heads where lose in the envelope.  The brush heads were, i guess, originally in a sandwich bag (the fold over flap sandwich bag).  I am disgusted at the packaging and don&#x27;t want to use because I don&#x27;t know if they are used or not.</li>
            <li> I will say that at first I was skeptical that these brush heads would fit my Clarisonic Mia 2 because in the past I bought a generic version and it didn&#x27;t fit at all. These replacement brush heads fit perfectly and at the price I&#x27;m so happy. Clarisonic replacement heads usually cost 25 bucks a pop minimum. These are a life saver!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pay because the high quality ones last much much longer. So in the long run I realized it is cheaper to get the more expensive ones. Also I want to make sure it&#x27;s working the way it is supposed to. But with these you never know</li>
            <li> These brushes are awesome, that work just as well as the original and the price is great. Shipping was fast. I would definitely purchase these again and will recommend to all my friends.</li>
            <li> These are really rough , abrasive and irritates my  face  badly. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> They fit perfectly. I feel the vibration but no spin. The bristles feel fine too. I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> I literally cannot tell the difference between this deep pore cleaning brush head vs. the clarisonic deep pore cleaning brush head. Because they are so inexpensive (not cheap—they&#x27;re very well made), I can change my brush heads more often, thus washing my skin with cleaner brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is happy, my wallet is happy... WIN.</li>
            <li> These fit my Clairsonic Mia perfectly, and they are just as good as the pricier brand-name ones.  I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> Love the replacement heads for my Mia Clarisonic. My sister also bought them and loves them.  You can not beat the price. Ulta sells the same ones for $24 each. That Is crazy</li>
            <li> I am not sure what the real clarisonic brushes are supposed to be like,but these four brushes @ $8.60 were a huge bargain.Compared to the real Clarisonic brushes which would cost $100.After using the brush twice a day for a couple of days my skin was soft and my pores appeared smaller.Thank you very much Amazon for carrying alternatives to the more expensive brand names.</li>
            <li> Awesome, for a fraction of the price! They come unwrapped in a cardboard box, but seem to be identical to Clarisonic brand.</li>
            <li> Terrible cheap alternative.</li>
            <li> Was hesitant to buy these, but sick of paying ridiculous amounts of money for a single replacement head made by the name brand. For the same price I got four, and they last much longer!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found these!  They work exactly the same as the Clarisonic brushes, but at a fraction of the cost.  I can now finally afford to replace my brush heads as often as recommended instead of bleaching my old ones and trying to get every last use out of them! LOL!  Don&#x27;t hesitate to go generic on these.  At this price with the same quality, you certainly won&#x27;t be sorry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emmy from ATL</li>
            <li> These work just like the expensive brand name ones and fit on my mia perfectly! They also last very well.</li>
            <li> I thought about ordering the Clairsonic replacement heads but they are drastically more expensive than these so I figured I&#x27;d give it a go and I have not regretted my decision! They fit perfectly and work amazingly well. I will continue to purchase these in the future.</li>
            <li> Four came in a package only 2 worked. Still cheaper then original brushes</li>
            <li> NOT like the original from the brand name. The brush is a lot softer than the Deep Pore Cleansing Brush and they are &amp;#34;MADE IN CHINA&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I would have not bought if I had known that.</li>
            <li> These are really stiff and rough on my face.  I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin at all, but these made my face raw after only two uses.  I am so disappointed because I read the reviews and most people seemed to have a good experience with them.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s literally no difference between these and the expensive name brand one. Fits perfectly with my sonic.</li>
            <li> Great replacements! Just what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Not sure why other people are having problems. I used this for the first time tonight and it worked wonderfully. I use it on my Mia2. There isn&#x27;t much difference to the Clarisonic brand brush head. I mean, $4 for a four pack compared to $25 for a single Clarisonic brand brush? Um, yes.</li>
            <li> just like the original!</li>
            <li> These are exactly like the clarisonic deep pore brushes! I will be repurchasing when my 4 pack is done. I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Great price. Perfect quality. They&#x27;re just like the clarisonic brushes and fit perfectly. They do their job like they&#x27;re supposed to and thats good enough for me. I don&#x27;t hear a rattling sound or anything like others reviewers have complained about. The brushes i received fit snugly onto my device and clean my face just fine. Will definitely repurchase when these have worn out. These are good money savers and do why they&#x27;re supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Works perfect for my clairisonic and for the price its worth every dollar!!! BUY NOW!!</li>
            <li> Cheap! They smelled sour after a few uses and my Mias battery started to die quickly. I bought better replacements and it works fine now.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work with my Mia 2</li>
            <li> I purchased these knowing they were generic. I have never used the name brand deep pore for comparison. They are very soft. They do not go on as smoothly as the name brand head that came with my clarisonic but they do fit, I would definitely purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the heads don&#x27;t move/transmit the sonic waves as well as the Clarisonic brand name heads do.</li>
            <li> Works just as great as the original.</li>
            <li> These Brush heads fit my clairsonic as as best as I can tell are identical to the Clsirsonic branded brush heads.</li>
            <li> These brushes work just as well as the rediculously overpriced Clarisonic Replacement Brushes.  I highly recommend using these instead.  I saved so much money.  Four of these brushes cost less than one Clarisonic and that includes shipping.</li>
            <li> These work just like the name brand but only for a LOT less.  It did take a while for them to be delivered but I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the deep cleansing brushes (the blue ones). It fit perfectly for my Mia clarisonic but once I started Washing my face with it my skin began to feel irritated. The brush was too rough on my skin and it made my face turn bright red. I will not be ordering these again.</li>
            <li> These generic brush heads are essentially exactly the same as the Clarisonic brand. I&#x27;ve been using one for about a month and the ONLY thing I suspect might be different is the level of quality, as it appears to be deteriorating only slightly faster than the name brand (which I don&#x27;t even mind because of the ridiculously low price). It fits perfectly onto my Clarisonic without issues and cleans my skin like it&#x27;s supposed to. Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> very impressive I pay that much for just one....Thanks</li>
            <li> Just buy the name brand...low quality, doesn&#x27;t exfoliate skin effectively</li>
            <li> it will stuck when use at clarisonic plus,  it was not suggested to buy this one to save money</li>
            <li> Same thing compared to clareisonic brushes,but at a reasonably good price,I will bye again if availability continues,I highly recommend this item.:-)</li>
            <li> My 3rd set of these ordered, complete godsend. Saves me much on replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li> Not remotely the same as the Brand item.</li>
            <li> I now have a &amp;#34;happy face.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Just like name brand heads.</li>
            <li> Love them looks and work just like the real ones you get 4 for 8.00 as a posed to 1 for 27.00 shipped fas</li>
            <li> 4 pack for $30 is awesome considering that 1 brush costs about $30 in the store. They really do give a nice deep clean and my face just glows.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. As I was searching for an alternative to the rather expensive option that the actual Clarisonic brand sells; I found this. At first I wasn&#x27;t sure but for the price definitely wasn&#x27;t easy afraid to gamble and get it a try. I have now used them for a few months and have noticed absolutely no difference between this generic brand and the Clarisonic brand. The only major difference is again the cost which is dramatically much more affordable. Don&#x27;t waste your money on expensive brushes!! These work great!</li>
            <li> Awesome, just like the ridiculously over priced Clarasonic brush..</li>
            <li> These are great. They work great and fit my clearisonic Mia 2. Its great that they are 4 brushes for a lot less than what you could buy at Ulta or Sephora.</li>
            <li> Fits, works just like the clairsonic. quarter of the price! works for me.</li>
            <li> Just what I have been looking for with a much better price. Thank you!</li>
            <li> They work so great I can&#x27;t believe how fast they got here I love them they fit great on my Mia 2 and really work great very happy with these brushes must buy !!!</li>
            <li> They work perfectly fine with my Clarisonic Pro.  I was actually in a store a few days ago about to pick up a single brush head for $29 and something told me to check Amazon.  The reviews for these were pretty good so I decided to try them.  I&#x27;m so happy I did.  I now have a years supply (4 brush heads, which I change every 2-3 months) for less than $12.  They fit perfectly with my Clarisonic without any rattling or odd oscillation.  I am a very happy buyer; I almost want to buy another box just because of the price!</li>
            <li> What a deal.  And they work just like they were made for my Clarisonic.  Oh, they were?  Just not $25 each.  Oh.  Okay.  No clacking, no loose fit.  The deep pore head much more effective (for me) than the original.</li>
            <li> These are probably worth what I paid for them, which was not a lot. While they fit my Clairisonic, you can tell they&#x27;re made with lower quality. The plastic base is made out of a lighter plastic that the brand name brushes and make a rattle noise when in use, which is only a minor annoyance. The reason why I gave this product 3 stars is because the bristles themselves seem different than the brand name brush. I ordered the &amp;#34;Deep Pore Cleansing&amp;#34; version and expected the slightly stiffer bristles for effective cleaning. This product&#x27;s bristles seem too soft in comparison. I will use what I purchased, but will probably go back to the brand name afterwards.</li>
            <li> Works fine with clarisonic</li>
            <li> Fit and work as expected.</li>
            <li> These are very abrasive.  I wish I hadn&#x27;t bought them.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful. They are just like the more expensive Clarisonic brand. I can put them side by side and you cannot tell the difference.</li>
            <li> Good part-- Quality is good, but you Get what you pay for. I have the most expensive clarisonic u can buy. I had about 5-6 brushes when I got it as a gift. Decided they has become too soft and wanted to replace . Saw these and reviews and was sold. Unfortunately they Are not working for me. The brushes don&#x27;t turn on my clarisonic. They just hum. Very sad because price and quality of bristles was good. :(</li>
            <li> Seem like they do the job. I have never used any kind of brush but the Clarasonic original sensitive skin brush so these kind of hurt my face. I have no problems connecting the head into the brush or with the spin either. They would work really well if you have super oily skin and were using maybe three times per week. I&#x27;m still glad I got them though, will continue to use, just not on a daily basis. IMO it was a great deal</li>
            <li> Not quite as good as the brand ones but close enough and the price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> NOT the same as OEM brushes.. spend the money for the real deal, I am next time.</li>
            <li> These were great and work perfect with my Clair.</li>
            <li> We own 2 Clarisonic Mia2s and these replacements do the job just like the originals. The bristles stay in good condition.</li>
            <li> The heads fit well and seem to be of fine quality.  My only gripe is that the bristles seem a lot softer than my Clarisonic ones, so may not cleanse as well.  You sure can&#x27;t beat the price, though, which may explain the difference from the branded heads.</li>
            <li> I had so much hope these would work in my clarisonic but alas they did not.  The vibration/fit of the OEM brushes were noticeable.  They are not cheaply made and 4 for the price point is awesome if they work for you, hence the two stars. Hopefully there will be some generic brushes manufactured that are parallel with the clarisonic brushes because I do feel they are overpriced. But I had to spend it to get the full benefits of my clarisonic that I love!</li>
            <li> These work perfect.  At first I thought it did not fit correctly and made a noise.  But not so after using.  Works perfectly and much better than paying $25 per brush head.  I&#x27;m going to get each type now!  Yea!!!</li>
            <li> These are great! They were a great price, they fit my Clarsonic perfectly and so far, have lasted well.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t want to spend the big $$ on the clarsonic brand replacement heads, these are a great alternative!</li>
            <li> Just like the name brand at a fraction of the cost. Will buy again</li>
            <li> Works fabulous with my expensive face brush. No need to spend 5x&#x27;s the price for name brand replacement heads these are great.</li>
            <li> These are as good as the Clarisonic brand. I actually like these better since the bristles are firmer. Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Exchanged my brush with this and it made my machine feel like new again. My face was washed better than ever and I could not be more satisfied with my purchase. Great price as well!</li>
            <li> I purchased these with the hope of saving money.  The aren&#x27;t the same as clarisonic brushes they are softer.  I would actually say they are about the same as a clarisonic sensitive brush.  I guess my daughter just got some refills since she uses the sensitive brushes.</li>
            <li> Very good brush heads and fit perfectly on my clarisonic!</li>
            <li> As good as the clarisonic ones!</li>
            <li> I have a clairsonic pro about 4yrs old. I thought for $5, if they didn&#x27;t fit if just throw them out.&lt;br /&gt;Fits and works perfectly. Comparing the design to a clairsonic brand there is zero difference.&lt;br /&gt;Possibly will need to change out more often than name brand brush, but 4 heads for $5 will make that ok!&lt;br /&gt;Ordered beginning of December and shipping was supposed to take 8 weeks. Received package in 2 1/2 weeks.</li>
            <li> These fit my Clarisonic and work great, I can&#x27;t tell a difference between the these and the Clarisonic brand. Great deal-so cheap for 4!</li>
