            <li>I do love this product and I use it when I am going out</li>
            <li>so glad I bought this brand.</li>
            <li>I love using it whenever I use mineral foundation to set it and to avoid that powdery look.</li>
            <li>It has a bit of a scent that I would not describe as enjoyable, but it vanishes within seconds from spraying.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a dewy finish which I like.</li>

            <li>but I am glad to report this stuff has really helped keep my make-up on all day!</li>
            <li>I have used this product for over a week now in very hot temps.</li>
            <li>But that does make it fast and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Definitely purchase more than 1 bottle!</li>
            <li>I love the soft dewy glow that it creates and I will be purchasing it again when I run out!</li>
            <li>I may not look as fresh as I started</li>
            <li>Fast and quick drying.</li>
            <li>or I know its going to be a hot day</li>
            <li>I was using Urban Decay spray but UD costs about three times more than this one</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really held up.</li>
            <li>Still have to touch up my makeup, but not as much.</li>
            <li>I spritz this on after I apply my makeup  and find that it sets and holds my makeup despite sometimes intense humidity.</li>
            <li>Really works well.</li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and by the end of my day</li>
            <li>It is alright, but it requires too much to really work.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough positive  things about this mist!  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin look very natural, like I&#x27;m not wearing makeup.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida and use public transportation to get to work.</li>
            <li>I use mineral foundation and this finishing spray gives me just the right amount of dewy look to offset the typically matte look that comes with mineral foundations.</li>
            <li>I sprayed it on early in the AM and my makeup still stayed fresh late at night.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> My face feels so fresh after I put this on! It does not make my face feel saggy, soggy, or coated. In love with this stuff!</li>
            <li> Works great! I tend to sweat when I walk to work and it&#x27;s really held up. I would recommend this!</li>
            <li> I CANT BELIEVE HOW THIS MAKES MY FACE FEELS, AND LEAVES IT WITH A DEWY FINISH</li>
            <li> I love this product o set my make-up. Fast and quick drying. My base make-up lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Still have to touch up my makeup, but not as much.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida and use public transportation to get to work. I spritz this on after I apply my makeup  and find that it sets and holds my makeup despite sometimes intense humidity. A little goes a long way too. The three pack has lasted me almost a year. Great product at a great price! I don&#x27;t even have to retouch my makeup for hours even in the heat. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff! I cannot say enough positive  things about this mist!  Definitely purchase more than 1 bottle!</li>
            <li> Great product. Really works well. I sprayed it on early in the AM and my makeup still stayed fresh late at night.</li>
            <li> a must have for combination and oily T-zone .. it truly helps</li>
            <li> I had a gift card and I was in the market for a setting spray, so why the heck not?! I do love this product and I use it when I am going out or I know its going to be a hot day and my make up may run. This setting spray is amazing and worth the price. It works really well, I have a job where I am constantly running around after kids and it keeps my eyeliner and blush in place. I love the soft dewy glow that it creates and I will be purchasing it again when I run out!</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and by the end of my day all my make-up is gone.  I have used this product for over a week now in very hot temps. I may not look as fresh as I started but I am glad to report this stuff has really helped keep my make-up on all day! I didn&#x27;t give it five stars because  spraying on my face still freaks me out a little.  But that does make it fast and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This stuff works!! I have oily skin and I use L&#x27;Oreal mineral powder foundation , and 7 hrs later alot less oil on my skin and my makeup looks great. It literally looks like I just did my makeup 1/2 hr ago.  Worth the money!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product. This is my second order!</li>
            <li> Im so glad I bought this brand. I was using Urban Decay spray but UD costs about three times more than this one and I saw no difference in quality and longevity. Use only in morning and keeps makeup set all day at work. This is now a staple in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this through extreme heat t and it kept all my makeup in place. I love using it whenever I use mineral foundation to set it and to avoid that powdery look. I just spray it 3 to 4 times from an arm length away after I&#x27;ve done all my makeup and it works wonders. It has a bit of a scent that I would not describe as enjoyable, but it vanishes within seconds from spraying. I&#x27;ll repurchase this for sure - soon!</li>
            <li> It is alright, but it requires too much to really work.</li>
            <li> This is the only setting spray that works for me. It isn&#x27;t matte. It&#x27;s more of a dewy finish which I like.</li>
            <li> Second time ordering it because my mother and I both loved it! It gets the job done and keeps my make up on all day and night!</li>
            <li> love my order. great quality</li>
            <li> My favorite finishing spray.  I use mineral foundation and this finishing spray gives me just the right amount of dewy look to offset the typically matte look that comes with mineral foundations. It makes my skin look very natural, like I&#x27;m not wearing makeup. It also does a good job of setting and holding my makeup in place for the day. Highly recommend.</li>
