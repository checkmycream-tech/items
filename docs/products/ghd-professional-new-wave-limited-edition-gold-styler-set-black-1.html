            <li>GHD is an excellent invest for good healthy hair.</li>
            <li>and she loved it.</li>
            <li>Buy it from an authorized retailer, maybe you think your getting a good deal but</li>
            <li>Highly satisfied!</li>
            <li>&amp;&amp; I love that the heat turns off if you forget to turn it off!</li>
            <li>The GHD is absolutely amazing even without temperature gauge.</li>
            <li>So stylish &amp; really good</li>
            <li>That said, I am not giving a 1 star because the product did come with a nice clutch to hold it</li>
            <li>The clips it comes with will also come in handy.    </li>
            <li>She particularly liked the bag it comes with to carry in.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own bag.  </li>
            <li>She is happy with the product and really excited that it came with</li>
            <li>Excellent product with a fantastic travel case and as usual Amazon has the best price and service around.</li>
            <li>The service was good, product came in quickly.</li>
            <li>The product was definitely authentic.</li>
            <li>and I love how my hair turns out.</li>
            <li>I bought this off sephora.com and was able to register at GHD website.  </li>
            <li>My item was definitely authentic (see the North America authorised retailer list at the end of this review).  </li>
            <li>I was able to register my ghd online</li>
            <li>so it is authentic.  </li>
            <li>Simply the best ever!</li>
            <li>This one it seems make my hair dryer and more brittle.</li>
            <li>O love it.</li>
            <li>it comes with a adorable pouch too!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tracy</li>
            <li>I couldnt have asked for more.</li>
            <li>Truly better than the CHI&#x27;s I&#x27;ve been using for years.  </li>
            <li>LOVE.</li>
            <li>Ever girl I&#x27;ve showed it to fell in love with it too.  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>Bag is really cute.  </li>
            <li>It is okay for her hair</li>
            <li>and i loved it so much i wanted to keep it for myself!</li>
            <li>Might be ok for someone with fine or medium hair that isn&#x27;t that wavy or curly, but for me it just didn&#x27;t get the job done.</li>
            <li>They do not ruin your hair like many other brands, I am so happy to have bought these straighteners!</li>
            <li>Regardless of whether it was an authentic CHI or not, it was smooth and never snagged my hair.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely loved it, up until it stopped heating up as much</li>
            <li>I have wanted a GHD for so long, so I was so excited to receive my very own!</li>
            <li>There are no markations and the swivel makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is hands down the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever used!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>but if you love your hair it worth the money.</li>
            <li>and it heats up in no time with a beep to let you know the tool is ready for use, which is a very nice feature for busy working</li>
            <li>Given the above, I do not feel good at all about the price I paid.  </li>
            <li>The bag it comes in is so cool</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good looking enough for her to carry it in.</li>
            <li>D. Just make sure you always check your vendors, not every vendor on Amazon selling GHD&#x27;s are real.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how they are able to sell these online for so much cheaper than the salons, but it felt great to get this product for 60$ less than what I was about to pay at Sephora!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the real deal!!</li>
            <li>it makes your hair perfectly straight, shiny, and frizz free with one swipe.</li>
            <li>You can put the guard on a hot (turned off) iron and put the iron away (I keep mine in a drawer) without having to wait for it to cool off.</li>
            <li>But I think my old ion was a lot better.</li>
            <li>love it and would never go back to a cheap one.</li>
            <li>Very much worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and somehow they made the professional even better.</li>
            <li>but anyone with fine/medium hair will end up burning their hair pretty quickly -</li>
            <li>and they would refund me for shipping and send out a replacement right away.</li>
            <li>Split ends were happening far more frequently as well - keep in mind that I use the Bamboo Smooth hair protector, so I was prepped.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to any woman who wants a top notch staightener that will last many years to come.  </li>
            <li>and I will be able to fit other items like hair accessories, a brush, etc when I travel.</li>
            <li>GHD warms up in a minute and the add on products are so cute, especially the carry case!</li>
            <li>This is my first ghd</li>
            <li>Authentic ghds should have the reset and test buttons, mine didn&#x27;t also it snagged my hair and took forever to straighten my hair, usually it only takes 10 minutes to straighten my hair, it took over an HOUR to straighten my hair with this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not the type to just splurge on any one thing unless I&#x27;ve done the proper research, so where better than Sephora.</li>
            <li>That said, the previous reviewer did get the code verified, so this retailer may be a good source to go for a much lower price.</li>
            <li>Love my flat iron</li>
            <li>Love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this product and made sure that the supplier was Amazon rather than other independent suppliers to make sure it was not a fake product.</li>
            <li>Easy straightening, simple, crease-free curling.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my hair straight in Houston, TX where the humidity is often 100% in the summer.  </li>
            <li>and it still heats up fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not one to really style up my hair, but once my friend introduced me to a straightener, I was hooked.</li>
            <li>Hair is so straight.</li>
            <li>I purchased GHD because of all the raving reviews, my hairdresser&#x27;s recommendation, and especially the travel friendly feature (works up to 240V)</li>
            <li>your better off buying it from an authorized retailer or Sephora and paying full price, but at least you get the real</li>
            <li>Way to better that other brands, is a pricy</li>
            <li>pros - heats up super fast; small and easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>I returned it and purchased the HAI convertible Blue Sapphire flat iron from Amazon and so far I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I am a believer in paying  a little more for hair tools, because they last and the quality is worth it!</li>
            <li>I just wish the bag was a little easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;Also, while it heats up super fast, it also gets very hot.  </li>
            <li>I decided that the evidence was insurmountable that I should probably spring for the GHD Classic, so I did.</li>
            <li>Also, I would highly recommend buying from this supplier.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product and the supplier.</li>
            <li>Luckily I was able to send it back and get my money, but please don&#x27;t Waste your money.</li>
            <li>I find that the GHD leaves my hair so much softer, as it doesn&#x27;t pull your hair, its soft on the hair.</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying my normal hair routine is: shower, comb, air-dry,</li>
            <li>The classic GHD I purchased also has a 2-yr warranty (I&#x27;m returning the GHD Classic to Sephora and keeping the GHD Professional from Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Amazon-sold version registered A-OK on the GHD website with the 2 year warranty and came with everything advertised in the box, and was clearly brand new!</li>
            <li>If you plan on using this every day or every other day, it is so worth it!    </li>
            <li>I like the fact that it heats up fast, I like it enough that I am not thinking about buying a new one.  </li>
            <li>I believe the one she had was a Chi, but seeing as how I have waist-level long wavy asian hair, I didn&#x27;t see the need to get something super high end.</li>
            <li>Hard pressed to find a better product for this price on the market.</li>
            <li>The GHD also finishes your hair in a quick amount of time compared to other hair products.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this.  </li>
            <li>My hair is still straight the next day, up until I decide to shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>T3 single pass was the first change in my hair routine.</li>
            <li>i would rather let my hair do what it wants, than struggle with anyone elses flat iron...</li>
            <li>The GHD professional apparently has aluminum as well and has a cooler barrel that isn&#x27;t prone to over heating.</li>
            <li>Yes, its a little pricey, but totally worth it.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not coarse, but has a lot of natural wave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely check that one out if you are searching for a new flat iron.</li>
            <li>purchased the GHD New Wave Limited Edition because it was on MyHabit.com (Amazon&#x27;s version of ideeli if you didn&#x27;t know!)</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this based on Ghd&#x27;s reputation and the other reviews.</li>

            <li> The GHD professional apparently has aluminum as well and has a cooler barrel that isn&#x27;t prone to over heating.</li>
            <li> Yes, its a little pricey, but totally worth it.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not coarse, but has a lot of natural wave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely check that one out if you are searching for a new flat iron.</li>
            <li> purchased the GHD New Wave Limited Edition because it was on MyHabit.com (Amazon&#x27;s version of ideeli if you didn&#x27;t know!)</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this based on Ghd&#x27;s reputation and the other reviews.</li>
            <li> ghd Professional New Wave Limited Edition Gold Styler Set, Black, 1&amp;#34;......</li>
            <li> Also, this arrived to my doorstep in New Zealand in less than 5 days.  </li>
            <li> Given that I wasn&#x27;t going to spring for the more expensive item, the Sultra, I opted for the T3 Single Pass since you could adjust the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace my silver bullet flat iron which cost me over $100 AUD where as this one was $130 USD.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t heat to the point where i can&#x27;t run my hands through where I just flat ironed.</li>
            <li> and hopefully it lasts long, but there is a 2 year warranty on it from ghd anyways.</li>
            <li> However, this product is not good for straightening my hair (Asian hair); it does a decent job for curling though.</li>
            <li> The maindifferences are actually on the GHD hair website, so don&#x27;t try to read too closely into what other people are saying that it&#x27;s just the 2 yr warranty.  </li>
            <li> It sits very loosely and is always coming off.  </li>
            <li> Even then it took forever because my hair would keep slipping out of it.</li>
            <li> beauty sent me an iron that had a small scratch on the ceramic plate, so I contacted them the same day I received it</li>
            <li> I did my research on Folica.com and other places</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t damaged my hair like every other one I&#x27;ve tried...</li>
            <li> bought this for my daughter who uses a flat iron daily and has very thick, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Absolute FAKE</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent product with a fantastic travel case and as usual Amazon has the best price and service around.Hard pressed to find a better product for this price on the market.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product &amp; its results! I find that the GHD leaves my hair so much softer, as it doesn&#x27;t pull your hair, its soft on the hair. The GHD also finishes your hair in a quick amount of time compared to other hair products.&lt;br /&gt;With the babyliss I finished my hair in 1 hour, whereas the GHD finished my hair in 30min or less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The GHD warms up in a minute and the add on products are so cute, especially the carry case! So stylish &amp; really good material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The GHD is an excellent invest for good healthy hair. I could not find anything I was not happy with.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and made sure that the supplier was Amazon rather than other independent suppliers to make sure it was not a fake product. I was a little worried but the item shipped in a week and I verified it on ghdhair.com. The product was definitely authentic. Very happy with my purchase! This is my first ghd but i&#x27;ve been to salons that use ghd exclusively and I love how my hair turns out. Can&#x27;t wait to use it and hopefully it lasts long, but there is a 2 year warranty on it from ghd anyways. Bought this to replace my silver bullet flat iron which cost me over $100 AUD where as this one was $130 USD. great purchase</li>
            <li> The service was good, product came in quickly. However, this product is not good for straightening my hair (Asian hair); it does a decent job for curling though.</li>
            <li> I bought this off sephora.com and was able to register at GHD website.  My item was definitely authentic (see the North America authorised retailer list at the end of this review).  I purchased GHD because of all the raving reviews, my hairdresser&#x27;s recommendation, and especially the travel friendly feature (works up to 240V) so I can use it in Europe and Asia.  However, I was quite disappointed at the product because it constantly snags my hair, which is thin and flat to begin with.  I bought a CHI from Amazon before.  Regardless of whether it was an authentic CHI or not, it was smooth and never snagged my hair.  I gave it away to my sister because she had to have it when she used mine.  Maybe everyone&#x27;s hair texture and tolerance to snagging are different, but I found it very annoying every time I use it.  The heating plate shield that comes with the product does not stay on well at all.  It sits very loosely and is always coming off.  Given the above, I do not feel good at all about the price I paid.  That said, I am not giving a 1 star because the product did come with a nice clutch to hold it and it heats up in no time with a beep to let you know the tool is ready for use, which is a very nice feature for busy working moms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a list of GHD North America authorized retailers according to GHD Professional North America as of November 21, 2011: ghdhairusa.com, sephora.com, folica.com, beautyencounter.com, trade secret, sephora, and planet beauty stores.  They specifically cautioned me that ASAP Beauty is not an authorized dealer and the authenticity is not guaranteed.  That said, the previous reviewer did get the code verified, so this retailer may be a good source to go for a much lower price.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome iron! I bought it to replace my ghd 2 inch iron that I bought 5 yrs ago.  I am a believer in paying  a little more for hair tools, because they last and the quality is worth it! It keeps my hair straight in Houston, TX where the humidity is often 100% in the summer.  I would highly recommend this to any woman who wants a top notch staightener that will last many years to come.  If you plan on using this every day or every other day, it is so worth it!    The bag it comes in is so cool and I will be able to fit other items like hair accessories, a brush, etc when I travel. And I like the guard it comes with. You can put the guard on a hot (turned off) iron and put the iron away (I keep mine in a drawer) without having to wait for it to cool off. The clips it comes with will also come in handy.    Also, I would highly recommend buying from this supplier. I was able to register my ghd online so it is authentic.  ASAP beauty sent me an iron that had a small scratch on the ceramic plate, so I contacted them the same day I received it and they promptly replied, telling me to send it back and they would refund me for shipping and send out a replacement right away. They did just that! I don&#x27;t know how they are able to sell these online for so much cheaper than the salons, but it felt great to get this product for 60$ less than what I was about to pay at Sephora!</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this.  I had a problem with it and its still under warrenty if its gold series so I sent it to GHD.  They returned it and said it is conterfit!  How disappointing!!!!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but I wanted to let everyone know- it&#x27;s the real deal!! I was hesitant to buy because there were previous reviews that stated this was a ripoff/fake product. Nope! The Amazon-sold version registered A-OK on the GHD website with the 2 year warranty and came with everything advertised in the box, and was clearly brand new! Highly satisfied!</li>
            <li> I bought it for her and she loved it. She particularly liked the bag it comes with to carry in. Albeit a little bulky it&#x27;s good looking enough for her to carry it in.</li>
            <li> Absolute FAKE, I bought this for myself as a birthday gift and it&#x27;s an absolute fake. Authentic ghds should have the reset and test buttons, mine didn&#x27;t also it snagged my hair and took forever to straighten my hair, usually it only takes 10 minutes to straighten my hair, it took over an HOUR to straighten my hair with this. Luckily I was able to send it back and get my money, but please don&#x27;t Waste your money. Buy it from an authorized retailer, maybe you think your getting a good deal but your better off buying it from an authorized retailer or Sephora and paying full price, but at least you get the real product.&lt;br /&gt;COMPLETE FAIL</li>
            <li> Love my flat iron ive had it a few yrs now and it still heats up fast. When im at friends and family&#x27;s i would rather let my hair do what it wants, than struggle with anyone elses flat iron...</li>
            <li> Excellent!! Simply the best ever! They do not ruin your hair like many other brands, I am so happy to have bought these straighteners! I would recommend them to everyone!</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it heats up fast, I like it enough that I am not thinking about buying a new one.  But I think my old ion was a lot better. This one it seems make my hair dryer and more brittle.</li>
            <li> Excelente, mercadoria no prazo, em perfeito estado, o vendedor muito atencioso, forma de pagamento correta. Sem problemas com a mercadoria ou com o vendedor.</li>
            <li> I have wanted a GHD for so long, so I was so excited to receive my very own! O love it. There were concerns it could be s fake, but it definitely isn&#x27;t. I checked the code with the GHD website for the warranty and everything is great.&lt;br /&gt;I love it and would never go back to a cheap one. Very much worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product and the supplier.</li>
            <li> ghd Professional New Wave Limited Edition Gold Styler Set, Black, 1&amp;#34;......tAmazing....extremely happy with my GHD!!!! Any it comes with a adorable pouch too!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tracy</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying my normal hair routine is: shower, comb, air-dry, and then I&#x27;m out the door.  I&#x27;m not one to really style up my hair, but once my friend introduced me to a straightener, I was hooked. I believe the one she had was a Chi, but seeing as how I have waist-level long wavy asian hair, I didn&#x27;t see the need to get something super high end. I&#x27;m not the type to just splurge on any one thing unless I&#x27;ve done the proper research, so where better than Sephora. Speaking with one of the sales folks, she mentioned the GHD, but I was wary of the fact that it would cost me $185 and that there was no adjustable temperature. Given that I wasn&#x27;t going to spring for the more expensive item, the Sultra, I opted for the T3 Single Pass since you could adjust the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The T3 single pass was the first change in my hair routine. I absolutely loved it, up until it stopped heating up as much and I noticed that my once lovely-air-dried hair was starting to poof instead without it. Split ends were happening far more frequently as well - keep in mind that I use the Bamboo Smooth hair protector, so I was prepped. I know there is no such thing as a non-damaging hair straightener. I decided that the evidence was insurmountable that I should probably spring for the GHD Classic, so I did. The difference in use is astounding! If you are ever contemplating getting the GHD vs. T3, JUST DO IT. The GHD is absolutely amazing even without temperature gauge. It doesn&#x27;t heat to the point where i can&#x27;t run my hands through where I just flat ironed. There are no markations and the swivel makes it easy to use. My hair is still straight the next day, up until I decide to shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the GHD New Wave Limited Edition because it was on MyHabit.com (Amazon&#x27;s version of ideeli if you didn&#x27;t know!) and somehow they made the professional even better. The GHD professional apparently has aluminum as well and has a cooler barrel that isn&#x27;t prone to over heating. The maindifferences are actually on the GHD hair website, so don&#x27;t try to read too closely into what other people are saying that it&#x27;s just the 2 yr warranty.  The classic GHD I purchased also has a 2-yr warranty (I&#x27;m returning the GHD Classic to Sephora and keeping the GHD Professional from Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On fakes, starting in the latter 2000&#x27;s GHD started manufacturing in China as well as South Korea, so don&#x27;t freak out on where it&#x27;s made. It&#x27;s a business for grief sake, no one gives a damn that your preference is made not in China. I inputed the hologram code &amp; date code and I am validated :D. Just make sure you always check your vendors, not every vendor on Amazon selling GHD&#x27;s are real. Just don&#x27;t be stupid about buying and you&#x27;ll be good to go!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift and i loved it so much i wanted to keep it for myself! Also, this arrived to my doorstep in New Zealand in less than 5 days.  I couldnt have asked for more.</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron.  Yes, its a little pricey, but totally worth it.  Truly better than the CHI&#x27;s I&#x27;ve been using for years.  I&#x27;ll never go back.  Easy straightening, simple, crease-free curling.  LOVE.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this based on Ghd&#x27;s reputation and the other reviews. I should have paid attention to the few reviews that mentioned hair snagging! This flat iron snagged my hair like crazy the one time I used it and the tension on the iron part was very low. I have a lot of hair...it&#x27;s not coarse, but has a lot of natural wave. And with this flat iron I had to squeeze it like crazy just to get it to sufficiently grab and straighten my hair. Even then it took forever because my hair would keep slipping out of it. Might be ok for someone with fine or medium hair that isn&#x27;t that wavy or curly, but for me it just didn&#x27;t get the job done. I returned it and purchased the HAI convertible Blue Sapphire flat iron from Amazon and so far I LOVE it! It was also about $30 dollars cheaper. I did my research on Folica.com and other places and they named the HAI one of the best. I&#x27;d definitely check that one out if you are searching for a new flat iron. It&#x27;s fantastic. And my hair is not easy to straighten.</li>
            <li> no good news, this ghd I had about 4 week and it is already not working anymore.&lt;br /&gt;It does not get hot.&lt;br /&gt;What can I do?&lt;br /&gt;Where should I get it returned, can I send it back to you?&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Monika</li>
            <li> My girlfriend introduced me to this... she brought hers over from Ireland.  It is hands down the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever used!  I was SO happy to find it here... I was afraid it was only a European product.  Ever girl I&#x27;ve showed it to fell in love with it too.  :)  Amazon will be selling a bunch of them!  :)  It hasn&#x27;t damaged my hair like every other one I&#x27;ve tried... it heats up instantly... it makes your hair perfectly straight, shiny, and frizz free with one swipe.</li>
            <li> I used this iron in Chile, Brasil, Colombia, Spain and USA and it had work perfectly. Way to better that other brands, is a pricy I know but if you love your hair it worth the money.</li>
            <li> This baby is the bomb!!! Hair is so straight. &amp;&amp; I love that the heat turns off if you forget to turn it off!</li>
            <li> pros - heats up super fast; small and easy to handle.  also came with a heat protector so you can pack up before it cools down.  Bag is really cute.  cord is really long for anyone that does not have a convenient outlet.&lt;br /&gt;cons - difficult to get into and out of the bag that it comes with, cannot control the temperature&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for my daughter who uses a flat iron daily and has very thick, curly hair.  She is happy with the product and really excited that it came with it&#x27;s own bag.  I just wish the bag was a little easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;Also, while it heats up super fast, it also gets very hot.  It is okay for her hair but anyone with fine/medium hair will end up burning their hair pretty quickly - opt for one that allows you to adjust the temperature instead.</li>
