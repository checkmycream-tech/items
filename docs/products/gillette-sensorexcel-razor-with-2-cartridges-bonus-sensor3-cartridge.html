    <ol>
            <li>/&gt;The dealer provided me with prompt and great service too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li>price was the best i found in my searches for this product.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, changing a products solely for the sake of novelty and increasing prices is not the best way to go about it.</li>
            <li>me, this razor is still the best.</li>
            <li>Awesome!  </li>
            <li>I forgot how great these razor handles are!  </li>
            <li>the best shaves</li>
            <li>A twin blade is still the best razor in my opinion and always will be.</li>
            <li>A twin blade is still the best razor in my opinion and always will be.</li>
            <li>Considering I cant use these three bladed razors, and thats ALL anybody sells, I was very happy to have found a  razor I can still use!  </li>
            <li>Very happy with the results!!</li>
            <li>My Husband is very Happy with this item.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
            <li>great price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Get yourself a handful of these and save some money while still looking great.</li>
            <li>She is happy, I am happy.</li>
            <li>This razor is great.</li>
            <li>As to the Sensor Excell: Great razor.</li>
            <li>Great product and</li>
            <li>Love this razor!!</li>
            <li>The newer models of Gillette shavers, the Mach 3 and the Fusion, are vastly superior to the Sensor</li>
            <li>Gives a good shave without all the bells and whistles on newer style razors.</li>
            <li>Just a good shave</li>
            <li>I always loved sensor excel.</li>
            <li>The up side is the Sensor blades are an improvement over the Trac II as they were intended to be (as well as the Atra) providing a superior shave over all.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t give as good a shave as the twin blade and again the cost.  </li>
            <li>trade - fair priced.</li>
            <li>It was a good price for what I got them for.</li>
            <li>more blades is not always better, the twin blade has always gave me the best shave.  </li>
            <li>The handles are great, seems like you can&#x27;t find them in the stores any more.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my order.</li>
            <li>It probably seems a trifle thing now, but years ago, it was truly amazing and to me, still is.  </li>
            <li>I own the Gillette Atra (1977), [[ASIN:B000065AB0 Mach 3]] (1998), [[ASIN:B000BUUVTE Fusion]]</li>
            <li>Nice shaver.</li>
            <li>I bought this because my electric and 5-blades irritated my skin too much; these are the perfect mix of functionality but also comfort.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s kind</li>
            <li>A high quality bristle like a silver tip will give you the greatest shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Superior to the original SensorExcel - nice rubber grips.</li>
            <li>Regardless, this Razor combined with the original Sensor blades is the best for an easy, comfortable, close shave.</li>
            <li>The interesting thing is the blade attached to the razor  has 3 blades.</li>
            <li>It appears Gillette is phasing this out to make more profit from their fancier products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the triple blades, but I like this one better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>On my face I use a different razor with a quattro design, but this is absolutely perfect for my neck.</li>
            <li>very prompt and great communication.</li>
            <li>Anyone want to buy one from me?  :-)</li>
            <li>No matter how they&#x27;re marketed, I feel they&#x27;re nothing but a gimmick, and all they do for me is increase razor burn by a factor of 2 or more.</li>
            <li>Glad Amazon had this as I could not find it anywhere..</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be more happier.</li>
            <li>I love my Sensor Excels.</li>
            <li>Amazon is my favorite on line store...</li>
            <li>Even with all the  supposed innovations in shaving blades, more blades, etc, the Sensor is still my go-to favorite.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I get a better shave with three or four</li>
            <li>The drugstore did not carry them any more, replaced with \\&quot;newer\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I am reunited with my favorite razor once again.</li>
            <li>Take a look around amazon here, I&#x27;m sure there are pics you can see for yourself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure by the time you read this, amazon will have updated the image.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>matter which razor you prefer, you can thank Gillette for the technology that has made razors of all kinds, work better and are safer to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve just about reached the end of the road:)  </li>
            <li>I also prefer the more lightweight feel of this razor as compared to the Fusion.  </li>
            <li>Went to so many stores to find this and all I found was the cartridges and not the razor.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find these in stores for years.</li>
            <li>The price was okay.  </li>
            <li>A bonus Sensor3 cartridge was included, making this an even better deal.</li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;m shaving around a nick right now that I got from that &#x27;superior&#x27;</li>
            <li>Sure, it&#x27;s a fine razor, but $21 bucks reduced from $36?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other, non-disposable, razors and these are the BEST a man can get.</li>
            <li>The better cartridges fit this handle and those are the ones I will be buying from now on.</li>
            <li>The best wet shaving system, never nicks or cuts.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This razor is by far my favorite of all time!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m like many guys that have given reviews for the original Sensor (NOT Excel) razor blades and swear by them over anything else out there.</li>
            <li>Anyway, my original Sensor razor finally broke and this Razor is awesome to use with your original Sensor blades.</li>
            <li>The product is compact and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li>I had the earliest design of this handle for almost 23 years and it worked fine.</li>
            <li>This razor has proved to be better than my old one, and I am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best razor I have ever used, I highly recommend buying plus the price was right!  </li>
            <li>I always have to hunt these perfect razors down for my husband!</li>
            <li>My triple and five blade razors don&#x27;t shave me any closer, and the smaller excel blade works great under the nose where the fatter blades don&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>and it came with a Sensor 3 cartridge as a free trial.</li>
            <li>That razor is available any number of places for about $5 bucks.</li>
            <li>for the Sensor Excel isn&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li>Genuine Gillette.  </li>
            <li>This causes the blade to clog with hair and not cut as smoothly.</li>
            <li>If you use those shaving creams, don&#x27;t go cheap on the badger brush.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need it to vibrate, light up, gel my face, make toast.</li>
            <li>This order came with three razors, I gave one to my father in law to enjoy.</li>
            <li>Perfectly smooth with no residual stubble.  </li>
            <li>so proudly we hailed at the twilight&#x27;s last gleaming?</li>
            <li>More importantly, the SensorExcel Razor maintains the pitch of the blades at a normal, upright/90-degree angle enabling me to shave with the handle at a more comfortable orientation of my hand (sort of like making a fist &amp; stroking your face with all 4 finger-nails simultaneously -- that angle).  </li>
            <li>with significant improvements in shaving technology today, the Gillette Sensor Excel just doesn&#x27;t quite cut it anymore.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied and surprised with this product.</li>
            <li>Have tried other shavers but the Sensor Excel is still my favorite - Glides smoothly and gives a good quick shave.</li>
            <li>blade cartridge already installed that is waaay superior to the standard 2 blade cartridges of the original.</li>
            <li>I love so much.</li>
            <li>It works as good or better than 3, 4, or 5 blades and is about half the cost.</li>
            <li>It requires more strokes to shave an area than either the Mach 3 and the Fusion, and thus it is more likely to cause irritated skin or razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other reviews have indicated the technology is old, that Gillette&#x27;s Mach III is far superior, I strongly disagree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Price is what drives so many of us on this search for a different and better razor as the prices are almost extortion for what you get.</li>
            <li>Also; now that the Sensor is out of production and the Trac II is back (from Russia) and there are so many company&#x27;s that still make the handle...and Gillette has never stopped making the blades (as well as Personna who wrote me and told me they had no intention of ending production of the twin blades for Trac II in the foreseeable future)I&#x27;ll always be able to get the blades for between $8.49 (Personna/CVS pack of 20) to 17.89 (Gillette pack of 10 or $12.99 can be found) and</li>
            <li>Very fast shipper!</li>
            <li>Twin Blade razor offers an excellent shave with less irritation for me.  </li>
            <li>This is the best razor ever and getting very hard to find.  </li>
            <li>They cut close and, after I use them to shave, they clean well when I shake them under the hot water.</li>
            <li>, twin blades may or may not cut as well as three blades, I rarely purchase the 3 blade versions for this razor</li>
            <li>this razor functions, I rarely, if ever, get a razor nick...</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s economical for me to stay with the Trac II razor and blades.</li>
            <li>Again: The Sensor is great and sad to see it go but wish the blades cost less.seeable future)I&#x27;ll always be able to get the blades for between $8.49 (Personna/CVS pack of 20) to 17.89 (Gillette pack of 10 or $12.99 can be found) and that&#x27;s economical for me to stay with the Trac II razor and blades.</li>
            <li>The original razor took these older blades that were  about $4 to$5 dollars</li>
            <li>Reasonable and quick deriver.  </li>
            <li>all the razors, the Gillette Mach 3 clearly hits the sweet spot for performance, comfort, and price (affordability) -- i.e. it does a reasonably good job with minimal discomfort at a price that&#x27;s not too exorbitant.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I could not find this razor in stores because they tend to carry only the latest models.</li>
            <li>The price is a bit higher than it should be.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, cartridges for the Sensor have a higher price nowadays.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Years ago, when this razor first came to market, I can still remember reading about the technology Gillette had to invent to produce this razor.  </li>
            <li>After 20+ years, it was the first of it</li>
            <li>This is the best men&#x27;s razor ever made and you are wrong if you think otherwise.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what we were looking for.  </li>
            <li>I only need one to shave and 2 is okay.  </li>
            <li>Just do the math the next time you are looking at the Mach 24 or whatever as to how much you pay for how many blades.  </li>
            <li>The last of my Sensor razor broke last week, and I was delighted to find them</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t cost that much when it first came out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because it&#x27;s only a twin blade, it&#x27;s thinner and maneuvers easily.</li>
            <li>I am not a big fan of the new razors with 3 or more blades.</li>
            <li>I bought a new set from my local store and they seem much sharper and they give a better shave than the on-line ones.</li>
            <li>I loved my Gilette sensor Excell, nice shave without those crazy prices to buy new blades.</li>
            <li>shaves just fine and the blades last longer...</li>
            <li>First I thought the price was too high for a razor, then I realized that I was getting three.</li>
            <li>, it costs almost as much as the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Very good...excellent response</li>
            <li>The aluminum handles feel very solidly built, and the rubberized grip is comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>The Gillette SensorExcel razor seems to be no longer available at local retailers and the 2-blade cartridges</li>
            <li>Bought for my wife, because they are the only razors that she is comfortable with.</li>
            <li>Very close shave and not too bulky.  </li>
            <li>was worth what I spent until I found my old favorite on line, just looking that maybe they were still around.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t cause irritation to skin , it&#x27;s very smooth, sharp and I like the quality</li>
            <li>My original Gillette Sensor Razor finally broke after around 20 years of service.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and no matter how much shaving cream you use, or how gently you shave, even three blades is too much.</li>
            <li>As long as they&#x27;re available, I will keep using these razors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on a shaving &#x27;kick&#x27; for about a year now and have tried several different razors from vintage D/E to triple blades in search for the \\&quot;Perfect Shave\\&quot;...at least for my face</li>
            <li>Its only redeeming quality is the relatively low price of its replacement cartridges.</li>
            <li>Razor Blades just keep getting more and more expensive, it&#x27;s now cheaper to buy these razors than it is to buy the blade refills when</li>
            <li>Gillette Sensor Excel was highly rated in its heyday but</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>an effortless, painless, high quality shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>they changed to gripping mechanism for the razor blades, the older blades will not fit, now I do not know what blades to buy.</li>
            <li>The rest of the blades were the normal excel sensor blades.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure what I ordered since the details were plain.</li>
            <li>New condition.  </li>
            <li>The new models they keep coming up with are just pur gimmick and rediculous.</li>
            <li>(3) three \\&quot;Gillette SensorExcel Razors\\&quot; I have been looking for this particular razor to replace my old \\&quot;Gillette Sensor\\&quot;...</li>
            <li>This is far and away improved over that!</li>
            <li>Exact same razor.</li>
            <li>Exact same razor.</li>
            <li>The blades cost less, cut just as comfortable, expecially if Ive skipped a day over the weekend and cut almost as close as the triple blade replacement.  </li>
            <li>It had what was shown clearly.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m old school, but the Sensor Excel gets the job done, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about losing a couple of layers of epidermis while shaving.</li>
            <li>Also try this product with a quality shaving cream like Avery, Truefitt and Hill, or Taylor of Old Bond Street.</li>
            <li>My old sensor razor had started to rust on the springs after 10+ years of soft water exposure.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised to get</li>
            <li>My shave with the \\&quot;old school\\&quot; twin blade Sensor Excel is just as close</li>
            <li>and I prefer it for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>When I use the Fusion Pro Glide Power, I get too much irritation, even though I use proper shaving technique and skin preparation.  </li>
            <li>Oh, say can you see by the dawn&#x27;s early light&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>But if I use proper prep and good products the Trac II has very little drag if at all</li>
            <li>Lathered up the first time with CVS Gel for sensitive skin after first applying a small amount of Proaso Pre-Shave purchased here at Amazon and shaved with the grain, re-lathered and shaved against the grain.  </li>
            <li>These things are solid and they&#x27;re made out of metal unlike most of the womanly competition out there with 6,000,000 razors that are thinner than electrons and leave you feeling like your face got dry humped by the business ends of a badger and a porcupine at the same time.</li>
            <li>Just a new look doing same results.</li>
            <li>I left my razor at a hotel on a recent trip and could really tell the difference when using a disposable razor.  </li>
            <li>and it is much easier to have all of them with the same razors instead of buying different cartridges for all three.</li>
            <li>only twin blades, the Sensor Excel takes a longer time to complete a shave compared to a 3-, 4-, or 5-blade razor.</li>
            <li>Newer razors have such a floppy cartridge mount that the cartridge flops over so far</li>
            <li>-up&amp;#34; orientation and then brushing your face with the very tip of your thumbnail -- not very ergonomic).</li>
            <li>Again: The Sensor is great and sad to see it go but wish the blades cost less.</li>
            <li>The twin blades get dull rather quickly compared to the Mach 3 and the Fusion.</li>
            <li>It shaves the hard-to-reach tight spots very well (like just under the nose, for example.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Nice shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my electric and 5-blades irritated my skin too much; these are the perfect mix of functionality but also comfort.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s kind</li>
            <li> A high quality bristle like a silver tip will give you the greatest shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Superior to the original SensorExcel - nice rubber grips.</li>
            <li> Regardless, this Razor combined with the original Sensor blades is the best for an easy, comfortable, close shave.</li>
            <li> The interesting thing is the blade attached to the razor  has 3 blades.</li>
            <li> It appears Gillette is phasing this out to make more profit from their fancier products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the triple blades, but I like this one better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> On my face I use a different razor with a quattro design, but this is absolutely perfect for my neck.</li>
            <li> very prompt and great communication.</li>
            <li> Anyone want to buy one from me?  :-)</li>
            <li> No matter how they&#x27;re marketed, I feel they&#x27;re nothing but a gimmick, and all they do for me is increase razor burn by a factor of 2 or more.</li>
            <li> Glad Amazon had this as I could not find it anywhere..</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be more happier.</li>
            <li> I love my Sensor Excels.</li>
            <li> Amazon is my favorite on line store...</li>
            <li> Even with all the  supposed innovations in shaving blades, more blades, etc, the Sensor is still my go-to favorite.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I get a better shave with three or four</li>
            <li> The drugstore did not carry them any more, replaced with \\&quot;newer\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I am reunited with my favorite razor once again.</li>
            <li> Take a look around amazon here, I&#x27;m sure there are pics you can see for yourself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure by the time you read this, amazon will have updated the image.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> matter which razor you prefer, you can thank Gillette for the technology that has made razors of all kinds, work better and are safer to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve just about reached the end of the road:)  </li>
            <li> I also prefer the more lightweight feel of this razor as compared to the Fusion.  </li>
            <li> Went to so many stores to find this and all I found was the cartridges and not the razor.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find these in stores for years.</li>
            <li> The price was okay.  </li>
            <li> A bonus Sensor3 cartridge was included, making this an even better deal.</li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;m shaving around a nick right now that I got from that &#x27;superior&#x27;</li>
            <li> Sure, it&#x27;s a fine razor, but $21 bucks reduced from $36?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other, non-disposable, razors and these are the BEST a man can get.</li>
            <li> The better cartridges fit this handle and those are the ones I will be buying from now on.</li>
            <li> The best wet shaving system, never nicks or cuts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This razor is by far my favorite of all time!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m like many guys that have given reviews for the original Sensor (NOT Excel) razor blades and swear by them over anything else out there.</li>
            <li> Anyway, my original Sensor razor finally broke and this Razor is awesome to use with your original Sensor blades.</li>
            <li> The product is compact and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li> I had the earliest design of this handle for almost 23 years and it worked fine.</li>
            <li> This razor has proved to be better than my old one, and I am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best razor I have ever used, I highly recommend buying plus the price was right!  </li>
            <li> I always have to hunt these perfect razors down for my husband!</li>
            <li> My triple and five blade razors don&#x27;t shave me any closer, and the smaller excel blade works great under the nose where the fatter blades don&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> and it came with a Sensor 3 cartridge as a free trial.</li>
            <li> That razor is available any number of places for about $5 bucks.</li>
            <li> for the Sensor Excel isn&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li> Genuine Gillette.  </li>
            <li> This causes the blade to clog with hair and not cut as smoothly.</li>
            <li> If you use those shaving creams, don&#x27;t go cheap on the badger brush.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need it to vibrate, light up, gel my face, make toast.</li>
            <li> This order came with three razors, I gave one to my father in law to enjoy.</li>
            <li> Perfectly smooth with no residual stubble.  </li>
            <li> so proudly we hailed at the twilight&#x27;s last gleaming?</li>
            <li> More importantly, the SensorExcel Razor maintains the pitch of the blades at a normal, upright/90-degree angle enabling me to shave with the handle at a more comfortable orientation of my hand (sort of like making a fist &amp; stroking your face with all 4 finger-nails simultaneously -- that angle).  </li>
            <li> with significant improvements in shaving technology today, the Gillette Sensor Excel just doesn&#x27;t quite cut it anymore.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied and surprised with this product.</li>
            <li> Have tried other shavers but the Sensor Excel is still my favorite - Glides smoothly and gives a good quick shave.</li>
            <li> blade cartridge already installed that is waaay superior to the standard 2 blade cartridges of the original.</li>
            <li> I love so much.</li>
            <li> It works as good or better than 3, 4, or 5 blades and is about half the cost.</li>
            <li> It requires more strokes to shave an area than either the Mach 3 and the Fusion, and thus it is more likely to cause irritated skin or razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other reviews have indicated the technology is old, that Gillette&#x27;s Mach III is far superior, I strongly disagree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Price is what drives so many of us on this search for a different and better razor as the prices are almost extortion for what you get.</li>
            <li> Also; now that the Sensor is out of production and the Trac II is back (from Russia) and there are so many company&#x27;s that still make the handle...and Gillette has never stopped making the blades (as well as Personna who wrote me and told me they had no intention of ending production of the twin blades for Trac II in the foreseeable future)I&#x27;ll always be able to get the blades for between $8.49 (Personna/CVS pack of 20) to 17.89 (Gillette pack of 10 or $12.99 can be found) and</li>
            <li> Very fast shipper!</li>
            <li> Twin Blade razor offers an excellent shave with less irritation for me.  </li>
            <li> This is the best razor ever and getting very hard to find.  </li>
            <li> They cut close and, after I use them to shave, they clean well when I shake them under the hot water.</li>
            <li> , twin blades may or may not cut as well as three blades, I rarely purchase the 3 blade versions for this razor</li>
            <li> this razor functions, I rarely, if ever, get a razor nick...</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s economical for me to stay with the Trac II razor and blades.</li>
            <li> Again: The Sensor is great and sad to see it go but wish the blades cost less.seeable future)I&#x27;ll always be able to get the blades for between $8.49 (Personna/CVS pack of 20) to 17.89 (Gillette pack of 10 or $12.99 can be found) and that&#x27;s economical for me to stay with the Trac II razor and blades.</li>
            <li> The original razor took these older blades that were  about $4 to$5 dollars</li>
            <li> Reasonable and quick deriver.  </li>
            <li> all the razors, the Gillette Mach 3 clearly hits the sweet spot for performance, comfort, and price (affordability) -- i.e. it does a reasonably good job with minimal discomfort at a price that&#x27;s not too exorbitant.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could not find this razor in stores because they tend to carry only the latest models.</li>
            <li> The price is a bit higher than it should be.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, cartridges for the Sensor have a higher price nowadays.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Years ago, when this razor first came to market, I can still remember reading about the technology Gillette had to invent to produce this razor.  </li>
            <li> After 20+ years, it was the first of it</li>
            <li> This is the best men&#x27;s razor ever made and you are wrong if you think otherwise.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what we were looking for.  </li>
            <li> I only need one to shave and 2 is okay.  </li>
            <li> Just do the math the next time you are looking at the Mach 24 or whatever as to how much you pay for how many blades.  </li>
            <li> The last of my Sensor razor broke last week, and I was delighted to find them</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t cost that much when it first came out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because it&#x27;s only a twin blade, it&#x27;s thinner and maneuvers easily.</li>
            <li> I am not a big fan of the new razors with 3 or more blades.</li>
            <li> I bought a new set from my local store and they seem much sharper and they give a better shave than the on-line ones.</li>
            <li> I loved my Gilette sensor Excell, nice shave without those crazy prices to buy new blades.</li>
            <li> shaves just fine and the blades last longer...</li>
            <li> First I thought the price was too high for a razor, then I realized that I was getting three.</li>
            <li> , it costs almost as much as the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Very good...excellent response</li>
            <li> The aluminum handles feel very solidly built, and the rubberized grip is comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> The Gillette SensorExcel razor seems to be no longer available at local retailers and the 2-blade cartridges</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife, because they are the only razors that she is comfortable with.</li>
            <li> Very close shave and not too bulky.  </li>
            <li> was worth what I spent until I found my old favorite on line, just looking that maybe they were still around.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t cause irritation to skin , it&#x27;s very smooth, sharp and I like the quality</li>
            <li> My original Gillette Sensor Razor finally broke after around 20 years of service.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and no matter how much shaving cream you use, or how gently you shave, even three blades is too much.</li>
            <li> As long as they&#x27;re available, I will keep using these razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on a shaving &#x27;kick&#x27; for about a year now and have tried several different razors from vintage D/E to triple blades in search for the \\&quot;Perfect Shave\\&quot;...at least for my face</li>
            <li> Its only redeeming quality is the relatively low price of its replacement cartridges.</li>
            <li> Razor Blades just keep getting more and more expensive, it&#x27;s now cheaper to buy these razors than it is to buy the blade refills when</li>
            <li> Gillette Sensor Excel was highly rated in its heyday but</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> an effortless, painless, high quality shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> they changed to gripping mechanism for the razor blades, the older blades will not fit, now I do not know what blades to buy.</li>
            <li> The rest of the blades were the normal excel sensor blades.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what I ordered since the details were plain.</li>
            <li> New condition.  </li>
            <li> The new models they keep coming up with are just pur gimmick and rediculous.</li>
            <li> (3) three \\&quot;Gillette SensorExcel Razors\\&quot; I have been looking for this particular razor to replace my old \\&quot;Gillette Sensor\\&quot;...</li>
            <li> This is far and away improved over that!</li>
            <li> Exact same razor.</li>
            <li> Exact same razor.</li>
            <li> The blades cost less, cut just as comfortable, expecially if Ive skipped a day over the weekend and cut almost as close as the triple blade replacement.  </li>
            <li> It had what was shown clearly.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m old school, but the Sensor Excel gets the job done, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about losing a couple of layers of epidermis while shaving.</li>
            <li> Also try this product with a quality shaving cream like Avery, Truefitt and Hill, or Taylor of Old Bond Street.</li>
            <li> My old sensor razor had started to rust on the springs after 10+ years of soft water exposure.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised to get</li>
            <li> My shave with the \\&quot;old school\\&quot; twin blade Sensor Excel is just as close</li>
            <li> and I prefer it for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> When I use the Fusion Pro Glide Power, I get too much irritation, even though I use proper shaving technique and skin preparation.  </li>
            <li> Oh, say can you see by the dawn&#x27;s early light&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> But if I use proper prep and good products the Trac II has very little drag if at all</li>
            <li> Lathered up the first time with CVS Gel for sensitive skin after first applying a small amount of Proaso Pre-Shave purchased here at Amazon and shaved with the grain, re-lathered and shaved against the grain.  </li>
            <li> These things are solid and they&#x27;re made out of metal unlike most of the womanly competition out there with 6,000,000 razors that are thinner than electrons and leave you feeling like your face got dry humped by the business ends of a badger and a porcupine at the same time.</li>
            <li> Just a new look doing same results.</li>
            <li> I left my razor at a hotel on a recent trip and could really tell the difference when using a disposable razor.  </li>
            <li> and it is much easier to have all of them with the same razors instead of buying different cartridges for all three.</li>
            <li> only twin blades, the Sensor Excel takes a longer time to complete a shave compared to a 3-, 4-, or 5-blade razor.</li>
            <li> Newer razors have such a floppy cartridge mount that the cartridge flops over so far</li>
            <li> -up&amp;#34; orientation and then brushing your face with the very tip of your thumbnail -- not very ergonomic).</li>
            <li> Again: The Sensor is great and sad to see it go but wish the blades cost less.</li>
            <li> The twin blades get dull rather quickly compared to the Mach 3 and the Fusion.</li>
            <li> It shaves the hard-to-reach tight spots very well (like just under the nose, for example.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I agree completely with other reviews that describe the 2-blade cartridge design as the only way to get into cleft chin &amp; up around my nostrils --</li>
            <li> Other razors I&#x27;ve tried will hold on to the bits of trimmed off hairs which later scratch the hell out of my baby soft man skin.</li>
            <li> The difference: on the older version, the rubber-like ribs on the side of the razor, are like small lines, on the newer versions, the rubber-like ribs are much larger, but fewer of them.</li>
            <li> The only difference is the toggle head and the lack of occasional drag.  </li>
            <li> The other two included are the regular 2 blade sensor blades.</li>
            <li> Basically that Gillette had to develop a laser to precisely weld small springs to the back of a thin razor blade.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only negative is that the cartridge that is loaded on the blade is not the normal excel blade and had me worried when I tried it - it required holding the blade at an odd angle,  pitching that blade and loading one from the balance of the pack</li>
            <li> It would appear that local retailers aren&#x27;t stocking any razors with less than 3 blades......</li>
            <li> With all of the 4-5+ blade razors coming onto the men&#x27;s razor scene now it&#x27;s hard to find something that doesn&#x27;t turn my neck into a vast landscape of pimples and red rashes.</li>
            <li> It is too bad razor companies have switched to razors with way too many blades.</li>
            <li> The blades are less expensive in the stores and they shave just as well for me than those newer ones that are getting kind of ridiculous with the blade count.  </li>
            <li> The quality was just what I expected at a</li>
            <li> The issue with the 3 blade is that the blades are jammed too closely together.</li>
            <li> But whats to be expected from Amazon...</li>
            <li> No cuts, nicks or blade drag at all.</li>
            <li> cuts my hair with no razor drag.  </li>
            <li> But the other spare and the one on the razor are the two blade (which is what I was after).</li>
            <li> , I usually purchase the standard Sensor Excel blades (the ones with twin blades), and for me, they work</li>
            <li> However, I did not realize it was in a package of 3 razors, so I sent the other two as gifts to my sons, who likewise have reported their satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Although it costs less than the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> If the blades cost less I might switch for awhile.</li>
            <li> If the blades cost less I might switch for awhile.</li>
            <li> I recently had the worst razor cut, on my face, in 30 years of shaving, using a cheap plastic</li>
            <li> and they are not cheap..</li>
            <li> I ordered these a few times from Amazon</li>
            <li> received the Gillette SensorExcel Razor I ordered on Amazon a few days ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard but the twin blade Sensor Excel</li>
            <li> have become difficult to find anywhere locally except at the club-retailer.  </li>
            <li> The simplicity of 2 blades minus the irritating rubber fins that come with the Excel version is really hard to beat.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still hard to beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s product is hard to find.  </li>
            <li> Replacement handles are hard to find in NZ.</li>
            <li> addition, the razor blade cartridges are little bit expensive...</li>
            <li> it is just plain awkward.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a package of 3 razors where each razor comes with a couple of Sensor Excel blades which you unfortunately have to pay for.</li>
            <li> My husband was so sad when he found out that Gillette stopped making this handle.  </li>
            <li> those 4 &amp; 5-headed designs are impossible to use in those spots for me -- like trying to shave your face with a pie plate.  </li>
            <li> Gillette will screw up badly if they quit making these.</li>
            <li> that by the time it quits flopping, the handle of the razor is almost perpendicular to my face -- very awkward motion (sort of like making a fist with the thumb in a &amp;#34;thumbs</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> First I thought the price was too high for a razor, then I realized that I was getting three. The interesting thing is the blade attached to the razor  has 3 blades. The other two included are the regular 2 blade sensor blades. I prefer the two blade cartridge over the three blade cartridge.</li>
            <li> My original Gillette Sensor Razor finally broke after around 20 years of service.  Could not find a replacement at any local stores.  Didn&#x27;t need 3 razors, so gave 2 away to sons who use them to trim around beards.  This razor is now a spare since I have switched to the Gillette Fusion Proglide</li>
            <li> This is by far the best razor I have ever used, I highly recommend buying plus the price was right!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see this in the stores anymore. It appears Gillette is phasing this out to make more profit from their fancier products. I&#x27;ve tried the triple blades, but I like this one better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. Blades are cheaper than the triples.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace the one I broke and it came with a Sensor 3 cartridge as a free trial. I have to say that after using the Sensor 3 cartridge I wanted to throw the regular cartridges out. The better cartridges fit this handle and those are the ones I will be buying from now on.</li>
            <li> Sure, it&#x27;s a fine razor, but $21 bucks reduced from $36? It didn&#x27;t cost that much when it first came out. Oh, and by the way, you give away the razor to sell the blades. That razor is available any number of places for about $5 bucks. Pahlease!!!</li>
            <li> I had the earliest design of this handle for almost 23 years and it worked fine. This is far and away improved over that!</li>
            <li> I own the Gillette Atra (1977), [[ASIN:B000065AB0 Mach 3]] (1998), [[ASIN:B000BUUVTE Fusion]] (2006) and this razor - the Gillette SensorExcel (1990).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette Sensor Excel was highly rated in its heyday but with significant improvements in shaving technology today, the Gillette Sensor Excel just doesn&#x27;t quite cut it anymore. The newer models of Gillette shavers, the Mach 3 and the Fusion, are vastly superior to the Sensor Excel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Price&lt;br /&gt;The [[ASIN:B001G7PMW2 Replacement Cartridge]] for the Sensor Excel isn&#x27;t cheap. Although it costs less than the [[ASIN:B000BUUVTO Gillette Fusion Replacement Cartridge]], it costs almost as much as the [[ASIN:B000JHJZ4Q Mach 3 Replacement Cartridge]]! (Price comparisons based on the price per cartridge at the retail price as of this writing.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Comfort&lt;br /&gt;For increased comfort, the Sensor Excel is designed with a pivoting head and flexible spring-loaded twin blades that conform to the contours of your face. However, the Sensor can also cause some *dis*comfort: The twin blades get dull rather quickly compared to the Mach 3 and the Fusion. It requires more strokes to shave an area than either the Mach 3 and the Fusion, and thus it is more likely to cause irritated skin or razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Performance&lt;br /&gt;With only twin blades, the Sensor Excel takes a longer time to complete a shave compared to a 3-, 4-, or 5-blade razor. Both Mach 3 and Fusion out-perform the Sensor Excel in shaving speed. (Mach 3 has 3 blades while Fusion has 5.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Recommended *&lt;br /&gt;Of all the razors, the Gillette Mach 3 clearly hits the sweet spot for performance, comfort, and price (affordability) -- i.e. it does a reasonably good job with minimal discomfort at a price that&#x27;s not too exorbitant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;The performance of the Gillette Sensor Excel is subpar in the context of current razor technology. Its only redeeming quality is the relatively low price of its replacement cartridges. - Overall, 3.5 Stars.verall, 3.5 Stars.</li>
            <li> Very good...excellent response</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m like many guys that have given reviews for the original Sensor (NOT Excel) razor blades and swear by them over anything else out there. The simplicity of 2 blades minus the irritating rubber fins that come with the Excel version is really hard to beat. Anyway, my original Sensor razor finally broke and this Razor is awesome to use with your original Sensor blades. It&#x27;s a package of 3 razors where each razor comes with a couple of Sensor Excel blades which you unfortunately have to pay for. Regardless, this Razor combined with the original Sensor blades is the best for an easy, comfortable, close shave.</li>
            <li> they changed to gripping mechanism for the razor blades, the older blades will not fit, now I do not know what blades to buy. The original razor took these older blades that were  about $4 to$5 dollars</li>
            <li> Ordered the \\&quot;Sensor\\&quot; razor, did not know it was the swivel head model and no indication in the descriptive material.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this product. The quality was just what I expected at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;The dealer provided me with prompt and great service too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> I loved my Gilette sensor Excell, nice shave without those crazy prices to buy new blades.I highly recommend.A+++.Stop wasting your money with those fancy shavers.Just a new look doing same results.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this razor.  It is the only one he will use.</li>
            <li> Superior to the original SensorExcel - nice rubber grips. Comes with one 3! blade cartridge already installed that is waaay superior to the standard 2 blade cartridges of the original. Don&#x27;t know why they didn&#x27;t include a set of the 3 blade carts instead of the 2 blade  but, hey, I&#x27;m not complaining. I&#x27;ll have to check if I can get the 3 blade version here on Amazon or anywhere locally. Nice shaver.</li>
            <li> With all of the 4-5+ blade razors coming onto the men&#x27;s razor scene now it&#x27;s hard to find something that doesn&#x27;t turn my neck into a vast landscape of pimples and red rashes. I have very sensitive skin and no matter how much shaving cream you use, or how gently you shave, even three blades is too much. On my face I use a different razor with a quattro design, but this is absolutely perfect for my neck. The aluminum handles feel very solidly built, and the rubberized grip is comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> My husband was so sad when he found out that Gillette stopped making this handle.  Thank goodness I found them here.</li>
            <li> It is what it is.  Genuine Gillette.  New condition.  Now I have razors everywhere I use them. What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> very prompt and great communication. price was the best i found in my searches for this product. would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> The blades are less expensive in the stores and they shave just as well for me than those newer ones that are getting kind of ridiculous with the blade count.  I&#x27;m waiting for the next one to be 24 blades for the closest shave ever.  Two blades works find for me, and I can still get into the nooks and crannies to get those hard-to-reach whiskers.  Just do the math the next time you are looking at the Mach 24 or whatever as to how much you pay for how many blades.  Get yourself a handful of these and save some money while still looking great.</li>
            <li> more blades is not always better, the twin blade has always gave me the best shave.  Gillette will screw up badly if they quit making these.</li>
            <li> This is the best razor ever and getting very hard to find.  Don&#x27;t stop making this.  Puts triple track razors to shame.</li>
            <li> Love this razor!! it doesn&#x27;t cause irritation to skin , it&#x27;s very smooth, sharp and I like the quality, I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> You get three Razors to an order, not just three blades.  I didn&#x27;t realize this when I ordered.  I wanted one for travel, one for home, and a spare.  I now have 9 razors, each with three blades.  Anyone want to buy one from me?  :-)</li>
            <li> I am not a big fan of the new razors with 3 or more blades. No matter how they&#x27;re marketed, I feel they&#x27;re nothing but a gimmick, and all they do for me is increase razor burn by a factor of 2 or more. Maybe I&#x27;m old school, but the Sensor Excel gets the job done, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about losing a couple of layers of epidermis while shaving. In my opinion, changing a products solely for the sake of novelty and increasing prices is not the best way to go about it. As long as they&#x27;re available, I will keep using these razors.</li>
            <li> The Gillette SensorExcel razor seems to be no longer available at local retailers and the 2-blade cartridges have become difficult to find anywhere locally except at the club-retailer.  This pack of 3 razors with cartridges will enable me to keep one in each of the showers and one in my travel kit and still have spare razors.&lt;br /&gt;  I agree completely with other reviews that describe the 2-blade cartridge design as the only way to get into cleft chin &amp; up around my nostrils -- those 4 &amp; 5-headed designs are impossible to use in those spots for me -- like trying to shave your face with a pie plate.  More importantly, the SensorExcel Razor maintains the pitch of the blades at a normal, upright/90-degree angle enabling me to shave with the handle at a more comfortable orientation of my hand (sort of like making a fist &amp; stroking your face with all 4 finger-nails simultaneously -- that angle).  Newer razors have such a floppy cartridge mount that the cartridge flops over so far that by the time it quits flopping, the handle of the razor is almost perpendicular to my face -- very awkward motion (sort of like making a fist with the thumb in a &amp;#34;thumbs-up&amp;#34; orientation and then brushing your face with the very tip of your thumbnail -- not very ergonomic).</li>
            <li> Glad Amazon had this as I could not find it anywhere..&lt;br /&gt;Have a Fusion as well, while it feels smoother on my face the blades do not last and they are not cheap..&lt;br /&gt;This shaves just fine and the blades last longer...</li>
            <li> The item states that it is the 2 blade sensor excel when it is both a 3 blade(horrible blade) but it has two of the two blade cartridges on the back side. The issue with the 3 blade is that the blades are jammed too closely together. This causes the blade to clog with hair and not cut as smoothly. The 3 blade also irritates the skin quite a bit. If you are just trying the sensor excel i would recommend this item since you do get to experiment with different blade types. Also try this product with a quality shaving cream like Avery, Truefitt and Hill, or Taylor of Old Bond Street. If you use those shaving creams, don&#x27;t go cheap on the badger brush. A high quality bristle like a silver tip will give you the greatest shave.</li>
            <li> Product came 1 day earlier than predicted. Wasn&#x27;t sure what I ordered since the details were plain. Bought for my wife, because they are the only razors that she is comfortable with. She is happy, I am happy.</li>
            <li> My old sensor razor had started to rust on the springs after 10+ years of soft water exposure.  I&#x27;ve tried the newer versions but keep coming back to the Excel  The blades cost less, cut just as comfortable, expecially if Ive skipped a day over the weekend and cut almost as close as the triple blade replacement.  The only negative is that the cartridge that is loaded on the blade is not the normal excel blade and had me worried when I tried it - it required holding the blade at an odd angle,  pitching that blade and loading one from the balance of the pack did the trick.  The rest of the blades were the normal excel sensor blades.</li>
            <li> I ordered these a few times from Amazon but I was concerned about reviews that said these were not the same quality you get from a store. I bought a new set from my local store and they seem much sharper and they give a better shave than the on-line ones. The handles are great, seems like you can&#x27;t find them in the stores any more.</li>
            <li> You do get three razors with this package deal.  One of the spare blades is a three blade, just so you know.  But the other spare and the one on the razor are the two blade (which is what I was after).</li>
            <li> I left my razor at a hotel on a recent trip and could really tell the difference when using a disposable razor.  I could not find this razor in stores because they tend to carry only the latest models. This Sensor 3 pack not only replaced my lost razor but gave me a backup in case I forget my razor in the future.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find these in any store. Gives a good shave without all the bells and whistles on newer style razors. Don&#x27;t need it to vibrate, light up, gel my face, make toast. Just a good shave</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my order. It is too bad razor companies have switched to razors with way too many blades. I always have to hunt these perfect razors down for my husband! Very fast shipper!</li>
            <li> Really only needed the razor not the blades but could not find it any longer so I bought this. Works!</li>
            <li> This razor is great. Very close shave and not too bulky.  This order came with three razors, I gave one to my father in law to enjoy.</li>
            <li> I always loved sensor excel. Been using it for some time. I could not find it anymore in stores so ordered from Amazon. Couldn&#x27;t be more happier. The price is a bit higher than it should be. But, no complaints. Before they stop producing it, ordered three. The new models they keep coming up with are just pur gimmick and rediculous. I love my Sensor Excels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other, non-disposable, razors and these are the BEST a man can get. They cut close and, after I use them to shave, they clean well when I shake them under the hot water. Other razors I&#x27;ve tried will hold on to the bits of trimmed off hairs which later scratch the hell out of my baby soft man skin. This razor is by far my favorite of all time!!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied and surprised with this product. I guess I didn&#x27;t read all about items orderd...I was surprised to get (3) three \\&quot;Gillette SensorExcel Razors\\&quot; I have been looking for this particular razor to replace my old \\&quot;Gillette Sensor\\&quot;...now I have(3)three !!! Can&#x27;t beat the product and the price. But whats to be expected from Amazon...Amazon is my favorite on line store...When asked by family or friends..about a gift ..I say Amazon Gift Certificate.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Sensor razor for 15 years. I have also tried the Mach 3 disposable, and the Schick Xtreme 3.  Even with all the  supposed innovations in shaving blades, more blades, etc, the Sensor is still my go-to favorite. It&#x27;s what I use on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has twin blades which I believe are all that is needed. I don&#x27;t think I get a better shave with three or four blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it&#x27;s only a twin blade, it&#x27;s thinner and maneuvers easily. It shaves the hard-to-reach tight spots very well (like just under the nose, for example.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the grips on the handle. It&#x27;s very easy to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, cartridges for the Sensor have a higher price nowadays.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my electric and 5-blades irritated my skin too much; these are the perfect mix of functionality but also comfort.</li>
            <li> I recently had the worst razor cut, on my face, in 30 years of shaving, using a cheap plastic razor.&lt;br /&gt;I received the Gillette SensorExcel Razor I ordered on Amazon a few days ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What an effortless, painless, high quality shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Razor comes with my highest recommendation.</li>
            <li> About 8 months ago, I lost my Gillette Sensor Excel razor while traveling and could not find another.&lt;br /&gt;I tried different brands, including Gillette Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing was worth what I spent until I found my old favorite on line, just looking that maybe they were still around.  The drugstore did not carry them any more, replaced with \\&quot;newer\\&quot; types.&lt;br /&gt;Now I am reunited with my favorite razor once again.</li>
            <li> The last of my Sensor razor broke last week, and I was delighted to find them here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviews have indicated the technology is old, that Gillette&#x27;s Mach III is far superior, I strongly disagree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have two Mach III razors, and can&#x27;t stand to use either one. The blade sits upright on the handle, and tilts back when you place it against your skin. Take a look around amazon here, I&#x27;m sure there are pics you can see for yourself. Shaving around corners, chins, etc., for me... it is just plain awkward.  I had to break out my Mach III&#x27;s while I was waiting for these to arrive, and yep, I still don&#x27;t like &#x27;em.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True, twin blades may or may not cut as well as three blades, I rarely purchase the 3 blade versions for this razor, I usually purchase the standard Sensor Excel blades (the ones with twin blades), and for me, they work great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way this razor functions, I rarely, if ever, get a razor nick... In fact, I&#x27;m shaving around a nick right now that I got from that &#x27;superior&#x27; Mach III.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the image of this product is not correct.  You will get the updated version of this razor.  The difference: on the older version, the rubber-like ribs on the side of the razor, are like small lines, on the newer versions, the rubber-like ribs are much larger, but fewer of them. I&#x27;m sure by the time you read this, amazon will have updated the image.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years ago, when this razor first came to market, I can still remember reading about the technology Gillette had to invent to produce this razor.  It probably seems a trifle thing now, but years ago, it was truly amazing and to me, still is.  Basically that Gillette had to develop a laser to precisely weld small springs to the back of a thin razor blade.&lt;br /&gt;No matter which razor you prefer, you can thank Gillette for the technology that has made razors of all kinds, work better and are safer to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A razor is a personal preference thing.  After 20+ years, it was the first of it&#x27;s kind and it&#x27;s still hard to beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, this razor is still the best.</li>
            <li> Awesome!  I forgot how great these razor handles are!  I wish they were still sold in stores like the cartridges.</li>
            <li> This is the only razor I like to use. I had to buy an extra one for I keep loosing one of them on trips</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on a shaving &#x27;kick&#x27; for about a year now and have tried several different razors from vintage D/E to triple blades in search for the \\&quot;Perfect Shave\\&quot;...at least for my face and I&#x27;ve just about reached the end of the road:)  As to the Sensor Excell: Great razor. Using proper preparation as you should with all shaving I just got one of the best shaves I&#x27;ve ever had.  Lathered up the first time with CVS Gel for sensitive skin after first applying a small amount of Proaso Pre-Shave purchased here at Amazon and shaved with the grain, re-lathered and shaved against the grain.  No razor burn at all.  No cuts, nicks or blade drag at all. Perfectly smooth with no residual stubble.  So with that for my face the Sensor Excel is an almost tie with the Gillette Trac II I love so much. The up side is the Sensor blades are an improvement over the Trac II as they were intended to be (as well as the Atra) providing a superior shave over all.  The downside is the price. Price is what drives so many of us on this search for a different and better razor as the prices are almost extortion for what you get. I&#x27;m one of those who have tried the multiple blade razors and don&#x27;t like them. They don&#x27;t give as good a shave as the twin blade and again the cost.  Since I can still purchase Gillette Trac II blades for $12.00 - 17.00 per ten blades here at Amazon (as well as almost anywhere) I just won&#x27;t pay the $21.00 - 27.00 for a pack of 10 Sensor&#x27;s. The only difference is the toggle head and the lack of occasional drag.  But if I use proper prep and good products the Trac II has very little drag if at all and I get ten shaves per cartridge on a medium/heavy beard.  Also; now that the Sensor is out of production and the Trac II is back (from Russia) and there are so many company&#x27;s that still make the handle...and Gillette has never stopped making the blades (as well as Personna who wrote me and told me they had no intention of ending production of the twin blades for Trac II in the foreseeable future)I&#x27;ll always be able to get the blades for between $8.49 (Personna/CVS pack of 20) to 17.89 (Gillette pack of 10 or $12.99 can be found) and that&#x27;s economical for me to stay with the Trac II razor and blades. In fact it&#x27;s interesting that now that sales of the expensive types are falling like a rock Gillette is bringing back the Trac II.  In any case; I just had to try the Sensor before it was gone just to know.  If the blades cost less I might switch for awhile. A twin blade is still the best razor in my opinion and always will be. Gillette should fall back to the Trac II and the Sensor for an alternate twin and also continue to offer the Sensor triple blade and re-capture the market it&#x27;s losing to the vintage market and the twin blade aftermarket.  They seem to know that with the re-issue of the Trac II from Russia.  Exact same razor. Again: The Sensor is great and sad to see it go but wish the blades cost less.seeable future)I&#x27;ll always be able to get the blades for between $8.49 (Personna/CVS pack of 20) to 17.89 (Gillette pack of 10 or $12.99 can be found) and that&#x27;s economical for me to stay with the Trac II razor and blades.

            <li> The Gillette Sensor Excel Twin Blade razor offers an excellent shave with less irritation for me.  I switched back to the Sensor Excel from Gillette Fusion Pro Glide Power, a 5 blade razor.  My shave with the \\&quot;old school\\&quot; twin blade Sensor Excel is just as close and I prefer it for my sensitive skin.  I also prefer the more lightweight feel of this razor as compared to the Fusion.  When I use the Fusion Pro Glide Power, I get too much irritation, even though I use proper shaving technique and skin preparation.  I have a heavy beard but the twin blade Sensor Excel cuts my hair with no razor drag.  Great product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Oh, say can you see by the dawn&#x27;s early light&lt;br /&gt;What so proudly we hailed at the twilight&#x27;s last gleaming?</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor because of the left over cartridges I had on hand. This razor has proved to be better than my old one, and I am very satisfied with it. However, I did not realize it was in a package of 3 razors, so I sent the other two as gifts to my sons, who likewise have reported their satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Razor Blades just keep getting more and more expensive, it&#x27;s now cheaper to buy these razors than it is to buy the blade refills when and if you can even find them. COSTCO no longer carries the refills for the Sensor Excel. My triple and five blade razors don&#x27;t shave me any closer, and the smaller excel blade works great under the nose where the fatter blades don&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s product is hard to find.  Went to so many stores to find this and all I found was the cartridges and not the razor. have 3 men in the house and it is much easier to have all of them with the same razors instead of buying different cartridges for all three.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find these in stores for years. I don&#x27;t need 500 blades to scrape hair off of my face with. This is the best men&#x27;s razor ever made and you are wrong if you think otherwise. These things are solid and they&#x27;re made out of metal unlike most of the womanly competition out there with 6,000,000 razors that are thinner than electrons and leave you feeling like your face got dry humped by the business ends of a badger and a porcupine at the same time.</li>
            <li> Replacement handles are hard to find in NZ. (you can always find packs of SensoorExcel blades at the supermarkets).&lt;br /&gt;Now I have 3 extra handles, that should last me 20 years! The best wet shaving system, never nicks or cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good trade - fair priced.</li>
            <li> It was a good price for what I got them for. I really only needed one razor handle but it never hurts to have extra I guess...</li>
            <li> Reasonable and quick deriver.  The product is compact and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;in addition, the razor blade cartridges are little bit expensive...</li>
            <li> It was exactly what we were looking for.  The price was okay.  It had what was shown clearly.  Will wordier again</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the bonus cartridge.</li>
            <li> A bonus Sensor3 cartridge was included, making this an even better deal. Have tried other shavers but the Sensor Excel is still my favorite - Glides smoothly and gives a good quick shave.</li>
            <li> It would appear that local retailers aren&#x27;t stocking any razors with less than 3 blades...... I only need one to shave and 2 is okay.  It works as good or better than 3, 4, or 5 blades and is about half the cost. Whats not to like?</li>
            <li> Considering I cant use these three bladed razors, and thats ALL anybody sells, I was very happy to have found a  razor I can still use!  Ive been using SensorExcel for some time now and before that I useed the regular Excel. Very happy with the results!!</li>
            <li> My Husband is very Happy with this item.</li>
