            <li>The wig came with a wig cap and was nicely packaged.  </li>
            <li>just thought I&#x27;d be honest about it.</li>
            <li>This wig is far from perfect.</li>
            <li>a great quality and lots of fun to wear</li>
            <li>It does tangle easily, but braiding it does help!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a very accurate color as shown in the picture, and length as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She was pleased with the quality versus</li>
            <li>This is an excellent wig especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got it.</li>
            <li>The bangs look cute on the mannequin, but they don&#x27;t split at all I had to put on a hair clip to keep them from being just in my face.  </li>
            <li>I was able to cut and style it for my convention.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Secondly, the quality of the wig was outstanding.</li>
            <li>Fun and functional, a good product.</li>
            <li>A+++ : )&lt;br /&gt;---Recent update&lt;br /&gt;04/10/2013</li>

            <li>i just loveeee iiiiittt... never had a wig before but allways wanted one in this color, just love it..</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a pretty good wig.</li>
            <li>It gets tangled easily and lost hair to the point you could see the cap</li>
            <li>Great wig, Took about 3 to 4 weeks to arrive so if your wanting to get this item make sure you order with enough lead time.</li>
            <li>and it tangles easily....</li>
            <li>easy to use, easy to brush</li>
            <li>and it was fine.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for anyone who wants a nice wig.</li>
            <li>and I am never dissappointed with cosplay wigs great quality for a low price!</li>
            <li>i could see lol overall</li>
            <li>My first wig so I&#x27;m not too sure what to expect, but it&#x27;s really easy to tangle so handle with care.</li>
            <li>Very sleek, very light hair, and tangles easily.</li>
            <li>This was the first wig I ever bought and it was fabulous!</li>
            <li>Looks great, very soft, VERY long, keep a brush handy.</li>
            <li>My 17 year young granddaughter is in Cosplay and makes her own costumes.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li>Adding on top of that that it is stick straight (so no body)</li>
            <li>I couldnt take this wig off and it comes with a wig cap i really love this wig so much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been cosplaying for many years and have bought wigs from super crappy party city wigs to very high end ones.</li>
            <li>I got this wig, wanting to use it for jinx cosplay, and to be honest, its amazing in almost every way, however it tangles very quickly, and it is thin at the top.</li>
            <li>I love it, is beautiful and better that i expected, color is a little darker but is ok.</li>
            <li>Though it was a lighter shade of blue than I was expecting (it was more of a Miku Hatsune color), the fine and sleek texture of it makes up for it!</li>
            <li>Great wig, it&#x27;s really long and silky at first.</li>
            <li>It actually hangs pretty natural (in spite of being an incredibly unnatural bright blue!</li>
            <li>Its very well made not like all those cheap wigs.</li>
            <li>And embrace my cartoonesque features by wearing colorful hair and clothing.</li>
            <li>bad.&lt;br /&gt;The color is also more of a light baby blue than what is pictured.</li>
            <li>I received it relatively quickly and it felt just like real hair!</li>
            <li>I was able to get all my long hair up under the cap and secure the wig without it hurting or sliding.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t go by the color in the main picture, but by those posted by others and the most light blue.  </li>
            <li>decent for a cosplay and true to color...</li>
            <li>This was my first wig ever, but I&#x27;ve bought extensions before</li>
            <li>It looks exactly like the picture.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>kind of heavy but real easy to work with and even though its blue people though it was my real hair.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more of a sky blue than the darker color shown.</li>
            <li>The bangs will most likely need to be trimmed so that you can see anything at all while you are wearing it.</li>
            <li>evaluation was quick, and she liked the wig giving it a 5 star.&lt;br /&gt;The wig does not seem of poor quality, if fit well.</li>
            <li>Is not the color of the picture, it looks blue but its a baby blue, good material, long and pretty :3</li>
            <li>WORKED WELL FOR THE SHOW DEXTERS LABORATORY 3 DISC SPEED AND POSITIVE INPUT FROM CITY&#x27;S MANAGMENT AND WAS A LEARNING EXPERIENCE</li>
            <li>The netting is visible at certain angles, but it&#x27;s not too noticeable.</li>
            <li>This wig is slightly shiner than I anticipated but the colour was fabulous just as shown and the length was accurate.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s to be expected of a long straight wig, and I was able to take pieces I had cut and incorporate them into the top for the style I wanted.</li>
            <li>Split on and sewed together, worked very well.</li>
            <li>Despite length, undyed wig remained relatively knot free and silky smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They need to change it to light blue on the description.</li>
            <li>I think I had a couple convinced that it was my real hair</li>
            <li>haha).</li>
            <li>If you try to maneuver the hair in any direction to style, you can see straight thru it.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly, but the net wigs normally come in was not surrounding the entire wig, on,y the top.</li>
            <li>As with long hair it tangles easily, so caring for it is a must.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s an okay wig.</li>
            <li>Love it its very long and soft will wear it out soon</li>
            <li>Used two together to make a cosplay with high side-pigtails.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this wig for anyone looking to impress.</li>
            <li>Cheap wig as expected, but arrived on time and worked in a pinch</li>
            <li>Very tangled there after, but soaking in wig untangler  fixed problem.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s normal with the length</li>
            <li>It is easy to comb through and put on the bangs are easy to move around like so and give it a real looking effect unlike some where the bangs just make the wig look fake.</li>
            <li>I live my life out loud!</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I love the color of this wig, I found it to run a bit small...</li>
            <li>is that you can secure it tightly to your head.</li>
            <li>this wig is really pretty and long very soft to.</li>
            <li>Added yellow fabric dye to ends and it turned a lovely vivid green.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something that you can just throw on and be ready to go in, this is definitely not your item.</li>
            <li>Have some trouble with bald spots, but I was able to fix it with the extra hair I cut off and restitched to those spots.</li>
            <li>My only complaint was that it was kind of thin/hard to get volume.</li>
            <li>The cap was a bit small for my head, but after a bit of adjusting it turned out fine.</li>
            <li>think my favorite thing about it (other than the fact that it&#x27;s a long blue wig!!)</li>
            <li>I have long hair and it always knots up fast</li>
            <li>However, with a lot of bobby pinning and a very thick headband, I was able to make this wig work for what I needed it to do.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s long and it doesn&#x27;t shed much when it&#x27;s brushed.</li>
            <li>The hair is actually quite soft.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery came quicker than I expected</li>
            <li>It is way too thin at the top.</li>
            <li>The wig was a little long for my taste (but is true to the picture).</li>
            <li>Was a little disappointed with the amount of hair in the wig, but my daughter was mostly very happy with this item.</li>
            <li>The wig is a bit hard to maintain, but as long as you have a light hand and patience, it is manageable.</li>
            <li>Just as described, its soft but takes a long time to brush all of the hair and gets messy fast but what do you expect?</li>
            <li>then you see through a little, but not as much).</li>

            <li> If you try to maneuver the hair in any direction to style, you can see straight thru it.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly, but the net wigs normally come in was not surrounding the entire wig, on,y the top.</li>
            <li> As with long hair it tangles easily, so caring for it is a must.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s an okay wig.</li>
            <li> Love it its very long and soft will wear it out soon</li>
            <li> Used two together to make a cosplay with high side-pigtails.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this wig for anyone looking to impress.</li>
            <li> Cheap wig as expected, but arrived on time and worked in a pinch</li>
            <li> Very tangled there after, but soaking in wig untangler  fixed problem.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s normal with the length</li>
            <li> It is easy to comb through and put on the bangs are easy to move around like so and give it a real looking effect unlike some where the bangs just make the wig look fake.</li>
            <li> I live my life out loud!</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I love the color of this wig, I found it to run a bit small...</li>
            <li> is that you can secure it tightly to your head.</li>
            <li> this wig is really pretty and long very soft to.</li>
            <li> Added yellow fabric dye to ends and it turned a lovely vivid green.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something that you can just throw on and be ready to go in, this is definitely not your item.</li>
            <li> Have some trouble with bald spots, but I was able to fix it with the extra hair I cut off and restitched to those spots.</li>
            <li> My only complaint was that it was kind of thin/hard to get volume.</li>
            <li> The cap was a bit small for my head, but after a bit of adjusting it turned out fine.</li>
            <li> think my favorite thing about it (other than the fact that it&#x27;s a long blue wig!!)</li>
            <li> I have long hair and it always knots up fast</li>
            <li> However, with a lot of bobby pinning and a very thick headband, I was able to make this wig work for what I needed it to do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long and it doesn&#x27;t shed much when it&#x27;s brushed.</li>
            <li> The hair is actually quite soft.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery came quicker than I expected</li>
            <li> It is way too thin at the top.</li>
            <li> The wig was a little long for my taste (but is true to the picture).</li>
            <li> Was a little disappointed with the amount of hair in the wig, but my daughter was mostly very happy with this item.</li>
            <li> The wig is a bit hard to maintain, but as long as you have a light hand and patience, it is manageable.</li>
            <li> Just as described, its soft but takes a long time to brush all of the hair and gets messy fast but what do you expect?</li>
            <li> then you see through a little, but not as much).</li>
            <li> but I am finding it hard to  cut it because it is so fun to wear long.</li>
            <li> he bangs are long enough where she could style or cut them to her needs.</li>
            <li> Because the wig was so long, it did tangle a bit, but I had a hood on over the wig, so it stayed relatively neat.</li>
            <li> Like normal wigs, if you mess with the hair too much, it will start to fall out and/or get hard to deal with.  </li>
            <li> seems like it will last a long time!</li>
            <li> But this tangles easily and looks so fake</li>
            <li> it just looks incredibly cheap and fake.</li>
            <li> This means you can braid it, tug on it, swing around in circles, and it won&#x27;t come loose.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nearly impossible to braid the wig without seeing through, so it&#x27;s better to use down(even</li>
            <li> It kinda smells weird when you first open the package, (like silicone) but goes away after a while.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m not sure I would want to try to brush it/straighten it out without dedicating some major time to it so that I don&#x27;t ruin it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ended up making it work by carefully draping it and applying liberal amounts of gel and hairspray (with the help of a friend), but it was still a bit sloppy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> certainly not what I needed for Jinx.</li>
            <li> the other commenter said she used it for</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed with the amount of hair on the top.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it just barely covers all my hair, but i guess i have really thick hair</li>
            <li> Thick and strong, I bought with the purpose of cutting and styling it for a costume</li>
            <li> so I could used the under one for another costume down the line.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the fibers are actually of decent quality.</li>
            <li> It is a little darker than Jinx&#x27;s hair, but worked color-wise.  </li>
            <li> It is verry heavy when you combine two.</li>
            <li> Wig is wayyyyy too long which I could probably deal with if it wasn&#x27;t also thin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s somewhat shiny and fake-looking (compared to expensive wigs) but obviously that&#x27;s to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;very very very thin, you can see the cap in the back if you part the hair, and in the front sometimes as well&lt;</li>
            <li> I rate it at 3 stars ONLY because I could only wear it for about half an hour at a time before my scalp started itching insanely</li>
            <li> Can hardly wait to show it off!</li>
            <li> This wig is beyond poor quality.</li>
            <li> Thin as hell.</li>
            <li> Thin as hell.</li>
            <li> Thin as hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (granted, they may have been a little drunk, but I took it as a compliment!).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Third, I was a bit disappointed with losing hair throughout the night, but I suppose that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> When braided, it was so heavy :(.  </li>
            <li> But the cap and structure of the weaves is terrible.</li>
            <li> The worst thing, is that this wig is non-returnable.</li>
            <li> U cannot return it once u see how terrible quality it is</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> This was fantastic!! Great quality, just the color pictured! The wig was a little long for my taste (but is true to the picture). I trimmed it with no problems, it was a big hit at the party I wore it to.... seems like it will last a long time!</li>
            <li> Just as described, its soft but takes a long time to brush all of the hair and gets messy fast but what do you expect? I have long hair and it always knots up fast</li>
            <li> It gets tangled easily and lost hair to the point you could see the cap</li>
            <li> My 17 year young granddaughter is in Cosplay and makes her own costumes.&lt;br /&gt;She asked me order this wig.&lt;br /&gt;She was pleased with the quality versus price.&lt;br /&gt;Her evaluation was quick, and she liked the wig giving it a 5 star.&lt;br /&gt;The wig does not seem of poor quality, if fit well. he bangs are long enough where she could style or cut them to her needs.</li>
            <li> This was my first wig ever, but I&#x27;ve bought extensions before and I know it can be a gamble.&lt;br /&gt;I love this wig! It has LOTS of hair, so you can style it a lot without showing through. it comes with a hair net and instructions.&lt;br /&gt;I think my favorite thing about it (other than the fact that it&#x27;s a long blue wig!!) is that you can secure it tightly to your head. This means you can braid it, tug on it, swing around in circles, and it won&#x27;t come loose. I think I will by my future wigs form this brand.</li>
            <li> Great wig, it&#x27;s really long and silky at first. It kinda smells weird when you first open the package, (like silicone) but goes away after a while. The wig is a bit hard to maintain, but as long as you have a light hand and patience, it is manageable.</li>
            <li> It is way too thin at the top. You could see through the wig. Other than that, it&#x27;s an okay wig.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent wig especially for the price. It has an adjustable skull cap on the inside which is great so it doesn&#x27;t fall off your head. It&#x27;s perfect for Halloween or Cosplay.</li>
            <li> This wig is slightly shiner than I anticipated but the colour was fabulous just as shown and the length was accurate.</li>
            <li> Wig is wayyyyy too long which I could probably deal with if it wasn&#x27;t also thin. Adding on top of that that it is stick straight (so no body) it just looks incredibly cheap and fake.</li>
            <li> I bought this intending to make braided pigtails, as that&#x27;s what my costume required. Pulling on it in any direction, however, makes the weave underneath show, and consequently makes your hair show through. I ended up making it work by carefully draping it and applying liberal amounts of gel and hairspray (with the help of a friend), but it was still a bit sloppy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you were to wear it as-is, without styling, it&#x27;s a pretty good wig. Just not what I was hoping for, I suppose.</li>
            <li> It looks exactly like the picture.  It&#x27;s not plastic feeling. The hair is actually quite soft. It&#x27;s long and it doesn&#x27;t shed much when it&#x27;s brushed. I&#x27;m glad I got it. Perfect for cosplay events or just for fun.</li>
            <li> WORKED WELL FOR THE SHOW DEXTERS LABORATORY 3 DISC SPEED AND POSITIVE INPUT FROM CITY&#x27;S MANAGMENT AND WAS A LEARNING EXPERIENCE</li>
            <li> Thick and strong, I bought with the purpose of cutting and styling it for a costume but I am finding it hard to  cut it because it is so fun to wear long. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Great wig, Took about 3 to 4 weeks to arrive so if your wanting to get this item make sure you order with enough lead time. I am using this for a Bachelorette party In Vegas and ordered all the girls different colors. Should be a very interesting night! ;)</li>
            <li> Cheap wig as expected, but arrived on time and worked in a pinch</li>
            <li> kind of heavy but real easy to work with and even though its blue people though it was my real hair. It is easy to comb through and put on the bangs are easy to move around like so and give it a real looking effect unlike some where the bangs just make the wig look fake. This one dose not have that problem.</li>
            <li> I couldnt take this wig off and it comes with a wig cap i really love this wig so much</li>
            <li> Used two together to make a cosplay with high side-pigtails. Split on and sewed together, worked very well. It is verry heavy when you combine two. I only did this to dye the attached wig so I could used the under one for another costume down the line. Added yellow fabric dye to ends and it turned a lovely vivid green. Very tangled there after, but soaking in wig untangler  fixed problem. Despite length, undyed wig remained relatively knot free and silky smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Warning, it will NOT GO LIGHTER. If you need lighter than cyan blue tips, get a white version and dip dye each segment.&lt;br /&gt;This wig was way above my expectations. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The color is just  like how you see... But this tangles easily and looks so fake you can&#x27;t even brush it (even with a wig brush) it will  get messed up I gave up and threw mine out not even a day of having it</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t go by the color in the main picture, but by those posted by others and the most light blue.  I needed specifically the blue shown in the picture, so I returned it.  The bangs look cute on the mannequin, but they don&#x27;t split at all I had to put on a hair clip to keep them from being just in my face.  They cover everything. I&#x27;m 5ft. and the hair reached me mid-butt.  They need to change it to light blue on the description.</li>
            <li> Fits well, good color and length.  Have some trouble with bald spots, but I was able to fix it with the extra hair I cut off and restitched to those spots.</li>
            <li> This was the first wig I ever bought and it was fabulous! I received it relatively quickly and it felt just like real hair! It is a LOT of hair though and takes a fair amount of brushing, but with some detangling  product, it works flawlessly. I would recommend this for anyone who wants a nice wig.</li>
            <li> I like this wig because I used it to play Jinx from League of Legends.  It is a little darker than Jinx&#x27;s hair, but worked color-wise.  The wig came with a wig cap and was nicely packaged.  The problem with the wig was that the wig cap just could not hold the weight of this wig.  When braided, it was so heavy :(.  I couldn&#x27;t figure out what to do, even making it tighter didn&#x27;t help.  Like normal wigs, if you mess with the hair too much, it will start to fall out and/or get hard to deal with.  I stopped messing with it and it was fine.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a very accurate color as shown in the picture, and length as well. it&#x27;s somewhat shiny and fake-looking (compared to expensive wigs) but obviously that&#x27;s to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very very very thin, you can see the cap in the back if you part the hair, and in the front sometimes as well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it just barely covers all my hair, but i guess i have really thick hair so that could be the reason. i think it&#x27;d be perfect for jinx, like the other commenter said she used it for</li>
            <li> It was good quality at an excellent price! I was able to cut and style it for my convention. My only complaint was that it was kind of thin/hard to get volume. But that&#x27;s to be expected of a long straight wig, and I was able to take pieces I had cut and incorporate them into the top for the style I wanted.</li>
            <li> Fist of all, the seller (out of China) was awesome! Shortly after I placed my order, I received an email thanking me for my order and what to expect in regard to shipping in the upcoming days. The seller then emailed me when my item shipped and told me when I should expect it and if it had not arrived by the estimated date, I was instructed to contact them at a specific email address and they would do whatever it took to get me the item as quickly as possible. I was thoroughly impressed. Also, I had no issues with the delivery of my item. I actually received it at the earlier projected date rather than the later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the quality of the wig was outstanding. I must admit, I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with wigs, but I have never had one that was this durable. I was able to get all my long hair up under the cap and secure the wig without it hurting or sliding. Because I wore it for Halloween and I went out dancing, I secured the wig with 2 bobby pins, and that&#x27;s all it took! Six hours later, I was still rocking the wig as I pulled into my driveway!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, I was a bit disappointed with losing hair throughout the night, but I suppose that&#x27;s to be expected. Because the wig was so long, it did tangle a bit, but I had a hood on over the wig, so it stayed relatively neat. However, I&#x27;m not sure I would want to try to brush it/straighten it out without dedicating some major time to it so that I don&#x27;t ruin it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with the quality of the wig and the customer service of the seller. I would highly recommend this wig for anyone looking to impress. I think I had a couple convinced that it was my real hair (granted, they may have been a little drunk, but I took it as a compliment!).</li>
            <li> My daughter loved the color, the lenght, the wig has elastic and makes it easier to hold on to the head</li>
            <li> The wig is great! Fits well, is adjustable for different sizes. As with long hair it tangles easily, so caring for it is a must. Can hardly wait to show it off!</li>
            <li> The wig itself was wonderful! Though it was a lighter shade of blue than I was expecting (it was more of a Miku Hatsune color), the fine and sleek texture of it makes up for it! It does tangle easily, but braiding it does help! I was a bit disappointed with the amount of hair on the top. The netting is visible at certain angles, but it&#x27;s not too noticeable. The cap was a bit small for my head, but after a bit of adjusting it turned out fine. All-in-all; it&#x27;s a great wig. Very sleek, very light hair, and tangles easily.</li>
            <li> I live my life out loud! And embrace my cartoonesque features by wearing colorful hair and clothing. I received this wig yesterday, and the color is absolutely gorgeous! The length is longer than I thought but not a problem for me. I plan to wear this on days when I cosplay or when I just wanna embrace cartoon me. lol. Fun and functional, a good product. A+++ : )&lt;br /&gt;---Recent update&lt;br /&gt;04/10/2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I love the color of this wig, I found it to run a bit small... and it tangles easily.... decent for a cosplay and true to color... just thought I&#x27;d be honest about it.</li>
            <li> Is not the color of the picture, it looks blue but its a baby blue, good material, long and pretty :3</li>
            <li> Totally made her Halloween costume. It actually hangs pretty natural (in spite of being an incredibly unnatural bright blue! haha).</li>
            <li> Love it its very long and soft will wear it out soon and I am never dissappointed with cosplay wigs great quality for a low price! Fast delivery came quicker than I expected</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more of a sky blue than the darker color shown. tangled as soon as i too it out the bag.</li>
            <li> I have to say this is a great wig, it does tangle very easy but that&#x27;s normal with the length but over all I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This wig is beyond poor quality. I&#x27;ve been cosplaying for many years and have bought wigs from super crappy party city wigs to very high end ones. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the fibers are actually of decent quality. But the cap and structure of the weaves is terrible. The cap is bulky, and sticks out in places. If you try to maneuver the hair in any direction to style, you can see straight thru it. It arrived quickly, but the net wigs normally come in was not surrounding the entire wig, on,y the top. The worst thing, is that this wig is non-returnable. Not losing a lot, but buyers BEWARE. U cannot return it once u see how terrible quality it is</li>
            <li> Was a little disappointed with the amount of hair in the wig, but my daughter was mostly very happy with this item. Would probably buy a more expensive version when this one needs to be replaced.</li>
            <li> This wig was PERFECT for my Buggy the Clown cross-play. There was enough waft to do low pigtails and it just looks adorable!</li>
            <li> I love it, is beautiful and better that i expected, color is a little darker but is ok. Really good product</li>
            <li> This wig is far from perfect. You can see the netting through the hair while it&#x27;s on your head. The bangs will most likely need to be trimmed so that you can see anything at all while you are wearing it. However, with a lot of bobby pinning and a very thick headband, I was able to make this wig work for what I needed it to do. If you&#x27;re looking for something that you can just throw on and be ready to go in, this is definitely not your item.</li>
            <li> Looks great, very soft, VERY long, keep a brush handy. It tangles very easily...! But that&#x27;s to be expected. I rate it at 3 stars ONLY because I could only wear it for about half an hour at a time before my scalp started itching insanely bad.&lt;br /&gt;The color is also more of a light baby blue than what is pictured.</li>
            <li> If I had 6 stars, I would give 6 stars, just excellent product, very good attention and excellent shipping time, certainly not a complaint I have. This wig is perfect for any cosplay.</li>
            <li> Thin as hell. Thin as hell. Thin as hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it stays in place very nicely with hairspray and gel, so it is easy to style. Beautiful color and nice length, but certainly not what I needed for Jinx.</li>
            <li> This went great with my costume. Its very well made not like all those cheap wigs. Im very very happy with this.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter but i love it,&lt;br /&gt;its a great quality and lots of fun to wear</li>
            <li> I got this wig, wanting to use it for jinx cosplay, and to be honest, its amazing in almost every way, however it tangles very quickly, and it is thin at the top. It&#x27;s nearly impossible to braid the wig without seeing through, so it&#x27;s better to use down(even then you see through a little, but not as much).</li>
            <li> i just loveeee iiiiittt... never had a wig before but allways wanted one in this color, just love it.. easy to use, easy to brush, its looks so beautifull and so out of this world.. very glad i purchase this wig</li>
            <li> this wig is really pretty and long very soft to. problem i had was finding the split were the bangs were so i could see lol overall i love it!</li>
            <li> Great wig for the price and arrived ahead of time and in good condition. I am very pleased as this will work well for my costume needs.</li>
            <li> this was an awsome buy though i would order at lest 2monthes ahead it takes forever to arvie but its form china so you expect that</li>
            <li> My first wig so I&#x27;m not too sure what to expect, but it&#x27;s really easy to tangle so handle with care.</li>
            <li> I purchased this wig for my daughter who was going to a convention in Los Angeles... She made the rest of the costume but needed the wig.  This worked perfectly and she had a great time!</li>
            <li> Yes there seem to be some bald spots, but styling and Bobby pins were made for a reason! Gorgeous color and texture. Definitely recommend this wig if you can deal with styling.</li>
