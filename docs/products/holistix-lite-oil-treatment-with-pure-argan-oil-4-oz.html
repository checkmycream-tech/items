            <li> GREAT product.  A little goes a really long way.  Use sparingly.  Great for your hair.  Very moisturizing. If you want healthy hair this is for you</li>
            <li> Apply this after shampooing to whole head, about six drops, and you&#x27;ll have tangle free, manageable hair that feels stronger, smells good, and looks healthy!  I love this product.</li>
            <li> I like it. When you blow dry, it&#x27;s a lot faster. Protects your hair as well. Non greasy. No unpleasant smell. Will get it again.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair. and a lot of hair. I have tried all other brands that may or may not be less expensive... but it is clear as night and day that this brand is totally the best. There is no comparison with this brand and others. I have many compliments on my hair at all times. and I would not go without applying enough of this oil from this maker into my hair after a shampoo ever! Thank you very much~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Cindy Jean Laba</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this Argan oil every time I shampoo my hair - MY HAIR JUST SHINES!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;M Haynes</li>
            <li> Someone gave me a sample of this I loved it.  Didn&#x27;t want to look all over town for salon that had it my salon doesn&#x27;t carry it I thought Amazon.  Great product</li>
            <li> Highly recommend when using blow dryer &amp; flat iron. It smells great and lasts a long time. Store out of sunlight.</li>
            <li> I use this to help moisturize my hair and protect it from heat styling and also to de-tangle my hair.  My hairstylist introduced this to me for my hair extensions.  She said to use this to help keep them from getting dried out and keep them in good condition.</li>
            <li> I put 3 drops of this oil on my hair after I wash my hair.  It makes it so much easier to comb and gives my hair a nice feel.</li>
            <li> If you have dry or over processed hair this product works great!  You only need a small amount and it leaves your hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Had the pleasure of being introduced to this product as a hair model for an event in my town and was given a bottle (plus hydrating shampoo and conditioner) as a gift. It smells lovely and really does seem to reduce drying time and give a beautiful shine. As someone with unruly, hard to manage and very long curly hair, I recommend with two thumbs up.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I have been using it for about a month or two now recommended by my hairdresser to help smooth my curly hair when I straighten it- which is everyday!  This makes my hair feel like silk super soft- not to mention it smells fantastic!  I would recommend to anyone looking for a light smoothing oil!  Holistix is the best!</li>
            <li> I have really thick, really dry hair. For years I have been searching for frizz control and moisturizing products. Although I&#x27;ve found some syrum and other products that work well, this product works the best by far. Only one squirt rubbed onto my hands and my hair stays soft and untangled for days.</li>
            <li> My hair is so much softer now that I use this product! You only need a small amount to make your hair appear healthier and softer!</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than local prices and great product - well packaged and shipped quickly - would buy more from this dealer.</li>
            <li> My very expensive hairdresser uses this oil on my hair.  I am OBSESSED with good smelling products for my hair.  It&#x27;s much more affordable on amazon.  The smell is TO DIE FOR!  The oil makes my hair manageable and soft.</li>
            <li> This oil is one of the best hair products I have ever used.  I blow dry my hair half way and then I put this oil in hair and finish blow drying.  It cuts the drying time in half and hair is left silky smooth.  I bought the 4 oz bottle and it has lasted a year with almost daily use...</li>
            <li> Best hair oil out there and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of oils!</li>
            <li> I love this oil been using it for years! By when it got here it had leaked a lot in the box:(</li>
