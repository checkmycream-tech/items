            <li>Best mascara</li>
            <li>This product is awesome.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>The best word to describe them is *extravagant.</li>
            <li>and im happy fairydrops made a waterproof one!</li>
            <li>Best mascara ever!!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I have used both the waterproof and non waterproof version and they are both great.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great because it separates your lashes and sets them.</li>
            <li>and I loved it...except that it smudges over my makeup after a while.</li>
            <li>If your lashes are already good, this probably won&#x27;t be for you.</li>
            <li>It has a drier formula vs Blinc (also a &amp;#34;tube&amp;#34;-forming mascara), which is good for building volume.</li>
            <li>They are great at catching the finest eyelashes at the corners of my eyes.</li>
            <li>I would recommend a good oil-based makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;That</li>
            <li>It is a bit more watery than i use to, but it works great.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely.  </li>
            <li>I loved it - and now I love the waterproof version even more.&lt;br /&gt;That wonky-looking brush?</li>
            <li>i have bought all kinds of mascara , this one by far is best .</li>
            <li>Love this mascara</li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>I love that it creates volume, holds the curl to my lashes, but I believe this irritated my eyes.</li>
            <li>I also wanted to see how many coats it took before it clumped</li>
            <li>Stayed on without smudging or flaking for the almost nine hours that I was able to wear it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The one drawback to this mascara (as with many waterproof mascaras) is that because it is waterproof, you have to work to get it off.</li>
            <li>I am a total mascara girl and this one is great!</li>
            <li>I love this mascara, so I was very excited to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I wear contact lenses, and my eyes felt incredibly sore after wearing this mascara the next day, and I think it&#x27;s because of the fibers in the mascara that irritated my eyes.</li>
            <li>and I use that when I am out of the Fairydrops (Clinique is also cheaper and more readily available)</li>
            <li>This time it didn&#x27;t go on as smooth, it&#x27;s a bit clumpier</li>
            <li>It is fantastic.</li>
            <li>but they kind of stick straight out.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t apply as smoothly and there are clumps everywhere.</li>
            <li>It applies as smoothly as the non-waterproof version.  </li>
            <li>I used to only use DiorShow, but was happy to come across this.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re real which was nice but tended to clump.  </li>
            <li>You could probably get something just as good or better at your local drug store.</li>
            <li>I will say it does look good when you put it on, but it just doesn&#x27;t stay, which is a major concern for me.</li>
            <li>worth the money !</li>
            <li>I then decided to try this one after doing some research on-line and how this was good for Asian type lashes.  </li>
            <li>This is nice mascara but for the price I expected more.  </li>
            <li>The very fine and densely packed bristles in the oddly shaped brush catch every single lash, and the combination of the brush and the fiber mascara formulation results in the best lashes I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>Very pretty tube.</li>
            <li>being said, I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive eyes and bought this hoping that I would be able to wear it.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had success with any fiber-containing mascara.  </li>
            <li>I have short, fine, asian lashes and this stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>This mascara is great because i no longer have to curl my lashes everyday!</li>
            <li>I have super straight lashes, but I&#x27;ve found if I use waterproof mascara after curling them, they stay put all day.</li>
            <li>I have used every single kind for thickening, lengthening, staying curled and non smudging and this has met all of the criteria mentioned.</li>
            <li>Lasted all day, was able to take it off easily with UD melt down.  </li>
            <li>As an Asian woman with the stereotypically short, sparse, and downward-pointing straight eyelashes, I&#x27;ve been searching my whole adult life for that perfect mascara.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t smudge because it has the &amp;#34;tube&amp;#34; technology, and works better for curling and lengthening because there are tiny fibers in the formula (again, does not flake).</li>
            <li>addition, what you can get on to your eyelashes, leaves traces below your bottom lashes even after you&#x27;ve washed your face twice and only applied it to your top lashes.</li>
            <li>I love waterproof only</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the fairydrops regular mascara--</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing and didn&#x27;t clump at all, looked natural only longer!  </li>
            <li>That being said, this product gives you the same affect as the two-step fiber products in one easy step and it lasts longer.  </li>
            <li>Only used this one tube and wasnt a huge fan.</li>
            <li>I found I did not like this as much as their water resistant version.</li>
            <li>I heard about this mascara, originally only available in Japan, in Allure magazine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s waterproof, doesn&#x27;t clump and makes my lashes look a lot longer than they really are.</li>
            <li>This is the best mascara I have ever used for my thin and straight Asian lashes.  </li>
            <li>It really adds volume and length (without clumps.)</li>
            <li>at least I know I love the regular kind.</li>
            <li>I tried Lancome Hypnose waterproof that absolutely did nothing for my lashes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on a mascara safari lately (ever since my beloved Max Factor 2000 Calorie Mascara was discontinued in the US.)</li>
            <li>Old formula - quick to apply, super long lashes without clumps, fully waterproof but amazingly easy to remove with a cloth &amp; water &amp; tiny bit of soap.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes stay curled too, which is something you might take for granted if you don&#x27;t have super straight hair (and eyelashes, obviously) like me.</li>
            <li>I have used Fairydrops mascara before but not this particular one.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Clinique High Impact Curling is also tubing technology</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I slept with my makeup on and by afternoon the following day, the mascara looked fresh as ever.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the most success with Japanese mascaras, and of the several Japanese mascaras I&#x27;ve tried, this one is the clear winner.</li>
            <li>It is the only mascara worth paying any money for.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have sensitive eyes, I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Better than the DiorShow stuff I usually use.</li>
            <li>One thing I wish I had paid attention to before purchasing was that the formula incorporates fibers, which tend to irritate sensitive eyes.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive eyes, this may not work for you either.</li>
            <li>However, where the non-waterproof version was absolutely smudge-proof, long lasting, this waterproof version smudges and actually wears off much faster.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have gone through at least 5 of these and am so glad that Amazon carries this, especially with Prime.</li>
            <li>New forumla - quick to apply, kinda long lashes still no clumps, fully waterproof ... &amp; now so hard to remove that I scrub my eyes &amp; wind up with irritated under-eye skin.</li>
            <li>It stays put and is super thick.</li>

            <li> It stays put and is super thick.</li>
            <li> I used this mascara in the past and really loved it, but this time around it was a total fail.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to find a mascara to keep my straight lashes curled after using an eyelash curler and this does the trick!</li>
            <li> Long, separated, defined, fanned out, almost a falsie effect, and not at all clumpy or spidery.</li>
            <li> I have always used waterproof and this took so long to take off even with waterproof makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I have semi-straight asian lashes, they don&#x27;t point down</li>
            <li> and it begins to flake off about 4-5 hours after application, leaving me with eye irritation resulting from tiny black fiber pieces that end up in and around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> it lasts forever, and both the normal and waterproof versions have serious staying power.</li>
            <li> This was much harder to get off and tended to clump/dry out faster.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a few times</li>
            <li> This mascara is the most luxurious--it makes my eyelashes so long, and it is so silky and the total opposite of those stiff, annoying waterproof mascaras!</li>
            <li> it is cakey and not worth the money you spend of it</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the mascara I received is not real thing, it doesn&#x27;t contains same ingredients as original one - I still have a box from the first one, and it doesn&#x27;t come off, with soap, or makeup remover, a real disappointment!</li>
            <li> Mine was dried out and clumpy.</li>
            <li> This tube of mascara had very little mascara in it at all.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would buy this again given the eye irritation and performance.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what all the hype is about with this mascara.</li>
            <li> I have been curling my lashes for the past 5 years and have always wanted a mascara where i did not have to curl my lashes every day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if they changed the formulation or what, but I had to return it this time because it just would not stay on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing waterproof mascara for years and this is no better than the mascara I can pick up at the drug store for 8 bucks.</li>
            <li> A big disappointment.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re working with very little, try this!</li>
            <li> and I have to say, it seriously holds a curl.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m not happy about having to go to a UPS dropoff to return it!&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on and off over the past two years and recently bought another one, after trying those two-step fiber lash products, which were awful, by the way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my eyes started tearing and burning an hour or so after I applied it.  </li>
            <li> So disappointed but</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smudge. Best mascara</li>
            <li> I found I did not like this as much as their water resistant version. This was much harder to get off and tended to clump/dry out faster. Only used this one tube and wasnt a huge fan.</li>
            <li> I think they re-formulated this product.  I&#x27;ve used it on and off over the past two years and recently bought another one, after trying those two-step fiber lash products, which were awful, by the way.  This time it didn&#x27;t go on as smooth, it&#x27;s a bit clumpier and it begins to flake off about 4-5 hours after application, leaving me with eye irritation resulting from tiny black fiber pieces that end up in and around my eyes.  That being said, this product gives you the same affect as the two-step fiber products in one easy step and it lasts longer.  Not sure if I would buy this again given the eye irritation and performance.  You could probably get something just as good or better at your local drug store.</li>
            <li> I heard about this mascara, originally only available in Japan, in Allure magazine. It is fantastic. Better than the DiorShow stuff I usually use. It stays put and is super thick. The brush allows the makeup to get on every tiny hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely reordering this product. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a few times and I have to say, it seriously holds a curl.  I slept with my makeup on and by afternoon the following day, the mascara looked fresh as ever.  I also took a shower and the mascara didn&#x27;t budge, so it&#x27;s definitely waterproof, too.  One thing I wish I had paid attention to before purchasing was that the formula incorporates fibers, which tend to irritate sensitive eyes.  All day, I find fibers flaking off into my eyes, making them red and watery.  I haven&#x27;t had success with any fiber-containing mascara.  So - if fibers don&#x27;t bother you, definitely give this a shot.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara I will keep buying it.</li>
            <li> i have bought all kinds of mascara , this one by far is best . no clumping , no smudging,no flaking , stays on tell i take it off aprox 3 days . worth the money !</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. It&#x27;s waterproof, doesn&#x27;t clump and makes my lashes look a lot longer than they really are. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what all the hype is about with this mascara. Mine was dried out and clumpy. I&#x27;m not impressed and I don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, so I was very excited to find it on Amazon. Unfortunately the mascara I received is not real thing, it doesn&#x27;t contains same ingredients as original one - I still have a box from the first one, and it doesn&#x27;t come off, with soap, or makeup remover, a real disappointment!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara. I purchased the non-waterproof version at Sephora while they still carried it and I loved it...except that it smudges over my makeup after a while. I got the waterproof version and problem solved! My eyelashes stay curled too, which is something you might take for granted if you don&#x27;t have super straight hair (and eyelashes, obviously) like me.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. I love that it creates volume, holds the curl to my lashes, but I believe this irritated my eyes. I wear contact lenses, and my eyes felt incredibly sore after wearing this mascara the next day, and I think it&#x27;s because of the fibers in the mascara that irritated my eyes. If you don&#x27;t have sensitive eyes, I highly recommend this. Also, I did find smudging underneath my eyes at the end of the day, but I have yet to find a mascara that hasn&#x27;t smudged on me so maybe it&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years - the tube color has changed &amp; the formulation with it. Old formula - quick to apply, super long lashes without clumps, fully waterproof but amazingly easy to remove with a cloth &amp; water &amp; tiny bit of soap. New forumla - quick to apply, kinda long lashes still no clumps, fully waterproof ... &amp; now so hard to remove that I scrub my eyes &amp; wind up with irritated under-eye skin.</li>
            <li> As an Asian woman with the stereotypically short, sparse, and downward-pointing straight eyelashes, I&#x27;ve been searching my whole adult life for that perfect mascara. I&#x27;ve had the most success with Japanese mascaras, and of the several Japanese mascaras I&#x27;ve tried, this one is the clear winner. The very fine and densely packed bristles in the oddly shaped brush catch every single lash, and the combination of the brush and the fiber mascara formulation results in the best lashes I&#x27;ve ever had. The best word to describe them is *extravagant.* Long, separated, defined, fanned out, almost a falsie effect, and not at all clumpy or spidery. And this mascara holds a curl all day and doesn&#x27;t smudge on me. I&#x27;ll definitely be keeping an eye on this listing and repurchasing as soon as they&#x27;re back in stock. I wouldn&#x27;t want to run out of this ever.</li>
            <li> I used to purchase this from Sephora but they no longer carry it. I have short, fine, asian lashes and this stuff is amazing! I curl my lashes and then apply 1 coat of this and it never smudges, even with my combination complexion. I have gone through at least 5 of these and am so glad that Amazon carries this, especially with Prime. This doesn&#x27;t smudge because it has the &amp;#34;tube&amp;#34; technology, and works better for curling and lengthening because there are tiny fibers in the formula (again, does not flake). Clinique High Impact Curling is also tubing technology and I use that when I am out of the Fairydrops (Clinique is also cheaper and more readily available) but I prefer the Fairydrops if I could use one exclusively. IF your lashes need help with lengthening, curling, and volume and you&#x27;re working with very little, try this! If your lashes are already good, this probably won&#x27;t be for you. There is a learning curve to applying this. It has a drier formula vs Blinc (also a &amp;#34;tube&amp;#34;-forming mascara), which is good for building volume. I love this product!</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I have ever used for my thin and straight Asian lashes.  I have used every single kind for thickening, lengthening, staying curled and non smudging and this has met all of the criteria mentioned. I have used both the waterproof and non waterproof version and they are both great. It is hard to find a mascara to keep my straight lashes curled after using an eyelash curler and this does the trick!</li>
            <li> I have used Fairydrops mascara before but not this particular one. This tube of mascara had very little mascara in it at all. A big disappointment. And I&#x27;m not happy about having to go to a UPS dropoff to return it!&lt;br /&gt;In addition, what you can get on to your eyelashes, leaves traces below your bottom lashes even after you&#x27;ve washed your face twice and only applied it to your top lashes. A never ending problem. I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have semi-straight asian lashes, they don&#x27;t point down but they kind of stick straight out. I have been curling my lashes for the past 5 years and have always wanted a mascara where i did not have to curl my lashes every day. This mascara is great because i no longer have to curl my lashes everyday! It is a bit more watery than i use to, but it works great. It lengthens a lot, and for volume, I don&#x27;t see a big difference. (But i do already have a lot of volume) I also wanted to see how many coats it took before it clumped and it took around 4-5 coats before it clumped and made lashes looked spidery. The biggest con is that since it is waterproof it takes forever to take off. I have always used waterproof and this took so long to take off even with waterproof makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive eyes and bought this hoping that I would be able to wear it.  It goes on nicely.  I like the brush it came with.  Very pretty tube. Stayed on without smudging or flaking for the almost nine hours that I was able to wear it.  Unfortunately, my eyes started tearing and burning an hour or so after I applied it.  So, I had to give it away after just one use.  If you have sensitive eyes, this may not work for you either.</li>
            <li> fibers in it make your lashes look ridiculously long, and from a girl with heavy asian eyelids, this is the first mascara I&#x27;ve ever had not smudge.  it lasts forever, and both the normal and waterproof versions have serious staying power.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on a mascara safari lately (ever since my beloved Max Factor 2000 Calorie Mascara was discontinued in the US.) I received a trial version of the Fairydrops Scandal Queen mascara with a Sephora value pack. I loved it - and now I love the waterproof version even more.&lt;br /&gt;That wonky-looking brush? It really adds volume and length (without clumps.) And the teeny-tiny teeth on the wand? They are great at catching the finest eyelashes at the corners of my eyes. Because I am vain, I tried wearing it while playing tennis - after an hour it didn&#x27;t smudge or sweat off.&lt;br /&gt;The one drawback to this mascara (as with many waterproof mascaras) is that because it is waterproof, you have to work to get it off. I would recommend a good oil-based makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li> I am a total mascara girl and this one is great! I love waterproof only and im happy fairydrops made a waterproof one!</li>
            <li> This mascara is the most luxurious--it makes my eyelashes so long, and it is so silky and the total opposite of those stiff, annoying waterproof mascaras!</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that made my eyes pop;  this did not.  it is cakey and not worth the money you spend of it</li>
            <li> Best mascara ever!!! It is exactly what I was looking for. Adds volume, and length, No flaking, stays all day and all night. It is the only mascara worth paying any money for. I can&#x27;t ever go back to the others.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the fairydrops regular mascara-- it&#x27;s the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. But after trying the waterproof, I got a totally different experience. It didn&#x27;t apply as smoothly and there are clumps everywhere. So disappointed but at least I know I love the regular kind.</li>
            <li> I used this mascara in the past and really loved it, but this time around it was a total fail.  I&#x27;m not sure if they changed the formulation or what, but I had to return it this time because it just would not stay on.  I will say it does look good when you put it on, but it just doesn&#x27;t stay, which is a major concern for me.</li>
            <li> It applies as smoothly as the non-waterproof version.  However, where the non-waterproof version was absolutely smudge-proof, long lasting, this waterproof version smudges and actually wears off much faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring back the non-waterproof version!</li>
            <li> I have super straight lashes, but I&#x27;ve found if I use waterproof mascara after curling them, they stay put all day. This stuff is great because it separates your lashes and sets them. I used to only use DiorShow, but was happy to come across this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of different mascara&#x27;s that either didn&#x27;t do anything or turned me into a &amp;#34;raccoon&amp;#34; by the end of the day.  I have skimpy lashes and oily lids.  I tried Lancome Hypnose waterproof that absolutely did nothing for my lashes.  I also tried Benefit They&#x27;re real which was nice but tended to clump.  I then decided to try this one after doing some research on-line and how this was good for Asian type lashes.  This stuff is amazing and didn&#x27;t clump at all, looked natural only longer!  Lasted all day, was able to take it off easily with UD melt down.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is nice mascara but for the price I expected more.  I&#x27;ve been wearing waterproof mascara for years and this is no better than the mascara I can pick up at the drug store for 8 bucks.</li>
