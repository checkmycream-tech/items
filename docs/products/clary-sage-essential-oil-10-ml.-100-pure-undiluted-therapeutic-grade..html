            <li> Excellent oil, fast shipping, packaged securely, excellent for hot flashes.</li>
            <li> Loooove it!! I use it in coconut oil to help with pain.. It also seems to relax me</li>
            <li> Came on time and love the way it smells</li>
            <li> It works great with my conditioner, however the smell is a little strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a newbie to using essential oils but this product seems to work as promised.</li>
            <li> I am not usually an essential oil person, nor do I believe in the multitudes of health ailments they &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34;. However I read an article that claimed that Clary Sage was a good oil to put in your bath and I have to say...I agree. There is something about this oil that puts Calgon to shame. I was way more relaxed than a normal bath and was not able to repeat it with other mainstream aromas or soaks. It may be one of the more expensive essential oils out there but it&#x27;s much cheaper than a spa visit and well worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Be ready for a very strong smell. Helps with cramps.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used essential oils in years until a friend told me about clary sage and how it was helping her granddaughter.  I decided to try it and really like it!</li>
            <li> I love this oil!  Plant Guru has sold me another success.  I absolutely love this fresh, cleansing scent.  Give it a try!</li>
            <li> I have used Clary sage for many of my recipes I make. I use it in my diffuser to calm the grandkids down right before bedtime. And i even make creams so i can massage onto my shoulders and arms to relax.. works wonders,  I Love this stuff. Great benefits it has and wonderful results as well. A must have in your essential oils kits.</li>
            <li> I like this fine but it drips bad.  It gets all over my hands - wasteful. I don&#x27;t know what is wrong with the dropper.</li>
            <li> I love everything I&#x27;ve purchased from plant guru.  I&#x27;m a return customer. I love their products, prices, selection and service.  I purchased Clary Sage for my brother and he also loves Plant Gurus products!</li>
            <li> I loved the smell, but it didn&#x27;t have affects I expected,and thought it would help with relaxation and muscle tension, it is great for aromatherapy.</li>
            <li> Really nice high quality product. Great !</li>
            <li> I just made a new lotion recipe and added the sage essential oil in it. The smell is a little strong at the beginning but doesn&#x27;t stay on you. Due that I&#x27;m so sensitive to smells, my biggest concern was the sage&#x27;s fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;I love my lotion with sage in it.&lt;br /&gt;Sage has many medicine properties such as stress relief, improve memory when you use it&#x27;s leaves in tea or cooking. It contains vitamins A and C and work as astringent and aging retarder. I can guess that it will be a good insect repellent too.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance, and packaged in glass bottle which preserves oil and fragrance. Thanks Plant Guru</li>
            <li> Plant Guru is the best! they are super fast with shipping and have wonderful products!</li>
            <li> I bought this essential oil to be used in many of my homemade blends (immunity blend, facial oil and facial toner blends, shampoo blend, peaceful sleep blend, deodorant blend, and linen spray blend).  It has an earthy, herbaceous-floral like fragrance.  I would buy this oil again from Plant Guru, as they offer great products at fair prices.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Thank you!!</li>
