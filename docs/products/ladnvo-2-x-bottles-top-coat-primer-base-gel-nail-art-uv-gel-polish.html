    <ol>
            <li>Great product for the price.</li>
            <li>the is the best nail top coat tat</li>
            <li>These do not work good at all</li>
            <li>its ok</li>
            <li>and then I used rubbing alcohol to remove the gummy layer on top.  </li>
            <li>Some gel top coats require alcohol on a cotton ball to remove to stickyness, so after about 2 or 3 mins under the light you are suppose to rub the alcohol on your nails.</li>
            <li>and then I used the UV light for 2 minutes for each coat.  </li>
            <li>nothing special..</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>That being said, I got these in the mail, and with high hopes, I popped in a movie for the kids (my own 2 and the 2 and 7 year old that I also watch during the day)</li>
            <li>peels right off after drying</li>
            <li>Does not peel easy and leaves a nice thick cost on the nails.</li>
            <li>It would have been better to spend a little more money on something that actually works like it is supposed to.</li>
            <li>I have to say that I purchased this because I am a stay at home Mom of 6 year old twins, and that means that I don&#x27;t have much time to do my nails, and when I do them, I would like the polish to last more than a day or two...  </li>
            <li>but the topcoat isn&#x27;t very shiny.</li>
            <li>Two nails came out OK, and the other 8 ranged from some mild smearing to the entire shebang coming off when I wiped it...  </li>
            <li>The polish dried, my nails are very strong, and so far the polish has been on for about a week with no cracking or lifting.  </li>
            <li>Works well on all gels I have tried doesn&#x27;t work very well over regular nail polish</li>
            <li>Never dried with UV lamp and without.</li>
            <li>The base coat is the best one</li>
            <li>It was half full and was oil.  </li>
            <li>So, in summary, takes a bit longer than some of the other polishes out there, but if you have patience it will work and for the price I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Basic and decent for price.</li>
            <li>I had previously used the Sally Hanson Sensationail system with good results, but the cost of their replacement base and top coats made me want to search for a cheaper alternative.  </li>
            <li>I could lay down a fairly good base and the second coat covers just fine...  </li>

            <li> I could lay down a fairly good base and the second coat covers just fine...  </li>
            <li> I have 3 different gel lights and after starting over again each time and using the lights for as long as 4 MINUTES, it still will not  set up.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry at all........</li>
            <li> doesnt dry have to wait an hour to use my hands</li>
            <li> Does not ever seem to dry!</li>
            <li> Not very Shiney but works</li>
            <li> Hopefully I will be able to return it. :-(</li>
            <li> The gel nail peeled off in less than a day.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a waste of money</li>
            <li> Having done this before, I put on some primer, base coat, two coats of polish and the topcoat, ( with a minute under the uv light after each coat)</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money!</li>
            <li> This time, I made sure that I used VERY THIN coats of the base and topcoats (which is tricky because they are quite thick)</li>
            <li> I also noticed that putting on the first coat of polish is difficult, because it doesn&#x27;t seem to stick to the base coat, but going over it a few times</li>
            <li> PLEASE, don&#x27;t waste your money on this stuff!!</li>
            <li> So, I was disappointed to say the least.  </li>
            <li> The worst purchase ever.  </li>
            <li> Do not buy it, is terrible.....</li>

            <li> Does not ever seem to dry! Wish I hadn&#x27;t bought this product. It would have been better to spend a little more money on something that actually works like it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> Grate for all the things i had to do it help me a grate deal and will be looking for the next grate thing to order.</li>
            <li> Works well on all gels I have tried doesn&#x27;t work very well over regular nail polish</li>
            <li> The worst purchase ever.  It was half full and was oil.  Never dried with UV lamp and without.</li>
            <li> nothing special..its ok</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work.... The gel nail peeled off in less than a day.</li>
            <li> Just not enough to do the hood of my Chevy.....But my wife loves it</li>
            <li> Do not buy it, is terrible..... It doesn&#x27;t dry at all........</li>
            <li> I have to say that I purchased this because I am a stay at home Mom of 6 year old twins, and that means that I don&#x27;t have much time to do my nails, and when I do them, I would like the polish to last more than a day or two...  I had previously used the Sally Hanson Sensationail system with good results, but the cost of their replacement base and top coats made me want to search for a cheaper alternative.  That being said, I got these in the mail, and with high hopes, I popped in a movie for the kids (my own 2 and the 2 and 7 year old that I also watch during the day) and I got started.  Having done this before, I put on some primer, base coat, two coats of polish and the topcoat, ( with a minute under the uv light after each coat) and then I used rubbing alcohol to remove the gummy layer on top.  Two nails came out OK, and the other 8 ranged from some mild smearing to the entire shebang coming off when I wiped it...  So, I was disappointed to say the least.  After the kids went to bed for the night I decided to give it another try...  This time, I made sure that I used VERY THIN coats of the base and topcoats (which is tricky because they are quite thick) and then I used the UV light for 2 minutes for each coat.  I also noticed that putting on the first coat of polish is difficult, because it doesn&#x27;t seem to stick to the base coat, but going over it a few times I could lay down a fairly good base and the second coat covers just fine...  Anyway, this method did seem to work.  The polish dried, my nails are very strong, and so far the polish has been on for about a week with no cracking or lifting.  So, in summary, takes a bit longer than some of the other polishes out there, but if you have patience it will work and for the price I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I have 3 different gel lights and after starting over again each time and using the lights for as long as 4 MINUTES, it still will not  set up. After 4 minutes it was still sticky with an oily like sheen on them. PLEASE, don&#x27;t waste your money on this stuff!!</li>
            <li> Some gel top coats require alcohol on a cotton ball to remove to stickyness, so after about 2 or 3 mins under the light you are suppose to rub the alcohol on your nails.</li>
            <li> doesnt work...peels right off after drying</li>
            <li> Basic and decent for price. The base coat is the best one but the topcoat isn&#x27;t very shiny.</li>
            <li> doesnt dry have to wait an hour to use my hands</li>
