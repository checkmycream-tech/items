            <li>The quality of the product is nice.</li>
            <li>A great companion conditioner to the MJ Super Slip Sudsy Shampoo.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner has a VERY strong salon-chemical smell.  </li>
            <li>I was honestly expecting more from this product.  </li>
            <li>it works alot better if you have the clenser too.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff...</li>
            <li>I have been using this product along with Miss Jessie&#x27;s shampoo and Curly Pudding and my hair has never looked better.</li>

            <li>I love love this.  </li>
            <li>I really love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love Miss Jessie&#x27;s product line.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a watery moisturizing cream than conditioner.</li>
            <li>Very happy I tried this after receiving a sample at my college homecoming last year.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this would work better for thicker hair</li>
            <li>This feels more like a cream rinse than a conditioner.</li>
            <li>I was so glad when I found it here on amazon for $8 cheaper then in store.</li>
            <li>You will be able to use it as a leave-in and use it by itself w/out shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love every miss Jessie&#x27;s product I have.  </li>
            <li>love this product.  </li>
            <li>Very rich and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>it smells great and leaves my hair really soft!</li>
            <li>Works great for my curly hair and keeping it soft.</li>
            <li>In other reviews, the fragrance is described as dryer sheets - perfect description.</li>
            <li>I really love the way it smells and use it primarly on dry hair as a leave in conditioner - works good!</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this to all you curly haired women,  </li>
            <li>Strong smell.</li>
            <li>I have amazingly fine hair which is also processed.</li>
            <li>this is a huge sign to how strong this can be for your hair.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just really fine, and kinks up.  </li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair looks shiny and healthy and doesn&#x27;t frizz out as quickly as it did before we started using this.</li>
            <li>HUGE dissapointment.</li>
            <li>My hair felt so soft and it smelled so good for days</li>
            <li>I have one more sample that I ordered from this company called Baby Butter Creme which I will THROW OUT right now.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t review many products but love love love this conditioner!  </li>
            <li>My hair feels super smooth, like silk or butter.</li>
            <li>and it also has a clean smell.</li>
            <li>then I use it as a leave-in, and follow up with their hair gel witch is also amazing, my hair stays soft all day !</li>
            <li>but I would recommend getting a sample size before you buy a full bottle or tub.</li>
            <li>but I love it so much that I HAVE to write a review.</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner makes my hair soft and easy to detangle.  </li>
            <li>Love the conditioner...a little high priced...but good!</li>
            <li>My hair is now super-soft, and while nothing is ever going to completely get rid of frizz, it&#x27;s so much more tamped down, it&#x27;s incredible.  </li>
            <li>My curls are better formed and my hair has an overall shine that I have never been able to achieve with another hair care line.</li>
            <li>, i didnt think it would come that quick</li>
            <li>Recently switched to Ouidad which I like better mostly because it doesn&#x27;t smell and has no dyes.</li>
            <li>Okay so the only positive thing I can say about miss Jessies is that when I ordered the free samples I received it in literally two days!</li>
            <li>This product does a great job of moisturizing  and conditioning your hair without leaving  heavy build up</li>
            <li>Worth the money, to me.  </li>
            <li>I love Miss Jessie&#x27;s products and this conditioner leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li>Not the right conditioner for my hair.</li>
            <li>You will look &#x27;right&#x27;.</li>
            <li>and i got it super fast</li>
            <li>This stuff makes your hair so soft and easy to comb out</li>
            <li>I have thinner, very curly hair, and this product allows me the freedom to choose whether or not I want to use supplemental product when I use with the Super Slip shampoo.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair easy to manage and soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li>Arrived on time as expected and love the product!</li>
            <li>I also used the super slip Sudsy shampoo which did not have such a strong smell.</li>
            <li>I really feel that this product protects my hair, and I&#x27;ve tried a huge number of both high end and drug store products.  </li>
            <li>This made my curls more defined and doesnt over-dry even with daily use.</li>
            <li>This conditioner really helps!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>You will feel pretty and people will tell you that.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair feeling clean, and so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>and when I take them out my hair is super conditioned and soft, but not sticky greasy.      </li>
            <li>The first one I&#x27;ve ever used that actually feels like it&#x27;s being absorbed by my hair!</li>
            <li>She is 2 1/2 and has curly blonde hair that is fine in texture.</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t really sure that this conditioner was the problem, but after my friend used this product to remove a buildup of residue in her locs I just knew this conditioner was not right for me.  </li>
            <li>But this product really makes a difference...</li>
            <li>It has also decreased the frizz and calmed my hair, which is great.</li>
            <li>Something in this is very drying on my hair.</li>
            <li>We have a whole drawer of products recommended by friends and even strangers about our daughters haircare.  </li>
            <li>Worked very well.  </li>
            <li>My girls have very curly hair</li>
            <li>This product was okay but didn&#x27;t provide the softening I expected.  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturally straight</li>
            <li>My hair type is 2b/2c but without much volume.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li>Your hair will feel &#x27;real&#x27;.</li>
            <li>They may be a little pricey, but WELL WORTH IT!!!</li>
            <li>I have almost shoulder length highly textured hair that is often dry when not fully relaxed that can be a real work out (think Macey Gray :) ) to comb out after washing.  </li>
            <li>I love this lines gel but have not had luck with the other products.</li>
            <li>NOt so much curls as frizz, particularly around the hairline.  </li>
            <li>Once out the shower, I comb my hair with a wide toothed comb and it is so easy.</li>
            <li>I mainly use it as a leave-in.  </li>
            <li>Initially my curls were soft well defined and frizz free.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend for those with tighter coiled/textured hair.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is so thick and rich, my hair loves it!!  </li>
            <li>the product gets stuck right where you initially put it.  </li>
            <li>I first tried this from a sample pack last year.  </li>
            <li>After two weeks if using this and the shampoos their hair is silky soft!  </li>
            <li>And now I&#x27;m willing to pay the regular price too.</li>
            <li>(I have natural 3c curls btw).</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair soft and takes the frizz away</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m attempting to go natural.  </li>
            <li>I have natural hair, and I have tried almost every product on the market for curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product to any body with natural hair.</li>
            <li>I went natural years ago</li>
            <li>I am mixed and I have A LOT of hair, curly and varying in color and texture, and I had to fill my palm to get enough to thoroughly coat my hair, as the product really doesn&#x27;t distribute very well -</li>
            <li>I had to wash my hair again the next day sooner than I normally would have to get the smell out.</li>
            <li>Finally I&#x27;ve found the product for me, and I don&#x27;t have to try every new brand that comes on the market.  </li>
            <li>With somewhat fine curls, it&#x27;s always a challenge to find a product that will moisturize my hair without weighing it down (I like my curls to be AS BIG AS POSSIBLE).</li>
            <li>If it can remove glue then it will DEFINITELY remove natural oils and such from your hair.</li>
            <li>My natural hair texture would be dry and would tagle after I rinsed this conditioner out.  </li>
            <li>This makes the process sooooo much easier and less stressful.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes because I love the Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow Soft Curls, but this left me disappointed.</li>

            <li> It makes my hair so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> You will feel pretty and people will tell you that.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair feeling clean, and so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> and when I take them out my hair is super conditioned and soft, but not sticky greasy.      </li>
            <li> The first one I&#x27;ve ever used that actually feels like it&#x27;s being absorbed by my hair!</li>
            <li> She is 2 1/2 and has curly blonde hair that is fine in texture.</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t really sure that this conditioner was the problem, but after my friend used this product to remove a buildup of residue in her locs I just knew this conditioner was not right for me.  </li>
            <li> But this product really makes a difference...</li>
            <li> It has also decreased the frizz and calmed my hair, which is great.</li>
            <li> Something in this is very drying on my hair.</li>
            <li> We have a whole drawer of products recommended by friends and even strangers about our daughters haircare.  </li>
            <li> Worked very well.  </li>
            <li> My girls have very curly hair</li>
            <li> This product was okay but didn&#x27;t provide the softening I expected.  </li>
            <li> My hair is naturally straight</li>
            <li> My hair type is 2b/2c but without much volume.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> Your hair will feel &#x27;real&#x27;.</li>
            <li> They may be a little pricey, but WELL WORTH IT!!!</li>
            <li> I have almost shoulder length highly textured hair that is often dry when not fully relaxed that can be a real work out (think Macey Gray :) ) to comb out after washing.  </li>
            <li> I love this lines gel but have not had luck with the other products.</li>
            <li> NOt so much curls as frizz, particularly around the hairline.  </li>
            <li> Once out the shower, I comb my hair with a wide toothed comb and it is so easy.</li>
            <li> I mainly use it as a leave-in.  </li>
            <li> Initially my curls were soft well defined and frizz free.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend for those with tighter coiled/textured hair.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is so thick and rich, my hair loves it!!  </li>
            <li> the product gets stuck right where you initially put it.  </li>
            <li> I first tried this from a sample pack last year.  </li>
            <li> After two weeks if using this and the shampoos their hair is silky soft!  </li>
            <li> And now I&#x27;m willing to pay the regular price too.</li>
            <li> (I have natural 3c curls btw).</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair soft and takes the frizz away</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m attempting to go natural.  </li>
            <li> I have natural hair, and I have tried almost every product on the market for curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product to any body with natural hair.</li>
            <li> I went natural years ago</li>
            <li> I am mixed and I have A LOT of hair, curly and varying in color and texture, and I had to fill my palm to get enough to thoroughly coat my hair, as the product really doesn&#x27;t distribute very well -</li>
            <li> I had to wash my hair again the next day sooner than I normally would have to get the smell out.</li>
            <li> Finally I&#x27;ve found the product for me, and I don&#x27;t have to try every new brand that comes on the market.  </li>
            <li> With somewhat fine curls, it&#x27;s always a challenge to find a product that will moisturize my hair without weighing it down (I like my curls to be AS BIG AS POSSIBLE).</li>
            <li> If it can remove glue then it will DEFINITELY remove natural oils and such from your hair.</li>
            <li> My natural hair texture would be dry and would tagle after I rinsed this conditioner out.  </li>
            <li> This makes the process sooooo much easier and less stressful.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes because I love the Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow Soft Curls, but this left me disappointed.</li>
            <li> When I put on the Creme de la Creme conditioner I was scared to even apply it to my hair because of the strong scent of chemicals, I even noticed that the first couple ingredients were bad news because of the drying properties of the alcohol.</li>
            <li> Very thick and rich.  </li>
            <li> It has helped to tame my very curly hair, and eliminate the frizz.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 65 and color my hair as well as using a flat iron daily.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to share this with anybody who is on the fence or is not sure if they should purchase or not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been natural for 4 yrs and typically just wash and go.</li>
            <li> My hair is long and I have problems with split ends</li>
            <li> The only packaging problem is that they apply a paper sticker to the bottle, which is an issue considering it is guaranteed to get wet.</li>
            <li> I had no wow impression.</li>
            <li> I am Caucasian with long wavy hair...</li>
            <li> I have a lot of new growth and this conditioner makes my hair so manageable, it is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> After one use, it makes your hair look as if you have dandruff, dry scalp, and buildup.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> now that I&#x27;m out the shower and my hair is almost dry</li>
            <li> It also leaves my hair feeling dry and crunchy and not at all moisturized.</li>
            <li> this conditions it and allows me to air dry my hair without frizz.</li>
            <li> It definitely helps define big fluffy curls.  </li>
            <li> This products&#x27; texture is like slime and is not effective on my hair either, also it does not create bubble/lather in my hair like normal shampoo</li>
            <li> It makes my hair have the appearance of loose waves.</li>
            <li> I felt that the product left my hair feeling a bit stiff upon completion of my hair-care regimen.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few times before but quit after my hair continues to gain new growth and gets really hard to comb through.  </li>
            <li> I usually burn out on beauty products before I finish the bottle, but I have ordered this several times.  </li>
            <li> I like some of the other Miss Jessie products as well</li>
            <li> I plan to try other products by Miss Jessie as well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference with other conditioners for wavy or curly hair.</li>
            <li> I may consider mixing with a bit of water or aloe juice and use as a leave-in spray conditioner for two-strand twists and other styles.  </li>
            <li> We have had trouble finding a conditioner that doesn&#x27;t dry out her hair or weigh it down.</li>
            <li> Made my very curly hair frizzy and smell weird.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is not like any other I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> I bought this at Target - (slightly cheaper than Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (Mid back length - very thin).</li>
            <li> The slip is also bad, making detangling an even more painful process than normal.</li>
            <li> I even put a little in my hair after I&#x27;ve washed it, to help style my hair sometimes.  </li>
            <li> A tip I use to thin it out a little to use it as a leave in and actually stretches use of one bottle is to mix it (in another bottle) with some 100% Aloe Vera juice....</li>
            <li> But by the end of the day my curls were completely dried out and felt coated with a film.</li>
            <li> When my hair dried it didn&#x27;t have any shine and looked frizzy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll get something else less expensive from the local drug store.</li>
            <li> I wish it was less expensive so that I could buy this on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> all I can smell is this horrible strong scent of harsh chemicals which should not be the case.</li>
            <li> My only disappointment in this product is the heavy fragrance and the color.</li>
            <li> the idea is to use some type of liquid to thin it out a little.  </li>
            <li> Have tried this conditioner several times with mediocre to poor results.  </li>
            <li> If you have hair, that is difficult to detangle or not very manageable, give this a try.</li>
            <li> The pack was so thick -it</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t mean you won&#x27;t</li>
            <li> My hair felt so greasy, dirty, and heavy.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this conditioner was not very moisturizing, did weigh down my curls, smelled terrible, and also did weird things to my skin.</li>
            <li> It almost stinks when you use it.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I&#x27;ll be buying this over and over again!</li>
            <li> but the hubby asked that I relax it because he felt bad for me as he watched me struggle to comb out and style every week without the relaxer in there.  </li>
            <li> It definately did not work with my hair texture. :(</li>
            <li> my curls hated this conditioner :(  </li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I like the way it made my hair feel, but the smell is terrible.</li>

            <li> I usually burn out on beauty products before I finish the bottle, but I have ordered this several times.  I&#x27;m 65 and color my hair as well as using a flat iron daily.  I really feel that this product protects my hair, and I&#x27;ve tried a huge number of both high end and drug store products.  This one does the trick!</li>
            <li> my curls hated this conditioner :(  I love this lines gel but have not had luck with the other products. doesn&#x27;t mean you won&#x27;t but I would recommend getting a sample size before you buy a full bottle or tub.</li>
            <li> I bought this and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. I will definitely never go back to regular shampoo again. My hair felt so soft and it smelled so good for days (I have natural 3c curls btw).</li>
            <li> Arrived on time as expected and love the product!</li>
            <li> Made my very curly hair frizzy and smell weird. Not a fan.</li>
            <li> This is great on my daughters hair!  If you have curly hair I recommend this It leaves your hair soft and takes the frizz away</li>
            <li> Love the conditioner...a little high priced...but good! Moisturized well and deep conditions! I purchased this along with the Super Sudsy shampoo and was impressed.</li>
            <li> After one use, it makes your hair look as if you have dandruff, dry scalp, and buildup. Did I mention it does not &amp;#34;condition&amp;#34; your hair as promised?</li>
            <li> I love the way this smells! And I can always get my comb through my hair unlike cheaper conditioners I have tried.</li>
            <li> this is a great conditioner! it works alot better if you have the clenser too. it smells great and leaves my hair really soft!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff...I mainly use it as a leave-in.  I am African American and I&#x27;m attempting to go natural.  I have tried a few times before but quit after my hair continues to gain new growth and gets really hard to comb through.  I think I have a 4 type hair.  But this product really makes a difference...I like some of the other Miss Jessie products as well but this is my favorite!!  No white flakes or build up.  I even use apply it to my braids when I have them in and when I take them out my hair is super conditioned and soft, but not sticky greasy.      A tip I use to thin it out a little to use it as a leave in and actually stretches use of one bottle is to mix it (in another bottle) with some 100% Aloe Vera juice....this is a great mixture!!  You probably also try to use something like an Infusium 23...the idea is to use some type of liquid to thin it out a little.  Just try adding even to get the Miss Jessie&#x27;s Creme de la Creme Conditioning Creme to a creamy smoothie like consistency.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair, and I have tried almost every product on the market for curly hair.  This is awesome.  It leaves your hair feeling clean, and so soft and manageable. I recommend this product to any body with natural hair. I plan to try other products by Miss Jessie as well.</li>
            <li> This product did nothing to soften my hair.  My natural hair texture would be dry and would tagle after I rinsed this conditioner out.  At first I wasn&#x27;t really sure that this conditioner was the problem, but after my friend used this product to remove a buildup of residue in her locs I just knew this conditioner was not right for me.  Miss Jessie&#x27;s Creme de la Creme Conditioner is great if you want to remove product buildup though.</li>
            <li> This is a great conditioner for curly or unruly wavy hair. I have been using this product along with Miss Jessie&#x27;s shampoo and Curly Pudding and my hair has never looked better. My curls are better formed and my hair has an overall shine that I have never been able to achieve with another hair care line.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff it stops breakage and conditions immediately. and i got it super fast, i didnt think it would come that quick so thank you miss jessies and thank you people who i bought this from. and the price is awesome. its like $22 at target so you saved me some mula.</li>
            <li> I love love this.  I have almost shoulder length highly textured hair that is often dry when not fully relaxed that can be a real work out (think Macey Gray :) ) to comb out after washing.  I also have a step-daughter who has mid back length hair with a personality that I use it on.  This makes the process sooooo much easier and less stressful.  I have not relaxed my hair in about 6 months after relaxing for years every 6-8 weeks.  I went natural years ago but the hubby asked that I relax it because he felt bad for me as he watched me struggle to comb out and style every week without the relaxer in there.  This stuff makes your hair so soft and easy to comb out it is amazing.  Comb out time before twisting, blow-drying, roller-setting, whatever is reduced drastically.  She is 11 and is so happy that she can wash her own hair and comb it out immediately because you can use a comb or a paddle brush with ease. I would highly recommend for those with tighter coiled/textured hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this conditioner hoping it would help my wavy/curly hair. My hair is long and I have problems with split ends and this seems to work great. It has an amazing smell that I absolutely love!! It makes my hair have the appearance of loose waves. It has also decreased the frizz and calmed my hair, which is great. I would definitely buy it again. I&#x27;ve tried many shampoos and conditioners, this conditioners great for wavy hair!</li>
            <li> Have tried this conditioner several times with mediocre to poor results.  Initially my curls were soft well defined and frizz free. But by the end of the day my curls were completely dried out and felt coated with a film. Could never get 2nd day hair even after trying to re-moisturize.  Something in this is very drying on my hair.</li>
            <li> I first tried this from a sample pack last year.  The pack was so thick -it only took a dime size to condition my hair. (Mid back length - very thin). I was in love!  Bought 2 bottles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a thick.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t condition as well.&lt;br /&gt; And just to feel like it has done something - I have to use about two (2) Tablespoons!&lt;br /&gt; It should never take that much!&lt;br /&gt; Whatever you did to the formula - it&#x27;s ruined a once great product.&lt;br /&gt; You have lost a customer.</li>
            <li> This made my curls more defined and doesnt over-dry even with daily use. I really love this stuff.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> We have a whole drawer of products recommended by friends and even strangers about our daughters haircare.  Miss Jessie&#x27;s product really is the best one we found.  They also have a December buy one/get one that&#x27;s unbeatable.</li>
            <li> Worked very well.  Smells great &amp; made my hair easy to comb out.</li>
            <li> great for curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have amazingly fine hair which is also processed. This conditioner is not like any other I&#x27;ve tried! It&#x27;s grease-free and literally adds weight to my lifeless stands! Anyone with processed and find hair knows the straw-like feeling of the hair.  This conditioner really helps! I cannot praise it enough! Needless to say I&#x27;ll be buying this over and over again!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, but since I did I&#x27;m just waiting for the bottle to be over. I didn&#x27;t see any difference with other conditioners for wavy or curly hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It has helped to tame my very curly hair, and eliminate the frizz.  I am very impressed and will be re-ordering this when it is all used up.  I strongly recommend this to all you curly haired women,  it makes me say &amp;#34;Big hair, don&#x27;t care!&amp;#34;  My hair looks great and is not frizzy at all.  What a relief!</li>
            <li> Not the right conditioner for my hair. Left my hair heavy and greasy feeling (and no I didn&#x27;t use too much or on my roots).</li>
            <li> I love Miss Jessie&#x27;s product line.</li>
            <li> My only disappointment in this product is the heavy fragrance and the color. In other reviews, the fragrance is described as dryer sheets - perfect description. It almost stinks when you use it. The fragrance stays in my hair just a bit. Would recommend that they reduce or eliminate the fragrance. I don&#x27;t understand the need to add coloring to hair products. The is a very bright green-blue, not quite teal, color. The quality of the product is nice. I have ordered it several times. Recently switched to Ouidad which I like better mostly because it doesn&#x27;t smell and has no dyes.</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my hair look!  Perfect curls and easy to detangle!  You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have curly hair, which I believe is what this is made for, but I love the texture it makes my hair and the smell is great!</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t review many products but love love love this conditioner!  My girls have very curly hair and it&#x27;s dry and brittle. After two weeks if using this and the shampoos their hair is silky soft!  I&#x27;ll buy this again and again!</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner makes my hair soft and easy to detangle.  I use it with the Creme de la Curl Shampoo.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I used it as a leave in conditioner. I&#x27;ve been natural for 4 yrs and typically just wash and go. This didn&#x27;t detangle well or give me the softness and curl definition I&#x27;m accustomed to. It&#x27;s more like a watery moisturizing cream than conditioner. When my hair dried it didn&#x27;t have any shine and looked frizzy. I definitely would not recommend this product for wash and go styling.</li>
            <li> A great companion conditioner to the MJ Super Slip Sudsy Shampoo.  Very thick and rich.  I may consider mixing with a bit of water or aloe juice and use as a leave-in spray conditioner for two-strand twists and other styles.  Just a thought.  Very happy I tried this after receiving a sample at my college homecoming last year.  #GoCAU</li>
            <li> I was honestly expecting more from this product.  This conditioner has a VERY strong salon-chemical smell.  I am mixed and I have A LOT of hair, curly and varying in color and texture, and I had to fill my palm to get enough to thoroughly coat my hair, as the product really doesn&#x27;t distribute very well - the product gets stuck right where you initially put it.  However, once you get the hair coated properly, combing through the hair is a breeze.  I felt that the product left my hair feeling a bit stiff upon completion of my hair-care regimen.</li>
            <li> This product was okay but didn&#x27;t provide the softening I expected.  I&#x27;ll get something else less expensive from the local drug store.</li>
            <li> My favorite conditioner ever! The first one I&#x27;ve ever used that actually feels like it&#x27;s being absorbed by my hair!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have thinner, very curly hair, and this product allows me the freedom to choose whether or not I want to use supplemental product when I use with the Super Slip shampoo. The only packaging problem is that they apply a paper sticker to the bottle, which is an issue considering it is guaranteed to get wet.</li>
            <li> I did not purchase this conditioner on amazon but I love it so much that I HAVE to write a review. I&#x27;ve always eyeballed the Miss Jessie&#x27;s hair products but I never wanted to spend the money. A couple of weeks before Christmas I was at Target and I bought the Creme de la Creme Condtioner for $6.00. And I&#x27;m so glad I did. I used to relax my hair but I stopped 8 months ago. I am now transitioning. I have a corkscrew type curl. I have a lot of new growth and this conditioner makes my hair so manageable, it is unbelievable. I detangle my hair in the shower with my fingers. Once out the shower, I comb my hair with a wide toothed comb and it is so easy. I always had to use another product for this step (such as a serum or a detangling spray). But now, all I need is this conditioner. My hair feels super smooth, like silk or butter. I really love it. And now I&#x27;m willing to pay the regular price too. I really wanted to share this with anybody who is on the fence or is not sure if they should purchase or not. If you have hair, that is difficult to detangle or not very manageable, give this a try. It will make your life a lot easier.</li>
            <li> I really love the way it smells and use it primarly on dry hair as a leave in conditioner - works good!</li>
            <li> Okay so the only positive thing I can say about miss Jessies is that when I ordered the free samples I received it in literally two days! My hair is naturally straight and ive never chemically treated it with anything. When I put on the Creme de la Creme conditioner I was scared to even apply it to my hair because of the strong scent of chemicals, I even noticed that the first couple ingredients were bad news because of the drying properties of the alcohol. I decided to give it a try and apply it to my hair, when I rinsed it - I had no wow impression. now that I&#x27;m out the shower and my hair is almost dry all I can smell is this horrible strong scent of harsh chemicals which should not be the case. I also used the super slip Sudsy shampoo which did not have such a strong smell. This products&#x27; texture is like slime and is not effective on my hair either, also it does not create bubble/lather in my hair like normal shampoo is suposed to. I have one more sample that I ordered from this company called Baby Butter Creme which I will THROW OUT right now. I cannot take another chance and ruin my hair.&lt;br /&gt;PS. in the front of the shampoo it says that it will Remove Weave Glue...this is a huge sign to how strong this can be for your hair. If it can remove glue then it will DEFINITELY remove natural oils and such from your hair. I find it rediculous that any of these products are selling for OVER ONE DOLLAR.&lt;br /&gt;please try the sample before wasting your money!</li>
            <li> Very rich and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Loved it until I took a really good look at the ingredients&#x27; list. Any product with alcohol will not touch my head. period.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use the product as a leave in conditioner, I put it in and rinsed it out. I like the way it made my hair feel, but the smell is terrible. I had to wash my hair again the next day sooner than I normally would have to get the smell out.</li>
            <li> Very nice product, longtime user.</li>
            <li> With somewhat fine curls, it&#x27;s always a challenge to find a product that will moisturize my hair without weighing it down (I like my curls to be AS BIG AS POSSIBLE). Unfortunately, this conditioner was not very moisturizing, did weigh down my curls, smelled terrible, and also did weird things to my skin. The slip is also bad, making detangling an even more painful process than normal. I don&#x27;t know if this would work better for thicker hair but I will never purchase it again (especially considering I still have an entire bottle since I only used it for about a week).</li>
            <li> Works great for my curly hair and keeping it soft.</li>
            <li> I use this conditioner for my daughter. She is 2 1/2 and has curly blonde hair that is fine in texture. We have had trouble finding a conditioner that doesn&#x27;t dry out her hair or weigh it down. We use this as a rinse out conditioner in the bath and then we mix it with water and spray it into her hair as a daily leave in. My daughter&#x27;s hair looks shiny and healthy and doesn&#x27;t frizz out as quickly as it did before we started using this. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I wish it was less expensive so that I could buy this on a regular basis. If you&#x27;ve got curly hair, this is the product for you!</li>
            <li> This product does a great job of moisturizing  and conditioning your hair without leaving  heavy build up and it also has a clean smell.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> This feels more like a cream rinse than a conditioner. It also leaves my hair feeling dry and crunchy and not at all moisturized. I had high hopes because I love the Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow Soft Curls, but this left me disappointed. My hair type is 2b/2c but without much volume.</li>
            <li> I tried this item after reading some reviews and decided to give it a try.  HUGE dissapointment. My hair felt so greasy, dirty, and heavy.  It definately did not work with my hair texture. :(</li>
            <li> I bought this at Target - (slightly cheaper than Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a white girl with a LOT of hair, it&#x27;s just really fine, and kinks up.  NOt so much curls as frizz, particularly around the hairline.  I LOVE this stuff!  My hair is now super-soft, and while nothing is ever going to completely get rid of frizz, it&#x27;s so much more tamped down, it&#x27;s incredible.  Worth the money, to me.  I&#x27;m going to try some of the more expensive cremes next.</li>
            <li> Strong smell. Didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> I loooooooove this conditioner ! It makes my hair so smooth and soft. It also leaves my hair smelling amazing for days. I use it as a rinse-out then I use it as a leave-in, and follow up with their hair gel witch is also amazing, my hair stays soft all day ! I was so glad when I found it here on amazon for $8 cheaper then in store.</li>
            <li> Your hair will feel &#x27;real&#x27;. You will not have white ... residue later in day. You will be able to use it as a leave-in and use it by itself w/out shampoo. You will not itch. You will feel pretty and people will tell you that. You will look in the mirror and believe them. You will look &#x27;right&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair easy to manage and soft to the touch.  It makes the comb glide through my hair(natural hair style).</li>
            <li> This conditioner is so thick and rich, my hair loves it!!  It definitely helps define big fluffy curls.  I even put a little in my hair after I&#x27;ve washed it, to help style my hair sometimes.  I love every miss Jessie&#x27;s product I have.  Finally I&#x27;ve found the product for me, and I don&#x27;t have to try every new brand that comes on the market.  They may be a little pricey, but WELL WORTH IT!!!</li>
            <li> This is the BEST for hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li> I ordered here because I cant find it in stores...love this product.  I am Caucasian with long wavy hair...this conditions it and allows me to air dry my hair without frizz.</li>
            <li> I love Miss Jessie&#x27;s products and this conditioner leaves my hair soft.</li>
