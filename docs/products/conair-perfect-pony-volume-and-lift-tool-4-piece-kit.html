            <li>Thanks again Conair for a GREAT product! :)</li>
            <li>my go-to work out pony tail just got a whole lot more awesome!!!</li>
            <li>She says it is very easy to use, and she recommends to others.</li>
            <li>It was very, very easy to use</li>
            <li>Wish I had found this many, many years ago!  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love!  </li>
            <li>Very bizarre looking.&lt;br</li>
            <li>anyhow...really liked this product and was worthy every penny!</li>
            <li>Now I can wear ponytails and love how it looks.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Air for sure.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t that this cost a lot, but the description made me think that it was something more than a length of plastic tubing around which you have to fashion your hair.</li>
            <li>I Love it and</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace one I lost and love it.  </li>
            <li>even my hubby said my ponytail looked cute and sassy :)</li>
            <li>I receive many compliments.  </li>
            <li>The instructions were easy, and on my second try I got it perfect.</li>
            <li>But it looks good, is pretty comfortable</li>
            <li>It looks full and neat!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to do and makes your pony tail look thicker.</li>
            <li>I find it quite easy to use.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be discouraged though, it is easy to master.</li>
            <li>and I thought that this would get covered up easily, but it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Easy Handling</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made out of a kind of sticky rubber that grips your hair pretty well and holds it in place.</li>
            <li>I just got this for less than $5.00 at Walgreen&#x27;s and it is wonderful!</li>
            <li>its very good and hold your hair very good,if you made moor different seizes and colours,it would be better .</li>
            <li>This thing is a HUGE gimmick that doesn&#x27;t work at all.  </li>
            <li>did have to switch hands a few times to get all my hair through the elastic while holding the perfect pony in place</li>
            <li>Comfortable to wear, no pulling anywhere.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t ever slip, is comfortable (can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s there) and does not show.  </li>
            <li>Perfect-Pony product is a clever idea for anyone with thicker hair than my own.  </li>
            <li>Of all the hair gadgets I have, this one is definitely in the top 2 (I equally love my spin pins for quick, easy buns).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The pony looks incredible, I have long hair but not thick at all--</li>
            <li>The gadget was attempted and succeeded in use the very first time by 2 of my friends.</li>
            <li>Those same friends that have a tendency to tease me because of my love of gadgets - hey!</li>
            <li>BUT, it&#x27;s not slick like PVC, it&#x27;s more rubbery like silicone.</li>
            <li>The perfect pony is white and that originally concerned me because my hair is dark brown, however it does not show so no need to be concerned about that.</li>
            <li>The ponytail is super secure even holds up to a rumbustious 10 month old.</li>
            <li>However when your hair is thin there&#x27;s not too many styles that look good.</li>
            <li>:) I had a pituitary tumor back in 2004 &amp; had to take medicine for it.</li>
            <li>Thanks Conair!</li>
            <li>Works ok but it does not make a big difference</li>
            <li>and i was surprised at how secure it felt when it was in.</li>
            <li>but it definitely worked better for me with a bit trimmed off.</li>
            <li>The first time I attempted to put it in was a little tricky, I kept catching it with my brush and it would slip out of my grip.</li>
            <li>But regular thin and fine works just great.</li>
            <li>so idk if the price was good, but even if not--- worth every penny for me!!!</li>
            <li>THEN with your THIRD HAND, you take one of the hair elastics and gather secure the whole thing together.  </li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>This product really does make you look like you have fuller hair.  </li>
            <li>Also, it really didn&#x27;t give my hair much lift or volume and my hair stuck to it, and pulled when I tried to take it out.</li>
            <li>it made my pony so much cuter</li>
            <li>but if you cut too much it won&#x27;t hold anymore (made that mistake).</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>When I tried out this product it was easy to upload my long hair in a pony</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair</li>
            <li>Have a 2.4 inch pony tail circumference at the moment without conair (had 3.1 inches before the shed), the single hair is fine and straight.</li>
            <li>It also holds the pony more \\&quot;out\\&quot; from my head (rather than straight down with the weight of all my hair).&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>and it Looks very Naturally in The hair!</li>
            <li>Only 4 stars because it would be nice if it came in a dark color as well.</li>
            <li>I love this thing, and was suprised that it stayed put since my hair is so heavy.</li>
            <li>My hair is thin enough that I could wrap a ponytail holder around it five times, with the Perfect Pony the elastic goes around my ponytail only two times.</li>
            <li>This makes my hair look nice and thick.</li>
            <li>took it out of the box, and it is a white, rubbery tube with several hair ties to secure it to your hair.  </li>
            <li>As it is, I am just going to have to store this little white elephant for a respectable amount of time before I throw it away.  </li>
            <li>Purchased this item used and it once so far.</li>
            <li>Oh Wow.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li>but it is fine my hair is about three inches below my shoulders and the tube stuck out not good for thin or fine hair and it takes alot more than a few times to figure it out</li>
            <li>Unlike other gadgets I&#x27;ve purchased this was a winner from the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>If you have really thin hair you might not be able to disguise the device.</li>
            <li>My hair is so thick that my pony tail sags way down under its own weight, and I thought this product might give it some lift.</li>
            <li>Using the combination of those 2 items gives such a clean, polished look to an otherwise ordinary ponytail.</li>
            <li>I am writing this review because I am surprised people say this doesn&#x27;t work for thin or fine hair.</li>
            <li>However, I will say that getting the thing in my hair in the first place was not as much trouble as I anticipated.</li>
            <li>I actually bought this product ages ago and have received so many compliments on my hair when I wore it that I finally gave away my secret recently at a girlfriend&#x27;so birthday party.</li>
            <li>I purchased it because my hair is thin and fine and the package promised \\&quot;volume and lift\\&quot;.  </li>

            <li> I purchased it because my hair is thin and fine and the package promised \\&quot;volume and lift\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I have long fine hair - lots of it, but when I put it in a ponytail, it looks thin.  </li>
            <li> I have had a big shed last year due to iron deficiency and my fine hair got quite thin.</li>
            <li> there is a secret to making this little device work as advertised, I would love for someone to share it with me.</li>
            <li> Overall, I thought it was a waste of even its modest price.</li>
            <li> (I couldn&#x27;t use my usual technique since I had to hold the contraption, but my hair is waist-long, so it probably won&#x27;t be a problem for everyone).&lt;br /&gt;Thrilled with the results, clever idea.</li>
            <li> You are supposed to pull the upper hair into a sort of half-pony and stick the little white tube under the upper hair.  </li>
            <li> Then, you admire yourself while the little white tube squirrells around on it&#x27;s side like some weird lopsided antennae, poking out of your hair in a most unattractive way.  </li>
            <li> As far as I&#x27;m  concerned, a big waste of money!</li>
            <li> it was too long.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t even know my hair isn&#x27;t really that thick or voluminous.</li>
            <li> being a new mommy( we all can remember the limp thinning hair months after that gorgeousness of pregnancy hair disappears! )</li>
            <li> The longer your hair is, the harder it is.</li>
            <li> THEN, while holding this in place, you take your other hand and gather the rest of the hair and pull it up towards the underside of the little white tube.  </li>
            <li> My hair is long so it takes a little longer to use this</li>
            <li> I have really long hair past my butt, works somewhat</li>
            <li> The problem was that it created a pony tail so ridiculously thick that my super-duper extra-strength elastic snapped when I tried to wrap it around only twice!</li>
            <li> I have no problem laying down with it.</li>
            <li> My long thick hair weighs it down.</li>
            <li> It will be awkward at first, and will take some getting used to, but if you have the sort of baby-fine hair that I envy, this product might work well for you.</li>
            <li> I did end up cutting a little bit (two of the little ridges) off the end of the device because it seemed to stick out too far from the back of my head and show through my hair.</li>
            <li> It is a little tricky but, eventually got it.</li>
            <li> The pipe looking thing kept slipping out of my hands and the rubber band is took thick and tight to even get my hands around the pipe..</li>
            <li> the reviews said it took a few times to get the hang if it</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product is far from &amp;#34;perfect.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have both and use this almost everyday.</li>
            <li> The only thing I can imagine is that these reviewers have the thinest of thin hair -- maybe wispy.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know why the other reviewer complained about the color.</li>
            <li> One downside, is that it is hard to lay down with your head on the floor or another stiff surface like a weight bench at the gym.   </li>
            <li> i actually bought this at bimart and it was less expensive.</li>
            <li> Not good for thick hair or long</li>
            <li> I usually wear my hair in a ponytail, or the ponytail bun looking thing.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not working for me :/</li>
            <li> i did end up cutting a tiny bit off the length</li>
            <li> Warning: This product is not for thick hair.</li>
            <li> A real waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick hair</li>
            <li> but I wanted that thick Ariana Grande pony tail, which is definitley what I got with this product.</li>
            <li> It can be a little awkward to put in all by yourself cuz you have to hold it in place with one hand and try to wrap the band around with the other.</li>
            <li> I seriously don&#x27;t know how to do hair, so I depend on the gadgets to help me out - were standing there in awe and asking where to get one.</li>
            <li> People always think I&#x27;ve wrapped my hair around the ponytail and are shocked when I reveal that it isn&#x27;t actually my hair!</li>
            <li> At least the name of the company is correct!</li>
            <li> and this makes my pony tail look very thick.  </li>
            <li> Now it looks like I have very thick</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair as it is</li>
            <li> I have somewhat thin hair</li>
            <li> The thing is if your hair is thin at times the silicone/rubber thing does show.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a white ribbed tube with a base.</li>
            <li> And if you have thin hair, that chunk of plastic shows through in places.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately everyone could see the plastic tubing on my head</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t lie, was so skeptical when ordering, I thought, let me try, but didn&#x27;t get my hopes up....</li>
            <li> If you have very thin hair it may shine through.</li>
            <li> Not to mention the crown is very thin.</li>
            <li> I have really thin hair and my ponytail always looked very sad.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my hair started to thin really bad.</li>
            <li> My ponytails look awful now.</li>
            <li> This thing is WORTHLESS!!  </li>

            <li> I have really thin hair and my ponytail always looked very sad. Now I can wear ponytails and love how it looks. This makes my hair look nice and thick. AND its affordable!</li>
            <li> Love this. It&#x27;s really easy to do and makes your pony tail look thicker.</li>
            <li> its very good and hold your hair very good,if you made moor different seizes and colours,it would be better .</li>
            <li> Really works. I have somewhat thin hair and this makes it look a lot fuller. It can be a little awkward to put in all by yourself cuz you have to hold it in place with one hand and try to wrap the band around with the other. The longer your hair is, the harder it is. But it looks good, is pretty comfortable and you can&#x27;t see it.</li>
            <li> Warning: This product is not for thick hair. My hair is so thick that my pony tail sags way down under its own weight, and I thought this product might give it some lift. The problem was that it created a pony tail so ridiculously thick that my super-duper extra-strength elastic snapped when I tried to wrap it around only twice! However, I will say that getting the thing in my hair in the first place was not as much trouble as I anticipated. It&#x27;s made out of a kind of sticky rubber that grips your hair pretty well and holds it in place. It will be awkward at first, and will take some getting used to, but if you have the sort of baby-fine hair that I envy, this product might work well for you.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to get that model pony tail the reviews said it took a few times to get the hang if it, I have alot of hair but it is fine my hair is about three inches below my shoulders and the tube stuck out not good for thin or fine hair and it takes alot more than a few times to figure it out</li>
            <li> This product really does make you look like you have fuller hair.  It takes a couple minutes to put but it works well.</li>
            <li> One of the teeth snapped off on the third used.  Not good for thick hair or long hair.&lt;br /&gt;A rip off for the price..  CON. Air for sure.  At least the name of the company is correct!</li>
            <li> So happy to have found this product it is fabulous . Thank you</li>
            <li> I have had a big shed last year due to iron deficiency and my fine hair got quite thin. With this product my pony tail looks great. I find it quite easy to use. If you have very thin hair it may shine through. Have a 2.4 inch pony tail circumference at the moment without conair (had 3.1 inches before the shed), the single hair is fine and straight.</li>
            <li> Does a great job making my ponytail look fuller. Wish it also came in a larger size for formal occasions. I would be even happier with it if It came in colors that would blend with my hair so that I could use it for a half-up look.  For just a pony tail, it&#x27;s not a problem for me though.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this product ages ago and have received so many compliments on my hair when I wore it that I finally gave away my secret recently at a girlfriend&#x27;so birthday party. It was at her house, so the result was a group of about 5 women scrunched in her bathroom as I took out my perfect ponytail and showed them how easy it was. The gadget was attempted and succeeded in use the very first time by 2 of my friends. They immediately insisted on getting one. Those same friends that have a tendency to tease me because of my love of gadgets - hey! I seriously don&#x27;t know how to do hair, so I depend on the gadgets to help me out - were standing there in awe and asking where to get one. Of all the hair gadgets I have, this one is definitely in the top 2 (I equally love my spin pins for quick, easy buns).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One awesome trick with this: I get the Mia ponytail wraps that look like my hair and put them over my regular hair elastic. People always think I&#x27;ve wrapped my hair around the ponytail and are shocked when I reveal that it isn&#x27;t actually my hair! Using the combination of those 2 items gives such a clean, polished look to an otherwise ordinary ponytail.</li>
            <li> Perfect-Pony product is a clever idea for anyone with thicker hair than my own.  When I tried out this product it was easy to upload my long hair in a pony but unfortunately everyone could see the plastic tubing on my head and I shall be passing this product on to people with thicker hair</li>
            <li> I usually wear my hair in a ponytail, or the ponytail bun looking thing. I kept seeing this in stores and wondered if it was any good. I finally bought it, because it was only $5. I wear it practically every day now!!! I love how it transformed my ponytail into a masterpiece! I keep getting compliments on how nice my hair looks. Ha! They don&#x27;t even know my hair isn&#x27;t really that thick or voluminous. The first time I attempted to put it in was a little tricky, I kept catching it with my brush and it would slip out of my grip. Don&#x27;t be discouraged though, it is easy to master. If you have really thin hair you might not be able to disguise the device. One downside, is that it is hard to lay down with your head on the floor or another stiff surface like a weight bench at the gym.   Oh and P.s. i don&#x27;t know why the other reviewer complained about the color. Who cares? Your hair covers it up, so what is the point there??</li>
            <li> I found this at Kmart. It is a little tricky but, eventually got it. Now I don&#x27;t know what I ever did without it! :) I had a pituitary tumor back in 2004 &amp; had to take medicine for it. Unfortunately my hair started to thin really bad. My ponytails look awful now. Not to mention the crown is very thin. I cry all the time when I have to fix my hair to go somewhere. First off I use Dermatch &amp; or Great Hair Day to cover up the thinness (works great)! However when your hair is thin there&#x27;s not too many styles that look good. Until I found Perfect Pony. Thanks Conair! I love it. My hair is long so it takes a little longer to use this but, when I am done. My ponytail looks awesome. Just as one of the poster&#x27;s above I do wish it came in brown. I know the last poster commented on the poster that said she wished it came in brown. The thing is if your hair is thin at times the silicone/rubber thing does show. I have to pull hair around it to cover it at times. I have no problem laying down with it. As a matter a fact I slept with it. Didn&#x27;t bother me at all. Thanks again Conair for a GREAT product! :)</li>
            <li> my go-to work out pony tail just got a whole lot more awesome!!! love this thing!!! my dog keeps eating them, so I have to keep replacing them, they are awesome!</li>
            <li> In this box is a device that looks like something from the plumbing department at Home Depot...it&#x27;s a white ribbed tube with a base. BUT, it&#x27;s not slick like PVC, it&#x27;s more rubbery like silicone. The instructions were easy, and on my second try I got it perfect. I was worried the white plastic would show through, but it doesn&#x27;t. It also holds the pony more \\&quot;out\\&quot; from my head (rather than straight down with the weight of all my hair).&lt;br /&gt;Note that hair doesn&#x27;t go through the tube, it is just gathered around the tube.&lt;br /&gt;I did have to switch hands a few times to get all my hair through the elastic while holding the perfect pony in place (I couldn&#x27;t use my usual technique since I had to hold the contraption, but my hair is waist-long, so it probably won&#x27;t be a problem for everyone).&lt;br /&gt;Thrilled with the results, clever idea. Only 4 stars because it would be nice if it came in a dark color as well.</li>
            <li> Purchased this item used and it once so far. I have really long hair past my butt, works somewhat but I think I need to trim my hair. My long thick hair weighs it down.</li>
            <li> Oh Wow.  This thing is a HUGE gimmick that doesn&#x27;t work at all.  I purchased it because my hair is thin and fine and the package promised \\&quot;volume and lift\\&quot;.  I should have known that it was too good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took it out of the box, and it is a white, rubbery tube with several hair ties to secure it to your hair.  You are supposed to pull the upper hair into a sort of half-pony and stick the little white tube under the upper hair.  THEN, while holding this in place, you take your other hand and gather the rest of the hair and pull it up towards the underside of the little white tube.  THEN with your THIRD HAND, you take one of the hair elastics and gather secure the whole thing together.  Then, you admire yourself while the little white tube squirrells around on it&#x27;s side like some weird lopsided antennae, poking out of your hair in a most unattractive way.  Very bizarre looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there is a secret to making this little device work as advertised, I would love for someone to share it with me. As it is, I am just going to have to store this little white elephant for a respectable amount of time before I throw it away.  Sigh.  A real waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> Works ok but it does not make a big difference</li>
            <li> I purchased the Perfect Pony for my daughter. She loves how it makes her hair look thicker where she rubber bands it for her ponytail.  She says it is very easy to use, and she recommends to others.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick hair and I thought that this would get covered up easily, but it wasn&#x27;t. You could see the white plastic. Also, it really didn&#x27;t give my hair much lift or volume and my hair stuck to it, and pulled when I tried to take it out. Unfortunately, this product is far from &amp;#34;perfect.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I tried this 5 times and never got it! The pipe looking thing kept slipping out of my hands and the rubber band is took thick and tight to even get my hands around the pipe.. If anybody could give me some advice, please do.. I seen good reviews but it&#x27;s not working for me :/</li>
            <li> This thing is WORTHLESS!!  I tried doing it myself - that was a joke!  I had a friend try - still couldn&#x27;t do it. I will take it with me the next time I get my hair done and see if my stylist can figure it out.  As far as I&#x27;m  concerned, a big waste of money!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t that this cost a lot, but the description made me think that it was something more than a length of plastic tubing around which you have to fashion your hair. And if you have thin hair, that chunk of plastic shows through in places. Overall, I thought it was a waste of even its modest price.</li>
            <li> The product Perfect Pony is a very Good product! Easy Handling and it Looks very Naturally in The hair! I Love it and The Price is very Good for this quality</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace one I lost and love it.  I have long, fine hair and this makes my pony tail look very thick.  I always get compliments on great my pony tail looks when I wear this.</li>
            <li> Love this Perfect Pony,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair has thinned over the years and my pony tails&lt;br /&gt;was awful.  Now it looks like I have very thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;Just love it!</li>
            <li> I must say, seldom write reviews but I was just compelled to review this product! I won&#x27;t lie, was so skeptical when ordering, I thought, let me try, but didn&#x27;t get my hopes up.... Let me tell you; it took me like 10mins to understand where, what, how and then it was a synch! The pony looks incredible, I have long hair but not thick at all--being a new mommy( we all can remember the limp thinning hair months after that gorgeousness of pregnancy hair disappears! ) The ponytail is super secure even holds up to a rumbustious 10 month old. It looks full and neat! Cannot see the white plastic thingy at all! Comfortable to wear, no pulling anywhere. All in all an Excellent Product. Honestly, haven&#x27;t seen at the store so idk if the price was good, but even if not--- worth every penny for me!!!</li>
            <li> The Perfect Pony is very easy to use and makes your ponytail look GREAT.  Unlike other gadgets I&#x27;ve purchased this was a winner from the first time I used it.  I like it so well I will be ordering a second as a spare.  The perfect pony is white and that originally concerned me because my hair is dark brown, however it does not show so no need to be concerned about that.</li>
            <li> i actually bought this at bimart and it was less expensive. however...great product! it made my pony so much cuter and i was surprised at how secure it felt when it was in. i did end up cutting a tiny bit off the length becuase it was too long. but if you cut too much it won&#x27;t hold anymore (made that mistake). but it definitely worked better for me with a bit trimmed off. anyhow...really liked this product and was worthy every penny! even my hubby said my ponytail looked cute and sassy :)</li>
            <li> Wish I had found this many, many years ago!  The name says it all - Perfect Pony!  I have long fine hair - lots of it, but when I put it in a ponytail, it looks thin.  For this first time in my life I now have a really great looking ponytail!  Love, love, love!  I receive many compliments.  It doesn&#x27;t ever slip, is comfortable (can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s there) and does not show.  GREAT product.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair as it is but I wanted that thick Ariana Grande pony tail, which is definitley what I got with this product. I love this thing, and was suprised that it stayed put since my hair is so heavy. I would purchase again. Very satisfied customer. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I just got this for less than $5.00 at Walgreen&#x27;s and it is wonderful! I have very fine, thin hair. Since I work in a food preparation area, I have to wear my shoulder-length hair in a ponytail every day. My hair is thin enough that I could wrap a ponytail holder around it five times, with the Perfect Pony the elastic goes around my ponytail only two times. It was very, very easy to use and I had a perfect result on the first try.  I did end up cutting a little bit (two of the little ridges) off the end of the device because it seemed to stick out too far from the back of my head and show through my hair. Now it is absolutely perfect - it doesn&#x27;t show at all, very comfortable, it stays put all day and it makes my hair look much fuller.</li>
            <li> I am writing this review because I am surprised people say this doesn&#x27;t work for thin or fine hair. I have both and use this almost everyday. The only thing I can imagine is that these reviewers have the thinest of thin hair -- maybe wispy. But regular thin and fine works just great.</li>
