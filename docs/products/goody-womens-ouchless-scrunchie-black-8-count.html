            <li>The scrunchies themselves are great, but the covering fabric is ribbed/patterned.  </li>

            <li>Love these for hanging around the house.</li>
            <li>I love my srunchies and have no shame wearing them.</li>

            <li>I thought that these would be better for my hair and wouldn&#x27;t leave an indentation.</li>

            <li>They don&#x27;t pull your hair, and they&#x27;re nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Love this product so much , can&#x27;t say enough good words on it ..</li>
            <li>Thank You for the quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>KEEPS MY SUPER LONG THICK HAIR IN A PONYTAIL WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT DAMAGE OR BREAKAGE FROM THE GREAT MATERIAL :).</li>
            <li>Exactly what was stated .  </li>
            <li>and I love big hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are good for everyday use, but not for food service where hair needs to be managed.</li>
            <li>I use them after the shower sometimes too, which is easy with these because they are made of cotton, so they dry quickly.  </li>
            <li>Such a good price, I bought these in the local stores and paid a lot for just one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is what I use at night -- to keep my long hair up, but making sure to not pull/damage hair.</li>
            <li>They hold a pony great in my thin waist length hair, they are soft, light and don&#x27;t damage or split my hair</li>
            <li>The elastic is nice and tight, and does not seem to stretch out like others.  </li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nothing fancy, they do the job for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>fast shipping</li>
            <li>They are smaller than I anticipated but nice all the same.</li>
            <li>Multipack of simple black scrunchies, good quality.</li>
            <li>Nice, just what you would expect, no pulling on the hair which you don&#x27;t get from ordinary hair bands</li>
            <li>:) They don&#x27;t tug like regular bands and not as unfashionally poufy and obvious like those scrunchie from the 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>These are solid and secure My long, straight hair</li>
            <li>and she is so comfortable with it , it does last forever , and you can only lose it , it doesn&#x27;t wear off...</li>
            <li>These Goody scrunchies are so soft!  </li>
            <li>I have thick hair and found these difficult to get around my hair more than twice, which is too lose to keep a good pony tail for me.</li>
            <li>:)  These scrunchies are thin and do a better job than the thick ones.</li>
            <li>-- they felt like they were pulling on my hair, and it was hard to get comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I love Goody products; however, my hair is three feet long and very thick.</li>
            <li>wide soft absorbent and durable!</li>

            <li> wide soft absorbent and durable!</li>
            <li> Barely held my hard and stretched in the first use.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re gentle on my hair and it&#x27;s really long (read: heavy)</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t get all stretched to the point of uselessness like a lot of fabric hair ties even with daily use.</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s no damage to my wet hair like with regular elastics.  </li>
            <li> Enter the scrunchie:  soft, loose, but still does the job of keeping your hair bundled up where it belongs....and in the morning, less frizz!  </li>
            <li> Loves these, especially since I have black hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately the scrunchies do not stretch large enough to hold My daughter&#x27;s crazy, curly hair without some effort.</li>
            <li> and when I let my hair down in the morning, there is no dent from the band.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d left scrunchies back in the 80s, but I was so, so wrong.  </li>
            <li> Black scrunchies have always been a staple for me.</li>
            <li> I have odd hair.</li>
            <li> They hold the hair without having to tie them too tight.</li>
            <li> and it holds tight.</li>
            <li> I ordered these because I was tired of having a dent in my hair from regular elastics.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy, I actually got this set to keep in my convertible for when I have a female passenger - it&#x27;s never pretty when thier hair is flailing around :(  </li>
            <li> I wanted to put my thick, curly hair up at night when I slept, but I didn&#x27;t want to use the tight elastics I use during the day</li>
            <li> workso well with thick fluffy hair.</li>
            <li> Thin on one side and thick on the other</li>
            <li> I hate the feeling of wet hair on my  face and neck when I&#x27;m getting dressed/putting on makeup, so after I&#x27;m done all that</li>
            <li> menopausal neck cooled off when doing annoying household tasks....</li>
            <li> These are terrible.</li>

            <li> They work alright for ponytails. I love Goody products; however, my hair is three feet long and very thick. These scrunchies are unable to hold a bun which is more than necessary for where I work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are good for everyday use, but not for food service where hair needs to be managed.</li>
            <li> KEEPS MY SUPER LONG THICK HAIR IN A PONYTAIL WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT DAMAGE OR BREAKAGE FROM THE GREAT MATERIAL :).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why these come in a pack of eight. I&#x27;ve been using the same one since I bought them a year ago and it still functions perfectly. They&#x27;re gentle on my hair and it&#x27;s really long (read: heavy) and they don&#x27;t get all stretched to the point of uselessness like a lot of fabric hair ties even with daily use.</li>
            <li> These are solid and secure My long, straight hair very well.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the scrunchies do not stretch large enough to hold My daughter&#x27;s crazy, curly hair without some effort.</li>
            <li> Those are great scrunchies, good material, they stay in place.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a guy, I actually got this set to keep in my convertible for when I have a female passenger - it&#x27;s never pretty when thier hair is flailing around :(  They are always happy when I pull one of these out of the glovebox for them...</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t break...workso well with thick fluffy hair.</li>
            <li> great for those last minute hair dos or workout! sturdy and strong</li>
            <li> Came well packed and satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> As advertised. I had to wear my hair up at work and it was getting damaged - these inexpensively solved the problem</li>
            <li> These are perfect scrunchies!</li>
            <li> Nothing fancy, they do the job for a reasonable price. I find a lot of hair scrunchies are either too bulky or slippery. These do a better job of staying put without pulling hairs.</li>
            <li> I have purchased these before.  These are terrible. Barely held my hard and stretched in the first use.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t pull your hair, and they&#x27;re nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Love these for hanging around the house.</li>
            <li> I love my srunchies and have no shame wearing them. :) They don&#x27;t tug like regular bands and not as unfashionally poufy and obvious like those scrunchie from the 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t have enough of these. No matter how many I have I can never find any.</li>
            <li> I ordered these because I was tired of having a dent in my hair from regular elastics. I thought that these would be better for my hair and wouldn&#x27;t leave an indentation. I was right! These are comfortable to sleep in and when I let my hair down in the morning, there is no dent from the band. Just what I was hoping for. They are strong too!</li>
            <li> this is what I use at night -- to keep my long hair up, but making sure to not pull/damage hair.</li>
            <li> Wrap once, twice or 3 times.  There is no exposed band to get tangled in.  Goody has been my favorite for years.  It is inexpensive, but still beats out the 99 cent store brands for quality by a mile.  You will lose before you wear out.</li>
            <li> Multiple styles in the pack</li>
            <li> the best scrunchies! wide soft absorbent and durable!</li>
            <li> Exactly what was stated .  Thank You for the quick delivery.  Love Amazon.. Thank you</li>
            <li> Love these scrunchies!! Look I&#x27;m from the 80&#x27;s and I love big hair. :)  These scrunchies are thin and do a better job than the thick ones.</li>
            <li> Love this product so much , can&#x27;t say enough good words on it .. my daughter uses it at school and she is so comfortable with it , it does last forever , and you can only lose it , it doesn&#x27;t wear off...</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d left scrunchies back in the 80s, but I was so, so wrong.  I wanted to put my thick, curly hair up at night when I slept, but I didn&#x27;t want to use the tight elastics I use during the day -- they felt like they were pulling on my hair, and it was hard to get comfortable.  Enter the scrunchie:  soft, loose, but still does the job of keeping your hair bundled up where it belongs....and in the morning, less frizz!  I use them after the shower sometimes too, which is easy with these because they are made of cotton, so they dry quickly.  I hate the feeling of wet hair on my  face and neck when I&#x27;m getting dressed/putting on makeup, so after I&#x27;m done all that, I can just pull out the scrunchie and there&#x27;s no damage to my wet hair like with regular elastics.  I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li> Love these scrunchies! They hold a pony great in my thin waist length hair, they are soft, light and don&#x27;t damage or split my hair :) excellent!!</li>
            <li> Plenty of scrunchies :)</li>
            <li> great item. fast shipping</li>
            <li> Such a good price, I bought these in the local stores and paid a lot for just one.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Great product. They are smaller than I anticipated but nice all the same.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and found these difficult to get around my hair more than twice, which is too lose to keep a good pony tail for me.</li>
            <li> Multipack of simple black scrunchies, good quality. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> They are very good for very fine hair. They hold the hair without having to tie them too tight. Good buy</li>
            <li> Loves these, especially since I have black hair.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me and had to return them.</li>
            <li> These were perfect. Strong, bunchy scrunchies. These are not just regular hair ties, so expect some fabric/volume. I can get about 3 3 loops with my pony tail.</li>
            <li> I loves this brand and buy them in multiples from Amazon. You just can&#x27;t have too many and they&#x27;re so comfortable!</li>
            <li> The scrunchies themselves are great, but the covering fabric is ribbed/patterned.  I prefer them smooth, nothing decorative.  Would not purchase again based on covering.</li>
            <li> Black scrunchies have always been a staple for me. This package is a great value. Comfortable with a pretty secure hold.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  Goody scrunchies are always very good.  They never break.  They don&#x27;t pull your hair out.  Very very good stuff.</li>
            <li> These are excellent for quickly and efficiently getting your heat- ravaged post- menopausal neck cooled off when doing annoying household tasks.... and they don&#x27;t rip up your hair like skinny rubber band-type hair fasteners do..</li>
            <li> these are not the absolute best in terms of fabric. but they are great for the price. I totally recommend them</li>
            <li> Item was as advertised.</li>
            <li> These Goody scrunchies are so soft!  The elastic is nice and tight, and does not seem to stretch out like others.  I have even washed these in a laundry bag (no drying) and they have held up exceptionally well.  They are great for those of us with fine or &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave them four stars instead of five is that they likely will not work for those with super-thick hair.  I bought them for my 8 yo daughter and she simply can not wear them because there is not enough elastic.</li>
            <li> I love these! I have odd hair. Thin on one side and thick on the other and it holds tight.</li>
            <li> Yup, they were scrunchies.</li>
            <li> Nice, just what you would expect, no pulling on the hair which you don&#x27;t get from ordinary hair bands</li>
            <li> Great presentation.Great quality</li>
    </ol>
