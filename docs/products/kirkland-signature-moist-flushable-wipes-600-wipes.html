            <li>always very satisfied with the service and product</li>

            <li>Multi use, very easy to pack anywhere</li>
            <li>great product and price with fast delivery</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s $5 more than at Costco itself.</li>
            <li>I love these wipes.  </li>
            <li>They are thicker and more durable than the others, and I keep them in my bathroom all the time.  </li>
            <li>Either they sell out before I get there or don&#x27;t cary them any more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more cleaner and</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how many wipes were in a package.</li>
            <li>These could clog the leach field and cost more money than I care to pay.  </li>
            <li>In addition it is healthy and does the job.</li>
            <li>Excellent product definitely a life changer when it comes to wiping.</li>
            <li>All that i need, gentle and very effective cleaning and cleansing wipe.</li>
            <li>Fresh clean feeling and safe for septic systems!</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are very good - with a couple of minor complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These charming people suggest that, although it is sold as flushable adult tissues, it can&#x27;t be flushed in a trustworthy way.</li>
            <li>I guess we&#x27;ll see, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>It is great to finish the job and not get torn up by all the toilet paper.</li>
            <li>Good product to use for &amp;#34; personal hygiene.&amp;#34; Does not require a separate container and the lid on the package pens easily and seals in moisture well.</li>
            <li>Quite the contrary, high content of this environmentally friendly material provide exceptional softness to the wipes and makes them very absorbent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got these for my dad who&#x27;s 86 and he says he feels clean and fresh after using them.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are much more gentle than toilet paper and with the Aloe and vitamin E in the wipes, they have helped soothe and stop the bleeding more quickly.  </li>
            <li>I actually can&#x27;t find flushable wipes in drug stores any more.</li>
            <li>First time using this brand.  </li>
            <li>These are an economical buy and they work really well.</li>
            <li>The sound and the feel of the closer leaves me confident the seal is tight.</li>
            <li>but I can get more wipes out of one square of these than I can through a wad of toilet paper.  </li>
            <li>Great for little kids who have a harder time getting clean.  </li>
            <li>They are strong enough to do the job.</li>
            <li>These work really well</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also seen its available locally!</li>
            <li>Clogging a septic system or sewer line that has tree roots is a real</li>
            <li>They might degrade after a while, but it isn&#x27;t going to be fast.</li>
            <li>Gentle on skin.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Very God value&lt;br</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell, it flushes just fine without clogging, if you take care not to overfill the toilet.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li>one flushable wipe is more safer than several wads of toilet paper.</li>
            <li>thanks to the application of special TencelÂ® fibers it does not make them harder.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They could clog pumps and filters in normal sewer lines as well.</li>
            <li>(new formula):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are using the image of the old style but are selling the new version</li>
            <li>lids close easily and firmly.</li>
            <li>I was willing to pay the extra money because I thought it was old inventory.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t complain, I like this product, used for my mom and is soft  </li>
            <li>I needed adult wipes for my mother</li>
            <li>We have young children and keep these in every bathroom.</li>
            <li>When I ordered, the photo showed the older box with the larger dimensions of the &amp;#34;wipe.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>At last a decent flushable wipe.</li>
            <li>cause sewer companies, it isn&#x27;t a pretty picture, and could cause sewer fees to be raised over time due to frequent system</li>
            <li>Because the wipes are quite thick, no need to use up as many even for big jobs!</li>
            <li>I only give 2 stars because they work at cleaning you better then toilet paper they are not safe for septic systems or sewer systems however yesterday</li>
            <li>It should be noted this aren&#x27;t flushable even though they are marked as such.</li>
            <li>And since I asked my browser to find adult wipes and this product came up, I assumed it was a much larger size.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These have been such a tremendous help that I can recommend them to anyone who is in the same situation or just anyone who needs any type of relief down there.</li>
            <li>In other words, figure out how to use it for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, as near as I can determine, this product is more than ordinarily irritating to skin tissue, and may even cause skin swelling when used by sensitive elderly persons.</li>
            <li>but I tend to think it is like that because this wipe really is a flushable product and thus is designed to break down when flushed and can&#x27;t be stronger or it would clog your plumbing.</li>
            <li>A little small, but ok.</li>
            <li>I like the price and they seem to be less thick than some wipes that flush, so I&#x27;m hoping they are better for my plumbing.</li>
            <li>The thickness is good and bad.</li>

            <li> The thickness is good and bad.</li>
            <li> Rather than using a piece of toilet paper, those moist flushable wipe help keep proper hygiene especially with our children.</li>
            <li> but since these are already small to start with, you really can only fold them in half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I could replace regular toilet paper for these I would.  </li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;ve used these you will never go back to using just toilet paper alone.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sort of got the texture of wet paper towels... if you are not careful when removing them from the package, they will tear.  </li>
            <li> As I said previously, if anyone is ordering this product thinking they are adult wipes, they are not.  </li>
            <li> They keep you cleaner and fresher than just toilet paper alone, and a box lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The paper the wipe is made from tends to not be that strong and tends to leave lint (if you use it to wipe your face and have a slight beard it will leave behind lint for example).</li>
            <li> Not sure I would use in septic system just to be safe though.&lt;br /&gt;They are very thick, but</li>
            <li> This verbiage is a p;rime example of curiously strange people writing copy to amuse themselves.</li>
            <li> I have placed a wipe in a sealed mason jar with water to test how long it takes the wipe to biodegrade.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is slightly heavy, not noxious but might bother someone who has allergies or a sensitive nose.</li>
            <li> One complaint that is not a complaint.</li>
            <li> but I notice the chain stores don&#x27;t carry a wide selection anymore of shampoos, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be careful when you buy this.</li>
            <li> Not much to say about these wipes, other than they do what they are supposed to do!</li>
            <li> /&gt;They also have quite a strong perfume smell to them - which isn&#x27;t too bad, but sort of smells like hand sanitizer.</li>
            <li> These new wipes are smaller, thinner, and utter crap.</li>
            <li> I always fold them in half or quarter</li>
            <li> These wipes do not break up they jammed my trap and froze the line cause water movement was stopped buyer beware!!!</li>
            <li> I will update in a few days to a month when the wipe shows signs of dissolving.</li>
            <li> To me, this was a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Thick means my fingers didn&#x27;t punch through them during use, but it also worried me that these are a little too sturdy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and the containers usually dispense one at a time</li>
            <li> My husband uses this product everyday!</li>
            <li> They are as small as baby wipes, something I could have purchased in a .99 cent store.  </li>
            <li> hard to find flush-able wipes like this</li>
            <li> have put them in the tub by another company that I already have because the tub is prettier than the ugly blue package in the guest bathroom.</li>
            <li> They are very thick and do not tear when used.</li>
            <li> This should be false advertising.</li>
            <li> These are the only wipes that don&#x27;t irritate my skin horribly.</li>
            <li> They are so bad that Costco is already coming out with another version at their warehouses.</li>
            <li> It is annoying</li>
            <li> I have a septic system at work, but tossing used baby wipes in the trash can is disgusting -</li>

            <li> wipe your butt. flush it. enough said.</li>
            <li> always very satisfied with the service and product</li>
            <li> great product and price with fast delivery</li>
            <li> I only give 2 stars because they work at cleaning you better then toilet paper they are not safe for septic systems or sewer systems however yesterday my sewage line froze and backed up the plumber came, heated and cleaned trap, to my surprise he came upstairs and said who was flushing paper towels? These wipes do not break up they jammed my trap and froze the line cause water movement was stopped buyer beware!!!</li>
            <li> Great price and does what it says.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I got these at a recommendation for a friend after I discovered I had a prolapsed bleeding hemorrhoid. Waiting for a surgical consult now but these have been a blessing and have helped immensely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are much more gentle than toilet paper and with the Aloe and vitamin E in the wipes, they have helped soothe and stop the bleeding more quickly.  I bought a case for my home and a case for my car. I have several packages stashed in my desk at my office so I will never be without them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These have been such a tremendous help that I can recommend them to anyone who is in the same situation or just anyone who needs any type of relief down there.</li>
            <li> These are the only wipes that don&#x27;t irritate my skin horribly.</li>
            <li> Good quality, nice size, like the quantity, fair price.</li>
            <li> It should be noted this aren&#x27;t flushable even though they are marked as such. There isn&#x27;t a truly flushable wipe on the market. They don&#x27;t disintegrate in a municipal sewer system or in a septic system.</li>
            <li> These charming people suggest that, although it is sold as flushable adult tissues, it can&#x27;t be flushed in a trustworthy way. This verbiage is a p;rime example of curiously strange people writing copy to amuse themselves. As far as I can tell, it flushes just fine without clogging, if you take care not to overfill the toilet. In other words, figure out how to use it for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, as near as I can determine, this product is more than ordinarily irritating to skin tissue, and may even cause skin swelling when used by sensitive elderly persons.</li>
            <li> Good size wipes.  Even though they are flushable....I  do not flush them.  They are strong enough to do the job.</li>
            <li> These work really well and the containers usually dispense one at a time easily.&lt;br /&gt;Soft enough and moist enough. A little small, but ok.</li>
            <li> good for whats needed! Multi use, very easy to pack anywhere I go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also seen its available locally!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Rather than using a piece of toilet paper, those moist flushable wipe help keep proper hygiene especially with our children. However, the entire family benefits. Because the wipes are quite thick, no need to use up as many even for big jobs! If you gather my meaning!&lt;br /&gt;The seller did great, it arrived at estimated promised time.</li>
            <li> Great for little kids who have a harder time getting clean.  Smells nice, is not greasy.  Very nice to have for when needed.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I purchased these for use in my bathroom</li>
            <li> The are getting smaller.  An inch can make a difference.  Current size on these are 7.1&amp;#34; x 5.1&amp;#34;.  When I ordered, the photo showed the older box with the larger dimensions of the &amp;#34;wipe.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I like the price and they seem to be less thick than some wipes that flush, so I&#x27;m hoping they are better for my plumbing. I guess we&#x27;ll see, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Not much to say about these wipes, other than they do what they are supposed to do! This is a good value for the price, you get a lot of product and it&#x27;s good quality.</li>
            <li> I have been buying these Kirtland wipes for over a year or so.  They are great to use, large 600 quantity, and  best price!  I&#x27;ll keep buying them before we run out. A+++++++++++++++++++</li>
            <li> This should be false advertising. They are using the image of the old style but are selling the new version and it&#x27;s $5 more than at Costco itself. I was willing to pay the extra money because I thought it was old inventory.  These new wipes are smaller, thinner, and utter crap. They are so bad that Costco is already coming out with another version at their warehouses. Time to get my money back.</li>
            <li> I love these wipes.  They are thicker and more durable than the others, and I keep them in my bathroom all the time.  They keep you cleaner and fresher than just toilet paper alone, and a box lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> MY HEINIE WAS VERY HAPPY THEREFORE I WAS HAPPIER-CAUTION PLEASE STAY HAPPY AND DO NOT TRY FLUSHING!!!!</li>
            <li> I actually can&#x27;t find flushable wipes in drug stores any more. Either they sell out before I get there or don&#x27;t cary them any more. I don&#x27;t know if the Great Recession has made inventory a thing not to have but I notice the chain stores don&#x27;t carry a wide selection anymore of shampoos, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about this is it is re-sealable and thus can be taken on trips. One complaint that is not a complaint. The paper the wipe is made from tends to not be that strong and tends to leave lint (if you use it to wipe your face and have a slight beard it will leave behind lint for example). It is annoying but I tend to think it is like that because this wipe really is a flushable product and thus is designed to break down when flushed and can&#x27;t be stronger or it would clog your plumbing.</li>
            <li> hard to find flush-able wipes like this</li>
            <li> At last a decent flushable wipe. Not sure I would use in septic system just to be safe though.&lt;br /&gt;They are very thick, but thanks to the application of special TencelÂ® fibers it does not make them harder. Quite the contrary, high content of this environmentally friendly material provide exceptional softness to the wipes and makes them very absorbent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients (new formula):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Tocopheryl Acetate, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Polysorbate 20, Citric Acid, Disodium Phosphate, Disodium EDTA, Ethylene Brassylate, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate.</li>
            <li> Not to be gross but I can get more wipes out of one square of these than I can through a wad of toilet paper.  If I could replace regular toilet paper for these I would.  It&#x27;s more cleaner and one flushable wipe is more safer than several wads of toilet paper.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how many wipes were in a package. This is a lot of wipes! The wipes are divided in 10 separate packages holding 60 wipes in each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lids close easily and firmly. The sound and the feel of the closer leaves me confident the seal is tight. I feel the wipes in each package will stay moist until I get to the last wipe in each package, if I am incorrect, I will revise this review promptly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have put them in the tub by another company that I already have because the tub is prettier than the ugly blue package in the guest bathroom. I left them as packaged in the family bathroom to test the seal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wipes are not as big as I had hoped, but I will use them until they are gone. They are very thick and do not tear when used. The thickness is good and bad. Thick means my fingers didn&#x27;t punch through them during use, but it also worried me that these are a little too sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would never put these in a septic tank! I lived for 20 years with a septic tank, the problems and lessons learned taught me what should and should never be flushed. These could clog the leach field and cost more money than I care to pay.  Clogging a septic system or sewer line that has tree roots is a real possibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They could clog pumps and filters in normal sewer lines as well. They might degrade after a while, but it isn&#x27;t going to be fast.I have placed a wipe in a sealed mason jar with water to test how long it takes the wipe to biodegrade. I will update in a few days to a month when the wipe shows signs of dissolving. (Do an internet search for flushable wipes and clogs to see the problems wipes cause sewer companies, it isn&#x27;t a pretty picture, and could cause sewer fees to be raised over time due to frequent system breakdowns.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is slightly heavy, not noxious but might bother someone who has allergies or a sensitive nose.</li>
            <li> I have a septic system at work, but tossing used baby wipes in the trash can is disgusting - so I got these &amp;#34;septic safe&amp;#34; ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are very good - with a couple of minor complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It is not made from as durable/strong a material as a non-flushable baby wipe.  It&#x27;s sort of got the texture of wet paper towels... if you are not careful when removing them from the package, they will tear.  They are made from sort of a compressed paper material so you must be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-They are substantially smaller than a regular baby wipe.  I always fold them in half or quarter (TMI, I know).. with a regular wipe this provides lots of hand-poop isolation and has a convenient size... but since these are already small to start with, you really can only fold them in half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also have quite a strong perfume smell to them - which isn&#x27;t too bad, but sort of smells like hand sanitizer.</li>
            <li> This is my second order</li>
            <li> First time using this brand.  I have used Cottonelle before but this was a great deal</li>
            <li> I have been using this item or almost a year now.&lt;br /&gt;An excellent product. In addition it is healthy and does the job.</li>
            <li> These are an economical buy and they work really well. Please continue to carry these. I would highly recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this product everyday! It is great to finish the job and not get torn up by all the toilet paper. My husband even takes some to work and leaves and locker when he needs to go.</li>
            <li> Gentle on skin. Reasonably priced. Good product to use for &amp;#34; personal hygiene.&amp;#34; Does not require a separate container and the lid on the package pens easily and seals in moisture well.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t complain, I like this product, used for my mom and is soft  and it can be flush into the toilette.</li>
            <li> They smell great and get the job done! Great for toddlers in training.</li>
            <li> As I said previously, if anyone is ordering this product thinking they are adult wipes, they are not.  They are as small as baby wipes, something I could have purchased in a .99 cent store.  To me, this was a waste of money.  I needed adult wipes for my mother wo is bedridden.  Nowhere in the ad or product description does it give the size .  And since I asked my browser to find adult wipes and this product came up, I assumed it was a much larger size.  Be careful when you buy this.</li>
            <li> We have young children and keep these in every bathroom. They are great for potty training. Excellent product. Great price!</li>
            <li> Very God value&lt;br /&gt; M</li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;ve used these you will never go back to using just toilet paper alone.  Fresh clean feeling and safe for septic systems!</li>
            <li> Biodegradable, very good product.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent supplier!</li>
            <li> Excellent product definitely a life changer when it comes to wiping. Must have.</li>
            <li> I got these for my dad who&#x27;s 86 and he says he feels clean and fresh after using them.  Although they say flushable, he throws them away.  My husband and I also use these and we flush them - no problems with our system.  A good product at a good price.</li>
            <li> All that i need, gentle and very effective cleaning and cleansing wipe.</li>
            <li> They are not as moist as cottonelle brand and they are scented I prefer unscented</li>
