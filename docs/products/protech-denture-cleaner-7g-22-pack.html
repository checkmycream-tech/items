            <li>To be perfectly honest</li>
            <li>Easy to use and lasts a week,does a good job cleaning dentures.</li>
            <li>Both do a great job of cleaning,but Smile</li>

            <li>Very good, clean taste and economical since it lasts a week to 10 days.</li>
            <li>I am glad I can purchase it on Amazon.  </li>

            <li>I read the instructions &amp; couldn&#x27;t imagane keeping a soulition for a week or more.</li>
            <li>My Dentist turned me on to this product &amp; after one use, most of the stains were GONE...  </li>
            <li>I have found that I could use a packet for more than the 7 - 10 days before mixing up another batch, about a month works for me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;this is better then any stuff you buy in the stor  </li>
            <li>Better off with fixodent tablets.</li>
            <li>It is OK, but not as good as Smile Again.</li>
            <li>I have had dentures since 1969 and have been using Protech Denture Cleaner for most of that time.  </li>

            <li>I really like my Dentist Sample best, but since I can&#x27;t order direct as I can with Protech</li>
            <li>Works so much better than anything else for keeping my night guard clean.</li>
            <li>He is now going to give free samples to his patients.</li>
            <li>They will even send you two free samples if requested.  </li>
            <li>The dentist recommended this product several years ago and he has been happy with this product.</li>
            <li>I will continue using ProTech because it&#x27;s available to me</li>

            <li>I have worn dentures for over 50 years and I never found a product that would keep them clean and stain free until this product.</li>
            <li>Protech Denture Cleaner when used in my New Trent CD-3800 Digital Ultrasonic has to be the greatest combination in denture cleaning.</li>
            <li>After a couple of days of overnight soakings they were as good as new - Fresh &amp; Clean.    </li>
            <li>I use this product to clean and sanitize my Invisalign aligners.  </li>

            <li>Ya just gotta clean &amp; rinse your stuff of before you Plop it into the tank.    </li>
            <li>nice\\&quot; &amp; they don&#x27;t even offer to clean them for me.    </li>
            <li>My cousin turned me on to this product recently and it is by far the best denture cleanser and stain removal product that I have ever used!</li>
            <li>I place my dentures into my ultrasonic cleaner with PROTECH DENTURE CLEANER and by the time I finish brushing my gums, my dentures are sparkling clean.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to clean as well.  </li>
            <li>Have to soak longer to get clean.</li>
            <li>My Dentist has commented on how clean I keep my dentures.</li>
            <li>Recommended by my dentist and it does clean well for my use.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really tell if its better or not.</li>
            <li>No bad taste.</li>
            <li>If you have dentures/appliances and you want them sparkling clean and fresh -- this is the product for you.</li>
            <li>A quick rinse</li>
            <li>Super cleaner.</li>
            <li>Very dissappointed!!</li>
            <li>I have purchased this item previously and found it very effective.  </li>
            <li>This product works great use it everyday.</li>
            <li>Makes me fresh.</li>
            <li>wow i love the way it makes my teath white&lt;</li>
            <li>Freshens you&#x27;re breath,and you&#x27;re smile too.</li>
            <li>There is a difference between Protech and Smile Again products.</li>
            <li>Smile Again&lt;</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money though.</li>
            <li>it does a better job by far.</li>
            <li>They clean dentures very well.</li>
            <li>they would always ask to clean my Bridge when they cleaned my teeth, now they just say \\&quot;Those look really</li>
            <li>I am placing an order for my Mother for her new upper Denture, so she can keep her stuff nice &amp; clean too.</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to this cleanser by a dentist and am amazed at how well it cleans my dentures.  </li>
            <li>This was recamended when I got my first set of dentures.</li>
            <li>The denture repair folks gave us a sample of this product and he was sold the first night.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Protech product does do a pretty good cleaning, but in my humble opinion</li>
            <li>If you are a denture wearer this is the only cleaner you will ever need and works SO MUCH better than store shelf cleaners.</li>
            <li>My dentist first gave me this</li>
            <li>I ordered this based on all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>It cleans and disinfect the dentures in a very short time and is really easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I know it is recommended to do this more often, but with normal day to day brushing, a deep cleaning once a week is plenty to keep appliances sparkling.</li>
            <li>It was very costly to see no change.</li>
            <li>and they are ready to put on.  </li>
            <li>I have tried most others and I always come back, it is well worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li>Product works very well.</li>
            <li>so I got &#x27;hollywood white&#x27; dentures and enjoy the &#x27;moviestar&#x27; look.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Trouble free clean every time.</li>
            <li>I would pay alot of money on a product that could whiten my dentures back to their original color.</li>
            <li>Just keeps it clean enough, I guess.</li>
            <li>I have used it for a long tmie and it keeps my dentures nice and white.</li>
            <li>The only warning I received was to make sure you really rinse your dentures for a very long time in very hot water since this is a professional grade cleanser.</li>
            <li>and it has kept them looking brand new!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>and now I have to find a way to brighten them to match the new shiny dentures.    </li>
            <li>My Dentist gave me a sample when I got my new teeth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It removes all stains and makes your dentures look like new.</li>
            <li>so they are like new.  </li>
            <li>The solution lasts a long time so it is quite economical.  </li>
            <li>One packet will last a week if you brush your dentures first.  </li>
            <li>I tried several of those other advertised products, they all Bubbled &amp; Fizzed a bunch but didn&#x27;t seem to clean much.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping this would clear up some yellowing on my night bite guard, but it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I still have 6 natural teeth</li>
            <li>Naturally, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Before  I tryed it I was hesitant, because it seemed more expensive to use,but it lasts so much longer,that it really is not.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My Dentist sample works slightly better (for me at least)</li>
            <li>Since mine are soft, I can&#x27;t use it</li>
            <li>I find that if you use a longer period you pick up an unusual taste that takes a long time to dissipate.</li>
            <li>Found Smile Again and their generic Protech Denture Cleaner a few years ago and it is the only denture cleaner that really works for me.</li>
            <li>I am a smoker and a heavy coffee drinker and it removed stains I had not been able to remove using any other product.</li>
            <li>worth the extra few dollars.</li>
            <li>I smoke &amp; spent over $3000 for new dentures.</li>
            <li>I smoke like a Train &amp; drink iced tea most of the day, so I stain up my Bridge pretty bad.  </li>
            <li>I am very fussy about how white my teeth look, after having ugly grey/yellow teeth most of my life</li>

            <li> so I got &#x27;hollywood white&#x27; dentures and enjoy the &#x27;moviestar&#x27; look.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Trouble free clean every time.</li>
            <li> I would pay alot of money on a product that could whiten my dentures back to their original color.</li>
            <li> Just keeps it clean enough, I guess.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a long tmie and it keeps my dentures nice and white.</li>
            <li> The only warning I received was to make sure you really rinse your dentures for a very long time in very hot water since this is a professional grade cleanser.</li>
            <li> and it has kept them looking brand new!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> and now I have to find a way to brighten them to match the new shiny dentures.    </li>
            <li> My Dentist gave me a sample when I got my new teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It removes all stains and makes your dentures look like new.</li>
            <li> so they are like new.  </li>
            <li> The solution lasts a long time so it is quite economical.  </li>
            <li> One packet will last a week if you brush your dentures first.  </li>
            <li> I tried several of those other advertised products, they all Bubbled &amp; Fizzed a bunch but didn&#x27;t seem to clean much.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping this would clear up some yellowing on my night bite guard, but it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I still have 6 natural teeth</li>
            <li> Naturally, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Before  I tryed it I was hesitant, because it seemed more expensive to use,but it lasts so much longer,that it really is not.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My Dentist sample works slightly better (for me at least)</li>
            <li> Since mine are soft, I can&#x27;t use it</li>
            <li> I find that if you use a longer period you pick up an unusual taste that takes a long time to dissipate.</li>
            <li> Found Smile Again and their generic Protech Denture Cleaner a few years ago and it is the only denture cleaner that really works for me.</li>
            <li> I am a smoker and a heavy coffee drinker and it removed stains I had not been able to remove using any other product.</li>
            <li> worth the extra few dollars.</li>
            <li> I smoke &amp; spent over $3000 for new dentures.</li>
            <li> I smoke like a Train &amp; drink iced tea most of the day, so I stain up my Bridge pretty bad.  </li>
            <li> I am very fussy about how white my teeth look, after having ugly grey/yellow teeth most of my life</li>
            <li> fast delivery, easy to use, one pack lasts 10 days so don&#x27;t forget and dump it out like I did. :(</li>
            <li> Plus 1 packet of Protech lasts at least 7-10 days making it very econonomical.</li>
            <li> Little more expensive</li>
            <li> I have been using PRO TECH for the last few years on my Lower Front Bridge</li>
            <li> / Partial.  </li>
            <li> so I used my amazon and of course it was there - a little more expensive than my dentist sold it for but at least I can get it.</li>
            <li> I tried other types of denture/appliance cleaners and they just don&#x27;t even compare.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other brands that use a tablet a day</li>
            <li> I did in fact locate the OTHER Brand,</li>
            <li> My husband will not use any other cleaner for his dentures.  </li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t say it was for hard lined dentures only.  </li>
            <li> usually only use 1/2 pkg at a time and it lasts for at least a week.  </li>
            <li> Plus, one tablet last at least 10 days.</li>
            <li> It removes all stains and it does the job in less than 8 hours.</li>
            <li> This product is almost impossible to find on any store shelf, but well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using the usual cleaners for years.  </li>
            <li> I keep a batch in a small container in my bathroom and pop my night guard in after brushing it.</li>
            <li> I had a very bad 37 year old upper denture that was fully stained from cigerettes, coffee and tea.</li>
            <li> This is a hard to find item!  </li>
            <li> ill get more&lt;</li>
            <li> It is expensive</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it for over a year, my teeth looked bad &amp; I used the 1 pack I had</li>
            <li> I was shocked!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this stuff with an Isonic F3900 and my dentures have NEVER been so clean! This is Good Stuff!!</li>
            <li> Great product best I have found.</li>
            <li> This is a hard to find item!  I am glad I can purchase it on Amazon.  It&#x27;s a great quality product that my dentist approved!  It doesn&#x27;t harm dentures.</li>
            <li> These are great with the use of a sonic cleaner.  Getting them in quantity means I do not have to order them as often.  They clean dentures very well.</li>
            <li> I use this product to clean and sanitize my Invisalign aligners.  Protech was recommended by my orthodontist and it really is the very best you can use.  I tried other types of denture/appliance cleaners and they just don&#x27;t even compare.  If you have dentures/appliances and you want them sparkling clean and fresh -- this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> It is the best denture cleaner ever: takes off all stains very well.</li>
            <li> I have worn dentures for over 50 years and I never found a product that would keep them clean and stain free until this product. I still have 6 natural teeth and now I have to find a way to brighten them to match the new shiny dentures.    I recommend that you follow the manufacturer&#x27;s directions and only soak the dentures for 20 minutes.  I find that if you use a longer period you pick up an unusual taste that takes a long time to dissipate.</li>
            <li> Does what it is advertised to do. My hygienist turned me on to this stuff. I don&#x27;t have to use it every day or even every week, just when the partials get grungy.</li>
            <li> I discovered this product soon after I got my retainers and it has kept them looking brand new! My orthodontist is amazed that I am keeping them so clean.</li>
            <li> great product, use 1 tablet for 3-4 weeks for my dentures, no foul taste. I have tried other brands that use a tablet a day and they do not compare. This was recommend by my dentist.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this cleanser by a dentist and am amazed at how well it cleans my dentures.  The solution lasts a long time so it is quite economical.  The only warning I received was to make sure you really rinse your dentures for a very long time in very hot water since this is a professional grade cleanser.</li>
            <li> What can I say. I have to use them, I love them and will always buy them. Makes me fresh.</li>
            <li> I smoke &amp; spent over $3000 for new dentures. My Dentist gave me a sample when I got my new teeth. I read the instructions &amp; couldn&#x27;t imagane keeping a soulition for a week or more. I didn&#x27;t use it for over a year, my teeth looked bad &amp; I used the 1 pack I had &amp; my teeth look AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;Great product &amp; follow the instructions!</li>
            <li> Received a sample from my doctor. I have been using it for years. Very good, clean taste and economical since it lasts a week to 10 days.</li>
            <li> I have been using PRO TECH for the last few years on my Lower Front Bridge / Partial.  I smoke like a Train &amp; drink iced tea most of the day, so I stain up my Bridge pretty bad.  I tried several of those other advertised products, they all Bubbled &amp; Fizzed a bunch but didn&#x27;t seem to clean much.  My Dentist turned me on to this product &amp; after one use, most of the stains were GONE...  After a couple of days of overnight soakings they were as good as new - Fresh &amp; Clean.    I have found that I could use a packet for more than the 7 - 10 days before mixing up another batch, about a month works for me.  Ya just gotta clean &amp; rinse your stuff of before you Plop it into the tank.    Used to be when I went to the Dentist they would always ask to clean my Bridge when they cleaned my teeth, now they just say \\&quot;Those look really nice\\&quot; &amp; they don&#x27;t even offer to clean them for me.    This has been a GREAT product for me, Hope it works for as well for you.  I&#x27;m getting my Implants completed this month, so I won&#x27;t need this anymore.  I am placing an order for my Mother for her new upper Denture, so she can keep her stuff nice &amp; clean too.</li>
            <li> wow i love the way it makes my teath white&lt;br /&gt;this is better then any stuff you buy in the stor  ill get more&lt;br /&gt;soon thank  you</li>
            <li> My cousin turned me on to this product recently and it is by far the best denture cleanser and stain removal product that I have ever used! I have recommended it to everyone I know that has a use for it. Even MY dentist! He is now going to give free samples to his patients. I had a very bad 37 year old upper denture that was fully stained from cigerettes, coffee and tea. This cleanser removed every brown stain! I was shocked!  The company backs this 100%. They will even send you two free samples if requested.  Peggy</li>
            <li> I ordered this based on all the positive reviews. I did not see any difference . The drugstore tablets give the same results. It was very costly to see no change. I would pay alot of money on a product that could whiten my dentures back to their original color. Very dissappointed!! Dont waste your money. Better off with fixodent tablets.</li>
            <li> This product is just as advertised.  I place my dentures into my ultrasonic cleaner with PROTECH DENTURE CLEANER and by the time I finish brushing my gums, my dentures are sparkling clean.  A quick rinse and they are ready to put on.  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> This is the same stuff my dentist uses. I have a bite guard that had a lot of tartar on it. This cleaner got it all off. Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> usually only use 1/2 pkg at a time and it lasts for at least a week.  I drink coffee and solution removes the stains</li>
            <li> Protech denture cleaner is the best cleaner on the market.  The only problem is that you can only get it at some dental clinics or by purchasing on-line.</li>
            <li> Does the job.  I change the powder after one week, per instructions,</li>
            <li> excellent product at a fair price same product purchased elsewhere for substantially more moneywould definitely recommend this supplier to save money</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple of years now. This product works great use it everyday. One packet lasts close to 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> It is OK, but not as good as Smile Again. Doesn&#x27;t seem to clean as well.  Have to soak longer to get clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and lasts a week,does a good job cleaning dentures.Keeps dentures from staining.Freshens you&#x27;re breath,and you&#x27;re smile too.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would clear up some yellowing on my night bite guard, but it didn&#x27;t.  Just keeps it clean enough, I guess.</li>
            <li> This was recamended when I got my first set of dentures. Little more expensive then the rest at local stores. I have tried most others and I always come back, it is well worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best denture cleaners available.  It cleans and disinfect the dentures in a very short time and is really easy to use.  For the money the best you can get.</li>
            <li> My dentist gave me a battery operated cleaning unit with 12 packets of the cleaning solutions. I was very impressed and pleased with the results. Naturally, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this all the time.The dentist recommended this product several years ago and he has been happy with this product.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this denture cleaner and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.</li>
            <li> I have had dentures since 1969 and have been using Protech Denture Cleaner for most of that time.  I was introduced to it by my Dentist.  For me there is none better and I use others only in an emergency.</li>
            <li> A great product that I have used for some time. My Dentist has commented on how clean I keep my dentures.</li>
            <li> There is a difference between Protech and Smile Again products. Smile Again&lt;br /&gt;disinfects and Protech does not.Had I realized this,I would have ordered Smile&lt;br /&gt;Again. Both do a great job of cleaning,but Smile Again kills Strep,Candida and&lt;br /&gt;is worth the extra few dollars. The company that makes both should make&lt;br /&gt;this clear,as a selling point.</li>
            <li> Found Smile Again and their generic Protech Denture Cleaner a few years ago and it is the only denture cleaner that really works for me. Over night you will have removed stains, yellowing, calcium build up, or whatever.  Coffee, tea, cigarettes, cigars,  all these stains disappear .</li>
            <li> Product works very well. Would recommend</li>
            <li> been using it for more than a decade. fast delivery, easy to use, one pack lasts 10 days so don&#x27;t forget and dump it out like I did. :(</li>
            <li> Best Product for the purpose!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really tell if its better or not.</li>
            <li> If you require this sort of thing, Protech is the product you want.</li>
            <li> I have used this  for years it is very good.  It removes all stains and it does the job in less than 8 hours.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using the usual cleaners for years.  The denture repair folks gave us a sample of this product and he was sold the first night.  He says it&#x27;s just as good as when the dental hygienist cleans his dentures.  Plus, one tablet last at least 10 days.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by the prosthodontist who made my dad&#x27;s dentures as the ONLY cleaning method he approves of. This is the best price also.</li>
            <li> Super cleaner. Have used it for many years.</li>
            <li> Protech Denture Cleaner when used in my New Trent CD-3800 Digital Ultrasonic has to be the greatest combination in denture cleaning. Plus 1 packet of Protech lasts at least 7-10 days making it very econonomical.</li>
            <li> if this was cheaper id buy more&lt;br /&gt;good stuff i  try to get this when i can thank you&lt;br /&gt;makes my dentures white</li>
            <li> I have used Protech Denture cleaner for many years,and for many years the consistency of top quality has continued though out the years. I had tryed many,many denture cleaners before I tryed Protech and none have even come close to the cleaning power.Before  I tryed it I was hesitant, because it seemed more expensive to use,but it lasts so much longer,that it really is not.&lt;br /&gt;My dentist even complemented me for keeping my dentures so clean,but I have to give credit to Protech! They came up with a great product!</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dentist and it does clean well for my use.</li>
            <li> This product is the only one I use for my dentures - It is excellent and is sold by my dentist.  My dentist has moved and I can no longer get it from him so I used my amazon and of course it was there - a little more expensive than my dentist sold it for but at least I can get it.</li>
            <li> This product is almost impossible to find on any store shelf, but well worth the money. I have had dentists give this out as samples and only find it online. Definitely worth the money though. Trouble free clean every time.</li>
            <li> Perfect for ultrasonic cleaning</li>
            <li> I was actually searching for another brand cleaner (my dentist gave me sample) when I ran into Protech  Reviews here. I did in fact locate the OTHER Brand, only problem they only sell to Registered Dentist  only. I&#x27;ve been using the Drug Store products trying to locate a cleaner equal to the Dentist sample. No such luck, drug store cleaners just won&#x27;t give me satisfactory results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So since I&#x27;m not a Registered Dentist thought I&#x27;d give Protech Cleaner a try. To be perfectly honest I really like my Dentist Sample best, but since I can&#x27;t order direct as I can with Protech this is my findings;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Protech product does do a pretty good cleaning, but in my humble opinion My Dentist sample works slightly better (for me at least) that&#x27;s reason for 4 star rating instead of 5. I will continue using ProTech because it&#x27;s available to me plus it cleans so much better than the Drug Store brand.</li>
            <li> Great for mouthguard cleanser!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dentures for years and trust me , nothing cleans them like this product. It is wonderful. I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this item previously and found it very effective.  Much more effective that the leading tablet cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;It removes all stains and makes your dentures look like new. I would reccoment it to anyone that wears dentures.</li>
            <li> Dad uses this product as it was recommended by his dentist for his dentures.  Good product!  Good price!</li>
            <li> If you are a denture wearer this is the only cleaner you will ever need and works SO MUCH better than store shelf cleaners. I am a smoker and a heavy coffee drinker and it removed stains I had not been able to remove using any other product.</li>
            <li> My husband will not use any other cleaner for his dentures.  Protech was recommended by his dentist.</li>
            <li> It Cleans better than any Denture Cleaner I have every find. It&#x27;s the best!!!! That&#x27;s is how come I gave it 5&lt;br /&gt;Stars.</li>
            <li> does what it&#x27;s supposed to do</li>
            <li> Works so much better than anything else for keeping my night guard clean.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this to keep my mouth guard from staining.  I&#x27;m happy with the product. I keep a batch in a small container in my bathroom and pop my night guard in after brushing it.</li>
            <li> My DMD recommended this for dentures.  It works as described and I would order it again.</li>
            <li> My dentist first gave me this and it works great.  One packet will last a week if you brush your dentures first.  No bad taste.</li>
            <li> I use this Protech for my snore guard. Works great.</li>
            <li> I have using this cleaner for over 8 years and it is just the best.  I was given a sample and gosh it made a difference in the whitening and cleaning  of my dentures.  I am very fussy about how white my teeth look, after having ugly grey/yellow teeth most of my life so I got &#x27;hollywood white&#x27; dentures and enjoy the &#x27;moviestar&#x27; look.&lt;br /&gt;Not only does this whiten, it also de-calcify the teeth so they are like new.  I give a pack of cleaner to everyone I know to try it out and everyone agrees with me.  It is expensive but I can get 12-15 days out of one pack which brings the cost to be cheaper than over-the-counter cleaners and it does a better job by far.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t say it was for hard lined dentures only.  Since mine are soft, I can&#x27;t use it</li>
            <li> I have used it for a long tmie and it keeps my dentures nice and white. It is a great product.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Works great!</li>
            <li> excellent product, dentist recommended</li>
            <li> These little packets of cleaner do an excellent job for keeping oral appliances clean with weekly use. I know it is recommended to do this more often, but with normal day to day brushing, a deep cleaning once a week is plenty to keep appliances sparkling.</li>
