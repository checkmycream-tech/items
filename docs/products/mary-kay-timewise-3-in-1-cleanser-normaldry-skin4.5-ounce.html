            <li>Delivering was fast, and the product works great!</li>
            <li>All Mary Kay products are good for me and have been using them for many years.  </li>

            <li>Being hooked on MK it is nice to be able to buy without having to call your rep</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so easy!</li>
            <li>I am so glad Amazon carries Mary Kay products.</li>
            <li>Glad to be able to get stuff online</li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>Been using it for years and have had many compliments saying I look like I&#x27;m in my 40s.</li>
            <li>My favorite cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many different face washes and this one is my favorite and makes my skin looks the best.  </li>
            <li>Glad to have found this product here.</li>
            <li>And trust me, like most women, I have used plenty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I love the tiny,gentle exfoliating beads as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>sure you know your skin type, though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Could not be happier:)</li>
            <li>I love the marycare Timewise colletion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for more years than I can remember--perfect for my normal-to-dry skin type.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>Keep my skin smooth and nice.</li>
            <li>I have mixture skin like most people and</li>
            <li>always love Mary Kay.</li>
            <li>Love the product since my lady friend loves it.</li>
            <li>How could it be better?</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t like that there is paraben in the product, but it&#x27;s low on the list of ingredients and in any event you do wash the stuff off, and the rest of the ingredients are impressive.</li>
            <li>The best part was the next day waking up</li>
            <li>This is the best facial cleanser I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I feel confident and comfortable leaving the house without any foundation or powder!</li>
            <li>Love Mary Kay products and</li>
            <li>Great product, very timely delivery.</li>
            <li>Lovely cream</li>
            <li>im glad i accidently bought this product now</li>
            <li>Love Mary Kay products and pleased I could get it online.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I only gave it 4 stars because I feel like 5 stars are perfect</li>
            <li>Always love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love ordering this from Amazon as I don&#x27;t wanted to be bothered with a rep.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>Have used before and love it.</li>
            <li>I just love Mary Kay.</li>
            <li>I would like more scrub in it</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>So bottom line, I love this product and I would recommend it to anyone who has a dry/sensitive face.</li>
            <li>Being able to purchase this product online is much more convenient than trying to find a MK rep.</li>
            <li>Pleased to be able to order this so easily.  </li>
            <li>Thank you arrived in good condition and exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Glad I found an easy way to get it.</li>
            <li>My skin is more even, more moisturized, shiny it really glows more!</li>
            <li>It cleans very well and with the Time/wise Moisturizer it keeps my skin looking good.  </li>
            <li>I. Arrived fast and at a fair market price.</li>
            <li>But if you have too much make up on, it won&#x27;t do a good job cleaning.</li>
            <li>I have used other things before but have found that the timewise skin care collections works the best for me.</li>
            <li>It is easy to order and the pricing is competitive.</li>
            <li>it is easy to  carry  when traveling.</li>
            <li>Easy to use if you have any reaction to any cleaning products.  </li>
            <li>she loved it and it got here super fast!  </li>
            <li>Because my skin is easily irritated, I find that using this cleanser, which does not foam or develop suds while washing the skin, helps to prevent fine lines by reducing dryness as well as a noticeable reduction in redness.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for years and its been the best i&#x27;ve ever used, hands down.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>The cleaner is fine.</li>
            <li>but it is fine without it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is just fine.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin very soft, feels good, the exfoliating is actually so smooth</li>
            <li>It exfoliates my skin and makes it feel smooth.  </li>
            <li>Oily, Light to Medium Skin Tone, Breakouts Cheek and Jawline    </li>
            <li>, I SEE HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR SKIN.</li>
            <li>Even my husband noticed a difference and he always comments on my smooth skin.</li>
            <li>Thank you for such great service.</li>
            <li>It cleans face and leaves a smooth sensation.</li>
            <li>Was due for more and this price was great.</li>
            <li>Makes your face so soft and clean, and feel good to.</li>
            <li>It is KEY to getting a healthy glow by using a great gentle cleanser.  </li>
            <li>This is by far one of the best facial cleansers I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel clean because of the micro beads without leaving it feeling stripped.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling clean and moisturized.</li>
            <li>MY PORES ARE ACTUALLY CLEAN NOW AND APPEAR TO HAVE MINIMIZED.</li>
            <li>this 3 in 1 did a great job without leaving feeling my skin too dry.</li>
            <li>After you use it, my skin feels so clean.</li>
            <li>It does not dry up my skin and feels good on my face.</li>
            <li>If you want a cleanser that is easy and gentle for the whole face, eye area too, get the kind without the beads in it.</li>
            <li>I use it up so fast, I&#x27;d love to get it at this price.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many years and really depend on its results.</li>
            <li>This is a true Mary&lt;br /&gt;kay product with all the benefits of cleansing your face.</li>
            <li>I used the full line of skincare products.</li>
            <li>I love the product thank you so much.</li>
            <li>and it still lets light it, great solution for this little &#x27;problem&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I did not expect it at all, as I&#x27;m really picky, but I LOVED it so much, since it moisturizes REALLY well all day!</li>
            <li>This was my first time to order online and it worked really smoothly.  </li>
            <li>My Mary Kay rep. moved and I love that Amazon has this product available through its many stores - at less than the original price.  </li>
            <li>When I use this facial cleanser day and night my skin stays perfectly clear all the time (even during those beautiful times of the month).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does not sting my eyes like most of them, easy to use, great little crystals in the cream that do an extra scrub.. NOT drying.  </li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and leaves your skin feeling silky smooth after using it, not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>so it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>The 3 in 1 Mary Kay cleanser is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft and very clean.</li>
            <li>It is such a time saver having it be a 3-1 cleanser; takes less time and does a great job!  </li>
            <li>I have fairly sensitive skin that is irritated easily; I have no problems what so ever with this product.</li>
            <li>Work great for African American women like myself.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable and the shipping quick.</li>
            <li>I won a free facial by a Mary Kay Rep. and received a free moisturizer.</li>
            <li>At first it is odd to rub a cleanser into skin that isn&#x27;t pre-moistened with water, but once you get over that feeling this is a good cleanser.</li>
            <li>Your face is very smooth and helps soften the skin when you use a cleanser with crystals or whatever those tiny sand like particles are called.</li>
            <li>I so happy about that, much cheaper so far the product appears to be the same, thanks.</li>
            <li>I love this product and use it daily.  </li>
            <li>I love this cleanser, and this price was cheaper than getting it locally.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While it doesn&#x27;t appear to do much at first, it does a lot over time.</li>
            <li>This cleanser was exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering more of this in the future.  </li>
            <li>I will absolutely reorder!</li>
            <li>This cleanser cleans my face leaving it smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In case anyone is interested</li>
            <li>My skin has SOOOO much improved!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t think until recently to purchase on Amazon and was able to save money doing so.</li>
            <li>ordering the whole set!</li>
            <li>I have used Mary Kay skin care products for more than ten years.</li>
            <li>this is my all time favorite facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel so soft and smooth....</li>
            <li>It removes makeup and leaves my skin very soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>(I know I sound like a rep, but believe me, I&#x27;m an amazed costumer!)&lt;br /&gt;Before, I was always using Clean Clear but now since it is soap free it doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin, yet cleanses REALLY WELL TOO!</li>
            <li>ALSO LIKED THIS ITEM WOULD TRY OTHER THINGS BLENDS</li>
            <li>Product came new in package and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Always leaves my face feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Have been using Mary Kay for a long time, and am a satisfied customer.  </li>
            <li>I find that using a touch of their moisturizer afterwards leaves my skin feeling clean, fresh and younger looking.</li>
            <li>I am an older woman with likewise older sun damaged skin, thoughI have the lucky Mediterranean genetics.  </li>
            <li>Most face washes dry out my face, however, this one does not.  </li>
            <li>My complexion looks so much brighter and it controls my break outs and minimizes pimples.   </li>
            <li>It really makes a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather have this than the Estee Lauder and thinking to return everything I have bought as their serum is very potion and never had an issue with any products of Mary Kay and much cheaper and</li>
            <li>It really has helped my skin to look smoother.  </li>
            <li>I appreciated the timeliness in receiving this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, I really like</li>
            <li>it really does wonders.</li>
            <li>I really like this cleanser in the winter when my skin is dryer.</li>
            <li>gentle</li>
            <li>It DOES cleanse very well, yet this type of cleanser cannot remove all makeup, but a normal day of dirt on your skin!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited to find this product online and especially at amazon.</li>
            <li>I have used this cleanser for years and live it!</li>
            <li>and I still have found nothing that works any better even though the costs of these other &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; products far exceeds Mary Kay!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend Mary Kay Timewise Cleanser</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product....</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I ordered this product along with the moisturizer and also use Aveeno Pure Radiance Moisturizer with SPF and my skin is clear and even</li>
            <li>I myself think that Mary Kay stuff is almost always more than a little overpriced but... &amp;#34;Whatever you want, Baby&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It keeps the wrinkles low  &amp; the skin soft and clean and shinning.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great but expensive</li>
            <li>As much as I prefer the latter, this product works pretty well too.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive as well as being older</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without my Mary Kay</li>
            <li>somehow my skin gets oily too and i have breakouts with any new skincare products.</li>
            <li>cleanser comes out of the tube in a nice marshmallow like consistency, but when you apply and wet it, it gets milky, not really too lather-y.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use very much so that it doesn&#x27;t make my face look too oily later in the day.</li>
            <li>My skin felt clean after, not annoyed and not too tight.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so young!</li>
            <li>Again I&#x27;m completely amazed, how well it works!</li>
            <li>last a very long time, easy to travel as it is in a tube.  </li>
            <li>The product is old and did not have the high quality when I have ordered directly through a rep.</li>
            <li>I have very dry/sensitive skin and have tried several cleansers which made my skin super dry after washimg my face with it.</li>
            <li>Seller was quick, package wrapped well and delivered before expected.</li>
            <li>Okay, so i didnt really like this cleanser first time, because i thought i bought the wrong product</li>
            <li>Mary Kay cleanser is gentle, thorough and very little is required to get a clean face.  </li>
            <li>Stumbled on this here in my endless quest to find a cleanser that both gets off makeup and cleans well, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Buying ANYTHING else is a huge waste of money....</li>
            <li>I am 22 years old and have used this cleanser for a year now.  </li>
            <li>It was completely different from the Real one this one is a phony</li>
            <li>(I have been following my cleaning with this some Weleda Almond Cleanser afterward because it&#x27;s very</li>
            <li>If i run out and use something else for about a week and then come back to this cleanser, I can really tell a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft and I feel like I have newer skin when I wear it.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have harsh chemicals, is gentle and yet works really well!</li>
            <li>I never thought I would like the products, but I prefer this so much over Avon; why; no penetrating smell, doesn&#x27;t feel like harsh chemicals and these products really work!</li>
            <li>It is also a scrub, cleanser and toner 3-in 1 in my opinion, so no other products are needed!</li>
            <li>This is absolutely NOT the first time i buy this Mary Kay cleanser.</li>
            <li>Because I have sensitive skin that reacts to many different products in a negative way, I always try to stick with brands I can trust.  </li>
            <li>, I use other, natural moisturizers underneath as well, but the combination with Mary Kay works REALLY WELL!)&lt;br /&gt;SINCE</li>
            <li>The old one left my skin smoother.</li>
            <li>Am looking for a similar cleanser as their old in another brand.  </li>
            <li>Mild, exfoliate for those whose skin gets dried out from traditional face washes.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is all i need now before my moisturizer (mary kay timewise age fighting moisturizer for normal to dry skin).  </li>
            <li>which most of the time dried up my skin,,) i was afraid the oily texture would actually lead to pimples and breakouts by clogging more pores.</li>
            <li>This is the only face wash that doesn&#x27;t instantly burn on my highly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am 22 years old with dry skin and still have some ance.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;i came all the way to leave this comment to save one more wrinkle- prone skin of all the late twenties!!</li>
            <li>Wish they would bring back their old cleanser for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Most end up being too harsh after a few days leaving my face blotchy and dry.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s  the best product which help me to clear all blemishes on my face within 6 months.</li>
            <li> Being hooked on MK it is nice to be able to buy without having to call your rep</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so easy!</li>
            <li> I am so glad Amazon carries Mary Kay products.</li>
            <li> Glad to be able to get stuff online</li>
            <li> love this product.</li>
            <li> Been using it for years and have had many compliments saying I look like I&#x27;m in my 40s.</li>
            <li> My favorite cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many different face washes and this one is my favorite and makes my skin looks the best.  </li>
            <li> Glad to have found this product here.</li>
            <li> And trust me, like most women, I have used plenty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I love the tiny,gentle exfoliating beads as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> sure you know your skin type, though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Could not be happier:)</li>
            <li> I love the marycare Timewise colletion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for more years than I can remember--perfect for my normal-to-dry skin type.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Keep my skin smooth and nice.</li>
            <li> I have mixture skin like most people and</li>
            <li> always love Mary Kay.</li>
            <li> Love the product since my lady friend loves it.</li>
            <li> How could it be better?</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like that there is paraben in the product, but it&#x27;s low on the list of ingredients and in any event you do wash the stuff off, and the rest of the ingredients are impressive.</li>
            <li> The best part was the next day waking up</li>
            <li> This is the best facial cleanser I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I feel confident and comfortable leaving the house without any foundation or powder!</li>
            <li> Love Mary Kay products and</li>
            <li> Great product, very timely delivery.</li>
            <li> Lovely cream</li>
            <li> im glad i accidently bought this product now</li>
            <li> Love Mary Kay products and pleased I could get it online.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars because I feel like 5 stars are perfect</li>
            <li> Always love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love ordering this from Amazon as I don&#x27;t wanted to be bothered with a rep.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> Have used before and love it.</li>
            <li> I just love Mary Kay.</li>
            <li> I would like more scrub in it</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> So bottom line, I love this product and I would recommend it to anyone who has a dry/sensitive face.</li>
            <li> Being able to purchase this product online is much more convenient than trying to find a MK rep.</li>
            <li> Pleased to be able to order this so easily.  </li>
            <li> Thank you arrived in good condition and exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Glad I found an easy way to get it.</li>
            <li> My skin is more even, more moisturized, shiny it really glows more!</li>
            <li> It cleans very well and with the Time/wise Moisturizer it keeps my skin looking good.  </li>
            <li> I. Arrived fast and at a fair market price.</li>
            <li> But if you have too much make up on, it won&#x27;t do a good job cleaning.</li>
            <li> I have used other things before but have found that the timewise skin care collections works the best for me.</li>
            <li> It is easy to order and the pricing is competitive.</li>
            <li> it is easy to  carry  when traveling.</li>
            <li> Easy to use if you have any reaction to any cleaning products.  </li>
            <li> she loved it and it got here super fast!  </li>
            <li> Because my skin is easily irritated, I find that using this cleanser, which does not foam or develop suds while washing the skin, helps to prevent fine lines by reducing dryness as well as a noticeable reduction in redness.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years and its been the best i&#x27;ve ever used, hands down.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> The cleaner is fine.</li>
            <li> but it is fine without it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is just fine.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin very soft, feels good, the exfoliating is actually so smooth</li>
            <li> It exfoliates my skin and makes it feel smooth.  </li>
            <li> Oily, Light to Medium Skin Tone, Breakouts Cheek and Jawline    </li>
            <li> , I SEE HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR SKIN.</li>
            <li> Even my husband noticed a difference and he always comments on my smooth skin.</li>
            <li> Thank you for such great service.</li>
            <li> It cleans face and leaves a smooth sensation.</li>
            <li> Was due for more and this price was great.</li>
            <li> Makes your face so soft and clean, and feel good to.</li>
            <li> It is KEY to getting a healthy glow by using a great gentle cleanser.  </li>
            <li> This is by far one of the best facial cleansers I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel clean because of the micro beads without leaving it feeling stripped.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling clean and moisturized.</li>
            <li> MY PORES ARE ACTUALLY CLEAN NOW AND APPEAR TO HAVE MINIMIZED.</li>
            <li> this 3 in 1 did a great job without leaving feeling my skin too dry.</li>
            <li> After you use it, my skin feels so clean.</li>
            <li> It does not dry up my skin and feels good on my face.</li>
            <li> If you want a cleanser that is easy and gentle for the whole face, eye area too, get the kind without the beads in it.</li>
            <li> I use it up so fast, I&#x27;d love to get it at this price.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years and really depend on its results.</li>
            <li> This is a true Mary&lt;br /&gt;kay product with all the benefits of cleansing your face.</li>
            <li> I used the full line of skincare products.</li>
            <li> I love the product thank you so much.</li>
            <li> and it still lets light it, great solution for this little &#x27;problem&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I did not expect it at all, as I&#x27;m really picky, but I LOVED it so much, since it moisturizes REALLY well all day!</li>
            <li> This was my first time to order online and it worked really smoothly.  </li>
            <li> My Mary Kay rep. moved and I love that Amazon has this product available through its many stores - at less than the original price.  </li>
            <li> When I use this facial cleanser day and night my skin stays perfectly clear all the time (even during those beautiful times of the month).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does not sting my eyes like most of them, easy to use, great little crystals in the cream that do an extra scrub.. NOT drying.  </li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and leaves your skin feeling silky smooth after using it, not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> so it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> The 3 in 1 Mary Kay cleanser is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft and very clean.</li>
            <li> It is such a time saver having it be a 3-1 cleanser; takes less time and does a great job!  </li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive skin that is irritated easily; I have no problems what so ever with this product.</li>
            <li> Work great for African American women like myself.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable and the shipping quick.</li>
            <li> I won a free facial by a Mary Kay Rep. and received a free moisturizer.</li>
            <li> At first it is odd to rub a cleanser into skin that isn&#x27;t pre-moistened with water, but once you get over that feeling this is a good cleanser.</li>
            <li> Your face is very smooth and helps soften the skin when you use a cleanser with crystals or whatever those tiny sand like particles are called.</li>
            <li> I so happy about that, much cheaper so far the product appears to be the same, thanks.</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it daily.  </li>
            <li> I love this cleanser, and this price was cheaper than getting it locally.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While it doesn&#x27;t appear to do much at first, it does a lot over time.</li>
            <li> This cleanser was exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> I will be ordering more of this in the future.  </li>
            <li> I will absolutely reorder!</li>
            <li> This cleanser cleans my face leaving it smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In case anyone is interested</li>
            <li> My skin has SOOOO much improved!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think until recently to purchase on Amazon and was able to save money doing so.</li>
            <li> ordering the whole set!</li>
            <li> I have used Mary Kay skin care products for more than ten years.</li>
            <li> this is my all time favorite facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so soft and smooth....</li>
            <li> It removes makeup and leaves my skin very soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> (I know I sound like a rep, but believe me, I&#x27;m an amazed costumer!)&lt;br /&gt;Before, I was always using Clean Clear but now since it is soap free it doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin, yet cleanses REALLY WELL TOO!</li>
            <li> ALSO LIKED THIS ITEM WOULD TRY OTHER THINGS BLENDS</li>
            <li> Product came new in package and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Always leaves my face feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Have been using Mary Kay for a long time, and am a satisfied customer.  </li>
            <li> I find that using a touch of their moisturizer afterwards leaves my skin feeling clean, fresh and younger looking.</li>
            <li> I am an older woman with likewise older sun damaged skin, thoughI have the lucky Mediterranean genetics.  </li>
            <li> Most face washes dry out my face, however, this one does not.  </li>
            <li> My complexion looks so much brighter and it controls my break outs and minimizes pimples.   </li>
            <li> It really makes a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather have this than the Estee Lauder and thinking to return everything I have bought as their serum is very potion and never had an issue with any products of Mary Kay and much cheaper and</li>
            <li> It really has helped my skin to look smoother.  </li>
            <li> I appreciated the timeliness in receiving this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , I really like</li>
            <li> it really does wonders.</li>
            <li> I really like this cleanser in the winter when my skin is dryer.</li>
            <li> gentle</li>
            <li> It DOES cleanse very well, yet this type of cleanser cannot remove all makeup, but a normal day of dirt on your skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to find this product online and especially at amazon.</li>
            <li> I have used this cleanser for years and live it!</li>
            <li> and I still have found nothing that works any better even though the costs of these other &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; products far exceeds Mary Kay!  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend Mary Kay Timewise Cleanser</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product....</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I ordered this product along with the moisturizer and also use Aveeno Pure Radiance Moisturizer with SPF and my skin is clear and even</li>
            <li> I myself think that Mary Kay stuff is almost always more than a little overpriced but... &amp;#34;Whatever you want, Baby&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It keeps the wrinkles low  &amp; the skin soft and clean and shinning.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great but expensive</li>
            <li> As much as I prefer the latter, this product works pretty well too.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive as well as being older</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without my Mary Kay</li>
            <li> somehow my skin gets oily too and i have breakouts with any new skincare products.</li>
            <li> cleanser comes out of the tube in a nice marshmallow like consistency, but when you apply and wet it, it gets milky, not really too lather-y.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use very much so that it doesn&#x27;t make my face look too oily later in the day.</li>
            <li> My skin felt clean after, not annoyed and not too tight.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so young!</li>
            <li> Again I&#x27;m completely amazed, how well it works!</li>
            <li> last a very long time, easy to travel as it is in a tube.  </li>
            <li> The product is old and did not have the high quality when I have ordered directly through a rep.</li>
            <li> I have very dry/sensitive skin and have tried several cleansers which made my skin super dry after washimg my face with it.</li>
            <li> Seller was quick, package wrapped well and delivered before expected.</li>
            <li> Okay, so i didnt really like this cleanser first time, because i thought i bought the wrong product</li>
            <li> Mary Kay cleanser is gentle, thorough and very little is required to get a clean face.  </li>
            <li> Stumbled on this here in my endless quest to find a cleanser that both gets off makeup and cleans well, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Buying ANYTHING else is a huge waste of money....</li>
            <li> I am 22 years old and have used this cleanser for a year now.  </li>
            <li> It was completely different from the Real one this one is a phony</li>
            <li> (I have been following my cleaning with this some Weleda Almond Cleanser afterward because it&#x27;s very</li>
            <li> If i run out and use something else for about a week and then come back to this cleanser, I can really tell a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling soft and I feel like I have newer skin when I wear it.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have harsh chemicals, is gentle and yet works really well!</li>
            <li> I never thought I would like the products, but I prefer this so much over Avon; why; no penetrating smell, doesn&#x27;t feel like harsh chemicals and these products really work!</li>
            <li> It is also a scrub, cleanser and toner 3-in 1 in my opinion, so no other products are needed!</li>
            <li> This is absolutely NOT the first time i buy this Mary Kay cleanser.</li>
            <li> Because I have sensitive skin that reacts to many different products in a negative way, I always try to stick with brands I can trust.  </li>
            <li> , I use other, natural moisturizers underneath as well, but the combination with Mary Kay works REALLY WELL!)&lt;br /&gt;SINCE</li>
            <li> The old one left my skin smoother.</li>
            <li> Am looking for a similar cleanser as their old in another brand.  </li>
            <li> Mild, exfoliate for those whose skin gets dried out from traditional face washes.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is all i need now before my moisturizer (mary kay timewise age fighting moisturizer for normal to dry skin).  </li>
            <li> which most of the time dried up my skin,,) i was afraid the oily texture would actually lead to pimples and breakouts by clogging more pores.</li>
            <li> This is the only face wash that doesn&#x27;t instantly burn on my highly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am 22 years old with dry skin and still have some ance.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;i came all the way to leave this comment to save one more wrinkle- prone skin of all the late twenties!!</li>
            <li> Wish they would bring back their old cleanser for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Most end up being too harsh after a few days leaving my face blotchy and dry.</li>
            <li> This particular type of cleanser, with the little scrubbing beads in it, isn&#x27;t probably meant for removing eye makeup</li>
            <li> Especially since it is for oil and dry skin.</li>
            <li> but since it&#x27;s been so cold, my skin has been drier because of heat running more often.</li>
            <li> I will keep buying this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use the Timewise as long as they keep making it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> Not a big deal for me as I only put heavy make up on occasionally.</li>
            <li> Been using this fur a long time.</li>
            <li> I have been a long time Mary Kay customer, and will continue to do so.  </li>
            <li> Have tried other well known products, but Mary Kay is the only one that does not make me break out in a rash.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other products from time to time, but always come back.  </li>
            <li> If you have a tendency to get dry..</li>
            <li> it also help loosen dry skin and tends to flush it off somewhat-</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave the face dry and would keep using it.</li>
            <li> IS DRY</li>
            <li> /&gt;NORMAL TO DRY</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t caused dry skin or breakouts.  </li>
            <li> and I have dry skin</li>
            <li> It cleaned my face without leaving it dry.</li>
            <li> The bottle will last you a long time since you only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> I would always feel dry and wake up in the morning with very dry skin that required me to put some cocoa butter on my face to renew the moisture.  </li>
            <li> I tried other products first and ended up with a dry, peeling face that was worse than before.</li>
            <li> but I carefully use it there too</li>
            <li> I use Estee Lauder for my face and spent over 500.00</li>
            <li> so i took out this one again, tried it for last few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so, i looove this cleanser since it doesnt dry out my skin, and once you get to use it properly, ( take time to rub it thoroughly because these little beads inside the product will remove your dead skin too , without scrubbing every now and then, i usually have white scaly skinaround my cheeks)</li>
            <li> A little does go a long way</li>
            <li> I definately have used other products but none of them does what this cleanser does def.</li>
            <li> THEN, I&#x27;M HOOKED; so I purchased other products, such as lately this cleanser on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Have used Mary Kay for years but have a hard time getting it in our rural area.  </li>
            <li> made my skin feel very tight and rather dry.</li>
            <li> Dark Brown/Black    </li>
            <li> I use this product everyday and have for the past several years.</li>
            <li> Only negative is finding a MaryKay consultant that doesn&#x27;t give up.  </li>
            <li> As an AA woman, I have always struggled with uneven skin and since starting heavily working out over the past 6 months I have felt like I could not get rid of a few trouble spots on my chin line.</li>

            <li> In a million years I wouldn&#x27;t see myself as a Mary Kay product person (seemed like a corny old ladyish line), but I was really wrong</li>
            <li> I ran out and used another brand from the local store but was not really happy with the results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i threw it away for like a few weeks until i found this blog post .</li>
            <li> You might have to go for a second/third round cleaning in that case.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and have no Mary Kay agent nearby.  </li>
            <li> I received a bunch of Mary Kay products as a gift and decided to try this out instead of my usual face wash.  </li>
            <li> i read how oil cleansing can actually do better job cleaning those disgusting oils clogging our pores.</li>
            <li> I usually use combination/oily formula</li>
            <li> , I hardly ever have to use moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my Late 50s</li>
            <li> im in late twenties and was worried about wrinkles.</li>
            <li> ,is Olay which is considerably less expensive.</li>
            <li> I was  disappointed to discover Mary Kay discontinued their extra emollient creamy cleanser, so decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li> ANYONE WHO HAS NOT TRIED THESE PRODUCTS, YOU ARE MISSING OUT!!!</li>
            <li> Had no ideal that this product was on Amazon.com until it pop up, I was having a problem with a seller for Mary Kay and went to look for another one and this pop up.  </li>
            <li> SORRY SORRY</li>
            <li> time i didnt complain about how greasy it is, how weird smelly it is, and how it feels like a makeup remover rather than a cleanser.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t suds and is very thin.</li>
            <li> Of course I would not use it if I&#x27;m totally dirty or need to remove lots of Make-up, but always in the morning and often evening</li>
            <li> I was afraid to use it in fear it may not be goof for my face.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without my Mary Kay</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and have no Mary Kay agent nearby.  I am so glad Amazon carries Mary Kay products. It is easy to order and the pricing is competitive.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t spend big money on lots of products but I always use this moisturizer.  Best one I have found.</li>
            <li> Have been using Mary Kay for a long time, and am a satisfied customer.  Glad to be able to get stuff online</li>
            <li> Works great, Mary Kay is all I use and my consultant quit so it was easy to get it off of Amazon.</li>
            <li> On my face.  It keeps the wrinkles low  &amp; the skin soft and clean and shinning.  I like it a lot</li>
            <li> love this product. Been using it for years and have had many compliments saying I look like I&#x27;m in my 40s. I&#x27;m in my Late 50s</li>
            <li> Mary Kay works great on my face.  Especially since it is for oil and dry skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it daily.  It cleans very well and with the Time/wise Moisturizer it keeps my skin looking good.  I have received many compliments about my youthful skin, which any woman loves!  I nave trusted Mary Kay skin products for 30 years.</li>
            <li> My favorite cleanser.  Leaves skin soft and very clean.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different face washes and this one is my favorite and makes my skin looks the best.  It exfoliates my skin and makes it feel smooth.  My complexion looks so much brighter and it controls my break outs and minimizes pimples.   My mom and sister have been using Mary Kay products for years and they both have bright and beautiful skin.  I would recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li> I use alot of Mary Kay products.  This one is a very good moisturizer. I would use it all the time if I could.</li>
            <li> I was  disappointed to discover Mary Kay discontinued their extra emollient creamy cleanser, so decided to give this a try. As much as I prefer the latter, this product works pretty well too.</li>
            <li> This was perfect for removing my make up.  Wish it was lt was larger.  It does not dry up my skin and feels good on my face.</li>
            <li> At first it is odd to rub a cleanser into skin that isn&#x27;t pre-moistened with water, but once you get over that feeling this is a good cleanser. This particular type of cleanser, with the little scrubbing beads in it, isn&#x27;t probably meant for removing eye makeup but I carefully use it there too and it does a good job. If you want a cleanser that is easy and gentle for the whole face, eye area too, get the kind without the beads in it.</li>
            <li> Best face cleaner I ever used. Makes your face so soft and clean, and feel good to.I will keep buying this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely NOT the first time i buy this Mary Kay cleanser. The formula i&#x27;m used to is the one that is a gel instead of the cream i received. Good size for the price thought.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser, and this price was cheaper than getting it locally.  I use it up so fast, I&#x27;d love to get it at this price.  I hate that MK has gone up on their prices, but finding this was a great surprise.  I also do not have to deal with local pressure to sell.  MK reps, some people just want to buy the product!!  Get off their backs and stop trying to build your pyramid.  Instead, build your business.  These reps selling on Amazon are doing just that.  Glad to have found this product here.</li>
            <li> The bottle will last you a long time since you only need a small amount. Leaves face feeling silky smooth which my man loved!!! My face used to break out about once a month but using this has stopped that from happening. The last bottle I had of this lasted almost a year (no joke) so it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the best facial cleansers I have ever used. And trust me, like most women, I have used plenty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it doesn&#x27;t appear to do much at first, it does a lot over time. When I use this facial cleanser day and night my skin stays perfectly clear all the time (even during those beautiful times of the month).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smoothness of this product is really nice and I love the tiny,gentle exfoliating beads as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you know your skin type, though. I had used the Oily/Combination skin cleanser from Mary Kay as a backup cause I had ran out of my Normal/Dry skin cleanser and the Oily/Combination cleanser made my skin feel very tight and rather dry. When I use the Normal/Dry skin my skin looks and feels perfect though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could not be happier:)</li>
            <li> I bought this because the last time I purchased it it contained sunscreen. I will switch to a moisturizer that contains sunscreen. I don&#x27;t know why they removed it.</li>
            <li> I love the marycare Timewise colletion. The face wash and this moisurizer are awesome! I don&#x27;t use very much so that it doesn&#x27;t make my face look too oily later in the day.</li>
            <li> Skin Type: Oily, Light to Medium Skin Tone, Breakouts Cheek and Jawline    Eye Color: Green    Hair Color: Dark Brown/Black    It is KEY to getting a healthy glow by using a great gentle cleanser.  I am 22 years old and have used this cleanser for a year now.  Because my skin is easily irritated, I find that using this cleanser, which does not foam or develop suds while washing the skin, helps to prevent fine lines by reducing dryness as well as a noticeable reduction in redness.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I like this product from Mary Kay,I use it sometimes at night before I go to bed.It cleans your skin really good</li>
            <li> I have used Mary Kay for years, tried others but always back to this, why?, cause this works. Glad I found an easy way to get it.</li>
            <li> I have used this Cleanser for a number of years. It makes my skin feel clean because of the micro beads without leaving it feeling stripped. I have used other things before but have found that the timewise skin care collections works the best for me.</li>
            <li> Love the cleanser...especially in summer! It really makes a difference in my skin. If you have a tendency to get dry..this isn&#x27;t for you though.</li>
            <li> I have tried a number of different facial cleansers - some inexpensive from the grocery store (Oil of Olay, Neutrogena, Aveeno, etc), others nicer (i.e. Estee Louder). The 3 in 1 Mary Kay cleanser is by far my favorite. Most face washes dry out my face, however, this one does not.  It leaves my face feeling clean and moisturized. I have fairly sensitive skin that is irritated easily; I have no problems what so ever with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for more years than I can remember--perfect for my normal-to-dry skin type.  A great product.</li>
            <li> I liked the cream for travel it is easy to  carry  when traveling. I will order again when I  Need  a refill.</li>
            <li> BECAUSE THE RESULTS ARE THE BEST, THE JOB IS WELL DONE. GET IT, YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT, ITS VERY GOOD!</li>
            <li> Pleased to be able to order this so easily.  This was my first time to order online and it worked really smoothly.  This cleanser was exactly what I needed.  It is such a time saver having it be a 3-1 cleanser; takes less time and does a great job!  I will be ordering more of this in the future.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Kind of seemed like it was already used but that&#x27;s fine. The cleaner is fine. It doesn&#x27;t suds and is very thin.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT. MY PORES ARE ACTUALLY CLEAN NOW AND APPEAR TO HAVE MINIMIZED. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. I WILL CONTINUE TO USE IT.</li>
            <li> I have used Mary Kay skin care all of my life, and have been using this product specifically for years. Was due for more and this price was great. Product came new in package and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> This is my newest &amp;#34;Must Have&amp;#34; product. As an AA woman, I have always struggled with uneven skin and since starting heavily working out over the past 6 months I have felt like I could not get rid of a few trouble spots on my chin line. I tried other products first and ended up with a dry, peeling face that was worse than before. I ordered this product along with the moisturizer and also use Aveeno Pure Radiance Moisturizer with SPF and my skin is clear and even and I haven&#x27;t had a break out in 2 months!!! I will absolutely reorder!</li>
            <li> Does not sting my eyes like most of them, easy to use, great little crystals in the cream that do an extra scrub.. NOT drying.  last a very long time, easy to travel as it is in a tube.  Best cleanser I have found so far.  At 67 I have tried alot! Another I like that has the crystals,is Olay which is considerably less expensive. It is in a white bottle with pump.Your face is very smooth and helps soften the skin when you use a cleanser with crystals or whatever those tiny sand like particles are called. it also help loosen dry skin and tends to flush it off somewhat-I will keep buying this product.</li>
            <li> I use Estee Lauder for my face and spent over 500.00 but I am one to buy a product I know that works for what I am looking for. Mary Kay runs a close race as a cleanser I&#x27;d rather have this than the Estee Lauder and thinking to return everything I have bought as their serum is very potion and never had an issue with any products of Mary Kay and much cheaper and this cleanser has a sand feel cleans deep into the pores!</li>
            <li> I had used it before, but I don&#x27;t think it is the same thing.  The old one left my skin smoother.</li>
            <li> Have tried other well known products, but Mary Kay is the only one that does not make me break out in a rash.  It really has helped my skin to look smoother.  Highly recommend Mary Kay Timewise Cleanser</li>
            <li> Wish they would bring back their old cleanser for dry skin.  Am looking for a similar cleanser as their old in another brand.  Mary Kay has lost me as a customer.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday and have for the past several years. Your skin feels good after its use. Great product.</li>
            <li> I use this morning and night and it leaves my skin feeling amazing.  Before using this I just washed with water and dove soap or body wash.  I would always feel dry and wake up in the morning with very dry skin that required me to put some cocoa butter on my face to renew the moisture.  This cleanser is all i need now before my moisturizer (mary kay timewise age fighting moisturizer for normal to dry skin).  The combo is perfect!!</li>
            <li> This cleanser cleans my face leaving it smooth and soft.  I have been using this product for many years and really depend on its results.</li>
            <li> Everyone knows Mary Kay is great!  I have used for years! It makes my skin feel so young! Try it!</li>
            <li> My mom likes it so, if she&#x27;s happy so am I. Arrived fast and at a fair market price. Works great!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do as promised. Won&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Work great for African American women like myself. Keep my skin smooth and nice. I will continue to use the Timewise as long as they keep making it.</li>
            <li> I am an older woman with likewise older sun damaged skin, thoughI have the lucky Mediterranean genetics.  Mary Kay cleanser is gentle, thorough and very little is required to get a clean face.  Can&#x27;t be without it as I learned when I ran out.</li>

            <li> I have used this before but this product is defective. I would like a refund</li>
            <li> Have been using these products for 35 years and I still have found nothing that works any better even though the costs of these other &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; products far exceeds Mary Kay!  Buying ANYTHING else is a huge waste of money....</li>
            <li> Mild, exfoliate for those whose skin gets dried out from traditional face washes. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and its been the best i&#x27;ve ever used, hands down. Compared against, CereVe, Cetaphil, Nuetragena, Nivea and others.</li>
            <li> ANYONE WHO HAS NOT TRIED THESE PRODUCTS, YOU ARE MISSING OUT!!! I HAVE BEEN USING MARY KAY FOR ABOUT 10 YEARS &amp;amp; I LOVE IT!!  NOW, THAT I AM 40 SOMETHING, I SEE HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR SKIN.</li>
            <li> Have used Mary Kay for years but have a hard time getting it in our rural area.  This is a good product and now I can get it easier.</li>
            <li> Thank you arrived in good condition and exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Great product. I have used it for years. Always prefer to use may kay products. Good value for the money.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing this for years.  Although the consistency changed (I like the gel better), it still is refreshing and cleanses great!</li>
            <li> ALSO LIKED THIS ITEM WOULD TRY OTHER THINGS BLENDS WELL SMELLS GOOD GOOD VALUE NOTHING ELSE TO SAY SORRY SORRY</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I look forward to ordering it again.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product....</li>
            <li> I received a bunch of Mary Kay products as a gift and decided to try this out instead of my usual face wash.  This worked well.  I have mixture skin like most people and this 3 in 1 did a great job without leaving feeling my skin too dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to find this product online and especially at amazon. The price is reasonable and the shipping quick. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> It was completely different from the Real one this one is a phony</li>
            <li> I appreciated the timeliness in receiving this product.&lt;br /&gt;I always love Mary Kay.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Perfect for normal/dry skin. It doesn&#x27;t leave the face dry and would keep using it.</li>
            <li> Fresh &amp; works great! With this product, you don&#x27;t have to use a toner...just cleanse &amp; moisturize. Awesome!</li>
            <li> This is a true Mary&lt;br /&gt;kay product with all the benefits of cleansing your face.</li>
            <li> I have used this cleanser for years and live it!</li>
            <li> Best cleanser I have ever used.  Cleans without drying out my skin.</li>
            <li> Love the product since my lady friend loves it. How could it be better?</li>
            <li> Had no ideal that this product was on Amazon.com until it pop up, I was having a problem with a seller for Mary Kay and went to look for another one and this pop up.  I so happy about that, much cheaper so far the product appears to be the same, thanks.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE IT CLEANS MOISTURIZE THE SKIN MINE IS DRY IT DOES WHAT IT SAYS BEEN USING FOR 1 YEAR NOW</li>
            <li> Stumbled on this here in my endless quest to find a cleanser that both gets off makeup and cleans well, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my super sensitive skin. In a million years I wouldn&#x27;t see myself as a Mary Kay product person (seemed like a corny old ladyish line), but I was really wrong and I am admitting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like that there is paraben in the product, but it&#x27;s low on the list of ingredients and in any event you do wash the stuff off, and the rest of the ingredients are impressive. (I have been following my cleaning with this some Weleda Almond Cleanser afterward because it&#x27;s very soothing.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser comes out of the tube in a nice marshmallow like consistency, but when you apply and wet it, it gets milky, not really too lather-y. My skin felt clean after, not annoyed and not too tight. The best part was the next day waking up and my skin not looking bumpy and red which it will if the product doesn&#x27;t agree with my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case anyone is interested (I was) her is the ingredient list:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NORMAL TO DRY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:  Water, mineral oil, glycerin, petrolatum, bentonite, cetyle PEG/PPG-10/1 dimethicone, ethyhexyl pelargonate, neopentyl glycol diethylhexanoate, C12-15 alkyl benzoate, myristyl myristate, PPG-26-buteth-26, sorbitol, sucrose distearate, PEG-40 hydrogenated castor oil, oleyl oleate, camellia ssinensis extract, chamomile extract, cucumber extract, camellia oleifera extract, hibiscus rosa-sinensis extract, malva sylvestris (Mallow) extract, echinacea purpurea extract, solanum lycopersicum (Tomato) extract, triethanolamine, sucrose stearate, propylene glycol, butylene glycol, carbomer, disodium EDTA, magnesium almunium silicate, diazolidinyl urea, tocopherol, carnauba wax, mannitol, methylparaben, cellulose, propylparaben, C9-15 alkyl phospahte, lauramine oxide, phenoxyethanol, thermus thermophillus ferment, ethyl linoleate, ethyl linolenate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, tetradibutyl penaerithrityl  hydroxyhydrocinnamate, talc, red 7, red 4, titanium dioxide, red 30, ultramarines, red 33.roxyhydrocinnamate, talc, red 7, red 4, titanium dioxide, red 30, ultramarines, red 33.</li>
            <li> I won a free facial by a Mary Kay Rep. and received a free moisturizer. I did not expect it at all, as I&#x27;m really picky, but I LOVED it so much, since it moisturizes REALLY well all day! (I have to admit though, I use other, natural moisturizers underneath as well, but the combination with Mary Kay works REALLY WELL!)&lt;br /&gt;SINCE THEN, I&#x27;M HOOKED; so I purchased other products, such as lately this cleanser on Amazon. Again I&#x27;m completely amazed, how well it works! Of course I would not use it if I&#x27;m totally dirty or need to remove lots of Make-up, but always in the morning and often evening I do use it! I&#x27;m amazed, how my skin has IMPROVED! It DOES cleanse very well, yet this type of cleanser cannot remove all makeup, but a normal day of dirt on your skin! It does a better job than I ever have thought! It doesn&#x27;t have harsh chemicals, is gentle and yet works really well! (I know I sound like a rep, but believe me, I&#x27;m an amazed costumer!)&lt;br /&gt;Before, I was always using Clean Clear but now since it is soap free it doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin, yet cleanses REALLY WELL TOO! It is also a scrub, cleanser and toner 3-in 1 in my opinion, so no other products are needed! My skin has SOOOO much improved! I&#x27;m really impressed; another amazing product by Mary Kay. My skin is more even, more moisturized, shiny it really glows more! I never thought I would like the products, but I prefer this so much over Avon; why; no penetrating smell, doesn&#x27;t feel like harsh chemicals and these products really work!</li>
            <li> This is the best facial cleanser I have ever used.  I have always had problems with rosacea and acne- not anymore!  After just two weeks of using this product, my skin was softer, clearer, and no longer red.  I feel confident and comfortable leaving the house without any foundation or powder! Even my husband noticed a difference and he always comments on my smooth skin.</li>
            <li> Works great. Does the job. Once a Mary Kay buyer, always a Mary Kay buyer. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought a Clairasonic cleansing machine. It was recommended by a reader that I also purchase the Mary Kay Timewise Cleanser. It is a wonderful product to use along with the Clairasonic!! Delivering was fast, and the product works great!</li>
            <li> Love Mary Kay products and this is one of the best cleansers I have found.  I ran out and used another brand from the local store but was not really happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Cleanser does a wonderful job of removing make-up while leaving skin moisturized but not oily. I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> I myself think that Mary Kay stuff is almost always more than a little overpriced but... &amp;#34;Whatever you want, Baby&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Great product, very timely delivery. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser!! After you use it, my skin feels so clean. If i run out and use something else for about a week and then come back to this cleanser, I can really tell a difference in my skin. It&#x27;s a must buy!</li>
            <li> Lovely cream, I really like</li>
            <li> Okay, so i didnt really like this cleanser first time, because i thought i bought the wrong product accidently.&lt;br /&gt;i threw it away for like a few weeks until i found this blog post . i read how oil cleansing can actually do better job cleaning those disgusting oils clogging our pores. cleaning oil with oil. so i took out this one again, tried it for last few days.&lt;br /&gt;this time i didnt complain about how greasy it is, how weird smelly it is, and how it feels like a makeup remover rather than a cleanser. ( ive used cleansers that actually make you feel like you washed off something from your face. which most of the time dried up my skin,,) i was afraid the oily texture would actually lead to pimples and breakouts by clogging more pores. but ! it worked soooo great.&lt;br /&gt;reason why i recommend this product is :: im in late twenties and was worried about wrinkles. somehow my skin gets oily too and i have breakouts with any new skincare products. so, i looove this cleanser since it doesnt dry out my skin, and once you get to use it properly, ( take time to rub it thoroughly because these little beads inside the product will remove your dead skin too , without scrubbing every now and then, i usually have white scaly skinaround my cheeks) it really does wonders. im glad i accidently bought this product now lol&lt;br /&gt;i came all the way to leave this comment to save one more wrinkle- prone skin of all the late twenties!!</li>
            <li> This product arrived ahead of time in excellent condition.  Love Mary Kay products and pleased I could get it online.  I have been using Mary Kay products for over 20 yrs.</li>
            <li> I like this cleanser because of the way it feels on my skin, however, if you&#x27;re looking for a cleanser that removes make up...this is not it.  I use Mary Kay a lot, therefore I use the toner also.  After cleaning my skin with this cleanser and then using the toner, the cotton ball had loads of make up on it.  yuck</li>
            <li> I love this product. I am 22 years old with dry skin and still have some ance.  This products does not make me break out. It leaves my skin feeling soft and I feel like I have newer skin when I wear it.  The only dislike would have to be the smell. It doesn&#x27;t smell but it doesn&#x27;t have a great smell to it. ( Just a personal problem I guess) It met all my expectations.  The mositurzing cream has not came in yet, but I&#x27;m hoping it will be the same.  I only gave it 4 stars because I feel like 5 stars are perfect and I have only been using the product for about 2 weeks now</li>
            <li> this was a gift for my mother in law....she loved it and it got here super fast!  wou  ld buy again!</li>
            <li> I really like this cleanser in the winter when my skin is dryer.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great but expensive</li>
            <li> Because I have sensitive skin that reacts to many different products in a negative way, I always try to stick with brands I can trust.  This is one of them.</li>
            <li> Always love this product.  Gives a youthful look to your skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grandmother cause it&#x27;s cheaper on here than through the MaryK lady, Grandma likes good deals.</li>
            <li> This is the only face wash that doesn&#x27;t instantly burn on my highly sensitive skin. Might be using this for life!</li>
            <li> very excellent! gentle and you can use daily. immediate results and it has been about 5 years and i have never had breakout again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of cleansers. Most end up being too harsh after a few days leaving my face blotchy and dry. Mary Kay Timewise 3 in 1 does not.  It hasn&#x27;t caused dry skin or breakouts.  I use it with my Clarisonic and it works great.  I love ordering this from Amazon as I don&#x27;t wanted to be bothered with a rep.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and leaves your skin feeling silky smooth after using it, not greasy at all. I use it every day.</li>
            <li> This is not a cleanser it is something else. I have used this product for a long time. The tube belongs to the product but the&lt;br /&gt;contents is something different. I was afraid to use it in fear it may not be goof for my face.</li>
            <li> Have used  Mary Kay for years. I have tried other products from time to time, but always come back.  Only negative is finding a MaryKay consultant that doesn&#x27;t give up.  Thus, was ecstatic to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Mary Kay Cosmetics is something that I have used for years.  The 3-in-1 cleanser helps save time.  Thank you for such great service.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay but I may not use it again. I didn&#x27;t realize it would have granules in it to exfoliate. My skin is very sensitive as well as being older (60&#x27;s) so I dont think it&#x27;s the perfect cleanser for me, but so far it&#x27;s working okay.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for! Have used before and love it. Will definitely order again. I just love Mary Kay.</li>
            <li> It cleans face and leaves a smooth sensation. It does not irritate skin. I would like more scrub in it but it is fine without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to follow up with facial cream afterwards. good deal for the money</li>
            <li> I usually use combination/oily formula but since it&#x27;s been so cold, my skin has been drier because of heat running more often. This has worked well and feels great!</li>
            <li> I use this product every day.  It removes makeup and leaves my skin very soft and clean.  Even when I do not need to remove makeup I like the feel this product gives me.  My Mary Kay rep. moved and I love that Amazon has this product available through its many stores - at less than the original price.  Will buy again.  Seller was quick, package wrapped well and delivered before expected.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin very soft, feels good, the exfoliating is actually so smooth I don&#x27;t think it works, but it&#x27;s ok!..</li>
            <li> The best cleanser there is.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I have used it for years.  Didn&#x27;t think until recently to purchase on Amazon and was able to save money doing so.</li>
            <li> This Mary Kay cleanser contains tiny granules that help in cleansing your skin.  I find that using a touch of their moisturizer afterwards leaves my skin feeling clean, fresh and younger looking.</li>
            <li> My Mom Came Over with a Travel size gift bag of Mary Kay Products and So I tried the Timewise 3 n 1 cleanser and I have dry skin and I&#x27;m telling you not only did it work my skin was a lot softer and I started getting compliments on my skin and people kept asking me What did I do . A little does go a long way and I used it to the last drop . I definately have used other products but none of them does what this cleanser does def. ordering the whole set!</li>
            <li> This is just fine. I always used the extra emmolient cleansing cream. Looks like they discontinued that. That was GREAT!</li>
            <li> Have used the product  for years. It works great.</li>
            <li> I have used Mary Kay skin care products for more than ten years. It&#x27;s  the best product which help me to clear all blemishes on my face within 6 months. I used the full line of skincare products.</li>
            <li> It did what it said. It cleaned my face without leaving it dry. I have very dry/sensitive skin and have tried several cleansers which made my skin super dry after washimg my face with it. I immediately had to put the moisturizer or I was feeling like my face is about to crack open. But the MK one definetly left my face moisturized and cleaned after wasing my face with it. But if you have too much make up on, it won&#x27;t do a good job cleaning. You might have to go for a second/third round cleaning in that case. Not a big deal for me as I only put heavy make up on occasionally. So bottom line, I love this product and I would recommend it to anyone who has a dry/sensitive face.</li>
            <li> We needed this for our front door and side windows, we have a etched type door and side windows and people seemed to always peek in between the etching to see is we were home or coming to the door, and our entry way still looks very very nice..  Well this works and it still lets light it, great solution for this little &#x27;problem&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Been using this fur a long time. It&#x27;s a great cleanser and I like the 3 in 1 time saving! I just use it each time I shower it&#x27;s so easy!</li>
            <li> Stick with a Mary Kay rep.  The product is old and did not have the high quality when I have ordered directly through a rep.</li>
            <li> All Mary Kay products are good for me and have been using them for many years.  Easy to use if you have any reaction to any cleaning products.  Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I have been a long time Mary Kay customer, and will continue to do so.  Being able to purchase this product online is much more convenient than trying to find a MK rep.</li>
            <li> Always leaves my face feeling clean and soft. Been using this product with the TW moisturizer and wouldn&#x27;t us anything else.</li>
            <li> dos&#x27;t work at all for me.</li>
            <li> this is my all time favorite facial cleanser. it cleans and moisturizes at the same time, I hardly ever have to use moisturizer. this is great for aging skin.</li>
            <li> I love the product thank you so much. It does just what it is supposed. I recommend these Mary Kay products to everyone</li>
            <li> This seller was prompt in their delivery and the product came as advertised. Being hooked on MK it is nice to be able to buy without having to call your rep, wait for her to come over and then have to deal with her trying to sell you something else when all you want is the one produce.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so soft and smooth....just keep it in the shower and use it twice a day...great product</li>
