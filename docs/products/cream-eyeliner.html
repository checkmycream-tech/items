            <li>This cream eyeliner was very good for the price.</li>
            <li>I use the brush that came with it for my lower lid as it is not the best of brushes but does a great job of blending on the lower lids.  </li>

            <li>and im good!</li>
            <li>this works so good!</li>

            <li>It is a great price</li>

            <li>This is a great eyeliner.</li>
            <li>product is a win.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t smudge or fade, It was still looking great.</li>
            <li>However, the applicator that it comes with is not that great.  </li>
            <li>Lol.</li>
            <li>the brush that it comes with is great.</li>
            <li>, however it is great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had great results with E.l.f. products and settled on the Studio Cream Eyeliner in black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i would recommended it to all my friends because its just a great product.</li>
            <li>This liner is great for those not intimidated by brush liquid liners.  </li>
            <li>Lol.</li>
            <li>I think the product was great for the price.</li>
            <li>its amazing!</li>
            <li>the brush is amazing!</li>
            <li>stuff is amazing!  </li>
            <li>I am very happy I bought it and plan to order more.</li>
            <li>excellent, will buy another when this one is done, for sure.</li>
            <li>Good service and great experience</li>
            <li>If you goof, keep some q-tips handy with make-up remover, and you&#x27;ll be good to go!</li>
            <li>its a great purchase, makes it a lot easier to eyeline your eyes, I used liquid and pen liners, but this is way better!</li>
            <li>The brush it comes with serves its purpose and is of good quality.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner is good to the fact that it does not bead up like ELF&#x27;s liquid</li>
            <li>The brush gives good control.</li>
            <li>I loved it.</li>
            <li>It is good quality and affordable.</li>
            <li>Ordering the colors online is a good idea</li>
            <li>But now i get use to,and its good</li>
            <li>but apart from this everything is good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say this is was a good purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen good Youtube reviews but....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a seriously good combo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never tried a cream eyeliner before, but I&#x27;d read good things about them and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>So I put a good amount of gel on the brush, spread it out</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product coming from elf</li>
            <li>Is perfect ;) not waterproof!!</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>However, I was able to use the brush from a rival product and had great results.</li>
            <li>very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I really love this product,though!</li>
            <li>so I decided I would give it a shot, and I am so glad I did!</li>
            <li>This is also better because you don&#x27;t have to pay $20 for quality eyeliner!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I love the color, the finish!</li>
            <li>Love this eyeliner!</li>
            <li>I love it !</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>but I like this better!</li>
            <li>and this product is great for the price, but it smears easily.</li>
            <li>It has great color, stays on ALL day, is waterproof, and relatively cheap.</li>
            <li>The product has AMAZING quality.</li>
            <li>your own eyeliner brush.</li>
            <li>and I use my own)</li>
            <li>i have my own brush</li>
            <li>but this applies nicely.</li>
            <li>The mini brush that comes with it is surprisingly good too (again, better than some I&#x27;ve bought on their own).</li>
            <li>I purchased this and liked it okay, but my roommate loved it</li>
            <li>I just used my own instead.</li>
            <li>Nothing spectacular about it</li>
            <li>I prefer it over the Maybelline Eye studio gel eyeliner honestly.</li>
            <li>that was my own fault for not bothering to look at the size and just went for the cheapest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>I made my own</li>
            <li>but I used my bent brush from bdellium since I am not that adept at eye liner to begin with.</li>
            <li>I am very impressed by this eyeliner, its goes on super smooth, stays on for awhile too.</li>
            <li>but it is very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>i Tried many liners and i like this one the Most!</li>
            <li>This is by far the BEST eyeliner I have used!</li>
            <li>range of colors it comes in is nice too, although I wish there was more selection.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i absolutly love this eyeliner goes on perfect and is very pigmented and stays put almost all day just love it</li>
            <li>i love it because it applies so nicely.</li>
            <li>It was so soft and perfect.</li>
            <li>but after reading the reviews I decided what do I have to lose, and wow I&#x27;m impressed with this one, I always wear a cat eye, this cream liner helps me achieve that in one swipe, I don&#x27;thave</li>
            <li>it was so easy and smooth to apply and looked great.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to apply &amp; it lasts all day!</li>
            <li>So easy to apply!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best eyeliner, you can use or on top or bottom on your water lines or even just you lash lines.</li>
            <li>It is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>very smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super creamy and glides on very easily!</li>
            <li>The Cream eyeliner was so easy to apply with the handy brush that came in with it.</li>
            <li>it goes on smoothly, the brush is perfect and easy to control and get a straight line.  </li>
            <li>but the quality isn&#x27;t really that great.  </li>
            <li>E.l.f. makes a fantastic cream eyeliner!</li>
            <li>Oh i&#x27;m 17 btw &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>If you are just starting out learning how to do the cateye on your self this product is perfect.</li>

            <li>and so I was looking for a liquid liner (I used to love the Maybelline waterproof liquid liner)</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner...</li>

            <li>Personally, I am satisfied with this one.</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner,I use their eyeliner brush instead of the one it comes with.  </li>
            <li>I fall in love with 75 percent of my purchases and with their prices</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>okay</li>

            <li>i freaken love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t used it more than a handful amount of times.</li>
            <li>I love the E.L.F. cream eyeliners but I don&#x27;t understand why they are $8.50 on Amazon when they are $3 in stores and on the E.L.F. site??</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok, use better than this.</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s been my favorite company</li>
            <li>I love non pencil eyeliners but liquid eyeliners can be a hassle.</li>

            <li>Nice smooth easy application.</li>
            <li>You do need a good liner applicator to put it on right because it is easy to over do it with this product because it&#x27;s so creamy and a lot can stick to the applicator.</li>
            <li>I love this product because it stays on and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>luckily I had my own to use.</li>
            <li>anyone who love bold eyeliner would love this.</li>
            <li>What I quickly realized is that you have to have the angle brush at the right angle on your lid for the gel to look good on your lid.</li>
            <li>other than that it works wonderful.</li>
            <li>The liner goes on easy and if you don&#x27;t touch it, it stays.</li>
            <li>For a cream eyeliner this is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>So easy to apply, no tugging or pulling.</li>
            <li>The reason is because it dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>Eyeliner was easy to used.</li>
            <li>The shipping was very quick as well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to create a wing-tip look with this and the eyeliner stays on all day but removes easily at night.  </li>
            <li>I found it easy to use.</li>
            <li>It came in the mail VERY quickly.</li>
            <li>It does not run, it&#x27;s easy to apply,</li>
            <li>come off easy at night.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was my first cream eyeliner product I&#x27;ve bought and it works nice.</li>
            <li>I liked it at first</li>
            <li>The color was rich and smooth and the pigment lasted for many hours.</li>
            <li>The brush technique makes it easy to apply and it&#x27;s the perfect shade of black.</li>
            <li>At the beginning it was fine.</li>
            <li>it gets the job done just fine for me.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t smear or rub off too easy.  </li>
            <li>It arrived in the mail quickly and packaged safely surrounded and swaddled in bubble wrap and in it&#x27;s packaging.</li>
            <li>Came to me quick!</li>
            <li>If its your first time buying a cream liner go for this one price is right!!!</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of elf products.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner works so well and makes my eyes look huge.</li>
            <li>I bought this one in Target for $3, thinking it&#x27;s cheap enough to try and got great reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Its cheap but works as if it was millions.</li>
            <li>but there are always coupons available through ELF if you look.  </li>
            <li>Lightly powder your lids (or use an eyelid primer) and then use your shadows.</li>
            <li>It goes on fairly bright but within a hour or so, it almost completely wears off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clean and easy to use (trust me</li>
            <li>Amazing colour and very creamy.</li>
            <li>it comes with makes my lines precise and evenly applied.</li>
            <li>I tried ALMAY oil free eye makeup remover and it did not come off.</li>
            <li>fifty???&lt;br /&gt;This cream eyeliner is a dream - goes on smoothly and stays on all day.  </li>
            <li>perfect for everyday use.</li>
            <li>It goes on really smooth and</li>
            <li>Overall great product.</li>
            <li>But because I was Cleopatra for Halloween I needed a cheap eye-liner.</li>
            <li>and it glides on so smooth.  </li>
            <li>and it went on smoothly.</li>
            <li>It went on smoothly and precisely, without a hitch, no stray marks or globs.  </li>
            <li>First, let me start by saying that I normally do not review anything I buy, but I was just really impressed with this</li>
            <li>This eyeliner is creamy, smooth, very very easy to use ... and I love that it&#x27;s smudge-proof, but if you need to remove it, it luckily comes off easily with your most basic makeup removers.</li>
            <li>However, When applied with other products, the staying power on the waterline is incredible.</li>
            <li>This is actually a decent cream eyeliner, and at an amazing price.</li>
            <li>Doing a wing liner is super easy with the brush it comes with.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented, &amp; very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>For only $3 (at Target), it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Amazon should be more aware of fraudulent sellers and do something to prevent it.</li>
            <li>It comes with a small eyeliner brush that applies the eyeliner great!</li>
            <li>But its ok for me ;)</li>
            <li>first time I used it, I fell in love.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s pretty challenging keeping any liner on me.</li>
            <li>AMAZING price, brand new as stated.</li>
            <li>The amount of product in the cute container is pretty good - especially for the bargain price.</li>
            <li>I love this E.l.f studio liner it goes on smooth, dark and makes a great cat eye, very intense</li>
            <li>When I first received this eyeliner I was really excited!</li>
            <li>and she had bought a new one of the same kind, and I used it and LOVED it.</li>
            <li>and it wiped right off!</li>
            <li>and I was right!  </li>
            <li>I like my eyeliner to be pretty precise, and I can&#x27;t quite get that fine \\&quot;wing\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I do recommend there professional eyeliner brush, it is much better than the plastic brush provided and dip in water when applying for a clean sleek finish!</li>
            <li>and WOW this is some amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d call it kind of a hybrid between using a soft pencil and liquid liner.</li>
            <li>It is a good product overall</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a phenomenal product and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I really like the cream texture and it is smooth which makes it easy to apply.</li>
            <li>After sliding off the excess onto the rim of the jar I started with my top lid and was sooooo surprised how easy it went on.</li>
            <li>As good or better product than many more expensive ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>it worked fine at first</li>
            <li>Forgiving if you make a mistake - just wipe off quickly.</li>
            <li>but if you want something more shapely or a cat eye look a different brush might be better.</li>
            <li>, that makes me super</li>
            <li>Y SUPER ACORDE CON EL TAMA&amp;Ntilde;O  </li>
            <li>When I went to put it on I dipped the brush and it quickly became covered in the cream.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re SUPER worried</li>
            <li>It mucks up your brush really quick.  </li>
            <li>Gives a nice smooth line without that gross \\&quot;chola\\</li>
            <li>The order came quick</li>
            <li>Iam greatly pleased with this product and considering buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>For being a cheap product it did exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>I always love to try new types of liners.</li>
            <li>It was easy to control (my hands are really jittery) and it had staying power - even when used without a primer.</li>
            <li>Overall its a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>I REALLY like this eyeliner!!</li>
            <li>to go back and double up over the first line, that impressed me for the price, to me</li>
            <li>This is a great product and I totally recommend it to anyone who is new to makeup.</li>
            <li>The little brush that comes with it works great.</li>
            <li>so i prefer to buy this one for 3 dollars that the old one for 20!!!!!</li>
            <li>Plus, I don&#x27;t think anyone can really complain about this makeup when it&#x27;s just so darn cheap.  </li>
            <li>Well, it goes on really nicely, smooth, intense color.</li>
            <li>Not to mention as with all E.L.F. products, the price is perfect and the quality is above expected.</li>
            <li>and I am able to complete a look on one eye without having to re-dip the brush into the container.  </li>
            <li>I rarely use make-up let alone eye-liner.</li>
            <li>bottom line is if your looking for an inexpensive cream liner you found it but your much better off paying a little bit more for a richly pigmented liner.</li>
            <li>You just need to get the right amount of cream on the brush.</li>
            <li>If you dont get the cover just right...</li>
            <li>The first few weeks it worked great-</li>
            <li>ELF&#x27;s cream eyeliner is a great soft formula, easy to apply and not too messy.</li>
            <li>I liked it the first couple weeks, then it started getting gross.</li>
            <li>this is way better than maybellines,which alot of people love, not me that formula was way to dry on my eyes and tugged to much, this liner goes on creamy and stays put</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply especially with the brush that it came with, stays on no smudge or running..</li>
            <li>I used Soft Soap to clean the brush!</li>
            <li>It works best when applied with another product over it, such as  a black eyeliner or pencil.  </li>
            <li>First, the jars never close flush, since they&#x27;re square the top is never aligned properly with the bottom when tightened.&lt;br /&gt;Second, and more importantly, the jars dont seal properly.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, if you use eye-liner regularily I would suggest spending just a little more for better quality.</li>
            <li>It is a great product, just as good as any of the more expensive brands, for half the price.</li>
            <li>Other than that I am VERY pleased.</li>
            <li>very fast shipping...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely waterproof to some extent and goes on very smoothly.</li>
            <li>The black is a true black, the texture is soft and easy to apply and best of all the color does not run or fade!  </li>
            <li>This is the first time i am using a cream eyeliner and to my surprise</li>
            <li>was exactly as described ....</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smudge and goes EXACTLY wear</li>
            <li>I use an eyeliner brush that came with another product, that has a longer handle, but otherwise, I love these products and use them daily.</li>
            <li>Overall its ok.</li>
            <li>actually use this more to fill in my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I first purchased this eyeliner</li>
            <li>The item was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>first I had given this eyeliner 5 stars, but I had to change it to  3 stars.</li>
            <li>When i first receive the product.</li>
            <li>The eyeliner quality is great and long lasting</li>
            <li>I would most likely recommended this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always swore by e.l.f. makeup since I first started wearing makeup</li>
            <li>e.l.f Cream Eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking to get the crisp, defined line look, and this product let me get that while pencil eyeliners didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>But I said why not ill try this out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to be buying more, and trying out the different colors too!</li>
            <li>This is said to be a good alternative for the MAC cream eyeliner - I am glad I purchased this and didn&#x27;t waste the extra money on MAC.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I used this brand.</li>
            <li>Overall I love the product, I just have to continue practicing the applying technique.</li>
            <li>It stays on all day, it glides on so easily without pulling or tugging on the eye skin it doesn&#x27;t run, come off or smear all day, well it smeared just a tiny, tiny bit to my upper lid but not to the point where it would annoy the heck out of me Lol, not like the way liquid eyeliner would.</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying that I usually love E.L.F products, they seamlessly blend with my high end cosmetics for a fraction of the cost, but this cream eyeliner really missed the mark.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The consistency of the gel was also very good, not too hard and not too soft.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a really good eyeliner that is a lot easier to apply than many others I have had in the past.</li>
            <li>After I got home in the evening my eyes still looked so fresh and vibrant</li>
            <li>I originally bought this to see if I liked cream eye liner in general and planned to buy a more expensive and/or bigger brand name product if I liked it.  </li>
            <li>It faded in the shower but didn&#x27;t completely come off( speaks highly of the waterproofness), but it easily came off with an eye make-up remover I got at the body</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been looking for a cake eyeliner for awhile, so was glad to stumble on this product.</li>
            <li>I put it on, it looked nice and dark, but</li>
            <li>The only thing I would recommend is not opening your eye until it dries and if your doing a very perfect line, you may want to use a different brush other than the one it came with.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it does smudge a little, but for the price I love it!</li>
            <li>: lasts all day nice jet black.</li>
            <li>I like the ELF gel eyeliner better than any gel eyeliner I have ever used because it does dry after you put it on so it wont smudge or crease during the day</li>
            <li>Until you&#x27;re ready to remove, it pretty much stays put.</li>
            <li>The brush that this comes with is useful for a quick, basic application</li>
            <li>I would suggest the brown color for us older ladies!  </li>
            <li>urge you to at least try this product I love it and will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li>my expectations for this product was pretty high.</li>
            <li>I wanted a highly pigmented product to line my eyes with that I could apply with an angled brush, and this is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re unsure of how good it is because it&#x27;s cheap, just spring for it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li>highly recommend!</li>
            <li>it is much easier to apply than a liquid one...</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend them all!</li>
            <li>I am very picky with my make up and</li>
            <li>The brush is really crappy and you have to wash it after every use so it doesnt harden and clump</li>
            <li>but I bought this one because it was very inexpensive</li>
            <li>This formula is very creamy.</li>
            <li>I am really</li>
            <li>The whole day it felt like I didn&#x27;t have any eyeliner on.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t smudge like pencil liner, it&#x27;s much easier to apply than liquid.</li>
            <li>it is waterproof and it really won&#x27;t smudge off at all, I use coconut oil to remove it.</li>
            <li>Much better quality than I expected for the price.</li>
            <li>but I think if I didn&#x27;t, it might not have as much staying power as others.</li>
            <li>The brush holds so much product</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine why anyone spends so much money for</li>
            <li>so much easier to do the pin up wing with it then a pencil or liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear makeup much, but when I do, I like</li>
            <li>The brush is angled and works very well if you like the winged eyeliner look.</li>
            <li>It really does work.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it to much</li>
            <li>With the angled brush it was really</li>
            <li>Really unsmudgable.</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>I can get my hands on in sephora, let me just say I didn&#x27;t expect much from a 3$eyeliner</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>The price and quality are unbeatable and I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>This stuff is ok you can make it thicker or thin but make sure you use primer and press into your lid to prevent smudging</li>
            <li>The container it comes in cute and simple and looks classy.  </li>
            <li>Worth spending a few more dollars and get something that works.</li>
            <li>Applies easily and the little brush it comes with is actually not bad either.</li>
            <li>It looks amazing and it is great for everyday and dramatic looks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However it is very matte, and after mixing the eyeliner it goes back to its original texture.</li>
            <li>so if you will be using this daily might want to reconsider but other than it good quality.</li>
            <li>The little brush that comes with the eyeliner makes precision lines and you can get a super fine line or use a heavier hand for a thicker look.  </li>
            <li>Super tiny, but you really don&#x27;t need much to get the job done.</li>
            <li>I am a usual fan of gel liners and this is my first cream and so far I love it!</li>
            <li>I then applied a generic pencil liner, then put Elf gel cream eyeliner on top of it, and on top of the Elf gel cream eyeliner, I dipped a small pointed eyeliner brush into black (or whatever color you choose) into eyeshadow and applied it on top.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner is very watery and translucent, i have to put on many coats for the eyeliner to appear black.</li>
            <li>I use a small angled brush to apply and my eyes looked amazing.</li>
            <li>It is creamy enough to go on easily, but dry enough to not smudge during application (and the brush it comes with is way better than the one that comes with the maybelline studio liner).</li>
            <li>Regular soap and water DID NOT clean the brush, but the Soft Soap cleaned it quickly and nicely.</li>
            <li>better when set with matte black eyeshadow</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this particular trial and error experience.</li>
            <li>Ok so I can be informative: You can get this product at Target for only $3 as their regular price.</li>
            <li>It comes with a decent slanted eyeliner brush</li>
            <li>At first I was happy but then after after few months it dried out and shrunk.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s creamy, the colour is true black, the brush is useful and does the job - the packaging isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;bad on the eye&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I use a high end lip brush for a cat eye look.</li>
            <li>If you have never used a gel formula before you may want to try this out before buying a high end formula.</li>
            <li>The prices are so reasonable, especially from their own website or Target, and the performance is up to par with the much more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>The price and quality are unbeatable and I highly recommend this!ity product.  </li>
            <li>I got this product and eventhough it is very very small the quality is great and it last for longgg time.</li>
            <li>You have to warm the pot in your hand a little before using it or it will get really clumped up on the tiny, unhelpful brush that comes with the eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I appreciate that the liner is waterproof, but I wasn&#x27;t happy with how difficult it was to wash off.</li>
            <li>It is able to be applied lightly or heavy depending on the look you&#x27;re aiming for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its sort of a waste to never be able to use %90 of product in the jar.</li>
            <li>Best buy in a long time - sorry</li>
            <li>For the price I can live with that though.</li>
            <li>Customarily I would not use cream eyeliner, but I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of experimenting with new products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I came across this product while searching for a new liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I wanted to try some new eyeliner</li>
            <li>if you are one of those people who want their eyeliner to last all day without smuge or having to re apply every few hours, this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>Unlike the more expensive Tart gel eyeliner available at Sephora, it is NOT waterproof or smudgeproof.</li>
            <li>The pigment is very concentrated and it lasts throughout the entire day w/out much fading.  </li>
            <li>it could have been better didn&#x27;t expect it the brush o be so small.</li>
            <li>This smudges with urban decay primer potion on within the first hour.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I say that as a professional make-up artist!</li>
            <li>I think this is a rip off only because I bought this exact thing eyeslipsface.com for $3.00...</li>
            <li>At first I was really skeptical about buying this because it was my first eye cream liner I love that it comes with a brush I use it also.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, using the little brush that came with it.</li>
            <li>It stays on all day for me and the little brush that comes with it makes for easy application.</li>
            <li>I just dab a little coconut oil onto my eyes and it wipes away easily with that.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is a great buy: only $3 for a dark, black, matte creme eyeliner with all-day staying power and intensity to make your eyes pop.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner glides on smooth and makes a very sharp line.</li>
            <li>I found that this gel liner dried out very quickly.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m now back on the hunt for a new eyeliner, one that really does have staying power.</li>
            <li>On me, it does start to smudge and run a little after a few hours, but I admit that could be because my eye primer doesn&#x27;t have good staying power.</li>
            <li>, I purchased it directly from the companies site and it isn&#x27;t pictured on there.</li>
            <li>Because i forgot that this its not so resistant like the old one that I used to buy.</li>
            <li>Just like a professional type of cream liner.</li>
            <li>Whether you use the brush that comes with it or a professional one, this product starts to get clumpy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has the control of liquid liner but the creamy fullness of a soft pencil</li>
            <li>I was soaked after splashing around with him and pleasantly surprised when I glanced in the mirror and saw it was still intact.  </li>
            <li>The only to problem i had with the product, the brush get  old quick and the cream dry out.</li>
            <li>It comes with a small angled brush and is so easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>The product color is a true black.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to apply and it provides a solid black line.</li>
            <li>use the eyeliner, and then the excess is light enough that it makes my eyebrows appear natural instead of too dark.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not very stiff</li>
            <li>The downside is that it dries very fast even when is properly closed</li>
            <li>Just make sure you barely get anything on the brush, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>This works VERY well and lasts really long.</li>
            <li>They are so cheap, their makeup usually hold up to the roughest of days.</li>
            <li>impressed!&lt;br /&gt;It washes off easily with face wash, no extra eye makeup remover needed.&lt;br /&gt;The applicator makes it easy to make thick or thin lines and as long as you keep it clean</li>
            <li>Once it&#x27;s dry and set it does very well  .</li>
            <li>Plus the brush is so fun and makes everyday makeup into an art!&lt;br /&gt;Can smudge a bit, just something to be conscious of every once in a while.</li>
            <li>Also, it dried up relatively quickly and became unusable.</li>
            <li>So between my inability to get it on right and then not able to without messing up my foundation, I just made a huge mess.</li>
            <li>I will more than likely repurchase this; but not in a hurry, cause a little goes a very long way with this eyeliner</li>
            <li>and it hurts a little, but that shouldn&#x27;t dissuade you from trying this product; it happens rarely</li>
            <li>I found it clumpy and hard to smooth on.</li>
            <li>however it comes with a very small brush that can be easily lost in a makeup bag or organizer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of cream eyeliners, usually I buy higher end ones like mac fluidline, or any little pot</li>
            <li>It was also highly pigmented which is a big deal to me, since my skin is dark and I need my liner to be midnight-BLACK in order to really pop.</li>
            <li>As a girl obsessed with makeup and has so much of it, I&#x27;ve tried many different types of eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Now, that is actually a PRO of the product if you are not a makeup professional.</li>
            <li>, I was a bit surprised how tiny it was.</li>
            <li>I have used bare minerals and the too faced  as well as the sephora eyeliners, and it doesn&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li>This product had the potential to wow me</li>
            <li>So far, it seems like low quality.</li>
            <li>I was prepared for a disappointment - after all who can buy a good eyeliner for a dollar</li>
            <li>The pigments are very dark, the color very black, and the effect very matte: the result is an awesome dramatic look that will make your eyes pop!  </li>
            <li>the only thing I dont like is how fast it drys out if you dont use it enough, and the little brush that comes with it falls apart really fast</li>
            <li>, you can always use this first, then go over it with their waterproof eyeliner pen in black, and finish with the liner sealer.</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure I had actually got any on my eye, (I&#x27;m used to the cold feeling from the liquid liner)</li>
            <li>When it rained this past Sunday, my 3 year old wanted to play in the rain and of course I couldn&#x27;t refuse such a fun request.  </li>
            <li>I only wear makeup for costume purposes, so it might be a bit much for everyday if you like a more subtle look.</li>
            <li>if u get what that means...recently i bought another from a store near by my house and got a bigger one than this for only 99 cents</li>
            <li>Will order this product and possibly from this seller in the near future (if they have it in stock).</li>
            <li>So far I found only the liquid liners last but are a bit tricky to use.</li>
            <li>(and I&#x27;ve heard less than stellar reviews of the one that people got with it), so it&#x27;s no big deal.</li>
            <li>I was really not looking forward to buying this because i had no previous experience in applying gel eyeliner, but this really surprised me.</li>
            <li>To get eyeliner to stay on my waterline, i first dried my water line with a cotton swab.</li>
            <li>usually just use this when having fun with makeup...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cute little pot of color and should be enough in there to last a few months since I don&#x27;t wear makeup everday.</li>
            <li>Putting it on wasn&#x27;t too difficult, the brush seems decent and it went on smoothly.</li>
            <li>but seriously, its worth it!</li>
            <li>was a little apprehensive about trying a cream eyeliner but the price was such that I was willing to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Seems to me that with the packaging, it was set up to dry early on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much too short, so I&#x27;ve now resorted to using the eyeliner brush from a previously purchased brush set.</li>
            <li>The brush that comes with it is basically useless, it&#x27;s very cheap</li>
            <li>I live in New England and this past week we&#x27;ve had snow, humidity, rain and my make up</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll just need to keep the applicator brush clean and flat to maintain a sharp line - it tends to get gunky after a few uses.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Very good</li>
            <li> This cream eyeliner was very good for the price.</li>
            <li> I use the brush that came with it for my lower lid as it is not the best of brushes but does a great job of blending on the lower lids.  </li>
            <li> Good amount of product though, so I can&#x27;t complain!</li>
            <li> and im good!</li>
            <li> this works so good!</li>
            <li> The colors perfect and the idea for it to be more of a cream is perfect.</li>
            <li> It is a great price</li>
            <li> But for the price it&#x27;s a great cream eyeliner</li>
            <li> this eyeliner is great.  </li>
            <li> and it works great.  </li>
            <li> This is a great eyeliner.</li>
            <li> product is a win.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t smudge or fade, It was still looking great.</li>
            <li> However, the applicator that it comes with is not that great.  </li>
            <li> Lol.</li>
            <li> the brush that it comes with is great.</li>
            <li> , however it is great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had great results with E.l.f. products and settled on the Studio Cream Eyeliner in black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i would recommended it to all my friends because its just a great product.</li>
            <li> This liner is great for those not intimidated by brush liquid liners.  </li>
            <li> Lol.</li>
            <li> I think the product was great for the price.</li>
            <li> its amazing!</li>
            <li> the brush is amazing!</li>
            <li> stuff is amazing!  </li>
            <li> I am very happy I bought it and plan to order more.</li>
            <li> excellent, will buy another when this one is done, for sure.</li>
            <li> Good service and great experience</li>
            <li> If you goof, keep some q-tips handy with make-up remover, and you&#x27;ll be good to go!</li>
            <li> its a great purchase, makes it a lot easier to eyeline your eyes, I used liquid and pen liners, but this is way better!</li>
            <li> The brush it comes with serves its purpose and is of good quality.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is good to the fact that it does not bead up like ELF&#x27;s liquid</li>
            <li> The brush gives good control.</li>
            <li> I loved it.</li>
            <li> It is good quality and affordable.</li>
            <li> Ordering the colors online is a good idea</li>
            <li> But now i get use to,and its good</li>
            <li> but apart from this everything is good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say this is was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen good Youtube reviews but....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a seriously good combo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never tried a cream eyeliner before, but I&#x27;d read good things about them and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> So I put a good amount of gel on the brush, spread it out</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product coming from elf</li>
            <li> Is perfect ;) not waterproof!!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> However, I was able to use the brush from a rival product and had great results.</li>
            <li> very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I really love this product,though!</li>
            <li> so I decided I would give it a shot, and I am so glad I did!</li>
            <li> This is also better because you don&#x27;t have to pay $20 for quality eyeliner!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> I love the color, the finish!</li>
            <li> Love this eyeliner!</li>
            <li> I love it !</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> but I like this better!</li>
            <li> and this product is great for the price, but it smears easily.</li>
            <li> It has great color, stays on ALL day, is waterproof, and relatively cheap.</li>
            <li> The product has AMAZING quality.</li>
            <li> your own eyeliner brush.</li>
            <li> and I use my own)</li>
            <li> i have my own brush</li>
            <li> but this applies nicely.</li>
            <li> The mini brush that comes with it is surprisingly good too (again, better than some I&#x27;ve bought on their own).</li>
            <li> I purchased this and liked it okay, but my roommate loved it</li>
            <li> I just used my own instead.</li>
            <li> Nothing spectacular about it</li>
            <li> I prefer it over the Maybelline Eye studio gel eyeliner honestly.</li>
            <li> that was my own fault for not bothering to look at the size and just went for the cheapest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> I made my own</li>
            <li> but I used my bent brush from bdellium since I am not that adept at eye liner to begin with.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed by this eyeliner, its goes on super smooth, stays on for awhile too.</li>
            <li> but it is very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> i Tried many liners and i like this one the Most!</li>
            <li> This is by far the BEST eyeliner I have used!</li>
            <li> range of colors it comes in is nice too, although I wish there was more selection.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i absolutly love this eyeliner goes on perfect and is very pigmented and stays put almost all day just love it</li>
            <li> i love it because it applies so nicely.</li>
            <li> It was so soft and perfect.</li>
            <li> but after reading the reviews I decided what do I have to lose, and wow I&#x27;m impressed with this one, I always wear a cat eye, this cream liner helps me achieve that in one swipe, I don&#x27;thave</li>
            <li> it was so easy and smooth to apply and looked great.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to apply &amp; it lasts all day!</li>
            <li> So easy to apply!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best eyeliner, you can use or on top or bottom on your water lines or even just you lash lines.</li>
            <li> It is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> very smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super creamy and glides on very easily!</li>
            <li> The Cream eyeliner was so easy to apply with the handy brush that came in with it.</li>
            <li> it goes on smoothly, the brush is perfect and easy to control and get a straight line.  </li>
            <li> but the quality isn&#x27;t really that great.  </li>
            <li> E.l.f. makes a fantastic cream eyeliner!</li>
            <li> Oh i&#x27;m 17 btw &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> If you are just starting out learning how to do the cateye on your self this product is perfect.</li>

            <li> I am in love with it</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I actually have to use a makeup remover pen because it seems waterproof, which is GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> and so I was looking for a liquid liner (I used to love the Maybelline waterproof liquid liner)</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner...</li>
            <li> It is SO much better than a pen or pencil</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>

            <li> and i love this eye liner.  </li>
            <li> Personally, I am satisfied with this one.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner,I use their eyeliner brush instead of the one it comes with.  </li>
            <li> I fall in love with 75 percent of my purchases and with their prices</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> Make sure you cover the cream eyeliner after you use it.</li>
            <li> i freaken love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t used it more than a handful amount of times.</li>
            <li> I love the E.L.F. cream eyeliners but I don&#x27;t understand why they are $8.50 on Amazon when they are $3 in stores and on the E.L.F. site??</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok, use better than this.</li>
            <li> just be sure to wipe the excess off on the edge of the pot.</li>

            <li> I am extremely satisfied.</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s been my favorite company</li>
            <li> I love non pencil eyeliners but liquid eyeliners can be a hassle.</li>

            <li> I love this eye make-up.</li>
            <li> Nice smooth easy application.</li>
            <li> You do need a good liner applicator to put it on right because it is easy to over do it with this product because it&#x27;s so creamy and a lot can stick to the applicator.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it stays on and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> luckily I had my own to use.</li>
            <li> anyone who love bold eyeliner would love this.</li>
            <li> What I quickly realized is that you have to have the angle brush at the right angle on your lid for the gel to look good on your lid.</li>
            <li> other than that it works wonderful.</li>
            <li> The liner goes on easy and if you don&#x27;t touch it, it stays.</li>
            <li> For a cream eyeliner this is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> So easy to apply, no tugging or pulling.</li>
            <li> The reason is because it dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> Eyeliner was easy to used.</li>
            <li> The shipping was very quick as well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to create a wing-tip look with this and the eyeliner stays on all day but removes easily at night.  </li>
            <li> I found it easy to use.</li>
            <li> It came in the mail VERY quickly.</li>
            <li> It does not run, it&#x27;s easy to apply,</li>
            <li> come off easy at night.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was my first cream eyeliner product I&#x27;ve bought and it works nice.</li>
            <li> I liked it at first</li>
            <li> The color was rich and smooth and the pigment lasted for many hours.</li>
            <li> The brush technique makes it easy to apply and it&#x27;s the perfect shade of black.</li>
            <li> At the beginning it was fine.</li>
            <li> it gets the job done just fine for me.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t smear or rub off too easy.  </li>
            <li> It arrived in the mail quickly and packaged safely surrounded and swaddled in bubble wrap and in it&#x27;s packaging.</li>
            <li> Came to me quick!</li>
            <li> If its your first time buying a cream liner go for this one price is right!!!</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of elf products.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner works so well and makes my eyes look huge.</li>
            <li> I bought this one in Target for $3, thinking it&#x27;s cheap enough to try and got great reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Its cheap but works as if it was millions.</li>
            <li> but there are always coupons available through ELF if you look.  </li>
            <li> Lightly powder your lids (or use an eyelid primer) and then use your shadows.</li>
            <li> It goes on fairly bright but within a hour or so, it almost completely wears off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clean and easy to use (trust me</li>
            <li> Amazing colour and very creamy.</li>
            <li> it comes with makes my lines precise and evenly applied.</li>
            <li> I tried ALMAY oil free eye makeup remover and it did not come off.</li>
            <li> fifty???&lt;br /&gt;This cream eyeliner is a dream - goes on smoothly and stays on all day.  </li>
            <li> perfect for everyday use.</li>
            <li> It goes on really smooth and</li>
            <li> Overall great product.</li>
            <li> But because I was Cleopatra for Halloween I needed a cheap eye-liner.</li>
            <li> and it glides on so smooth.  </li>
            <li> and it went on smoothly.</li>
            <li> It went on smoothly and precisely, without a hitch, no stray marks or globs.  </li>
            <li> First, let me start by saying that I normally do not review anything I buy, but I was just really impressed with this</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is creamy, smooth, very very easy to use ... and I love that it&#x27;s smudge-proof, but if you need to remove it, it luckily comes off easily with your most basic makeup removers.</li>
            <li> However, When applied with other products, the staying power on the waterline is incredible.</li>
            <li> This is actually a decent cream eyeliner, and at an amazing price.</li>
            <li> Doing a wing liner is super easy with the brush it comes with.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented, &amp; very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> For only $3 (at Target), it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Amazon should be more aware of fraudulent sellers and do something to prevent it.</li>
            <li> It comes with a small eyeliner brush that applies the eyeliner great!</li>
            <li> But its ok for me ;)</li>
            <li> first time I used it, I fell in love.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s pretty challenging keeping any liner on me.</li>
            <li> AMAZING price, brand new as stated.</li>
            <li> The amount of product in the cute container is pretty good - especially for the bargain price.</li>
            <li> I love this E.l.f studio liner it goes on smooth, dark and makes a great cat eye, very intense</li>
            <li> When I first received this eyeliner I was really excited!</li>
            <li> and she had bought a new one of the same kind, and I used it and LOVED it.</li>
            <li> and it wiped right off!</li>
            <li> and I was right!  </li>
            <li> I like my eyeliner to be pretty precise, and I can&#x27;t quite get that fine \\&quot;wing\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I do recommend there professional eyeliner brush, it is much better than the plastic brush provided and dip in water when applying for a clean sleek finish!</li>
            <li> and WOW this is some amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d call it kind of a hybrid between using a soft pencil and liquid liner.</li>
            <li> It is a good product overall</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a phenomenal product and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really like the cream texture and it is smooth which makes it easy to apply.</li>
            <li> After sliding off the excess onto the rim of the jar I started with my top lid and was sooooo surprised how easy it went on.</li>
            <li> As good or better product than many more expensive ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> it worked fine at first</li>
            <li> Forgiving if you make a mistake - just wipe off quickly.</li>
            <li> but if you want something more shapely or a cat eye look a different brush might be better.</li>
            <li> , that makes me super</li>
            <li> Y SUPER ACORDE CON EL TAMA&amp;Ntilde;O  </li>
            <li> When I went to put it on I dipped the brush and it quickly became covered in the cream.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re SUPER worried</li>
            <li> It mucks up your brush really quick.  </li>
            <li> Gives a nice smooth line without that gross \\&quot;chola\\</li>
            <li> The order came quick</li>
            <li> Iam greatly pleased with this product and considering buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> For being a cheap product it did exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> I always love to try new types of liners.</li>
            <li> It was easy to control (my hands are really jittery) and it had staying power - even when used without a primer.</li>
            <li> Overall its a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> I REALLY like this eyeliner!!</li>
            <li> to go back and double up over the first line, that impressed me for the price, to me</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I totally recommend it to anyone who is new to makeup.</li>
            <li> The little brush that comes with it works great.</li>
            <li> so i prefer to buy this one for 3 dollars that the old one for 20!!!!!</li>
            <li> Plus, I don&#x27;t think anyone can really complain about this makeup when it&#x27;s just so darn cheap.  </li>
            <li> Well, it goes on really nicely, smooth, intense color.</li>
            <li> Not to mention as with all E.L.F. products, the price is perfect and the quality is above expected.</li>
            <li> and I am able to complete a look on one eye without having to re-dip the brush into the container.  </li>
            <li> I rarely use make-up let alone eye-liner.</li>
            <li> bottom line is if your looking for an inexpensive cream liner you found it but your much better off paying a little bit more for a richly pigmented liner.</li>
            <li> You just need to get the right amount of cream on the brush.</li>
            <li> If you dont get the cover just right...</li>
            <li> The first few weeks it worked great-</li>
            <li> ELF&#x27;s cream eyeliner is a great soft formula, easy to apply and not too messy.</li>
            <li> I liked it the first couple weeks, then it started getting gross.</li>
            <li> this is way better than maybellines,which alot of people love, not me that formula was way to dry on my eyes and tugged to much, this liner goes on creamy and stays put</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply especially with the brush that it came with, stays on no smudge or running..</li>
            <li> I used Soft Soap to clean the brush!</li>
            <li> It works best when applied with another product over it, such as  a black eyeliner or pencil.  </li>
            <li> First, the jars never close flush, since they&#x27;re square the top is never aligned properly with the bottom when tightened.&lt;br /&gt;Second, and more importantly, the jars dont seal properly.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, if you use eye-liner regularily I would suggest spending just a little more for better quality.</li>
            <li> It is a great product, just as good as any of the more expensive brands, for half the price.</li>
            <li> Other than that I am VERY pleased.</li>
            <li> very fast shipping...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely waterproof to some extent and goes on very smoothly.</li>
            <li> The black is a true black, the texture is soft and easy to apply and best of all the color does not run or fade!  </li>
            <li> This is the first time i am using a cream eyeliner and to my surprise</li>
            <li> was exactly as described ....</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smudge and goes EXACTLY wear</li>
            <li> I use an eyeliner brush that came with another product, that has a longer handle, but otherwise, I love these products and use them daily.</li>
            <li> Overall its ok.</li>
            <li> actually use this more to fill in my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I first purchased this eyeliner</li>
            <li> The item was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> first I had given this eyeliner 5 stars, but I had to change it to  3 stars.</li>
            <li> When i first receive the product.</li>
            <li> The eyeliner quality is great and long lasting</li>
            <li> I would most likely recommended this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always swore by e.l.f. makeup since I first started wearing makeup</li>
            <li> e.l.f Cream Eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking to get the crisp, defined line look, and this product let me get that while pencil eyeliners didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> But I said why not ill try this out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be buying more, and trying out the different colors too!</li>
            <li> This is said to be a good alternative for the MAC cream eyeliner - I am glad I purchased this and didn&#x27;t waste the extra money on MAC.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I used this brand.</li>
            <li> Overall I love the product, I just have to continue practicing the applying technique.</li>
            <li> It stays on all day, it glides on so easily without pulling or tugging on the eye skin it doesn&#x27;t run, come off or smear all day, well it smeared just a tiny, tiny bit to my upper lid but not to the point where it would annoy the heck out of me Lol, not like the way liquid eyeliner would.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I usually love E.L.F products, they seamlessly blend with my high end cosmetics for a fraction of the cost, but this cream eyeliner really missed the mark.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The consistency of the gel was also very good, not too hard and not too soft.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a really good eyeliner that is a lot easier to apply than many others I have had in the past.</li>
            <li> After I got home in the evening my eyes still looked so fresh and vibrant</li>
            <li> I originally bought this to see if I liked cream eye liner in general and planned to buy a more expensive and/or bigger brand name product if I liked it.  </li>
            <li> It faded in the shower but didn&#x27;t completely come off( speaks highly of the waterproofness), but it easily came off with an eye make-up remover I got at the body</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been looking for a cake eyeliner for awhile, so was glad to stumble on this product.</li>
            <li> I put it on, it looked nice and dark, but</li>
            <li> The only thing I would recommend is not opening your eye until it dries and if your doing a very perfect line, you may want to use a different brush other than the one it came with.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it does smudge a little, but for the price I love it!</li>
            <li> : lasts all day nice jet black.</li>
            <li> I like the ELF gel eyeliner better than any gel eyeliner I have ever used because it does dry after you put it on so it wont smudge or crease during the day</li>
            <li> Until you&#x27;re ready to remove, it pretty much stays put.</li>
            <li> The brush that this comes with is useful for a quick, basic application</li>
            <li> I would suggest the brown color for us older ladies!  </li>
            <li> urge you to at least try this product I love it and will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li> my expectations for this product was pretty high.</li>
            <li> I wanted a highly pigmented product to line my eyes with that I could apply with an angled brush, and this is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re unsure of how good it is because it&#x27;s cheap, just spring for it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> highly recommend!</li>
            <li> it is much easier to apply than a liquid one...</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend them all!</li>
            <li> I am very picky with my make up and</li>
            <li> The brush is really crappy and you have to wash it after every use so it doesnt harden and clump</li>
            <li> but I bought this one because it was very inexpensive</li>
            <li> This formula is very creamy.</li>
            <li> I am really</li>
            <li> The whole day it felt like I didn&#x27;t have any eyeliner on.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t smudge like pencil liner, it&#x27;s much easier to apply than liquid.</li>
            <li> it is waterproof and it really won&#x27;t smudge off at all, I use coconut oil to remove it.</li>
            <li> Much better quality than I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> but I think if I didn&#x27;t, it might not have as much staying power as others.</li>
            <li> The brush holds so much product</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine why anyone spends so much money for</li>
            <li> so much easier to do the pin up wing with it then a pencil or liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup much, but when I do, I like</li>
            <li> The brush is angled and works very well if you like the winged eyeliner look.</li>
            <li> It really does work.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it to much</li>
            <li> With the angled brush it was really</li>
            <li> Really unsmudgable.</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> I can get my hands on in sephora, let me just say I didn&#x27;t expect much from a 3$eyeliner</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> The price and quality are unbeatable and I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> This stuff is ok you can make it thicker or thin but make sure you use primer and press into your lid to prevent smudging</li>
            <li> The container it comes in cute and simple and looks classy.  </li>
            <li> Worth spending a few more dollars and get something that works.</li>
            <li> Applies easily and the little brush it comes with is actually not bad either.</li>
            <li> It looks amazing and it is great for everyday and dramatic looks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However it is very matte, and after mixing the eyeliner it goes back to its original texture.</li>
            <li> so if you will be using this daily might want to reconsider but other than it good quality.</li>
            <li> The little brush that comes with the eyeliner makes precision lines and you can get a super fine line or use a heavier hand for a thicker look.  </li>
            <li> Super tiny, but you really don&#x27;t need much to get the job done.</li>
            <li> I am a usual fan of gel liners and this is my first cream and so far I love it!</li>
            <li> I then applied a generic pencil liner, then put Elf gel cream eyeliner on top of it, and on top of the Elf gel cream eyeliner, I dipped a small pointed eyeliner brush into black (or whatever color you choose) into eyeshadow and applied it on top.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is very watery and translucent, i have to put on many coats for the eyeliner to appear black.</li>
            <li> I use a small angled brush to apply and my eyes looked amazing.</li>
            <li> It is creamy enough to go on easily, but dry enough to not smudge during application (and the brush it comes with is way better than the one that comes with the maybelline studio liner).</li>
            <li> Regular soap and water DID NOT clean the brush, but the Soft Soap cleaned it quickly and nicely.</li>
            <li> better when set with matte black eyeshadow</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this particular trial and error experience.</li>
            <li> Ok so I can be informative: You can get this product at Target for only $3 as their regular price.</li>
            <li> It comes with a decent slanted eyeliner brush</li>
            <li> At first I was happy but then after after few months it dried out and shrunk.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s creamy, the colour is true black, the brush is useful and does the job - the packaging isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;bad on the eye&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I use a high end lip brush for a cat eye look.</li>
            <li> If you have never used a gel formula before you may want to try this out before buying a high end formula.</li>
            <li> The prices are so reasonable, especially from their own website or Target, and the performance is up to par with the much more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> The price and quality are unbeatable and I highly recommend this!ity product.  </li>
            <li> I got this product and eventhough it is very very small the quality is great and it last for longgg time.</li>
            <li> You have to warm the pot in your hand a little before using it or it will get really clumped up on the tiny, unhelpful brush that comes with the eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I appreciate that the liner is waterproof, but I wasn&#x27;t happy with how difficult it was to wash off.</li>
            <li> It is able to be applied lightly or heavy depending on the look you&#x27;re aiming for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its sort of a waste to never be able to use %90 of product in the jar.</li>
            <li> Best buy in a long time - sorry</li>
            <li> For the price I can live with that though.</li>
            <li> Customarily I would not use cream eyeliner, but I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of experimenting with new products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I came across this product while searching for a new liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I wanted to try some new eyeliner</li>
            <li> if you are one of those people who want their eyeliner to last all day without smuge or having to re apply every few hours, this product is amazing.</li>
            <li> Unlike the more expensive Tart gel eyeliner available at Sephora, it is NOT waterproof or smudgeproof.</li>
            <li> The pigment is very concentrated and it lasts throughout the entire day w/out much fading.  </li>
            <li> it could have been better didn&#x27;t expect it the brush o be so small.</li>
            <li> This smudges with urban decay primer potion on within the first hour.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I say that as a professional make-up artist!</li>
            <li> I think this is a rip off only because I bought this exact thing eyeslipsface.com for $3.00...</li>
            <li> At first I was really skeptical about buying this because it was my first eye cream liner I love that it comes with a brush I use it also.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply, using the little brush that came with it.</li>
            <li> It stays on all day for me and the little brush that comes with it makes for easy application.</li>
            <li> I just dab a little coconut oil onto my eyes and it wipes away easily with that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this is a great buy: only $3 for a dark, black, matte creme eyeliner with all-day staying power and intensity to make your eyes pop.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner glides on smooth and makes a very sharp line.</li>
            <li> I found that this gel liner dried out very quickly.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m now back on the hunt for a new eyeliner, one that really does have staying power.</li>
            <li> On me, it does start to smudge and run a little after a few hours, but I admit that could be because my eye primer doesn&#x27;t have good staying power.</li>
            <li> , I purchased it directly from the companies site and it isn&#x27;t pictured on there.</li>
            <li> Because i forgot that this its not so resistant like the old one that I used to buy.</li>
            <li> Just like a professional type of cream liner.</li>
            <li> Whether you use the brush that comes with it or a professional one, this product starts to get clumpy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has the control of liquid liner but the creamy fullness of a soft pencil</li>
            <li> I was soaked after splashing around with him and pleasantly surprised when I glanced in the mirror and saw it was still intact.  </li>
            <li> The only to problem i had with the product, the brush get  old quick and the cream dry out.</li>
            <li> It comes with a small angled brush and is so easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> The product color is a true black.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to apply and it provides a solid black line.</li>
            <li> use the eyeliner, and then the excess is light enough that it makes my eyebrows appear natural instead of too dark.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not very stiff</li>
            <li> The downside is that it dries very fast even when is properly closed</li>
            <li> Just make sure you barely get anything on the brush, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This works VERY well and lasts really long.</li>
            <li> They are so cheap, their makeup usually hold up to the roughest of days.</li>
            <li> impressed!&lt;br /&gt;It washes off easily with face wash, no extra eye makeup remover needed.&lt;br /&gt;The applicator makes it easy to make thick or thin lines and as long as you keep it clean</li>
            <li> Once it&#x27;s dry and set it does very well  .</li>
            <li> Plus the brush is so fun and makes everyday makeup into an art!&lt;br /&gt;Can smudge a bit, just something to be conscious of every once in a while.</li>
            <li> Also, it dried up relatively quickly and became unusable.</li>
            <li> So between my inability to get it on right and then not able to without messing up my foundation, I just made a huge mess.</li>
            <li> I will more than likely repurchase this; but not in a hurry, cause a little goes a very long way with this eyeliner</li>
            <li> and it hurts a little, but that shouldn&#x27;t dissuade you from trying this product; it happens rarely</li>
            <li> I found it clumpy and hard to smooth on.</li>
            <li> however it comes with a very small brush that can be easily lost in a makeup bag or organizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of cream eyeliners, usually I buy higher end ones like mac fluidline, or any little pot</li>
            <li> It was also highly pigmented which is a big deal to me, since my skin is dark and I need my liner to be midnight-BLACK in order to really pop.</li>
            <li> As a girl obsessed with makeup and has so much of it, I&#x27;ve tried many different types of eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Now, that is actually a PRO of the product if you are not a makeup professional.</li>
            <li> , I was a bit surprised how tiny it was.</li>
            <li> I have used bare minerals and the too faced  as well as the sephora eyeliners, and it doesn&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> This product had the potential to wow me</li>
            <li> So far, it seems like low quality.</li>
            <li> I was prepared for a disappointment - after all who can buy a good eyeliner for a dollar</li>
            <li> The pigments are very dark, the color very black, and the effect very matte: the result is an awesome dramatic look that will make your eyes pop!  </li>
            <li> the only thing I dont like is how fast it drys out if you dont use it enough, and the little brush that comes with it falls apart really fast</li>
            <li> , you can always use this first, then go over it with their waterproof eyeliner pen in black, and finish with the liner sealer.</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure I had actually got any on my eye, (I&#x27;m used to the cold feeling from the liquid liner)</li>
            <li> When it rained this past Sunday, my 3 year old wanted to play in the rain and of course I couldn&#x27;t refuse such a fun request.  </li>
            <li> I only wear makeup for costume purposes, so it might be a bit much for everyday if you like a more subtle look.</li>
            <li> if u get what that means...recently i bought another from a store near by my house and got a bigger one than this for only 99 cents</li>
            <li> Will order this product and possibly from this seller in the near future (if they have it in stock).</li>
            <li> So far I found only the liquid liners last but are a bit tricky to use.</li>
            <li> (and I&#x27;ve heard less than stellar reviews of the one that people got with it), so it&#x27;s no big deal.</li>
            <li> I was really not looking forward to buying this because i had no previous experience in applying gel eyeliner, but this really surprised me.</li>
            <li> To get eyeliner to stay on my waterline, i first dried my water line with a cotton swab.</li>
            <li> usually just use this when having fun with makeup...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cute little pot of color and should be enough in there to last a few months since I don&#x27;t wear makeup everday.</li>
            <li> Putting it on wasn&#x27;t too difficult, the brush seems decent and it went on smoothly.</li>
            <li> but seriously, its worth it!</li>
            <li> was a little apprehensive about trying a cream eyeliner but the price was such that I was willing to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Seems to me that with the packaging, it was set up to dry early on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much too short, so I&#x27;ve now resorted to using the eyeliner brush from a previously purchased brush set.</li>
            <li> The brush that comes with it is basically useless, it&#x27;s very cheap</li>
            <li> I live in New England and this past week we&#x27;ve had snow, humidity, rain and my make up</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll just need to keep the applicator brush clean and flat to maintain a sharp line - it tends to get gunky after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and with the right brush you can make lines thin and thick.</li>
            <li> it is not easy off makeup, and water-repellent.i really like this.</li>
            <li> The first day was a mess!!</li>
            <li> However, the reason I rated this eyeliner 4 out of 5 stars is because it does smudge occasionally throughout the day, but if you set it with eyeshadow it does last all day long .</li>
            <li> The brush kinda suck and is only about 2 to 3 inches long</li>
            <li> and it is not that long lasting...</li>
            <li> It does last long and doesn&#x27;t crumble or flake off when wearing it so that&#x27;s a plus.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend to any women who likes eyeliner that last for a long time and the make up does not smear.</li>
            <li> Does not last very long at all, would NOT recommend.</li>
            <li> only con is that it began to dry out before I finished all of the product but for the price</li>
            <li> But then after using it the next time, the surface will dry up.</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t use dark eyeliner on my waterline, I bought this specifically for my upper lash line to create a cat eye and possibly for my lower lash line.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m no professional make up artist:</li>
            <li> You use a minimal amount of the product during application so this should last probably</li>
            <li> and how long it lasts, this eyeliner cannot be beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t smudge and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The cream is thick and when you dip the brush in it it gets chunky fast.</li>
            <li> My previous had to be scrapped due to a pink-eye contamination and I was in need of new eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Of note, as other reviewers mentioned, it is a little difficult to remove without some kind of oil product.</li>
            <li> ( I love the less exaggerated version of a cat eye) and it has not smudged even once.</li>
            <li> My only downside is it&#x27;s so small, but that is probably because a large container would dry out and waste everything.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and makes a very thin line if you are careful.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ve gone this long without it!</li>
            <li> but I got it somewhat dry</li>
            <li> resistant when dry</li>
            <li> on the eyelid until dry</li>
            <li> Studio Cream Eyeliner (elf) came in absolutely dry pieces.</li>
            <li> I have tried a couple different brands when this wasn&#x27;t in stock at my local store; what a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> It has happened to every single one of the 8 ELF cream eyeliners I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> I like this eyeliner because no eyeliner is dark enough when you are doing a smokey eye.</li>
            <li> This will definitely be a repeat buy, although this small container will probably last me a long time.  </li>
            <li> This will definitely be a repeat buy, although this small container will probably last me a long time.  </li>
            <li> If you buy this you will never want to go back to the other liners!</li>
            <li> If you need a temporary not high quality eyeliner, this will do.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll find it falling into your lashes and later in the day it&#x27;ll be a black smudge somewhere on your cheek.</li>
            <li> My eye&#x27;s are all red and there is still black eyeliner streaks.</li>
            <li> After an hour or maybe less this liner was all over my upper lid.</li>
            <li> I just tryed out the Elf cream eyeliner in black last week.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical when I was applying it with the angle brush that it came with because if I put too much liner on the brush it would smear thickly on my lid and there would be some spots that didn&#x27;t have liner at all,</li>
            <li> was a little skeptical about  cream eyeliner because the one that I used previously would smudge onto the top of my lid after a couple of hours</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this here and get it for $5+ more, unless you&#x27;re desperately in need of [black] cream eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This does tend to dry out after a while, a few weeks I&#x27;d say, but adding a tiny drop of oil will do the trick.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve only been using this for a little over a month.</li>
            <li> when I would put a little bit on it would not be enough on my lid...</li>
            <li> so I only got to use this twice before it dried out</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay creamy or wet on your eye</li>
            <li> I have three swatches that have been through a day at the library, a few hours at work and multiple hand washings.</li>
            <li> I have never used gel eyeliner before, so I was curious to see what it was like.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> -- A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little still goes a long</li>
            <li> but then again a little goes a long way...</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> The only downfall was that the packaging was a little crushed when I received it which caused the brush bristles to be a little bent, but nothing a wash can&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li> It last me all day, I work 12hrs and usually eyeliner</li>
            <li> /&gt;Regardless, I removed 2 stars due to packaging jar for 2 reasons.</li>
            <li> Darker than any other eye liner I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> hadn&#x27;t expected it to be soooo creamy!</li>
            <li> like I&#x27;ve had with other cream eyeliners, it dries and it stays in place.  </li>
            <li> I did buy a different brush, the one in the set was too small for me.</li>
            <li> The container is small and plastic instead of glass, which is a plus, especially for travelling.  </li>
            <li> It lasts for a LONG time, it goes on VERY black (matte with no shine)</li>
            <li> Everyone who is saying it is hard to apply simply does not know how to apply make up.  </li>
            <li> (I have dark brown/black eyebrows naturally)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought that if I didn&#x27;t like it then at least it only cost me a couple of bucks.  </li>
            <li> People should not be confusing price with quality, especially when it comes to this product.</li>
            <li> Ladies, it DOES go on quite dark, but if you smudge it with a q-tip while it is still moist you can soften the look quite well.  </li>
            <li> You cant go wrong, and it lasted very well.</li>
            <li> When it was delivered I thought that it was small, but it has lasted me months of everyday use, and still has quite a bit left.</li>
            <li> Eventually (usually sooner rather than later) the eyeliner begins to dry up, turning into a hard ball.</li>
            <li> and this cream eyeliner is not very cheap.</li>
            <li> It is really thick and dry you will need to wet your brush every time you use it.  </li>
            <li> I have a big problem with my eyes, usually eyeliners make my eyes water and get irritated, but this one did not!</li>
            <li> they dont have other colors - would have bought them all!</li>
            <li> Also, if you wanted it a dark black, you have to go over it twice, maybe three times.</li>
            <li> It takes a very small amount of product to line both upper lids.  </li>
            <li> While the colors can be harder to find, the Black and brown are very common and are only about 2 or 3 dollars in stores like target or kmart.</li>
            <li> and I wanted to try out a black one.</li>
            <li> 10 x&#x27;s longer than the typical stick</li>
            <li> you can use as much as you want and make it as thick or thin as you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> if you want black gel eyeliner</li>
            <li> Studio Cream Eyeliner (Black) elf]]</li>
            <li> Just slightly dab the brush into the cream and apply.</li>
            <li> previously rated this item a 4 star</li>
            <li> but the price is a rip off for black and brown.</li>
            <li> it looks as if i have a black eye...</li>
            <li> Studio Cream Eyeliner (Black)</li>
            <li> I was about to buy the expensive high end version of this product from MAC.</li>
            <li> But after a few months it is dry and the ink is very little.</li>
            <li> so I made a mess of my eyes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is hard to remove as well when dry.</li>
            <li> Little bits at a time</li>
            <li> The lines are still there, a little bit duller (but I also washed my hands a few times today) but they are still there.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ve used this product as a background colour when I&#x27;m trying to achieve very dark smokey eyes</li>
            <li> It either made my lines way too dark, like Cleopatra, or faint and barely there.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> ( I used primary base too)</li>
            <li> but it dried out, even with the lid covering it, maybeline never did, I don&#x27;t wear makeup often</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it quite a few times and it always ends up smudged all over.</li>
            <li> but I set mine with eye shadow but don&#x27;t waste your money here.</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to make the lining so thick it smears.</li>
            <li> and it hadn&#x27;t dried out yet,</li>
            <li> I am not a huge fan of the E.L.F. brand.  </li>
            <li> And the color is very black.</li>
            <li> Just like one other reviewer said, if you mess it up, it is very hard to get off.</li>
            <li> This stuff hardly moves when you set it with black eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> My lids are a little oily,  but the gel does stay on!</li>
            <li> : Smudges if tampered with, hard to remove, and messy.</li>
            <li> My recommendation is to buy an eyeliner angled brush because this one that it coems with is very small and not very easy to work</li>
            <li> I usually use an eggplant color</li>
            <li> it comes with a small brush(which</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; I have is that it&#x27;s difficult to get off at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;10/10 would recommend.</li>
            <li> and the size is really small</li>
            <li> The brush is small and I lost it within a week .</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it is hard to get off of your skin with just water.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;ve never used a cream eyeliner; but this was everything I was imagining it would be.</li>
            <li> I also have to brush my eyeliner brush immediately after I apply eyeliner because it makes my brush icky and</li>
            <li> I have a cheaper brand cream liner and it sucks.</li>
            <li> i always at least wear this even if i dont wear anything else.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never had a complaint about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not nice and creamy like sephora brand.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I received an outdated product or not, but mine was dry and difficult to use.</li>
            <li> the only disappointment was the size when it came in the mail this product is very small although it lasts about a month.</li>
            <li> what i mean by that is that after applying this and i go out to run an errand</li>
            <li> Having deep set eyes makes using liner very difficult.</li>
            <li> The Elf cream eyeliner comes in a very small container.</li>
            <li> im serious.</li>
            <li> i was never good at using liquid liners and the brush</li>
            <li> I used a professional brush though, the brush it comes with is crap</li>
            <li> One complaint that I have is that the liner is soooo hard to wash off!!</li>
            <li> but I find it very hard to apply.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all.</li>
            <li> This one is useless (at least to me)&lt;br /&gt;-Buy</li>
            <li> I hate to knock this product as everyone else had such glowing reviews.</li>
            <li> I also use it over the lash line to help camouflage the line of false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> After 2, or 3 months it was all dried, too sad!</li>
            <li> Though I admit when I opened it I was a little disappointed it was so</li>
            <li> and I use this at least 4 - 5 times a week!!</li>
            <li> The brush that comes with it is terrible, you have to buy a different brush to use.</li>
            <li> I do not wear eyeliner daily because I&#x27;m horrible at applying it.</li>
            <li> And was not impressed with the brush.</li>
            <li> but I tried different brushes because the one it comes with is awful.</li>
            <li> is it is difficult to remove the eyeliner with water or face wash or anything else</li>
            <li> It affords you a very dramatic look.</li>
            <li> After being out of practice, doing any sort of wing on my eyeliner was very difficult for me.  </li>
            <li> It is impossible to touch up makeup during the day.  </li>
            <li> Will not buy again, highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have used it three times and now it is worthless.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after learning that it was not tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;However, I was very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> At the beginning it was fine. But after a few months it is dry and the ink is very little. I have used it three times and now it is worthless.</li>
            <li> I always love to try new types of liners. Having deep set eyes makes using liner very difficult. This stuff is ok you can make it thicker or thin but make sure you use primer and press into your lid to prevent smudging</li>
            <li> I tested this product out on my waterline. As a stand alone eyeliner, it does not do the job. However, When applied with other products, the staying power on the waterline is incredible. To get eyeliner to stay on my waterline, i first dried my water line with a cotton swab. I then applied a generic pencil liner, then put Elf gel cream eyeliner on top of it, and on top of the Elf gel cream eyeliner, I dipped a small pointed eyeliner brush into black (or whatever color you choose) into eyeshadow and applied it on top. Doing this made the staying power of my eyeliner about 5 hours before i needed to reapply. The Elf cream eyeliner comes in a very small container. Fortunately, a little bit goes a long way. Unfortunately, it is hard to get off of your skin with just water. For example, if you make a mistake while applying it, you will need makeup remover to fix your mistakes.</li>
            <li> I am not a huge fan of the E.L.F. brand.  It is a great price but the quality isn&#x27;t really that great.  This eyeliner cannot be worn alone or it will smudge and smear, especially on the upper lid when worn all day.  I get a massive crease in the middle of my eyelid.  It works best when applied with another product over it, such as  a black eyeliner or pencil.  I had never tried the cream eyeliner and I think it might just be the concept itself that I don&#x27;t like.  Can&#x27;t beat the price to try it though.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;d give it 5 stars, but there&#x27;s two things I dislike. The brush that comes with it is terrible, you have to buy a different brush to use. Also, if you wanted it a dark black, you have to go over it twice, maybe three times. But for the price it&#x27;s a great cream eyeliner i&#x27;ll definatly use</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is creamy, smooth, very very easy to use ... and I love that it&#x27;s smudge-proof, but if you need to remove it, it luckily comes off easily with your most basic makeup removers. E.l.f. makes a fantastic cream eyeliner!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eyeliner for months and its so awesome! Its cheap but works as if it was millions. but seriously, its worth it! Stays put and doesn&#x27;t smudge. Finally! I&#x27;ve found the perfect eyeliner. Oh i&#x27;m 17 btw &#x3D;] highly recommend!</li>
            <li> As a girl obsessed with makeup and has so much of it, I&#x27;ve tried many different types of eyeliner. Mastering the cat-eye has always been a challenge, this product is perfect. Unlike the more expensive Tart gel eyeliner available at Sephora, it is NOT waterproof or smudgeproof. Now, that is actually a PRO of the product if you are not a makeup professional. If you are just starting out learning how to do the cateye on your self this product is perfect. It allows you to fix any mistakes you may make. The liner goes on easy and if you don&#x27;t touch it, it stays. Not to mention as with all E.L.F. products, the price is perfect and the quality is above expected.</li>
            <li> For a cream eyeliner this is easy to apply. I use this when I am tightlining my eyes and it makes the process a lot easier. However, it does tend to smudge after awhile, and even though I don&#x27;t apply it to my bottom lashes at the end of the day I will find some smudge under there. For the price I can live with that though.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday. I love the brush.</li>
            <li> very fast shipping... This is the first time i am using a cream eyeliner and to my surprise it is much easier to apply than a liquid one...I am in love with it&lt;br /&gt;Item was exactly as described ....I would buy again from this seller.. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I do not wear eyeliner daily because I&#x27;m horrible at applying it. I decided to give this a try since I&#x27;ve never used a cream eyeliner before. I LOVE IT. It simplifies applying an eyeliner to the upper lash line. The brush it comes with serves its purpose and is of good quality. It doesn&#x27;t smudge and goes EXACTLY wear you want it to. Whenever I need to make a correction (because I&#x27;m no pro makeup artist!) I actually have to use a makeup remover pen because it seems waterproof, which is GREAT!!! I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this particular trial and error experience. No errors here!</li>
            <li> First, let me start by saying that I normally do not review anything I buy, but I was just really impressed with this eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;I was a little skeptical about  cream eyeliner because the one that I used previously would smudge onto the top of my lid after a couple of hours and so I was looking for a liquid liner (I used to love the Maybelline waterproof liquid liner) but I decided to give E.l.f. a try. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my buy.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been wearing it for a couple of days now( I love the less exaggerated version of a cat eye) and it has not smudged even once. I live in New England and this past week we&#x27;ve had snow, humidity, rain and my make up has withstood it all. It is creamy enough to go on easily, but dry enough to not smudge during application (and the brush it comes with is way better than the one that comes with the maybelline studio liner). It faded in the shower but didn&#x27;t completely come off( speaks highly of the waterproofness), but it easily came off with an eye make-up remover I got at the body shop.&lt;br /&gt;Buy this! You will not regret it.</li>
            <li> This is overpriced. You can get this cream eye liner on the elf website or at Target for only $3.00!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been looking for a cake eyeliner for awhile, so was glad to stumble on this product. It&#x27;s easy to apply, using the little brush that came with it. The eyeliner stays on all day. On me, it does start to smudge and run a little after a few hours, but I admit that could be because my eye primer doesn&#x27;t have good staying power. It&#x27;s a cute little pot of color and should be enough in there to last a few months since I don&#x27;t wear makeup everday. Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner...it goes on smoothly, the brush is perfect and easy to control and get a straight line.  It is SO much better than a pen or pencil eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My problem is that it only costs only $3 on ELF&#x27;s website.  Yes you have to pay $6.95 for shipping but there are always coupons available through ELF if you look.  Paying $9.99 for the same product is a total rip off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon should be more aware of fraudulent sellers and do something to prevent it.</li>
            <li> I have this eyeliner in three colors - the black,the bronze (brown) color and the purple and I highly recommend them all! So easy to apply, no tugging or pulling. Forgiving if you make a mistake - just wipe off quickly. I use an eyeliner brush that came with another product, that has a longer handle, but otherwise, I love these products and use them daily. And, it does last! I work in an office and it does last all day (don&#x27;t know how it would do if I worked outside).</li>
            <li> I like this eyeliner because no eyeliner is dark enough when you are doing a smokey eye. The only thing I would recommend is not opening your eye until it dries and if your doing a very perfect line, you may want to use a different brush other than the one it came with. Picture also looks a lot bigger then the actual product.</li>
            <li> Ok so I can be informative: You can get this product at Target for only $3 as their regular price. Don&#x27;t buy this here and get it for $5+ more, unless you&#x27;re desperately in need of [black] cream eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first cream eyeliner product I&#x27;ve bought and it works nice. It comes with a small eyeliner brush that applies the eyeliner great! You just need to get the right amount of cream on the brush. (:</li>
            <li> it is not easy off makeup, and water-repellent.i really like this. and this cream eyeliner is not very cheap. I think every girl can buy it.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for an eyeliner that would stay on.This is it.I can actually wear it all day and still have it on at night. Love this product.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all. The cream is thick and when you dip the brush in it it gets chunky fast. It smudged horrendously throughout the day. Will not buy elf cosmetics again.</li>
            <li> You can purchase this at any Target for $3.  I do recommend there professional eyeliner brush, it is much better than the plastic brush provided and dip in water when applying for a clean sleek finish!</li>
            <li> I am very impressed by this eyeliner, its goes on super smooth, stays on for awhile too. You only need a tiny bit on the brush too, this stuff will last forever! Great buy!</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of elf products. I have things from their facial whips to their mascara, and I am very impressed with this eyeliner! When it says smudge proof, it means smudge proof. I have a big problem with my eyes, usually eyeliners make my eyes water and get irritated, but this one did not! It has great color, stays on ALL day, is waterproof, and relatively cheap. I will definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> Overall its ok. You gotta be patient for it to work good.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Smudges if tampered with, hard to remove, and messy. the brush is not so great.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: lasts all day nice jet black.</li>
            <li> this eyeliner is great.  I am very picky with my make up and especially eye liners and i love this eye liner.  The brush is really crappy and you have to wash it after every use so it doesnt harden and clump but it is very easy to apply.  Everyone who is saying it is hard to apply simply does not know how to apply make up.  You just cant load up the tiny brush with a bunch of the eye liner.  Little bits at a time and it works great.  Lasts for hours and doesnt smudge. will def buy another one when mine runs out</li>
            <li> if you are one of those people who want their eyeliner to last all day without smuge or having to re apply every few hours, this product is amazing. the only disappointment was the size when it came in the mail this product is very small although it lasts about a month.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is good to the fact that it does not bead up like ELF&#x27;s liquid eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually just use this when having fun with makeup...&lt;br /&gt;not trying to look my best, but looking okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually use this more to fill in my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the eyeliner, and then the excess is light enough that it makes my eyebrows appear natural instead of too dark. (I have dark brown/black eyebrows naturally)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not smudge proof or anything either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;recommend:&lt;br /&gt;-Buy your own eyeliner brush. This one is useless (at least to me)&lt;br /&gt;-Buy in stores. This is, like, $1-3 (I forgot...) in stores.&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T BUY ONLINE</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and makes a very thin line if you are careful. Just make sure you barely get anything on the brush, a little goes a long way. Would buy again, though this looks like it&#x27;s going to last me for quite awhile.</li>
            <li> Super tiny, but you really don&#x27;t need much to get the job done. Everyone complains about the brush- it&#x27;s not very stiff but I&#x27;m no professional make up artist: it gets the job done just fine for me. Go for it, especially if you&#x27;re buying makeup just to try and practice different looks; however, it still works well for actually going public with it. Invest in some makeup remover, tho, because it can be a bit stubborn to remove. ;)</li>
            <li> This stuff hardly moves when you set it with black eyeshadow. Stayed on during a 2 hour volleyball practice! You have to warm the pot in your hand a little before using it or it will get really clumped up on the tiny, unhelpful brush that comes with the eyeliner.</li>
            <li> This is a great eyeliner. I really like the cream texture and it is smooth which makes it easy to apply. However, I just bought it at Target for $3.00. There were lots of colors too. Just a heads up that Target has this eyeliner for 3 bucks!</li>
            <li> I have several gel &amp; cream eye liner. I usually use an eggplant color but I bought this one because it was very inexpensive and I wanted to try out a black one. The brush that this comes with is useful for a quick, basic application but if you want something more shapely or a cat eye look a different brush might be better. I use a high end lip brush for a cat eye look. This formula is very creamy. Once it&#x27;s dry and set it does very well  . If you have never used a gel formula before you may want to try this out before buying a high end formula. Personally, I am satisfied with this one.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner,I use their eyeliner brush instead of the one it comes with.  It last me all day, I work 12hrs and usually eyeliner I use will start to smudge, but not this one.  I works for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of e.l.f. I fall in love with 75 percent of my purchases and with their prices, that makes me super happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a win. Honestly, I&#x27;ve never used a cream eyeliner; but this was everything I was imagining it would be. It was easy to control (my hands are really jittery) and it had staying power - even when used without a primer. It was also highly pigmented which is a big deal to me, since my skin is dark and I need my liner to be midnight-BLACK in order to really pop. I didn&#x27;t get the brush that&#x27;s pictured with it - though, I purchased it directly from the companies site and it isn&#x27;t pictured on there. I have tons of brushes though (and I&#x27;ve heard less than stellar reviews of the one that people got with it), so it&#x27;s no big deal. The amount of product in the cute container is pretty good - especially for the bargain price.</li>
            <li> This cream eyeliner is AWESOME!  I love it.  The black is a true black, the texture is soft and easy to apply and best of all the color does not run or fade!  I am really impressed!&lt;br /&gt;It washes off easily with face wash, no extra eye makeup remover needed.&lt;br /&gt;The applicator makes it easy to make thick or thin lines and as long as you keep it clean it seems like it will last.  You use a minimal amount of the product during application so this should last probably 10 x&#x27;s longer than the typical stick eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;Since I first purchased this eyeliner I have tried a couple different brands when this wasn&#x27;t in stock at my local store; what a waste of money.  I always go back to this eyeliner and now purchase 2 at a time so I won&#x27;t run out.&lt;br /&gt;The only con is that it began to dry out before I finished all of the product but for the price and how long it lasts, this eyeliner cannot be beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look for it at Target or on elf.com though; it only costs $3 at those places.</li>
            <li> Works great!! Goes on smoothly and with the right brush you can make lines thin and thick. Def will be buying this product again!</li>
            <li> It was a okay it could have been better didn&#x27;t expect it the brush o be so small. Make sure you cover the cream eyeliner after you use it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about e.l.f. cosmetics. The prices are so reasonable, especially from their own website or Target, and the performance is up to par with the much more expensive brands. Customarily I would not use cream eyeliner, but I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of experimenting with new products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my surprise, this creme eyeliner stays put. It affords you a very dramatic look. Lightly powder your lids (or use an eyelid primer) and then use your shadows. The brush gives good control. It might take a bit of prictice to get this just as you want, but once you master the application of it, you&#x27;ll probably want to use it quite often. If you goof, keep some q-tips handy with make-up remover, and you&#x27;ll be good to go!</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is very watery and translucent, i have to put on many coats for the eyeliner to appear black. Does not last very long at all, would NOT recommend.</li>
            <li> I received this eyeliner couple days ago but didn&#x27;t have a chance to apply. I finally applied it today before I went to school it was so easy and smooth to apply and looked great. After I got home in the evening my eyes still looked so fresh and vibrant like I just did my eye make-up 5 min. ago. It didn&#x27;t smudge or fade, It was still looking great. ( I used primary base too) I loved it. The whole day it felt like I didn&#x27;t have any eyeliner on. It is very comfortable. I am very happy with this product. It is good quality and affordable. I recommend it to anyone who loves to show off their eyes like me...</li>
            <li> The item was exactly what I needed. I am very satisfied. No problems to receive the item as well. Very good</li>
            <li> This item works great! I am very happy I bought it and plan to order more. The brush technique makes it easy to apply and it&#x27;s the perfect shade of black. I have oily eyes and this never runs or smears. I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This is by far the BEST eyeliner I have used! It lasts for a LONG time, it goes on VERY black (matte with no shine) you can use as much as you want and make it as thick or thin as you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I don&#x27;t like the brush that it comes with and I use my own) My recommendation is to buy an eyeliner angled brush because this one that it coems with is very small and not very easy to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------update---------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I had given this eyeliner 5 stars, but I had to change it to  3 stars. The reason is because it dries very quickly. I also have to brush my eyeliner brush immediately after I apply eyeliner because it makes my brush icky and hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However it is very matte, and after mixing the eyeliner it goes back to its original texture. But then after using it the next time, the surface will dry up.</li>
            <li> oh my gosh! i freaken love this eyeliner. its amazing! the box says \\&quot;no-smudge\\&quot; so i decided to take up that challenge and it didnt smudge! or if it did then i didnt see it! i would recommend this gel/cream eyeliner to anyone. im serious. if you want black gel eyeliner this is the product. it comes with a small brush(which i didnt use) i have my own brush so i just used that instead. but this applies nicely. when i run out im buying from here again because its a lot cheaper than target and wal-mart. haha</li>
            <li> rhis product is great! i used it on halloween for a clown makeup and it was just amazing!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;i definetly recomend it!</li>
            <li> The only reason why I gave this product 4 stars is because it&#x27;s like, double the price on amazon that it is at Target.  GO TO TARGET TO GET THIS PRODUCT! This liquid eyeliner is the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used.  However, the applicator that it comes with is not that great.  I like my eyeliner to be pretty precise, and I can&#x27;t quite get that fine \\&quot;wing\\&quot; when I use the applicator that comes with it.  But overall, with a different brush, the eyeliner is perfecto.  Plus, I don&#x27;t think anyone can really complain about this makeup when it&#x27;s just so darn cheap.  If you don&#x27;t like it when you buy it, oh well! You lost three dollars.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re anything like me, you will want to use a different brush. I struggled with the one that came with it. It either made my lines way too dark, like Cleopatra, or faint and barely there. However, I was able to use the brush from a rival product and had great results. This eyeliner goes on well and it wears well. I didn&#x27;t notice any flaking or caking. It is a great product, just as good as any of the more expensive brands, for half the price. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this E.l.f studio liner it goes on smooth, dark and makes a great cat eye, very intense I love it! I have a cheaper brand cream liner and it sucks.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B004DIUX34 E.l.f. Studio Cream Eyeliner (Black) elf]] The item came as described, though, I was a bit surprised how tiny it was. It&#x27;s definitely waterproof to some extent and goes on very smoothly. My only issue is the brush. It&#x27;s much too short, so I&#x27;ve now resorted to using the eyeliner brush from a previously purchased brush set. Also, I&#x27;ve used this product as a background colour when I&#x27;m trying to achieve very dark smokey eyes and it looks GREAT! Tip -- A little goes a long way. Just slightly dab the brush into the cream and apply. There&#x27;s no need to stick it all the way in as you&#x27;d only be wasting the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I previously rated this item a 4 star but I&#x27;m now reducing that to 3. It goes on fairly bright but within a hour or so, it almost completely wears off. My pot also seems to be drying out now and I&#x27;ve only been using this for a little over a month. I no longer use the brush that comes in the set. A little still goes a long so I have quite a bit of this product left but I&#x27;m now back on the hunt for a new eyeliner, one that really does have staying power. Suggestions welcomed.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner glides on smooth and makes a very sharp line. I&#x27;d call it kind of a hybrid between using a soft pencil and liquid liner. I found it easier to apply than liquid liner, and a crisper line than a pencil. And the color is very black. You&#x27;ll just need to keep the applicator brush clean and flat to maintain a sharp line - it tends to get gunky after a few uses.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner works so well and makes my eyes look huge. I&#x27;m going to use it until it runs out. It was shipped to my house in two days or so.</li>
            <li> The product has AMAZING quality. I personally use it and have no plans of switching. While the colors can be harder to find, the Black and brown are very common and are only about 2 or 3 dollars in stores like target or kmart. Ordering the colors online is a good idea but the price is a rip off for black and brown.</li>
            <li> I like this product, however its a LOT smaller than it looks in the picture. It is supdf smal so if you will be using this daily might want to reconsider but other than it good quality.</li>
            <li> I used the applicator that came with it, and maybe I just lack in skill, but I couldn&#x27;t get it to go on smoothly/evenly. Also, it dried up relatively quickly and became unusable.</li>
            <li> Well i try this for two weeks. The first day was a mess!! Because i forgot that this its not so resistant like the old one that I used to buy. But now i get use to,and its good if you DON&#x27;T TOUCH your eyes!! Lol. I&#x27;m not working so i prefer to buy this one for 3 dollars that the old one for 20!!!!! Btw i love the brush that come with this!!! Is perfect ;) not waterproof!! But its ok for me ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 years now- I&#x27;ve always gotten mine at Walmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the first time I used it, I fell in love. it doesn&#x27;t smudge like pencil liner, it&#x27;s much easier to apply than liquid. it&#x27;s a win-win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; I have is that it&#x27;s difficult to get off at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;10/10 would recommend.</li>
            <li> At first I was happy but then after after few months it dried out and shrunk. I wouldn&#x27;t order this again</li>
            <li> When i first receive the product. Eyeliner was easy to used. The only to problem i had with the product, the brush get  old quick and the cream dry out.</li>
            <li> I have used ELF cream eyeliner (purchased several times) since it debuted on ELF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, the eyeliner is impressive, creamy. It is able to be applied lightly or heavy depending on the look you&#x27;re aiming for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The range of colors it comes in is nice too, although I wish there was more selection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, I removed 2 stars due to packaging jar for 2 reasons. First, the jars never close flush, since they&#x27;re square the top is never aligned properly with the bottom when tightened.&lt;br /&gt;Second, and more importantly, the jars dont seal properly. Eventually (usually sooner rather than later) the eyeliner begins to dry up, turning into a hard ball. Its sort of a waste to never be able to use %90 of product in the jar. It has happened to every single one of the 8 ELF cream eyeliners I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> As good or better product than many more expensive ones I&#x27;ve tried. The mini brush that comes with it is surprisingly good too (again, better than some I&#x27;ve bought on their own).</li>
            <li> Siempre quise maquilarme los ojos apropiadamente y este toque de delineador le da ese realce que necesitan mis ojos para verse bien</li>
            <li> Just like a professional type of cream liner. Great for cat eyes!</li>
            <li> it worked fine at first but it dried out, even with the lid covering it, maybeline never did, I don&#x27;t wear makeup often so I only got to use this twice before it dried out</li>
            <li> When I first received this eyeliner I was really excited! The first few weeks it worked great-but then it dried up really fast. I don&#x27;t think I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best eyeliner, you can use or on top or bottom on your water lines or even just you lash lines. I have used bare minerals and the too faced  as well as the sephora eyeliners, and it doesn&#x27;t compare. It&#x27;s clean and easy to use (trust me I put it on while riding in a bouncy semi) it is waterproof and it really won&#x27;t smudge off at all, I use coconut oil to remove it. Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Lasts All day! ( 7 hrs)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it fades off on your waterline in the corner, put two layers on.&lt;br /&gt;Put on the 1st wait about a minute for it to set then add another in that problem areas (:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your not picky, life up you eye lid and put it under your lash line, it makes it last 10x longer.</li>
            <li> i absolutly love this eyeliner goes on perfect and is very pigmented and stays put almost all day just love it</li>
            <li> I found that this gel liner dried out very quickly. And I am talking like within the same week that I opened it. And was not impressed with the brush.</li>
            <li> Amazing colour and very creamy. stays on all day. The brush kinda suck and is only about 2 to 3 inches long</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d give gel liner a go and it&#x27;s not for me. I have had the product for over a year and I haven&#x27;t used it more than a handful amount of times.</li>
            <li> I loooooove this stuff. It stays on all day for me and the little brush that comes with it makes for easy application.</li>
            <li> I love the E.L.F. cream eyeliners but I don&#x27;t understand why they are $8.50 on Amazon when they are $3 in stores and on the E.L.F. site??</li>
            <li> I hate to knock this product as everyone else had such glowing reviews. I liked it at first but I find it very hard to apply. It may just be me but I tried different brushes because the one it comes with is awful. I found it clumpy and hard to smooth on. Just like one other reviewer said, if you mess it up, it is very hard to get off. So between my inability to get it on right and then not able to without messing up my foundation, I just made a huge mess. I ended up tossing it after a month of trying.</li>
            <li> I purchased this and liked it okay, but my roommate loved it so I gave it to her. Later I went to borrow it and she had bought a new one of the same kind, and I used it and LOVED it. Darker than any other eye liner I&#x27;ve used before. Plus the brush is so fun and makes everyday makeup into an art!&lt;br /&gt;Can smudge a bit, just something to be conscious of every once in a while.</li>
            <li> Whether you use the brush that comes with it or a professional one, this product starts to get clumpy. You&#x27;ll find it falling into your lashes and later in the day it&#x27;ll be a black smudge somewhere on your cheek. I liked it the first couple weeks, then it started getting gross.</li>
            <li> Before I start, I just want to say that I didn&#x27;t order these on amazon. I purchased this at Target. I really love this product,though! For only $3 (at Target), it&#x27;s amazing! It&#x27;s super creamy and glides on very easily! I am definitely going to re purchase this when i finish this one!</li>
            <li> I have always used eyeliner pencils, so I was hesitant to try a cream eyeliner. The price was low so I decided I would give it a shot, and I am so glad I did! It is so easy to apply &amp; it lasts all day! I could not be happier with this product!</li>
            <li> smudges! what i mean by that is that after applying this and i go out to run an errand and i come back it looks as if i have a black eye...i even applied primer on b4 this and it is not that long lasting...imma stick with my 24hr k pallet since it actually stays on...oh and i didn&#x27;t check b4 i got this and the size is really small but then again a little goes a long way...if u get what that means...recently i bought another from a store near by my house and got a bigger one than this for only 99 cents</li>
            <li> Much better quality than I expected for the price. Applies easily and the little brush it comes with is actually not bad either. I use a primer but I think if I didn&#x27;t, it might not have as much staying power as others. Good amount of product though, so I can&#x27;t complain!</li>
            <li> EXCELENTE PRODUCTO EXCELENTE CALIDAD Y SUPER ACORDE CON EL TAMA&amp;Ntilde;O  LOS FELICITO POR PRESENTAR PRODUCTOS DE ESTA CALIDAD JSIUDIUDF IYDFIUYF</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply especially with the brush that it came with, stays on no smudge or running..excellent, will buy another when this one is done, for sure.</li>
            <li> I like the ELF gel eyeliner better than any gel eyeliner I have ever used because it does dry after you put it on so it wont smudge or crease during the day and it is a lot easier to use than liquid liner. This is also better because you don&#x27;t have to pay $20 for quality eyeliner!</li>
            <li> It is a good product overall I just didn&#x27;t like the brush that came along with it. I just used my own instead.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok, use better than this. Nothing spectacular about it</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is all that I use, I&#x27;ve been a faithful e.l.f user for years now and this product is great for the price, but it smears easily. Not a big enough problem for me to stop using it though.</li>
            <li> I brought this eyeliner and i like it but only one thing which i don&#x27;t like about this product is it is difficult to remove the eyeliner with water or face wash or anything else,you need to use makeup remover but apart from this everything is good.</li>
            <li> This cream eyeliner was very good for the price. Very pigmented, &amp; very easy to apply. The shipping was very quick as well.  However, the reason I rated this eyeliner 4 out of 5 stars is because it does smudge occasionally throughout the day, but if you set it with eyeshadow it does last all day long . Overall its a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try creme and/or gel eyeliners for sometime and purchased this one because it was one of the cheaper drug store choices.  I thought that if I didn&#x27;t like it then at least it only cost me a couple of bucks.  After trying this one time, though, I have to admit this may be a permanent fixture in my makeup bag.  It comes with a small angled brush and is so easy to apply.  The brush holds so much product and I am able to complete a look on one eye without having to re-dip the brush into the container.  The pigments are very dark, the color very black, and the effect very matte: the result is an awesome dramatic look that will make your eyes pop!  It&#x27;s so easy to create a wing-tip look with this and the eyeliner stays on all day but removes easily at night.  The container it comes in cute and simple and looks classy.  The only dislike I have is that sometimes the bristles on the brush can poke my eyelid and it hurts a little, but that shouldn&#x27;t dissuade you from trying this product; it happens rarely and I think once you get the hang of the brush it wouldn&#x27;t be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a great buy: only $3 for a dark, black, matte creme eyeliner with all-day staying power and intensity to make your eyes pop.</li>
            <li> 5 stars. i love it because it applies so nicely. i was never good at using liquid liners and the brush it comes with makes my lines precise and evenly applied. just be sure to wipe the excess off on the edge of the pot. a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> The eyeliner quality is great and long lasting however it comes with a very small brush that can be easily lost in a makeup bag or organizer. wish it came with a longer brush.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is awesome. very satisfied. AMAZING price, brand new as stated. I am extremely satisfied. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner. I can&#x27;t imagine why anyone spends so much money for cream/gel eyeliner pots at Sephora when this one exists. People should not be confusing price with quality, especially when it comes to this product. If you&#x27;re unsure of how good it is because it&#x27;s cheap, just spring for it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great eyeliner, but DOES NOT COME OFF! I tried ALMAY oil free eye makeup remover and it did not come off. My eye&#x27;s are all red and there is still black eyeliner streaks.</li>
            <li> i Tried many liners and i like this one the Most!</li>
            <li> I was prepared for a disappointment - after all who can buy a good eyeliner for a dollar fifty???&lt;br /&gt;This cream eyeliner is a dream - goes on smoothly and stays on all day.  Best buy in a long time - sorry they dont have other colors - would have bought them all!</li>
            <li> The Cream eyeliner was so easy to apply with the handy brush that came in with it. so much easier to do the pin up wing with it then a pencil or liquid eyeliner. I would most likely recommended this product. perfect for everyday use.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite piece of makeup. i always at least wear this even if i dont wear anything else.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I prefer it over the Maybelline Eye studio gel eyeliner honestly. It goes on really smooth and the brush that it comes with is great. My lids are a little oily,  but the gel does stay on! Sometimes it does smudge a little, but for the price I love it!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this after reading the reviews. Putting it on wasn&#x27;t too difficult, the brush seems decent and it went on smoothly. Well, about an hour after application I looked in the mirror and it was smudged all over! I looked like a raccoon. I didn&#x27;t touch it, I wasn&#x27;t sweaty or anything. I&#x27;ve tried it quite a few times and it always ends up smudged all over. Will not buy again, highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> This smudges with urban decay primer potion on within the first hour.&lt;br /&gt;It is hard to remove as well when dry.</li>
            <li> This creme liner is everything</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smudge or run once applied. I also use it over the lash line to help camouflage the line of false eyelashes. Works like a dream. Nice smooth easy application. Don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ve gone this long without it!</li>
            <li> Overall this is a really good eyeliner that is a lot easier to apply than many others I have had in the past. It won&#x27;t smudge and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I love ittttttt, i love it to put a winged eye line, but it does abit smudge, however it is great. Oh and by like a year of using it, it cracked in the middle &amp;#62;&amp;#60; need to buy moree!!</li>
            <li> I came across this product while searching for a new liquid eyeliner. My previous had to be scrapped due to a pink-eye contamination and I was in need of new eyeliner. I&#x27;ve always swore by e.l.f. makeup since I first started wearing makeup it&#x27;s been my favorite company and I&#x27;ve never had a complaint about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my expectations for this product was pretty high. It arrived in the mail quickly and packaged safely surrounded and swaddled in bubble wrap and in it&#x27;s packaging. Though I admit when I opened it I was a little disappointed it was so tiny!&lt;br /&gt;But that was my own fault for not bothering to look at the size and just went for the cheapest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hadn&#x27;t expected it to be soooo creamy! When I went to put it on I dipped the brush and it quickly became covered in the cream. It was so soft and perfect. After sliding off the excess onto the rim of the jar I started with my top lid and was sooooo surprised how easy it went on. At first I wasn&#x27;t sure I had actually got any on my eye, (I&#x27;m used to the cold feeling from the liquid liner) And as I pulled away it just looked amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has the control of liquid liner but the creamy fullness of a soft pencil liner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I urge you to at least try this product I love it and will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup much, but when I do, I like e.l.f Cream Eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking to get the crisp, defined line look, and this product let me get that while pencil eyeliners didn&#x27;t. I&#x27;d say this is was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Nice product. I found it easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Perfect to complement your makeup and give a sense of depth in the eye. The downside is that it dries very fast even when is properly closed</li>
            <li> This product had the potential to wow me but I got it somewhat dry so I never fully got to experience it&#x27;s ability. I&#x27;ve seen good Youtube reviews but....&lt;br /&gt;Seems to me that with the packaging, it was set up to dry early on. If you dont get the cover just right...&lt;br /&gt;I keep putting a bit of eye drops in there every now and again but I&#x27;ve since moved on</li>
            <li> This works VERY well and lasts really long. I actually want this in EVERY color! May not use pencil liners anymore and I say that as a professional make-up artist! It came in the mail VERY quickly. Will order this product and possibly from this seller in the near future (if they have it in stock).</li>
            <li> This is great!! It does not run, it&#x27;s easy to apply, it&#x27;s creamy, the colour is true black, the brush is useful and does the job - the packaging isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;bad on the eye&amp;#34; either .... I will more than likely repurchase this; but not in a hurry, cause a little goes a very long way with this eyeliner - I still have a lot of product left and I use this at least 4 - 5 times a week!!</li>
            <li> I love non pencil eyeliners but liquid eyeliners can be a hassle. ELF&#x27;s cream eyeliner is a great soft formula, easy to apply and not too messy. You even get an applicator with it. My only downside is it&#x27;s so small, but that is probably because a large container would dry out and waste everything. This does tend to dry out after a while, a few weeks I&#x27;d say, but adding a tiny drop of oil will do the trick.</li>
            <li> I was about to buy the expensive high end version of this product from MAC. But I said why not ill try this out. It has lasted me forever and goes on just the same as MAC would. Stays on all day too. I just put some powder over it to set it and im good!</li>
            <li> I put this one with some trepidation.  Ladies, it DOES go on quite dark, but if you smudge it with a q-tip while it is still moist you can soften the look quite well.  I got some on my hand inadvertently and I had to wash it off.  Similarly, it did not smear on my eye.  granted, I did not put it under my lower lid.  I would suggest the brown color for us older ladies!  Other than that I am VERY pleased.</li>
            <li> I REALLY like this eyeliner!! It looks amazing and it is great for everyday and dramatic looks. Just be sure to close it all the way after every use or else it dries out. Overall great product.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I wanted to try some new eyeliner and I have to say that I&#x27;m really impressed!  I outlined my entire eye with it including the waterline and 8 hours later, it&#x27;s still on!  No smudging, no transferring, it&#x27;s great!  It doesn&#x27;t stay creamy or wet on your eye like I&#x27;ve had with other cream eyeliners, it dries and it stays in place.  I&#x27;ve never had anything stay on like this before without having to reapply throughout the day.  I&#x27;m going to be buying more, and trying out the different colors too!</li>
            <li> I love the color, the finish! its a great purchase, makes it a lot easier to eyeline your eyes, I used liquid and pen liners, but this is way better! the brush is amazing! If you buy this you will never want to go back to the other liners! fully recommend this one! After 2, or 3 months it was all dried, too sad!</li>
            <li> This eye liner rocks last all day but I set mine with eye shadow but don&#x27;t waste your money here. It&#x27;s only a dollar at target!</li>
            <li> I was really not looking forward to buying this because i had no previous experience in applying gel eyeliner, but this really surprised me. It was easy to apply and it provides a solid black line. The brush is angled and works very well if you like the winged eyeliner look. The consistency of the gel was also very good, not too hard and not too soft. I recommend this gel eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I love this liner. You do need a good liner applicator to put it on right because it is easy to over do it with this product because it&#x27;s so creamy and a lot can stick to the applicator. I use this when I go clubbing with my girlfriends and it STAYS. We&#x27;ll get all sweaty and dance for hours then come home and fall asleep and it&#x27;s still there in the morning, after 14+ hours of wear. I always finish this with ELF&#x27;s studio eyeliner sealer. They market it as a product you can use to make any eyeshadow a liner, but I use it as a way to set my eyeliner. It really does work. I you&#x27;re SUPER worried, you can always use this first, then go over it with their waterproof eyeliner pen in black, and finish with the liner sealer. It&#x27;s a seriously good combo.</li>
            <li> I am looking for smudge proof liner that is not a liquid. I bought this one in Target for $3, thinking it&#x27;s cheap enough to try and got great reviews on Amazon. Well, it goes on really nicely, smooth, intense color. I used a professional brush though, the brush it comes with is crap and it actually came creased in the box. I have oily eyelids so it&#x27;s pretty challenging keeping any liner on me. So far I found only the liquid liners last but are a bit tricky to use. After an hour or maybe less this liner was all over my upper lid. I will be trying L&#x27;Oreal HIP next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I purchased L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s infallible gel liner. It is great! It stays put. Worth spending a few more dollars and get something that works.</li>
            <li> I love elf products. They are so cheap, their makeup usually hold up to the roughest of days. I was ecstatic when I received my cream liner. I am a usual fan of gel liners and this is my first cream and so far I love it! I woke up this morning around 8, got my package and tested it out on my hand. I have three swatches that have been through a day at the library, a few hours at work and multiple hand washings. The lines are still there, a little bit duller (but I also washed my hands a few times today) but they are still there. They don&#x27;t smudge when I touch or rub them with my fingers. I am so incredibly happy! The only downfall was that the packaging was a little crushed when I received it which caused the brush bristles to be a little bent, but nothing a wash can&#x27;t do. This is a great product and I totally recommend it to anyone who is new to makeup. So easy to apply!</li>
            <li> I wanted to experiment for Halloween. If you need a temporary not high quality eyeliner, this will do. Just be careful not to make the lining so thick it smears. I rarely use make-up let alone eye-liner. But because I was Cleopatra for Halloween I needed a cheap eye-liner. I don&#x27;t use it to much but I do like this method/texture of eyeliner. For being a cheap product it did exactly what I needed. HOWEVER, if you use eye-liner regularily I would suggest spending just a little more for better quality.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t smear or rub off too easy.  I will never go back to liquid eyeliner again, cream is the way to go. I even use this on my bottom lash line and it stays put.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never tried a cream eyeliner before, but I&#x27;d read good things about them and decided to give it a try.  I&#x27;ve had great results with E.l.f. products and settled on the Studio Cream Eyeliner in black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is amazing!  I tried it out as soon as I received it and it glides on so smooth.  The little brush that comes with the eyeliner makes precision lines and you can get a super fine line or use a heavier hand for a thicker look.  The best part?  After being out of practice, doing any sort of wing on my eyeliner was very difficult for me.  With the angled brush it was really easy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a phenomenal product and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I just tryed out the Elf cream eyeliner in black last week. I have been using liquid eyeliner like forever and i decided to try this out and WOW this is some amazing stuff. I use a small angled brush to apply and my eyes looked amazing. It stays on all day, it glides on so easily without pulling or tugging on the eye skin it doesn&#x27;t run, come off or smear all day, well it smeared just a tiny, tiny bit to my upper lid but not to the point where it would annoy the heck out of me Lol, not like the way liquid eyeliner would. So yes I would definietly buy this again.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it stays on and is easy to apply. The little brush that comes with it works great.</li>
            <li> Love this eyeliner! The pigment is very concentrated and it lasts throughout the entire day w/out much fading.  Applies evenly as well. I do use a primer, whether it be NYX or Urban Decay.  This is said to be a good alternative for the MAC cream eyeliner - I am glad I purchased this and didn&#x27;t waste the extra money on MAC.</li>
            <li> This is not the greatest cream eyeliner.  It is really thick and dry you will need to wet your brush every time you use it.  The brush that comes with it is basically useless, it&#x27;s very cheap luckily I had my own to use. It mucks up your brush really quick.  Not nice and creamy like sephora brand.  It does last long and doesn&#x27;t crumble or flake off when wearing it so that&#x27;s a plus.  I don&#x27;t think I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Good service and great experience i would recommended it to all my friends because its just a great product. I love it !</li>
            <li> Would recommend to any women who likes eyeliner that last for a long time and the make up does not smear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I received an outdated product or not, but mine was dry and difficult to use. I wasn&#x27;t able to apply it correctly so I made a mess of my eyes. This is the first time I used this brand. So far, it seems like low quality.</li>
            <li> I wanted a highly pigmented product to line my eyes with that I could apply with an angled brush, and this is exactly what I was looking for. I only wear makeup for costume purposes, so it might be a bit much for everyday if you like a more subtle look. Gives a nice smooth line without that gross \\&quot;chola\\&quot; look that some liquid eyeliners can have. This is a perfect product to use if you like to wear a cateye style of liner. Of note, as other reviewers mentioned, it is a little difficult to remove without some kind of oil product. I just dab a little coconut oil onto my eyes and it wipes away easily with that. Until you&#x27;re ready to remove, it pretty much stays put. I also like the brush it came with. I&#x27;m not a brush snob, so I don&#x27;t know if others will like it, but it does the job for me.</li>
            <li> I use this occasinally, Ive had it for a year and i still have plenty left. I did buy a different brush, the one in the set was too small for me.</li>
            <li> This liner is great for those not intimidated by brush liquid liners.  The color was rich and smooth and the pigment lasted for many hours.</li>
            <li> Wanted to try something different instead of the eye liner pencil and this is just what i needed. The order came quick couldn&#x27;t wait to try it on. I love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I usually love E.L.F products, they seamlessly blend with my high end cosmetics for a fraction of the cost, but this cream eyeliner really missed the mark.&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;water resistant when dry&lt;br /&gt;inexensive&lt;br /&gt;works better when set with matte black eyeshadow&lt;br /&gt;could be used as an eyeshadow base&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;greasy on the eyelid until dry&lt;br /&gt;creases easy&lt;br /&gt;not pigmented - goes on muddy and grey&lt;br /&gt;goes on waxy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is if your looking for an inexpensive cream liner you found it but your much better off paying a little bit more for a richly pigmented liner.</li>
            <li> Not a pro at using this product as yet but im still practicing....but i think when i get the hang of it i will love it with no problem</li>
            <li> Really unsmudgable. Is that even a word? Lol. The brush is small and I lost it within a week .</li>
            <li> I think the product was great for the price. You cant go wrong, and it lasted very well. I would get it again.</li>
            <li> It works really well. Affordable. Came to me quick! Iam greatly pleased with this product and considering buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> I love this! I made my own but I like this better! This is equivalent to the Benefit push-up liner! I&#x27;m not going to spend 24.00 on Bemefit I don&#x27;t think! CuZ I do love it but I can get a ton of these for that prove and this works so good! It&#x27;s baducal the same!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of cream eyeliners, usually I buy higher end ones like mac fluidline, or any little pot I can get my hands on in sephora, let me just say I didn&#x27;t expect much from a 3$eyeliner but after reading the reviews I decided what do I have to lose, and wow I&#x27;m impressed with this one, I always wear a cat eye, this cream liner helps me achieve that in one swipe, I don&#x27;thave to go back and double up over the first line, that impressed me for the price, to me this is way better than maybellines,which alot of people love, not me that formula was way to dry on my eyes and tugged to much, this liner goes on creamy and stays put I&#x27;ve had mine for two months now and it hadn&#x27;t dried out yet, I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the gel liner.  It lasts all day and does not run! I use the brush that came with it for my lower lid as it is not the best of brushes but does a great job of blending on the lower lids.  I use a different brush to create a thicker line or cat eye on the upper lid.</li>
            <li> The brush for this was one worry I had, but found it to work quite well. When it was delivered I thought that it was small, but it has lasted me months of everyday use, and still has quite a bit left. This is actually a decent cream eyeliner, and at an amazing price. I plan to buy more from this store</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE. Will order again once it is gone</li>
            <li> I watched a YouTube video on applying gel eyeliner and I ended up ordering this one. I have never used gel eyeliner before, so I was curious to see what it was like. At first I was skeptical when I was applying it with the angle brush that it came with because if I put too much liner on the brush it would smear thickly on my lid and there would be some spots that didn&#x27;t have liner at all, when I would put a little bit on it would not be enough on my lid... So I put a good amount of gel on the brush, spread it out and it went on smoothly. What I quickly realized is that you have to have the angle brush at the right angle on your lid for the gel to look good on your lid. One complaint that I have is that the liner is soooo hard to wash off!! I appreciate that the liner is waterproof, but I wasn&#x27;t happy with how difficult it was to wash off. What I did was used Olay moisturizer lotion and it wiped right off! I used Soft Soap to clean the brush! Regular soap and water DID NOT clean the brush, but the Soft Soap cleaned it quickly and nicely. Overall I love the product, I just have to continue practicing the applying technique. I hope my review helped!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B004DIUX34 E.l.f. Studio Cream Eyeliner (Black) elf]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little apprehensive about trying a cream eyeliner but the price was such that I was willing to give it a try.  I am a teacher and need an eyeliner that can withstand the rigors of students, classroom and playground.  It is impossible to touch up makeup during the day.  Since I don&#x27;t use dark eyeliner on my waterline, I bought this specifically for my upper lash line to create a cat eye and possibly for my lower lash line.  The product was shipped promptly (within 2 days since I have Amazon Prime) and fully intact.  The container is small and plastic instead of glass, which is a plus, especially for travelling.  The product color is a true black.  It is creamy but yet not so creamy that it slides around or runs.  It comes with a decent slanted eyeliner brush but I used my bent brush from bdellium since I am not that adept at eye liner to begin with. I was hoping a cream would be easier to work with than a liquid and I was right!  It went on smoothly and precisely, without a hitch, no stray marks or globs.  It takes a very small amount of product to line both upper lids.  I have very oily skin and it didn&#x27;t smudge, run or melt off even in 98 degree Texas heat!  When it rained this past Sunday, my 3 year old wanted to play in the rain and of course I couldn&#x27;t refuse such a fun request.  I was soaked after splashing around with him and pleasantly surprised when I glanced in the mirror and saw it was still intact.  It never smudged, ran, or dissolved under those conditions either.  You will need eye makeup remover to wash it off, as it is very waterproof (but this is what I want out of an eyeliner) and rubbing harshly on your eyelids is not something anyone should be doing.  I originally bought this to see if I liked cream eye liner in general and planned to buy a more expensive and/or bigger brand name product if I liked it.  There is no need for that now as this has proved to be such a quality product.  This will definitely be a repeat buy, although this small container will probably last me a long time.  The price and quality are unbeatable and I highly recommend this!ity product.  This will definitely be a repeat buy, although this small container will probably last me a long time.  The price and quality are unbeatable and I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Studio Cream Eyeliner (elf) came in absolutely dry pieces. I tried to add water, then alcohol, but nothing helped, it just became chunky. Very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I think this is a rip off only because I bought this exact thing eyeslipsface.com for $3.00...I think this is a total rip off to customers. You can also purchase this at Target for $3.00...better off going that route. I just wanted to let people to know before getting ripped off...</li>
            <li> I got this product and eventhough it is very very small the quality is great and it last for longgg time.</li>
            <li> I love this eye make-up. the only thing I dont like is how fast it drys out if you dont use it enough, and the little brush that comes with it falls apart really fast so you have to duck tape it together. other than that it works wonderful. very smooth and creamy. come off easy at night. anyone who love bold eyeliner would love this.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after learning that it was not tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;However, I was very disappointed. I put it on, it looked nice and dark, but then it wouldn&#x27;t come off!!!&lt;br /&gt; I tried everything and it came off in two days. TWO DAYS!</li>
            <li> At first I was really skeptical about buying this because it was my first eye cream liner I love that it comes with a brush I use it also. It&#x27;s a good product coming from elf I give it a 5 star it&#x27;s easy to apply. Doing a wing liner is super easy with the brush it comes with. If its your first time buying a cream liner go for this one price is right!!!</li>
            <li> I love this eye make-up. It&#x27;s probably one of the best eye liners i have ever used. The colors perfect and the idea for it to be more of a cream is perfect.</li>
