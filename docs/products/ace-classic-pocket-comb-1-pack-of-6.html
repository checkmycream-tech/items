            <li>Excellent service.</li>
            <li>Combs by ACE are the best.  </li>
            <li>This is a good deal on a perfectly serviceable product.  </li>
            <li>This is a great alternative to running out to the store to replace a lost comb.  </li>
            <li>Great product at a great price.  </li>
            <li>Now though, I have found them on Amazon in a six-pack and the price is a great buy . . .  </li>
            <li>I found a great bargain on a great product.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find these Ace combs in a 6 pack!  </li>
            <li>Causes great agitation when he does, so in the interest of keeping him safe (from me!)</li>
            <li>Good quality, good price.</li>
            <li>Wish these were as good as they used to be.  </li>
            <li>These combs are nice &amp; the price is great.</li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t it, and shame on Ace for cashing in on a good reputation and cheating their customers.</li>
            <li>Service and shipping were good.</li>
            <li>This was good insurance.</li>
            <li>This comb is good value for the money.  </li>
            <li>good product good price</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the original ACE , but the best out there.</li>
            <li>Sturdy, nice compact size</li>
            <li>I also would like to thank all the honest reviews of this inferior product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cheap six pack of good combs, and that makes it a good deal.</li>
            <li>These are the best pocket combs on the market they don&#x27;t break easily and are just the right size.</li>
            <li>The teeth on the combs get bent out of shape very easily</li>
            <li>So far so good: When you got something on the \\&quot;pros\\&quot; side of the notepad, and nothing on the \\&quot;cons\\&quot; side, you&#x27;re probably looking at a good deal!  </li>
            <li>Makes combing your hair easy!    </li>
            <li>Not expensive, but work great.</li>
            <li>- if you need a superior pocket comb that will hide neatly in your pocket, fit easily in the car console, or even over the visor, then this is the one.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>If I find a better comb, I will buy it.  </li>
            <li>Will not be able to give this a five star since I know they can, and used to be made much better.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a more reliable comb.</li>
            <li>What more can you say?  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve been combing my hair for 30-odd years now, and I needed to know *for sure</li>
            <li>As the months have passed, I&#x27;ve been satisfied with its performance time and time again.  </li>
            <li>I am not a big comb guy, but these were the best combs I ever bought.</li>
            <li>I sincerely hope the Ace company will soon realize that quantity (the pack of six) will never be a substitute for quality.  </li>
            <li>This is an Amazon problem more than anything else.</li>
            <li>Sure, they&#x27;ll part your hair, but not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>What can one say about combs - this is my favorite and about every 3-4 months need to replace the one I have in my hip pocket</li>
            <li>I love these combs.</li>
            <li>I found something better...</li>
            <li>I bought a six-pack of the Ace Pocket Combs hoping they would hold up slightly better - which they have.  </li>
            <li>Most combs seem to be made with cheap plastic that creates static discharge and causes your hair to stand on end.</li>
            <li>As implied by its name, the APC does indeed fit into pockets, whether shirt, shorts, or pants -- even Members Only jackets, as I can happily report!) and exited onto the street.  </li>
            <li>Amazon has fantastic customer service though, and refunded my money for these, since I didn&#x27;t receive the correct thing. :)</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t pull your hair, doesn&#x27;t break easily and keeps its teeth.  </li>
            <li>longer are the best they are just like any other cheap</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a good, flexible, sturdy comb and live up to their name.</li>
            <li>The accompanying text also specifically says \\&quot;Has both fine and medium teeth for all hair types\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Nonetheless, the combs shipped have nothing but fine teeth.  </li>
            <li>Fine quality, cheap in bulk, and not too lightweight.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a dozen and now I have one in my night stand, medicine cabinet, car, van, camper, wife&#x27;s purse (in case I forget), tool box, shop drawer and in my pocket (until I loose it, again), but no problem, I have have two spares and I can get more on Amazon at a great price.</li>
            <li>these cheap pieces of junk.  </li>
            <li>We couldn&#x27;t find this brand in any of our local stores, so was happy to find it online.</li>
            <li>Seems as good as my old original pocket comb which I still carry.</li>
            <li>Good decent combs, right rigidity and flexibility.</li>
            <li>Ladies - you will appreciate that, while not a miracle grooming tool, it will come in handy and fit nicely into an evening or other clutch bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are pretty good combs but they will break if bent too far.</li>
            <li>Was looking for a good pocket comb Ive carried for years, takes me back to the fifties and DA cuts</li>
            <li>Good basic comb.</li>
            <li>There on the counter was a jar full of them.    </li>
            <li>ACE combs used to be good solid rubber products.</li>
            <li>My only issue was that I was sent the fine-tooth combs instead, which are much more cheaply made and are sure to break and fall apart fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>I lose pocket combs regularly, and came across this multiple comb set; it is ideal -- and well priced!</li>
            <li>If they did, the misrepresentations would stop quickly.  </li>
            <li>A great old standard comb at a fantastic price.</li>
            <li>As before, the transformation was as sudden as it was amazing.    </li>
            <li>In short, it&#x27;s a cheap comb; I don&#x27;t need anything more.</li>
            <li>Just what I was looking for; nothing fancy, just practical and economical.  </li>
            <li>The classic combs shown in the photo are fantastic combs that hold up quite well, after being sat on and everything.  </li>
            <li>These would probably be great for children with small hands.</li>
            <li>As others have noted, they are no longer marked or labeled \\&quot;Unbreakable\\&quot; and most certainly are not.</li>
            <li>I wish to extend my thanks to everyone who posted an honest review of these inferior Chinese products.  </li>
            <li>You can hold it above your lip and pretend it&#x27;s a mustache; 2) You can run it back and forth on a table&#x27;s edge, delighting everyone near you with its sound; 3) You can use it as a ruler, to draw a gentle, curving line (however, if you do so, be sure to use the top side of the APC!  </li>
            <li>The comb in the photo clearly shows both fine and medium teeth.  </li>
            <li>Great hard rubber comb.</li>
            <li>They do work, but I miss the old smooth style.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what it says...</li>
            <li>This is my first one-star review.</li>
            <li>&quot; Ace combs were coming out several or more years ago.  </li>
            <li>The old combs had that rubber feel, silky smooth as they glided over your head.  </li>
            <li>Hair that had been mussed and out of place was suddenly transformed as if by magic into an orderly, and if I do say so, rather fashionable, part.  </li>
            <li>It was at this point that I noticed everyone in the shop looking at me funny.  </li>
            <li>It was a windy day, and so I faced my first test</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, no.  </li>
            <li>My first comb lasted all but one day.  </li>
            <li>The price is better then the local stores.</li>
            <li>I would gladly pay more to get the old style, hard rubber combs if they are available.  </li>
            <li>fine tines are so fine and sharp that they now scratch and irritate your scalp when you comb your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The rubber feel became more plasticy, the body thinner, and the teeth points are often rough and more scratchy feeling (the last one I had felt like plastic \\&quot;flash\\&quot; was still on the points).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ace</li>
            <li>Back in the day, Genuine Ace Hard Rubber combs could easily be found anywhere, they lasted forever, glided smoothly over the scalp and skin, and left hair looking and feeling nice.  </li>
            <li>These are simply plastic and break easily.  </li>
            <li>These are not the Classic  rubber Ace Combs!</li>
            <li>Good long lasting classic vombs</li>
            <li>It is easy to notice these combs have sharp teeth, the old style has smooth teeth.</li>
            <li>I like to carry a comb in my pocket, and have destroyed many cheap combs lately.  </li>
            <li>The combs work very well,</li>
            <li>Only one has broken at all, on the edge, so it&#x27;s still perfectly usable.  </li>
            <li>I used the comb side at first, and the many little teeth caused my line to be jagged).    </li>
            <li>and as kids, we would always feel cool carrying these in our back pocket.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the classic pocket comb</li>
            <li>the classic ace combs were made I the USA not China&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li>In closing, I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Gently at first (so as to keep from scraping too hard against my scalp) and then with greater vigor, I combed my hair.  </li>
            <li>These new versions of the Ace Classic comb are not manufactured like they used to be.  </li>
            <li>economical buy especially when the men of the house keep losing them!</li>
            <li>Woks fine, inexpensive and sturdy enough to last.</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have and treasure a set of the last \\&quot;Made in USA\\&quot; Ace combs for which I scoured the city to find as the first \\&quot;Made in China\\</li>
            <li>if by magic\\&quot; above, but in truth, there is nothing magical at work; it requires a human hand to operate and, like all things human, the fruits of its labor can be undone by nature.  </li>
            <li>I ran my thumb down the length of its teeth -- it produced a pleasing \\&quot;Zzzzzing!\\&quot; sound.  </li>
            <li>(it was black, but I&#x27;m pretty sure the performance will be the same for all the different colors).  </li>
            <li>The APC performed equally well on the top of my head and the sides; likewise, it combed short and long hairs with no distinction.    </li>
            <li>They are small enough to fit comfortably in a pocket, strong enough to pull through long hair, and sturdy enough that I&#x27;ve only cracked the packaging on one.</li>
            <li>executives should get their offshore products and use them side by side their old ones.  </li>
            <li>They are no wear near as “unbreakable” as they used to be.  </li>
            <li>Cons -- None, so far as I can see.    </li>
            <li>Ace shifted to a much a cheaper product at the same price some time ago, and I&#x27;m still looking for a replacement.  </li>
            <li>Now I know some Fifties purists might be enraged that these are plastic and not the rubber combs of old that allowed them to get their duck&#x27;s</li>
            <li>The comb itself is very sturdy and actually scratches your scalp.</li>
            <li>Soft heads beware.</li>
            <li>For my relatively thick Anglo hair, this model with some widely spaced tines and some narrowly placed ones works best.</li>
            <li>Just a little small, but good quality.  </li>
            <li>They are decent quality and last a while but not indestructible.  </li>
            <li>I needed no more convincing and promptly ordered several APCs for myself and my family.  </li>
            <li>Having been an Ace comb carrier for most of my life, the lack of quality, now displayed, is a true disappointment.</li>
            <li>These are injection molded hard plastic, and the tips of the teeth are notable sharper, whereas the old style comb has smooth rounded teeth - so a definited negative there.  </li>
            <li>I would say these are no better than any toher cheap comb out there.  </li>
            <li>Clearly this comb is crafted from sturdy plastic and is built to last!  </li>
            <li>You know, the old ones that had \\&quot;Ace\\&quot; engraved in gold on them, not the white printing they have now.  </li>
            <li>I do not see why the old feel cannot be brought back.  </li>
            <li>6 pack means my kid has no excuse not to comb his hair.</li>
            <li>They are not much more than half the size of the combs I have bought in stores, and the first one I used broke within one month of first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Ace comb, large and small, are made from hard rubber not plastic as the cheap ones are</li>
            <li>Hard plastic, with wide and fine teeth.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> You can hold it above your lip and pretend it&#x27;s a mustache; 2) You can run it back and forth on a table&#x27;s edge, delighting everyone near you with its sound; 3) You can use it as a ruler, to draw a gentle, curving line (however, if you do so, be sure to use the top side of the APC!  </li>
            <li> The comb in the photo clearly shows both fine and medium teeth.  </li>
            <li> Great hard rubber comb.</li>
            <li> They do work, but I miss the old smooth style.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what it says...</li>
            <li> This is my first one-star review.</li>
            <li> &quot; Ace combs were coming out several or more years ago.  </li>
            <li> The old combs had that rubber feel, silky smooth as they glided over your head.  </li>
            <li> Hair that had been mussed and out of place was suddenly transformed as if by magic into an orderly, and if I do say so, rather fashionable, part.  </li>
            <li> It was at this point that I noticed everyone in the shop looking at me funny.  </li>
            <li> It was a windy day, and so I faced my first test</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, no.  </li>
            <li> My first comb lasted all but one day.  </li>
            <li> The price is better then the local stores.</li>
            <li> I would gladly pay more to get the old style, hard rubber combs if they are available.  </li>
            <li> fine tines are so fine and sharp that they now scratch and irritate your scalp when you comb your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The rubber feel became more plasticy, the body thinner, and the teeth points are often rough and more scratchy feeling (the last one I had felt like plastic \\&quot;flash\\&quot; was still on the points).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ace</li>
            <li> Back in the day, Genuine Ace Hard Rubber combs could easily be found anywhere, they lasted forever, glided smoothly over the scalp and skin, and left hair looking and feeling nice.  </li>
            <li> These are simply plastic and break easily.  </li>
            <li> These are not the Classic  rubber Ace Combs!</li>
            <li> Good long lasting classic vombs</li>
            <li> It is easy to notice these combs have sharp teeth, the old style has smooth teeth.</li>
            <li> I like to carry a comb in my pocket, and have destroyed many cheap combs lately.  </li>
            <li> The combs work very well,</li>
            <li> Only one has broken at all, on the edge, so it&#x27;s still perfectly usable.  </li>
            <li> I used the comb side at first, and the many little teeth caused my line to be jagged).    </li>
            <li> and as kids, we would always feel cool carrying these in our back pocket.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the classic pocket comb</li>
            <li> the classic ace combs were made I the USA not China&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li> In closing, I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> Gently at first (so as to keep from scraping too hard against my scalp) and then with greater vigor, I combed my hair.  </li>
            <li> These new versions of the Ace Classic comb are not manufactured like they used to be.  </li>
            <li> economical buy especially when the men of the house keep losing them!</li>
            <li> Woks fine, inexpensive and sturdy enough to last.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have and treasure a set of the last \\&quot;Made in USA\\&quot; Ace combs for which I scoured the city to find as the first \\&quot;Made in China\\</li>
            <li> if by magic\\&quot; above, but in truth, there is nothing magical at work; it requires a human hand to operate and, like all things human, the fruits of its labor can be undone by nature.  </li>
            <li> I ran my thumb down the length of its teeth -- it produced a pleasing \\&quot;Zzzzzing!\\&quot; sound.  </li>
            <li> (it was black, but I&#x27;m pretty sure the performance will be the same for all the different colors).  </li>
            <li> The APC performed equally well on the top of my head and the sides; likewise, it combed short and long hairs with no distinction.    </li>
            <li> They are small enough to fit comfortably in a pocket, strong enough to pull through long hair, and sturdy enough that I&#x27;ve only cracked the packaging on one.</li>
            <li> executives should get their offshore products and use them side by side their old ones.  </li>
            <li> They are no wear near as “unbreakable” as they used to be.  </li>
            <li> Cons -- None, so far as I can see.    </li>
            <li> Ace shifted to a much a cheaper product at the same price some time ago, and I&#x27;m still looking for a replacement.  </li>
            <li> Now I know some Fifties purists might be enraged that these are plastic and not the rubber combs of old that allowed them to get their duck&#x27;s</li>
            <li> The comb itself is very sturdy and actually scratches your scalp.</li>
            <li> Soft heads beware.</li>
            <li> For my relatively thick Anglo hair, this model with some widely spaced tines and some narrowly placed ones works best.</li>
            <li> Just a little small, but good quality.  </li>
            <li> They are decent quality and last a while but not indestructible.  </li>
            <li> I needed no more convincing and promptly ordered several APCs for myself and my family.  </li>
            <li> Having been an Ace comb carrier for most of my life, the lack of quality, now displayed, is a true disappointment.</li>
            <li> These are injection molded hard plastic, and the tips of the teeth are notable sharper, whereas the old style comb has smooth rounded teeth - so a definited negative there.  </li>
            <li> I would say these are no better than any toher cheap comb out there.  </li>
            <li> Clearly this comb is crafted from sturdy plastic and is built to last!  </li>
            <li> You know, the old ones that had \\&quot;Ace\\&quot; engraved in gold on them, not the white printing they have now.  </li>
            <li> I do not see why the old feel cannot be brought back.  </li>
            <li> 6 pack means my kid has no excuse not to comb his hair.</li>
            <li> They are not much more than half the size of the combs I have bought in stores, and the first one I used broke within one month of first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Ace comb, large and small, are made from hard rubber not plastic as the cheap ones are</li>
            <li> Hard plastic, with wide and fine teeth.  </li>
            <li> As some have said, they are not 7 inches long, but only 5.  </li>
            <li> Nowadays, these cheap Chinese brittle plastic knock-offs with razor-sharp teeth are all you can find - it is sad and shameful.  </li>
            <li> I think I was trying to brush a matted deep pile rug; certainly not hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The Name of Ace is being destroyed by a bunch of executives who apparently care less about brand quality and image.</li>
            <li> It fits nicely in a standard pants pocket and even flexes without cracking when you sit down.  </li>
            <li> To test, I headed down to my local barber&#x27;s to borrow an APC.  </li>
            <li> I have a number of the old hard rubber combs - the say &amp;#34;hard rubber&amp;#34; on them, and did a side by side comparison.  </li>
            <li> If see one marked hard rubber - I would buy it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely sold on the hard rubber material.</li>
            <li> In fairness, however, none of the descriptive text suggests that they are either unbreakable or made of the old hard rubber material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon seems to have a lot of sellers like this.  </li>
            <li> Never had one break and isn&#x27;t rough on the scalp.</li>
            <li> Not much else</li>
            <li> I carefully weighed its pros and cons:    </li>
            <li> , I was hoping the other five would show up soon.</li>
            <li> For more reviews, please see my myspace page: [...]</li>
            <li> the teeth were so sharp, they scratched my head.</li>
            <li> Ace hard rubber combs have become harder to find at local merchants.</li>
            <li> The photo shows a comb with both narrow and wide teeth.</li>
            <li> I called \\&quot;Hi!\\&quot; to my mom and dashed down to my room in the basement.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even discovered a few other uses for this item: 1)</li>
            <li> I got these about a year and a half ago, and somehow have managed not to lose all of them</li>
            <li> I have since had all 3 snap in half.</li>
            <li> By the time I arrived home, my hair was a mess again.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too much trouble to go through the return process or try for a refund.</li>
            <li> However, the combs sent to me by Amazon had all narrow teeth.  </li>
            <li> I always lose these things and after a few times and having to repurchase it again.</li>
            <li> Only one I use (goodie is no good!)</li>
            <li> I carry these in my back pocket and eventually they break in half when I sit the wrong way.</li>
            <li> These are horrible and shame on the moneybags executives who offshored this piece of American history and instead gave their loyal customers an inferior product.</li>
            <li> so breakage isn&#x27;t an issue for me, and the combs I received don&#x27;t have excessive flash on the teeth.</li>
            <li> However these are too small for a man&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> Sharp teeth on the comb scratches the scalp; not a great product.  </li>
            <li> I was a fan of ace hard rubber combs and sought them out,  but these are not them.</li>
            <li> Thought I was purchasing the ACE hard rubber combs.  </li>
            <li> All barber shops used to carry them, but hardly any do today</li>
            <li> Now I do not have to shop for combs again for at least a year.</li>
            <li> I have at least six and keep one ion each of may backpack, briefcase, work drawer.</li>
            <li> Somebody please have some common sense and change the filter to allow 10 words.</li>
            <li> Since people complained about breaking them, I ordered 6.  </li>
            <li> The new ones do a poor job combing the hair and are very uncomfortable to the scalp.  </li>
            <li> I should have stocked up on them then, they are next to impossible to find now.  </li>
            <li> Leaving one star only because it is impossible to leave zero stars.  </li>
            <li> I am truly saddened that this bit of Americana is apparently long gone.  :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to express my disappointment in this garbage.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with ACE Combs.</li>
            <li> How lame.</li>
            <li> but, unfortunately it was not.</li>
            <li> Sad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sad.</li>
            <li> Misrepresentations like this should not be buried in reviews but should jump out at casual browsers.  </li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I returned mine, and listed the bad description as the reason.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed, it&#x27;s got the dimensions I want</li>
            <li> You have saved me the frustration of wasting my money on worthless combs.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely horrible.</li>

            <li> Quality combs, would purchase again.</li>
            <li> What can I say , the combs work!</li>
            <li> I am &amp;#34;always&amp;#34;  losing my comb.  This is a great alternative to running out to the store to replace a lost comb.  Great product at a great price.  Delivered in a timely manner.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with ACE Combs.</li>
            <li> Never had one break and isn&#x27;t rough on the scalp. All in all a great comb! Only one I use (goodie is no good!)</li>
            <li> Too spikey, was hoping for rounder tips.</li>
            <li> I was a fan of ace hard rubber combs and sought them out,  but these are not them. I have a number of the old hard rubber combs - the say &amp;#34;hard rubber&amp;#34; on them, and did a side by side comparison.  I would gladly pay more to get the old style, hard rubber combs if they are available.  These are injection molded hard plastic, and the tips of the teeth are notable sharper, whereas the old style comb has smooth rounded teeth - so a definited negative there.  It is easy to notice these combs have sharp teeth, the old style has smooth teeth. The logo on these is painted on the surface and wears off over time. I have not found them to break - but then I carry them in my shirt pocket. They do work, but I miss the old smooth style.  I would say these are no better than any toher cheap comb out there.  If see one marked hard rubber - I would buy it.  I don&#x27;t know if they make those anymore.  BTW - I bought these over a year ago and have been using them almost daily.</li>
            <li> Hard plastic, with wide and fine teeth.  This is a good deal on a perfectly serviceable product.  Now I do not have to shop for combs again for at least a year.</li>
            <li> what can i say. indestructable they are just rubber 1955 combs</li>
            <li> Exactly what it says... It&#x27;s the classic pocket comb - Reminds me of the &amp;#34;Unbreakable&amp;#34; combs that I grew up with (without the word unbreakable on it). Quality combs that should last quite awhile. (Especially having six of them) They came in a manila envelope that was put between my front door and my screen door. Not much else I can say about the combs...</li>
            <li> This is my first one-star review. I purchased this product expecting six combs, but only one arrived. I haven&#x27;t opened it yet, I was hoping the other five would show up soon. No such luck. It&#x27;s too much trouble to go through the return process or try for a refund. I&#x27;m disappointed, it&#x27;s got the dimensions I want but the single-comb package is not what I ordered or paid for.</li>
            <li> The classic combs shown in the photo are fantastic combs that hold up quite well, after being sat on and everything.  They are sturdy and work well.  My only issue was that I was sent the fine-tooth combs instead, which are much more cheaply made and are sure to break and fall apart fairly quickly.  Amazon has fantastic customer service though, and refunded my money for these, since I didn&#x27;t receive the correct thing. :)</li>
            <li> Good quality, good price.</li>
            <li> The teeth on the combs get bent out of shape very easily</li>
            <li> I never bought any combs but Ace as the gold standard of combs, but here is a problem, for what used to be a 5 star product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have and treasure a set of the last \\&quot;Made in USA\\&quot; Ace combs for which I scoured the city to find as the first \\&quot;Made in China\\&quot; Ace combs were coming out several or more years ago.  You know, the old ones that had \\&quot;Ace\\&quot; engraved in gold on them, not the white printing they have now.  I am glad I did.  The old combs had that rubber feel, silky smooth as they glided over your head.  But something happened when production went to China.  The rubber feel became more plasticy, the body thinner, and the teeth points are often rough and more scratchy feeling (the last one I had felt like plastic \\&quot;flash\\&quot; was still on the points).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ace executives should get their offshore products and use them side by side their old ones.  Maybe no one cares, and price is all that metters, but quality is something that still counts.  I do not see why the old feel cannot be brought back.  If I find a better comb, I will buy it.  I haven&#x27;t found it yet.  But I&#x27;d rather it be an Ace.</li>
            <li> Wish these were as good as they used to be.  They are no wear near as “unbreakable” as they used to be.  They are decent quality and last a while but not indestructible.  Maybe they know that since they sell the pocket come in a pack of 6!  Will not be able to give this a five star since I know they can, and used to be made much better.  Unfortunately I have not found anything better to replace it.</li>
            <li> These are the best pocket combs on the market they don&#x27;t break easily and are just the right size.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find these Ace combs in a 6 pack!  My husband uses these and is forever misplacing them.  Causes great agitation when he does, so in the interest of keeping him safe (from me!) and sane, I bought these as soon as I found them.  They&#x27;re a good, flexible, sturdy comb and live up to their name.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my stepson, who likes to carry a comb with him but tends to misplace them. When the box came to my door, there was only one comb in the package. How lame.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a good pocket comb Ive carried for years, takes me back to the fifties and DA cuts</li>
            <li> Thought I was purchasing the ACE hard rubber combs.  These are simply plastic and break easily.  The product description should have mentioned that these were plastic.  Shame on the Ace company</li>
            <li> It looked like the comb I was looking for......but, unfortunately it was not. The teeth broke out at various times, while combing my hair. I was looking for a more reliable comb.</li>
            <li> I have used the Ace comb for over 50 years.  It doesn&#x27;t pull your hair, doesn&#x27;t break easily and keeps its teeth.  It fits nicely in a standard pants pocket and even flexes without cracking when you sit down.  All barber shops used to carry them, but hardly any do today (then they don&#x27;t carry any of the things they used to).  Hence, a trip to the drug store and about $1.20 to 2.40 per comb in a two pack.  Now though, I have found them on Amazon in a six-pack and the price is a great buy . . .  and the way I lose combs, a godsend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guys - if you need a superior pocket comb that will hide neatly in your pocket, fit easily in the car console, or even over the visor, then this is the one.  Ladies - you will appreciate that, while not a miracle grooming tool, it will come in handy and fit nicely into an evening or other clutch bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a dozen and now I have one in my night stand, medicine cabinet, car, van, camper, wife&#x27;s purse (in case I forget), tool box, shop drawer and in my pocket (until I loose it, again), but no problem, I have have two spares and I can get more on Amazon at a great price.</li>
            <li> Absolutely horrible. Used these combs all the time growing up. To me, they were a staple of Americana I always associated with \\&quot;Grease\\&quot; and as kids, we would always feel cool carrying these in our back pocket. Grown up, I like to use quality items. I don&#x27;t need 6 combs for $2. I&#x27;d probably buy 2 or 3 at $5 each if they were the quality ones from back in the day. These are horrible and shame on the moneybags executives who offshored this piece of American history and instead gave their loyal customers an inferior product.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, nice compact size</li>
            <li> These are pretty good combs but they will break if bent too far. I carry these in my back pocket and eventually they break in half when I sit the wrong way.</li>
            <li> These combs are nice &amp; the price is great. The same comb as this one is .97 at WalMart. That is each combs price. I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> The Ace comb, large and small, are made from hard rubber not plastic as the cheap ones are and they can scratch your scalp.  I have used exclusively Ace for 50 years.</li>
            <li> Every gentleman should stock this item</li>
            <li> No, it&#x27;s not made of rubber like in the days of yore (you kids git offa my lawn!) but hey, the comb drags thru my hair and helps to arrange it into some semblance of normality.  I don&#x27;t carry a comb in my back pocket so breakage isn&#x27;t an issue for me, and the combs I received don&#x27;t have excessive flash on the teeth. In short, it&#x27;s a cheap comb; I don&#x27;t need anything more. YMMV.</li>
            <li> I also would like to thank all the honest reviews of this inferior product - you saved me the aggravation of buying (and hating) these cheap pieces of junk.  Back in the day, Genuine Ace Hard Rubber combs could easily be found anywhere, they lasted forever, glided smoothly over the scalp and skin, and left hair looking and feeling nice.  I should have stocked up on them then, they are next to impossible to find now.  Nowadays, these cheap Chinese brittle plastic knock-offs with razor-sharp teeth are all you can find - it is sad and shameful.  Leaving one star only because it is impossible to leave zero stars.  I am truly saddened that this bit of Americana is apparently long gone.  :(</li>
            <li> I have at least six and keep one ion each of may backpack, briefcase, work drawer. Flexible and does not scratch.</li>
            <li> This is the only brand of hair comb I will buy. My dad used to buy them when I was a kid... and even to this day... I&#x27;m completely sold on the hard rubber material. Most combs seem to be made with cheap plastic that creates static discharge and causes your hair to stand on end. This one does not. For my relatively thick Anglo hair, this model with some widely spaced tines and some narrowly placed ones works best.</li>
            <li> as expected&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> Good basic comb. It didn&#x27;t snag my hair or rip it. I only use a comb when I have conditioner in it.</li>
            <li> Ace hard rubber combs have become harder to find at local merchants. Ordering this set of 6 seemed a convenient solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned, these are not the same combs. They are not much more than half the size of the combs I have bought in stores, and the first one I used broke within one month of first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These combs get one star only because it is not possible to give zero stars.</li>
            <li> economical buy especially when the men of the house keep losing them!</li>
            <li> What more can you say?  I lose pocket combs regularly, and came across this multiple comb set; it is ideal -- and well priced!</li>
            <li> Fine quality, cheap in bulk, and not too lightweight. May not be brand name, but they work for me. Plastic.</li>
            <li> Makes combing your hair easy!    Before buying my Ace Pocket Comb (hereafter, APC) I carefully weighed its pros and cons:    Pros -- It combs my hair.  Cons -- None, so far as I can see.    So far so good: When you got something on the \\&quot;pros\\&quot; side of the notepad, and nothing on the \\&quot;cons\\&quot; side, you&#x27;re probably looking at a good deal!  But I&#x27;ve been combing my hair for 30-odd years now, and I needed to know *for sure* that the APC would meet all my hair-grooming needs.  To test, I headed down to my local barber&#x27;s to borrow an APC.  Jackpot!  There on the counter was a jar full of them.    With trembling hands, I took one (it was black, but I&#x27;m pretty sure the performance will be the same for all the different colors).  I ran my thumb down the length of its teeth -- it produced a pleasing \\&quot;Zzzzzing!\\&quot; sound.  Clearly this comb is crafted from sturdy plastic and is built to last!  Gently at first (so as to keep from scraping too hard against my scalp) and then with greater vigor, I combed my hair.  The effect was immediate: Hair that had been mussed and out of place was suddenly transformed as if by magic into an orderly, and if I do say so, rather fashionable, part.  The APC performed equally well on the top of my head and the sides; likewise, it combed short and long hairs with no distinction.    It was at this point that I noticed everyone in the shop looking at me funny.  So I slipped the APC into my pocket (another bonus!  As implied by its name, the APC does indeed fit into pockets, whether shirt, shorts, or pants -- even Members Only jackets, as I can happily report!) and exited onto the street.  It was a windy day, and so I faced my first test: Would the APC&#x27;s handiwork resist the aeolian gale?  Unfortunately, no.  And this is why I rate the product 4 stars and not 5.  I used the phrase \\&quot;as if by magic\\&quot; above, but in truth, there is nothing magical at work; it requires a human hand to operate and, like all things human, the fruits of its labor can be undone by nature.  By the time I arrived home, my hair was a mess again.  I called \\&quot;Hi!\\&quot; to my mom and dashed down to my room in the basement.  Standing before my mirror, I re-combed my hair using the APC.  As before, the transformation was as sudden as it was amazing.    I needed no more convincing and promptly ordered several APCs for myself and my family.  As the months have passed, I&#x27;ve been satisfied with its performance time and time again.  I&#x27;ve even discovered a few other uses for this item: 1) You can hold it above your lip and pretend it&#x27;s a mustache; 2) You can run it back and forth on a table&#x27;s edge, delighting everyone near you with its sound; 3) You can use it as a ruler, to draw a gentle, curving line (however, if you do so, be sure to use the top side of the APC!  I used the comb side at first, and the many little teeth caused my line to be jagged).    In closing, I highly recommend this product.  For more reviews, please see my myspace page: [...]</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to express my disappointment in this garbage.  Ace shifted to a much a cheaper product at the same price some time ago, and I&#x27;m still looking for a replacement.  These aren&#x27;t it, and shame on Ace for cashing in on a good reputation and cheating their customers.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my husband as he only likes this brand of comb.  We couldn&#x27;t find this brand in any of our local stores, so was happy to find it online.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the original ACE , but the best out there.</li>
            <li> Great hard rubber comb. Quality not found at chain stores.</li>
            <li> Products are not as advertised.  As some have said, they are not 7 inches long, but only 5.  I returned mine, and listed the bad description as the reason.</li>
            <li> A great old standard comb at a fantastic price.</li>
            <li> These are plastic combs that will break within days. My first comb lasted all but one day.  I bought cheaper combs that lasted longer.&lt;br /&gt;The Name of Ace is being destroyed by a bunch of executives who apparently care less about brand quality and image. Sad.</li>
            <li> And the Goody Gang didn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s a cheap six pack of good combs, and that makes it a good deal. Now I know some Fifties purists might be enraged that these are plastic and not the rubber combs of old that allowed them to get their duck&#x27;s a** just so before cruising to the sock hop and trying to talk Peggy Sue into the back seat of their dad&#x27;s DeSoto, but hey, them&#x27;s the breaks.</li>
            <li> Good long lasting classic vombs</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and was as described. The combs work very well, so I would recommend buying these to anyone.</li>
            <li> I got these about a year and a half ago, and somehow have managed not to lose all of them (I think we still have 4 of them left).  Only one has broken at all, on the edge, so it&#x27;s still perfectly usable.  I think I was trying to brush a matted deep pile rug; certainly not hair.  If only they came in different colors so you could accessorize!</li>
            <li> I have been buying Ace pocket combs for years and the only place I could find them was Walgreens.  I recently bought two of them.&lt;br /&gt;They are not the Ace combs they used to be.  They have cheapened them.&lt;br /&gt;The fine tines are so fine and sharp that they now scratch and irritate your scalp when you comb your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fire the person who cheapened this product and go back to making the way you used to.  Your combs&lt;br /&gt;no longer are the best they are just like any other cheap comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cruikshank1@comcast.net</li>
            <li> I am not a big comb guy, but these were the best combs I ever bought. Not expensive, but work great.</li>
            <li> These new versions of the Ace Classic comb are not manufactured like they used to be.  The new ones do a poor job combing the hair and are very uncomfortable to the scalp.  Don&#x27;t ask me how or why this is, but you won&#x27;t want these.  It&#x27;s sad.</li>
            <li> Bought three of these last year for .99 a piece at wal-mart. I have since had all 3 snap in half. Junk!</li>
            <li> I wish to extend my thanks to everyone who posted an honest review of these inferior Chinese products.  You have saved me the frustration of wasting my money on worthless combs.  I sincerely hope the Ace company will soon realize that quantity (the pack of six) will never be a substitute for quality.  Having been an Ace comb carrier for most of my life, the lack of quality, now displayed, is a true disappointment.</li>
            <li> The photo shows a comb with both narrow and wide teeth. However, the combs sent to me by Amazon had all narrow teeth.  Why doesn&#x27;t Amazon use a pictute the correctly describes the product?</li>
            <li> Excellent comb. What can you say about a comb?  Somebody please have some common sense and change the filter to allow 10 words.</li>
            <li> The comb in the photo clearly shows both fine and medium teeth.  The accompanying text also specifically says \\&quot;Has both fine and medium teeth for all hair types\\&quot;.  Nonetheless, the combs shipped have nothing but fine teeth.  This seller does not ship the product advertised and if that&#x27;s what you want, you should find it somewhere else. As others have noted, they are no longer marked or labeled \\&quot;Unbreakable\\&quot; and most certainly are not. In fairness, however, none of the descriptive text suggests that they are either unbreakable or made of the old hard rubber material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon seems to have a lot of sellers like this.  I think there should be a way for Amazon customers to post an obvious \\&quot;Liar\\&quot; or \\&quot;Fraud\\&quot; badge on the pages of sellers like this.  Misrepresentations like this should not be buried in reviews but should jump out at casual browsers.  If they did, the misrepresentations would stop quickly.  This is an Amazon problem more than anything else.</li>
            <li> Good decent combs, right rigidity and flexibility.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for; nothing fancy, just practical and economical.  Since people complained about breaking them, I ordered 6.  I have yet to break even one of them; of course, I don&#x27;t put the comb into my back pocket.</li>
            <li> ACE combs used to be good solid rubber products. These are plastic and made in China. Disappointing. Sure, they&#x27;ll part your hair, but not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> These are not the Classic  rubber Ace Combs! these comb are plastic the classic ace combs were made I the USA not China&lt;br /&gt;Plus they put holes in your jean pockets</li>
            <li> They are plastic combs</li>
            <li> Seems as good as my old original pocket comb which I still carry. BTW it has only lost one tooth in over 50 years of service. I biught these as gifts.</li>
            <li> Sharp teeth on the comb scratches the scalp; not a great product.  This seems to be another case of fixing an earlier design that was not broke!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t break like the ones I had bought at a local drugstore</li>
            <li> Hard-rubber ACE combs never scratch and the spine are smoother which reduces pulling out hair. I was just stocking up in case they might be discontinued. Service and shipping were good.</li>
            <li> Just a little small, but good quality.  By buying six, I have not lost a one yet. This was good insurance.</li>
            <li> This comb is good value for the money.  The price is better then the local stores.</li>
            <li> 6 pack means my kid has no excuse not to comb his hair. good product good price</li>
            <li> Good product. Excellent service.</li>
            <li> What can one say about combs - this is my favorite and about every 3-4 months need to replace the one I have in my hip pocket</li>
            <li> I love these combs. Combs my hair like a comb should. The comb itself is very sturdy and actually scratches your scalp. Soft heads beware.</li>
            <li> the teeth were so sharp, they scratched my head.</li>
            <li> My husband loves these combs.</li>
            <li> Woks fine, inexpensive and sturdy enough to last.</li>
            <li> I found something better...</li>
            <li> I like to carry a comb in my pocket, and have destroyed many cheap combs lately.  I bought a six-pack of the Ace Pocket Combs hoping they would hold up slightly better - which they have.  They are small enough to fit comfortably in a pocket, strong enough to pull through long hair, and sturdy enough that I&#x27;ve only cracked the packaging on one.</li>
            <li> Combs by ACE are the best.  However these are too small for a man&#x27;s hair.  Next time I will order a larger size.  These would probably be great for children with small hands.</li>
            <li> I always lose these things and after a few times and having to repurchase it again. I found a great bargain on a great product.</li>
            <li> I wear a helment when on the bike/motorcycle and sometimes need to fix up my hair when I get where I&#x27;m going. This 6 pack allows me to keep 1 at work, 1 on the bike, 1 at home, 1 in my travel bag, and 1 in the car.</li>
