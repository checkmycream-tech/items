            <li>The pinks work just as fabulous as their my first one.</li>
            <li>Makes straightening hair fast and easy.</li>
            <li>It really works well on curly hair and it get close to my hair roots and heats up really quick!  </li>
            <li>It is not quite as bright pink as it is in the manufacturers picture.</li>
            <li>I heard of Andis because my sister has a Andis flat iron and it worked so well that I had to get my own.</li>
            <li>The flat iron gets really hot and it curls my hair nicely.</li>
            <li>This is as good as a high-priced iron I bought previously.  </li>

            <li>I have coarse hair and if it can straighten my hair, I&#x27;m sure it can straighten</li>
            <li>It has hot spots as well.</li>
            <li>I have loved using this flat iron -- it makes my hair look silky and smooth with minimal effort.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to damage the hair if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>so I had to buy my own in pink!</li>
            <li>I received it today, part of the finger pad is peel off and rose up, but when the handle turned too hot made the finger pad lower down.</li>
            <li>It is really unsafe for short-hair style user with hot handles.</li>
            <li>Had it along time works very well and still going</li>
            <li>Pink color is cute.</li>
            <li>cuz i dont mind it,it does heat up RILLY fast.so when your on the go or your man is taping his foot at the bathroom door, you&#x27;ll be out fast.....</li>
            <li>It was very inconvenient!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but i doubt there is much you can do about that.</li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t used the straightener very often.  </li>
            <li>I love it so much in fact that I have purchased it in pink.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this flat iron for anyone who wants to treat their hair right!</li>
            <li>First of all let me say I just love the color in pink and the shipping was so fast that I received the item the next day after placing my order!!!</li>
            <li>so i wanted something that would get my new growth straight without heat damage.</li>
            <li>It does an OKAY job, but the only way that i can get my super thick but fairly straight hair to STAY straight in Oregon is to straighten the night before i want to wear it straight and also the day i want it straight.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Obviously I find that I LOVE this flat iron.</li>
            <li>For the first couple of months i really liked this flat iron, but lately it hasnt been doing very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>HEY.. i know all the reviews have been saying about girls with African american hair, but i have blond fine hair,... and it works for me also,</li>
            <li>basically  just made my hair look brand new.</li>
            <li>This is my first Andis flat iron that I&#x27;ve purchased and I looove it.</li>
            <li>the handles are too hot, I don&#x27;t like this flat iron and don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li>This is the second Andis flat iron I have owned the other one was stolen by my big sis, but it works great, never even used it on the highest setting and it helped me maintain my hair pre-relaxer in my last weeks.</li>
            <li>The plates did get a little scratched from use, however it is better than turning colors like the traditional gold/bronze color plates.</li>
            <li>I have tried 4 different techniques and it just comes out straight.</li>
            <li>So far it is getting the job done.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s def worth the price plus the pink color</li>
            <li>More of a baby pink like the other review photos!</li>
            <li>actually its not that small,there is a chance you mite not like that there isnt a # to see how high the temp.</li>
            <li>This flat iron doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out like most and it gets the job done better than my expensive flat irons.</li>
            <li>This is the only flat iron that I have seen that can lock close, very convenient when storing.</li>
            <li>I just  used it  on my natural hair and my hair does feel noticeably  softer and is definitely shiny.</li>
            <li>I have had zero problems with this flat iron so far.</li>
            <li>I have waist length natural African American and Caucasian hair</li>
            <li>I plan on passing my first one down to a girl friend of mine whose flat iron just died after having been dropped on her bathroom floor.</li>
            <li>Used my previous Andis flat iron for six years before I decided that it was ready to retire, so I upgraded to this version</li>

            <li> I already had this same flat iron in blue color a year ago</li>
            <li> but I gave it to my sister because I wanted to use my &#x27;expensive &amp; better&#x27; flat iron instead.</li>
            <li> When I want to straight hair from the back of my neck, I usually use both hands.</li>
            <li> I recommend using a heat protection spray or flat iron balm on your hair prior to flat ironing your hair.</li>
            <li> But for my coarse, dry, curly hair it takes several passes to straighten.  </li>
            <li> I also flat ironed my weave and it  </li>
            <li> This flat iron was a gift for my daughter</li>
            <li> I have never had a problem with my hair and the Andis flat irons.</li>
            <li> a flat iron is a flat iron is a flat iron and who cares if it does not work like a salon flat iron just get</li>
            <li> The only draw back is its pink color, but if you can get over that, then you&#x27;re set.</li>
            <li> It does the job just as well as other, much more expensive, flat irons for a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells terrible when it is hot and the both handles which cover the plates are super hot.</li>
            <li> But other than that I can&#x27;t complain especially for the price and color!</li>
            <li> I am black and my hair plays for the coarse team.</li>
            <li> I had previously bought a Wigo for $150 but after it died a month later, I swore that I would never purchase another straightener...</li>
            <li> I gave it a 4 star because I wish it was a little bigger like 1 1/2\\</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron in black in 2006.</li>
            <li> so I need lots of help and two to flat iron on my hair equals less time.</li>
            <li> I am African American with semi thick hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this flat iron was less than thirty dollars!</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s pink!  </li>
            <li> The flat iron is still kicking through all kinds of use and and slight damage (dropped it a few times but it never stopped working).</li>
            <li> Also the plates have been coming loose a little bit so that almost every time i clamp down on my hair it gets caught and breaks my hair.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first, with the straightener being so affordable, but it has surpassed my expectations.</li>
            <li> if your into pink its just for you if your not into the color then your missing out.</li>
            <li> I loooooove that its pink!!</li>
            <li> I like Andis products because they well constructed but not so heavy that my arms and hands do not tire during the day</li>
            <li> Not too heavy to hold.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, the package looked like it had been opened and even possibly used.  </li>
            <li> i was kinda hesitant when there was a comment that said it was small....</li>
            <li> Disappointingly, the ceramic finish on the plates is wearing off after only 6 months of use.</li>
            <li> If you purchase this flat iron you will NOT be sorry, I assure you!</li>
            <li> No gd can&#x27;t uses wrong plug on them waste of money  </li>
            <li> my 2 little girls  rant over !!!</li>
            <li> I am quite disappointed about this flat</li>
            <li> (Used on caucasian, medium-length, curly -but thin - hair)</li>
            <li> so bad read think u get from how very bad take ppl money big let down for</li>
            <li> they always get twisted up and tangled...</li>
            <li> but need to use a glove :(.</li>

            <li> I have loved using this flat iron -- it makes my hair look silky and smooth with minimal effort.  Disappointingly, the ceramic finish on the plates is wearing off after only 6 months of use.</li>
            <li> Had it along time works very well and still going</li>
            <li> Sadly, the package looked like it had been opened and even possibly used.  There were about 20 deep scratches on the ceramic plates.  Never got to try it out to know whether it was a good product or not.  First return ever to Amazon.</li>
            <li> I just  used it  on my natural hair and my hair does feel noticeably  softer and is definitely shiny. I am black and my hair plays for the coarse team. I also flat ironed my weave and it  basically  just made my hair look brand new. This product also comes with a five year warranty which is great, I love the size, love the color.</li>
            <li> This flat iron was a gift for my daughter but I have one just like it and it&#x27;s still working great after 5 years. It&#x27;s a perfect size in my opinion and heats up fast. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first, with the straightener being so affordable, but it has surpassed my expectations. I had previously bought a Wigo for $150 but after it died a month later, I swore that I would never purchase another straightener...that was until I got a cute cut that looked better with straighter hair. It has a great temperature dial control and heats up quickly and evenly. My hair is African American and I do have a relaxer and the iron works great for it. The only draw back is its pink color, but if you can get over that, then you&#x27;re set.</li>
            <li> This flat iron works great! I loooooove that its pink!! This is the only flat iron that I have seen that can lock close, very convenient when storing. The plates did get a little scratched from use, however it is better than turning colors like the traditional gold/bronze color plates. I would recommend this flat iron for anyone who wants to treat their hair right! It leaves my hair and my daughters hair soft, smooth and shiny!! Oh did I mention that the price was excellent!!!</li>
            <li> I heard that tourmaline ceramic is very good for your hair to lock in moisture. This flat iron doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out like most and it gets the job done better than my expensive flat irons. I have coarse hair and if it can straighten my hair, I&#x27;m sure it can straighten anyone else&#x27;s out! Plus, it gets nice and silky! I can&#x27;t believe this flat iron was less than thirty dollars! I already had this same flat iron in blue color a year ago but I gave it to my sister because I wanted to use my &#x27;expensive &amp; better&#x27; flat iron instead. I started using hers to test it out and I like it better so I had to buy my own in pink! It heats up quickly and I like that it automatically turns off after a while because sometimes I&#x27;m in a hurry and I forget to unplug it. Great product!</li>
            <li> First of all let me say I just love the color in pink and the shipping was so fast that I received the item the next day after placing my order!!! I heard of Andis because my sister has a Andis flat iron and it worked so well that I had to get my own. I am so happy with my purchase that I had to try it as soon as I received the package. And let me tell u it works just as great as my sister&#x27;s. I gave it a 4 star because I wish it was a little bigger like 1 1/2\\&quot; in. But other than that I can&#x27;t complain especially for the price and color!</li>
            <li> This is my second Andis. The last 1 lasted about 2 years.  I have never had a problem with my hair and the Andis flat irons. My hair is shiny.  I love their products!</li>
            <li> This is my first Andis flat iron that I&#x27;ve purchased and I looove it. The flat iron gets really hot and it curls my hair nicely. I am African American with semi thick hair. It&#x27;s def worth the price plus the pink color makes it even more fun to have:-D</li>
            <li> Heats quickly. Makes straightening hair fast and easy. Surface of heated plates is smooth and hair glides nicely. Closing device is clever &amp; handy. (Used on caucasian, medium-length, curly -but thin - hair) Pink color is cute. Great cause. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product! Got here on time! Auto shut off is fantastic. Equal to some straighteners I&#x27;ve paid double the price for.</li>
            <li> HEY.. i know all the reviews have been saying about girls with African american hair, but i have blond fine hair,... and it works for me also,i was kinda hesitant when there was a comment that said it was small.... actually its not that small,there is a chance you mite not like that there isnt a # to see how high the temp. gose.but i didn&#x27;t put a 4 cuz i dont mind it,it does heat up RILLY fast.so when your on the go or your man is taping his foot at the bathroom door, you&#x27;ll be out fast.....LOL...well i do think every girl,woman NEEDS this if your into pink its just for you if your not into the color then your missing out.GET IT youll be happy........... SPECIALLY sens you&#x27;ll have more money in your pocket</li>
            <li> This is as good as a high-priced iron I bought previously.  it does lack some of the features of the higher-priced item, however.</li>
            <li> No gd can&#x27;t uses wrong plug on them waste of money  no star don&#x27;t no say can&#x27;t uses in England  so bad read think u get from how very bad take ppl money big let down for my 2 little girls  rant over !!!</li>
            <li> I like Andis products because they well constructed but not so heavy that my arms and hands do not tire during the day</li>
            <li> Used my previous Andis flat iron for six years before I decided that it was ready to retire, so I upgraded to this version and I love it.  It does the job just as well as other, much more expensive, flat irons for a fraction of the price.  Plus, it&#x27;s pink!  It does get very hot, so I recommend using a heat protection spray or flat iron balm on your hair prior to flat ironing your hair.</li>
            <li> I am quite disappointed about this flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells terrible when it is hot and the both handles which cover the plates are super hot. I couldn&#x27;t hold it for more than 2 seconds. The finger Pads are also too small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have short hair. It is really unsafe for short-hair style user with hot handles. When I want to straight hair from the back of my neck, I usually use both hands. But since the finger pads are too small and the area around them are too hot, I had to use only one hand. It was very inconvenient!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received it today, part of the finger pad is peel off and rose up, but when the handle turned too hot made the finger pad lower down. *_* It is made in China, looks quite dusty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the handles are too hot, I don&#x27;t like this flat iron and don&#x27;t recommend it. I&#x27;ve been considering to return it or keep it but need to use a glove :(.</li>
            <li> For the first couple of months i really liked this flat iron, but lately it hasnt been doing very well.&lt;br /&gt;The plates are losing the silver titanium stuff and once thats gone its starts burning your hair!! Also it does NOT have constant heat. I straighten my hair in 5 layers and after each layer i have to wait 5-10 minutes to do the next layer because it tales FOREVER to heat up! It has hot spots as well. It takes 10-15 minutes to heat up. Also the plates have been coming loose a little bit so that almost every time i clamp down on my hair it gets caught and breaks my hair. It does an OKAY job, but the only way that i can get my super thick but fairly straight hair to STAY straight in Oregon is to straighten the night before i want to wear it straight and also the day i want it straight. Takes about 30-50 minutes to straighten. It DOES NOT curl at all. I have tried 4 different techniques and it just comes out straight. I DONT RECOMEND!</li>
            <li> I love Andis!! This is a great flat iron.  Works awesome on my hair... my only downfall is always the cord.... they always get twisted up and tangled... but i doubt there is much you can do about that. otherwise its awesome.</li>
            <li> Nice product.  Not too heavy to hold.  But for my coarse, dry, curly hair it takes several passes to straighten.  I need a good heat protectant product, but these are pricey so I haven&#x27;t used the straightener very often.  It&#x27;s easy to damage the hair if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> The product came fast and it is great for the price. Wouldn&#x27;t use it every day since it tends to pull.</li>
            <li> I am in the process of transitioning from a relaxer so i wanted something that would get my new growth straight without heat damage. So far it is getting the job done.</li>
            <li> This is the second Andis flat iron I have owned the other one was stolen by my big sis, but it works great, never even used it on the highest setting and it helped me maintain my hair pre-relaxer in my last weeks. Great Product.</li>
            <li> I have had zero problems with this flat iron so far. I am loving the locking feature which makes it perfect for travel since I am always flying! It is not quite as bright pink as it is in the manufacturers picture. More of a baby pink like the other review photos!</li>
            <li> Ok,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought this flat iron in black in 2006. I was like \\&quot;okay a flat iron is a flat iron is a flat iron and who cares if it does not work like a salon flat iron just get one\\&quot;. Boy, am I ever happy that I did. The flat iron is still kicking through all kinds of use and and slight damage (dropped it a few times but it never stopped working). It is like Michael Meyers (from the Halloween movies), it just won&#x27;t die! Obviously I find that I LOVE this flat iron. I love it so much in fact that I have purchased it in pink. Two of them in fact. I have waist length natural African American and Caucasian hair so I need lots of help and two to flat iron on my hair equals less time. I plan on passing my first one down to a girl friend of mine whose flat iron just died after having been dropped on her bathroom floor. The pinks work just as fabulous as their my first one. In my opinion they work better than a CHI. If you purchase this flat iron you will NOT be sorry, I assure you!</li>
