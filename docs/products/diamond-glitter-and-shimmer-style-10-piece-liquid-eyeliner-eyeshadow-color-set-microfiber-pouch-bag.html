            <li>/&gt;Disclosure - I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>All thoughts, opinions and ratings are my own.</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t expect it to be so watery</li>
            <li>Kind of watery.</li>
            <li>But once its on, its nice.</li>
            <li>Nice array of colors.</li>
            <li>Some of the colors are great but some aren&#x27;t exactly what I had imagined they would be.  </li>
            <li>Delivery  was fast and colors are beautiful.  </li>
            <li>Colors are nice and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>I love it..</li>
            <li>It is challenging to get the glitter to be visible</li>
            <li>and I get many compliments.</li>
            <li>i really am satisfied with these eyeliners.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>They are okay.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t stay on as well as I would like, but they are okay</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love glitter, so these eyeliners were perfect for the extra sparkle around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s more water solution than glitter</li>
            <li>they are so smooth and don&#x27;t irritate the eyes!</li>
            <li>These are really cute</li>
            <li>All in all the blue is perfect.</li>
            <li>It would have been a better buy if the eyeshadow was included</li>
            <li>These eyeliners I love them.</li>
            <li>The eyeliner itself is okay.</li>
            <li>Its just ok..</li>
            <li>and  you get  sexy sparkle</li>
            <li>This product is of excellent quality, you can buy with confidence and security, the price is very affordable for anyone who wants to buy it.</li>
            <li>, the good thing is they came really fast,</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure they would be useful for cheerleaders as well!</li>
            <li>It was smooth and non-burning to eyes.</li>
            <li>It looks really cheap.</li>
            <li>but overall this was a great purchase.</li>
            <li>These are honestly such a great product for the price.</li>
            <li>If you want more pigment you must put on more and this leads to a very unattractive clump in the corners of your eyes.</li>
            <li>A very useful product for color guard</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I was looking for glitter eyeliner and when I saw this, I got super excited.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Check out the video to see the full review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, I thought this was a really good product.</li>
            <li>those are  nice colors ,but they take for ever to dry out ,i thought they were better than this after reading the reviews</li>
            <li>10 DIFFERENT COLORS, AND IT MADE A GREAT ADDITION TO MY EYESHADOW, VERY VIBRANT AND STAYED ON ALL DAY.</li>
            <li>love the colors and how they go on highly recommend</li>
            <li>Very pretty.</li>
            <li>I expected some bold bright color and, tons of sparkle...</li>
            <li>I really like the idea of this set, but when put to use they are really light.</li>
            <li>this is worth it</li>
            <li>Waiting to return them, there is more clear liquid than glitter, the color do not show up well.</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely HOWEVER, it clumps to your lid and it makes your eyelid look gross.</li>
            <li>Best to use over your regular eyeliner but still not very shimmery.  </li>
            <li>These are fun if you are looking to experiment with glitter liners without paying the price of a high-end brand.</li>
            <li>That wins it a rate of 5 stars.</li>
            <li>She was very happy with the liners, she said easy to put it on and off, they clean off easy and she has a different color on all the time and for the price I paid, I will never tell her what I paid because she thinks they were so expensive</li>
            <li>first i thought how would it look when i apply such colors ...to my surprise, its amazing ..</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so pretty and colorful and glittery.</li>
            <li>super fast shipping thank you</li>
            <li>The shipping was very fast (arrived in 2 days), and the product arrived intact.</li>
            <li>Looks pretty but does not go onto eyes.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>Very shiny!</li>
            <li>and it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Thanks for taking the time to read my review!</li>
            <li>But other than that I love them!</li>
            <li>the colors are so pretty.</li>
            <li>Work well and very portable!</li>
            <li>Certain ones definitely work better than others.</li>
            <li>Love these except the blue is very watery and doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I was under no obligation to post a review or give positive feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The green and the silver were fairly pigmented, so I felt like I got a decent deal for the price.</li>
            <li>It is really good to add a little sparle to your normal eyeliner.</li>
            <li>The colors looked amazing in the bottles, but turned out watery and unpigmented when applied alone and layered over black.</li>
            <li>Even for someone who can&#x27;t draw, using these to create glitter facial designs has been easy.</li>
            <li>Good long lasting......</li>
            <li>On the lids, not so much.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t like this product because it doesn&#x27;t go on well.</li>
            <li>but I will, they have become one of my absolute favs when putting on makeup.</li>
            <li>and, the shadow is very watery.</li>
            <li>It shipped really fast too.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery too</li>
            <li>/&gt;they are very inexpensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like these glitters</li>
            <li>Suggested for anyone who wants to add a pop of color to their makeup.</li>
            <li>Real junk..</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s ok for the silver and gold but for the other colors, not so much.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply but take a while to dry.</li>
            <li>I liked this, the only problem is they take forever to dry, and when they do they clump.</li>
            <li>Not a long lasting liner so it is okay like a dollar store item.</li>
            <li>but...some of the colors show up better than others, and a few of them are really watery.</li>
            <li>they came with this cute little black pouch which i love</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re out there looking for a little more &#x27;pop&#x27; to your eye makeup</li>
            <li>I most likely would not buy there again just because of how long the shipping was.</li>
            <li>Thats kind of ridiculous.</li>
            <li>Long lasting and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>The product seems old.  </li>
            <li>The only one that really pops is the silver.  </li>
            <li>I really like the extra bedazzle it give to my stage makeup</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve found a use for each color so far.</li>
            <li>I found the same results, really light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I try to provide you with simple reviews that get straight to the point without a lot of jargon or repeating the product description.</li>
            <li>old niece.</li>
            <li>It must be used in a very specific makeup as they are very watery</li>
            <li>I really like half of the liners,they were bright and intense,but the other half required two,or even three coats to be noticed.</li>
            <li>Brush to small, more like novelty makeup then actual makeuo.</li>
            <li>There was no black brown or purple.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product, but it fell short.</li>
            <li>Some of them (the black one for instance) doesn&#x27;t really show much glitter</li>
            <li>I dont really wear make-up, but i needed to find blue sparkles for my little cousin to match her dress for her first ever dance.</li>
            <li>Lately I&#x27;ve become a huge makeup junkie,lol.</li>
            <li>but it is kind of scary.  </li>
            <li>its verry cool kinda flashy fun</li>
            <li>and i applied black eyeliner first before i applied the colored eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Buy something that actually works and that is not dry!</li>
            <li>The little bag that comes with the eyeliners is also very helpful so you can keep track of all of them.</li>

            <li> Certain ones definitely work better than others.</li>
            <li> Love these except the blue is very watery and doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I was under no obligation to post a review or give positive feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The green and the silver were fairly pigmented, so I felt like I got a decent deal for the price.</li>
            <li> It is really good to add a little sparle to your normal eyeliner.</li>
            <li> The colors looked amazing in the bottles, but turned out watery and unpigmented when applied alone and layered over black.</li>
            <li> Even for someone who can&#x27;t draw, using these to create glitter facial designs has been easy.</li>
            <li> Good long lasting......</li>
            <li> On the lids, not so much.  </li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like this product because it doesn&#x27;t go on well.</li>
            <li> but I will, they have become one of my absolute favs when putting on makeup.</li>
            <li> and, the shadow is very watery.</li>
            <li> It shipped really fast too.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery too</li>
            <li> /&gt;they are very inexpensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like these glitters</li>
            <li> Suggested for anyone who wants to add a pop of color to their makeup.</li>
            <li> Real junk..</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s ok for the silver and gold but for the other colors, not so much.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply but take a while to dry.</li>
            <li> I liked this, the only problem is they take forever to dry, and when they do they clump.</li>
            <li> Not a long lasting liner so it is okay like a dollar store item.</li>
            <li> but...some of the colors show up better than others, and a few of them are really watery.</li>
            <li> they came with this cute little black pouch which i love</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re out there looking for a little more &#x27;pop&#x27; to your eye makeup</li>
            <li> I most likely would not buy there again just because of how long the shipping was.</li>
            <li> Thats kind of ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Long lasting and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> The product seems old.  </li>
            <li> The only one that really pops is the silver.  </li>
            <li> I really like the extra bedazzle it give to my stage makeup</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve found a use for each color so far.</li>
            <li> I found the same results, really light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I try to provide you with simple reviews that get straight to the point without a lot of jargon or repeating the product description.</li>
            <li> old niece.</li>
            <li> It must be used in a very specific makeup as they are very watery</li>
            <li> I really like half of the liners,they were bright and intense,but the other half required two,or even three coats to be noticed.</li>
            <li> Brush to small, more like novelty makeup then actual makeuo.</li>
            <li> There was no black brown or purple.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, but it fell short.</li>
            <li> Some of them (the black one for instance) doesn&#x27;t really show much glitter</li>
            <li> I dont really wear make-up, but i needed to find blue sparkles for my little cousin to match her dress for her first ever dance.</li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve become a huge makeup junkie,lol.</li>
            <li> but it is kind of scary.  </li>
            <li> its verry cool kinda flashy fun</li>
            <li> and i applied black eyeliner first before i applied the colored eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Buy something that actually works and that is not dry!</li>
            <li> The little bag that comes with the eyeliners is also very helpful so you can keep track of all of them.</li>
            <li> basically doesn&#x27;t show up very well at all, so i got what i usually get which is the urban decay</li>
            <li> they are long lasting - ordered to use with the pearlescent shadow palettes I also purchased.  </li>
            <li> With primer stays put and shiny long enough.</li>
            <li> But the only thing is like in 3 hours they dry up and make your eyes look like they&#x27;re peeling.</li>
            <li> very clumpy and hard to see with the darker colors</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> and it take too long to dry</li>
            <li> What you actually get is some sheer shine and, little sparkle</li>
            <li> They do take a while to dry through</li>
            <li> and I would suggest blowing them dry with a blow dryer</li>
            <li> Not what I was expecting, when I opened them the eyeliners were dry</li>
            <li> /&gt;Silver and Grey are the same, at least I received 2 liners of the same color.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping took forever!</li>
            <li> :(,very easy to use</li>
            <li> You have to layer several layer for just a little glimmer.  </li>
            <li> I had to reapply a few times for you to actually see it.</li>
            <li> Not seriously intense product for makeup collection.</li>
            <li> Now that i&#x27;ve had them a while, they are almost empty.</li>
            <li> Watery and not much glitter payoff.</li>
            <li> I got 2 gold, 2 pink, 2 green, 2 silver, and 2 blue.</li>
            <li> They seem big in the pictures but the bottles are really small.</li>
            <li> I didnt realize how small the tubes are, but then again i didnt look at the details to see how big they are either.</li>
            <li> I feel like this is just a big waste of time and trouble shipping this item to me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> One day I layered it thick to make the color pop, and it actually hurt my eyelids.</li>
            <li> so it is thick enough to see on My eye.</li>
            <li> I do not know if Purple and Black did that because the are dark in color?</li>
            <li> And you get 10 for less than 1 sephora one.</li>
            <li> This is a slight pigment with the glitter.</li>
            <li> The blue glitter eyeliner is weird, it has bubbles that are constantly moving, not sure if it is a chemical imbalance or</li>
            <li> /&gt;they are a little watery</li>
            <li> A little sticky on the eye.</li>
            <li> I felt like this was a total waste of my money!!!</li>
            <li> Fluids are separated, as if they had dried out.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money</li>
            <li> they were really thin and liquedy i guess glitter is tiny</li>
            <li> However, Two of my bottles were dried out glitter in oil stuck to the applicator brush.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I wear this glitter on my eyes everyday  lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> and i use them everyday</li>
            <li> I use one almost everyday, and i have every color, so I can match it to what i am wearing,.</li>
            <li> and I had DRY clumps on my eyelid which was not a good look.</li>
            <li> It takes forever to dry even with a small, thin layer.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your hard earned cash on this.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this product is toxic.</li>
            <li> Overall, a disappointment.</li>
            <li> But you have to put at least 3 or 4 layers just to get it to show up...</li>
            <li> and so you will need at least a primer in your eyes to put it</li>
            <li> on.&lt;br /&gt;The pencil is too thick</li>
            <li> you will need to use a base with these as they are not very thick.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product; each container provides only enough for 2-3 applications, is watery and impossible to apply with precision.</li>
            <li> the glitter liner takes too long to dry, you end up looking horrible if you blink before it dries.  </li>
            <li> I bought them for my daughter who loves eye make-up and wears false eyelashes all the time.  </li>
            <li> These are a very thin and watery glitter base and barely come out on the brush.  </li>
            <li> sa a few coats over a base.</li>
            <li> so you may end up cutting some part of it to make it thinner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but  unfortunately they are not  :(</li>
            <li> but I guess its not that bad</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s glittering but you will need to buy eye liner for each color to use as base for it.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> then it peels off and looks horrible</li>
            <li> Hated these!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> very clumpy and hard to see with the darker colors</li>
            <li> this is worth it money I love it..i would tell friends to order it ...the colors are great choice for me and my daughters</li>
            <li> Not what I was expecting. Thought the colors would be bolder. Doesn&#x27;t show up well</li>
            <li> The colors are alright, but as soon as it dries it starts to peel. One day I layered it thick to make the color pop, and it actually hurt my eyelids. It&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> Looks pretty but does not go onto eyes. Brush to small, more like novelty makeup then actual makeuo.</li>
            <li> Colors are nice and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> Waiting to return them, there is more clear liquid than glitter, the color do not show up well.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. It&#x27;s fun and easy to use. I just wish the products were darker. It goes on transparent. That&#x27;s ok for the silver and gold but for the other colors, not so much.</li>
            <li> The product seems old.  Fluids are separated, as if they had dried out.</li>
            <li> the color does not stay on at all. I wasted my money</li>
            <li> This is a really nice selection for the price. It is challenging to get the glitter to be visible so several coats may be required based on what look you are going for.  Overall would recommend.</li>
            <li> Colors are beautiful in the tubes.  On the lids, not so much.  The only one that really pops is the silver.  I wear multiple shades of eyeshadow so I just line after eyeshadow application and the silver picks up the colors of the eyeshadow.  Really is very attractive and I get many compliments.</li>
            <li> Well, you get what you paid for! Hair gel with glitter in it!</li>
            <li> These are incredibly beautiful, easily used as either a shadow or liner when used with a primer they are long lasting - ordered to use with the pearlescent shadow palettes I also purchased.  So glamorous for  evenings and the holidaze!</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like this product because it doesn&#x27;t go on well.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast! they came with this cute little black pouch which i love so i won&#x27;t lose them! i really am satisfied with these eyeliners. the colors stick out if u have a primer and i applied black eyeliner first before i applied the colored eyeliner. i was very happy to see the colors really stick out!! i love them!</li>
            <li> I was looking for glitter eyeliner and when I saw this, I got super excited. It goes on nicely HOWEVER, it clumps to your lid and it makes your eyelid look gross. It peeled during the day and I had DRY clumps on my eyelid which was not a good look. I do not recommend this.</li>
            <li> those are  nice colors ,but they take for ever to dry out ,i thought they were better than this after reading the reviews but  unfortunately they are not  :( :(,very easy to use</li>
            <li> Clumpy and does not apply well</li>
            <li> Very nicely designed, great colors and allot of fun to play with.  Even for someone who can&#x27;t draw, using these to create glitter facial designs has been easy.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product; each container provides only enough for 2-3 applications, is watery and impossible to apply with precision.</li>
            <li> I love this product. The price is good compared to the hair stores. I will order again. All my friends loved it</li>
            <li> They are okay. Don&#x27;t stay on as well as I would like, but they are okay and I like the different colors.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.  Received in a timely manner!</li>
            <li> Better than I imagined!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like them I don&#x27;t even use it at all. I wish I never got them at all and save myself of having in my makeup it</li>
            <li> Good long lasting...... And no flaking off... Love it.</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than expected. Colors are great. But glitter does not last.  As soon as you start blinking your glitter goes all over your eyelids. I wish it would stay in place.</li>
            <li> Love these except the blue is very watery and doesn&#x27;t work. I bought this twice and the blue in both are watery.</li>
            <li> you will need to use a base with these as they are not very thick. sa a few coats over a base. they are a nice highlight.</li>
            <li> The blue glitter eyeliner is weird, it has bubbles that are constantly moving, not sure if it is a chemical imbalance or what but it is kind of scary.  Will not use this product nor will I purchase it again.  Not sure if this product is toxic.</li>
            <li> Very shiny! All me! Love these!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love glitter, so these eyeliners were perfect for the extra sparkle around my eyes. Lately I&#x27;ve become a huge makeup junkie,lol. I haven&#x27;t gotten to use all of the glitter eyeliners yet but I will, they have become one of my absolute favs when putting on makeup. They make the holiday look even better!!! I love them.</li>
            <li> This product wasn&#x27;t at all what I was expecting. There&#x27;s more water solution than glitter and it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t stick well on to the skin.</li>
            <li> love the colors and how they go on highly recommend super fast shipping thank you</li>
            <li> It does kinda clump but only if you play with it, I my boyfriend loves it on me, and it lasted me all day without clumping until the end when I played with it.</li>
            <li> All these colors are so beautiful to wear. they are so smooth and don&#x27;t irritate the eyes! I am very satisfied..</li>
            <li> This stuff looks like something from a kids playset. I expected some bold bright color and, tons of sparkle...What you actually get is some sheer shine and, little sparkle and, the shadow is very watery. Don&#x27;t waste your hard earned cash on this.</li>
            <li> These are really cute but...some of the colors show up better than others, and a few of them are really watery. Certain ones definitely work better than others. Easy to apply but take a while to dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very cool and great colors ! A nice touch to your eyes and look good! I&#x27;m happy with it!</li>
            <li> i bought these for prom! i loved the way it made my eyes look! these are definately a good deal and m definately going to buy again!</li>
            <li> I liked this, the only problem is they take forever to dry, and when they do they clump. I really like the extra bedazzle it give to my stage makeup</li>
            <li> I felt like this was a total waste of my money!!! The glitter did not come out even with the application brush that came with this item.  I feel like this is just a big waste of time and trouble shipping this item to me.</li>
            <li> Some of the colors are great but some aren&#x27;t exactly what I had imagined they would be.  All in all the blue is perfect.</li>
            <li> I use this eyeliner with a primer and it works pretty well. It is really good to add a little sparle to your normal eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Best to use over your regular eyeliner but still not very shimmery.  Overall, a disappointment.</li>
            <li> These colors are amazing! So happy with this purchase. I would recommend these to anyone who wears eye make up. Long lasting and easy to apply. Absolutely great collection of colors!!</li>
            <li> I am captain of my band&#x27;s majorette squad and my twirlers just love using these liquid eye liners for performances! We&#x27;ve found a use for each color so far. They do take a while to dry through and I would suggest blowing them dry with a blow dryer so they don&#x27;t drip. A very useful product for color guard and I&#x27;m sure they would be useful for cheerleaders as well!</li>
            <li> first i thought how would it look when i apply such colors ...to my surprise, its amazing ..my eyes looks beautiful with this liners...</li>
            <li> These are a very thin and watery glitter base and barely come out on the brush.  You have to layer several layer for just a little glimmer.  I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> the glitter liner takes too long to dry, you end up looking horrible if you blink before it dries.  Wouldnt buy again.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:32be84dd0114c0484adb8afe8db3c3bf]] I really like the idea of this set, but when put to use they are really light. You have to use several layers to get any color or glitter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried them out on some craft projects as well. I found the same results, really light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out the video to see the full review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure - I received this product in exchange for an honest review. All thoughts, opinions and ratings are my own. I was under no obligation to post a review or give positive feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** I try to provide you with simple reviews that get straight to the point without a lot of jargon or repeating the product description. I hope this look at the products has helped you make the decision to buy or not to buy. Thanks for taking the time to read my review! ***</li>
            <li> they were really thin and liquedy i guess glitter is tiny basically doesn&#x27;t show up very well at all, so i got what i usually get which is the urban decay liquid glitter eyeliners they work really great and make the eyes pop</li>
            <li> This causes irritation on my skin. Everytime i put it on my eye, makes my skin burn!&lt;br /&gt;it lasts about 1h - 2h max! then it peels off and looks horrible and you cant even go fix it .&lt;br /&gt;would not recommend!!!!!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, but it fell short. The shipping was very fast (arrived in 2 days), and the product arrived intact. The colors looked amazing in the bottles, but turned out watery and unpigmented when applied alone and layered over black. The green and the silver were fairly pigmented, so I felt like I got a decent deal for the price. These are fun if you are looking to experiment with glitter liners without paying the price of a high-end brand.</li>
            <li> I like the glitter of this product. It was smooth and non-burning to eyes. That wins it a rate of 5 stars. However, Two of my bottles were dried out glitter in oil stuck to the applicator brush. I do not know if Purple and Black did that because the are dark in color? This is why I gave this rating a 3 Stars.</li>
            <li> Not what I was expecting, when I opened them the eyeliners were dry I couldn&#x27;t even use them. They seem big in the pictures but the bottles are really small. It looks really cheap. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Buy something that actually works and that is not dry!</li>
            <li> I only received the eyeliner and thought it had the liquid eyeshadow also. Otherwise, it&#x27;s good stuff.It would have been a better buy if the eyeshadow was included</li>
            <li> It takes forever to dry even with a small, thin layer. But you have to put at least 3 or 4 layers just to get it to show up...i would not recommend this at all</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t expect it to be so watery and it take too long to dry but I guess its not that bad , the good thing is they came really fast,</li>
            <li> These eyeliners I love them. They&#x27;re so pretty and colorful and glittery. But the only thing is like in 3 hours they dry up and make your eyes look like they&#x27;re peeling. But other than that I love them!</li>
            <li> Overall, I thought this was a really good product. The silver colors are great and some of the others work great as well. Some of them (the black one for instance) doesn&#x27;t really show much glitter but overall this was a great purchase. If you&#x27;re out there looking for a little more &#x27;pop&#x27; to your eye makeup then I definitely recommend this product. It shipped really fast too. The little bag that comes with the eyeliners is also very helpful so you can keep track of all of them.</li>
            <li> These are honestly such a great product for the price. if you are looking for sparkle eye liner and dont want to pay for the $12 ones at sephora these are just as good. And you get 10 for less than 1 sephora one.</li>
            <li> 10 DIFFERENT COLORS, AND IT MADE A GREAT ADDITION TO MY EYESHADOW, VERY VIBRANT AND STAYED ON ALL DAY. I RECCOMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR ANYONE LOOKING FOR A GREAT DEAL.</li>
            <li> The eyeliner itself is okay. Kind of watery. I had to reapply a few times for you to actually see it. But once its on, its nice. I most likely would not buy there again just because of how long the shipping was. I ordered them on January 15, and they didnt come in until February 11. Thats kind of ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Very pretty. Though when you order it they give you just ten bottles not necessarily the ten colors above. I got 2 gold, 2 pink, 2 green, 2 silver, and 2 blue. There was no black brown or purple.</li>
            <li> Awesome.  I wear this glitter on my eyes everyday  lots of compliments. Fast delivery too</li>
            <li> I like them alot there alot of colors to chose from i cant wait to start playing with you.&lt;br /&gt;they are a little watery but they are still good.&lt;br /&gt;they are very inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;good for makeup collection starters.</li>
            <li> I really like half of the liners,they were bright and intense,but the other half required two,or even three coats to be noticed. Great for teens,and tweens. Not seriously intense product for makeup collection.</li>
            <li> I was expecting the quality of Ben Nye but I was mistaken. This is a slight pigment with the glitter. If you want more pigment you must put on more and this leads to a very unattractive clump in the corners of your eyes. Along with flaking off during the day. Its just ok..</li>
            <li> I bought them for my daughter who loves eye make-up and wears false eyelashes all the time.  She was very happy with the liners, she said easy to put it on and off, they clean off easy and she has a different color on all the time and for the price I paid, I will never tell her what I paid because she thinks they were so expensive lol</li>
            <li> want some glam put this neet eye lliner on and  you get  sexy sparkle its verry cool kinda flashy fun</li>
            <li> Nice array of colors. A little sticky on the eye. Not a long lasting liner so it is okay like a dollar store item.</li>
            <li> I really like these glitters the colors are so pretty. I didnt realize how small the tubes are, but then again i didnt look at the details to see how big they are either. I&#x27;m quite happy with this purchase :))</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s glittering but you will need to buy eye liner for each color to use as base for it. If you do so, you will get the results.</li>
            <li> These are amazing and i use them everyday</li>
            <li> I am now the coolest Aunty &amp;#34;EVER&amp;#34; in the history of Aunty&#x27;s&amp;#34;for gifting these to my 15 yr. old niece.</li>
            <li> Delivery  was fast and colors are beautiful.  With primer stays put and shiny long enough.</li>
            <li> Work well and very portable! Suggested for anyone who wants to add a pop of color to their makeup. Affordable price for product received. I suggest this product.</li>
            <li> I dont really wear make-up, but i needed to find blue sparkles for my little cousin to match her dress for her first ever dance. i found these and didnt like having to buy all of them just to get the blue i needed. Now that i&#x27;ve had them a while, they are almost empty. I use one almost everyday, and i have every color, so I can match it to what i am wearing,. or just wear the one i want to.&lt;br /&gt;Its a great buy, and i am glad i got them</li>
            <li> These eyeliners are good for sporadic use I think. It must be used in a very specific makeup as they are very watery and so you will need at least a primer in your eyes to put it on.&lt;br /&gt;The pencil is too thick so you may end up cutting some part of it to make it thinner.&lt;br /&gt;Silver and Grey are the same, at least I received 2 liners of the same color.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping took forever!</li>
            <li> These colors are great but I have to reapply 2 to 3 times so it is thick enough to see on My eye.</li>
            <li> Hated these! Watery and not much glitter payoff.</li>
            <li> This product is of excellent quality, you can buy with confidence and security, the price is very affordable for anyone who wants to buy it.</li>
            <li> Real junk.. They peal !!!</li>
