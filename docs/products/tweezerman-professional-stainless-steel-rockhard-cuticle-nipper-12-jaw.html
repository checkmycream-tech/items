    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is the best cuticle snip I have ever had.</li>
            <li>These nippers are perfect for doing my manicure.</li>
            <li>Very good quality.</li>
            <li>but this pair works beautifully, just as they should.</li>
            <li>Great product, does the job</li>
            <li>Great quality.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Good nippers, cuts well</li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>Great quality and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>caused more cuticle problems than an old pair...not impressed</li>
            <li>I would expect better with this price.</li>
            <li>Unlike the cheap kind, these have two springs that are hooked together and they never pop out and snap your hand like the cheapies to.  </li>
            <li>Tweezernan only make the best</li>
            <li>I was most pleased with my purchases, all of them from Tweezerman.  </li>
            <li>Definitely the best cuticle clippers</li>
            <li>: they really are as good as their reputation says.</li>
            <li>Tweezerman Professional Stainless Steel cuticle clippers are wonderful.</li>
            <li>They work good enough to keep as a backup, but I&#x27;m still on a quest to find something better.  </li>
            <li>Razor shar, get close and personal to the cuticle and works smoothly - all at a fair price.</li>
            <li>SHARP EXCELLENT - DOES NOT TRIM TOO MUCH OF THE CUTICLE</li>
            <li>I am giving this product 2 stars instead of one only because they have a good return policy.</li>
            <li>Had high expectation, as I love their tweezers.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re high quality and easy to use.</li>
            <li>These are good and sharp.  </li>

            <li>right out of the box.  </li>
            <li>Best cuticle nippers ever, they stay sharp for a long time.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, reasonable price</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Exactly like the one my manicurist uses.</li>
            <li>Hinge isn&#x27;t very springy.</li>
            <li>Very durable.</li>
            <li>This product is a bit smaller than I expected, but arrived in good condition and works well.</li>
            <li>good edge on the nippers but jaws don&#x27;t open very wide.</li>
            <li>When I first got these clippers they worked fine and I gave them five stars, but I&#x27;ve had them less than a year</li>
            <li>These are precise and sharp.</li>
            <li>The nipper arrived, looks very professional, but it was defective.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for both professional manicurists and do-it-your-self nail technicians.</li>
            <li>WOW is all I can say.</li>
            <li>Not like old Tweezermans.</li>
            <li>Professional grade.</li>
            <li>The tip&#x27;s opening range is very little, does not allow you to control the tool easily.</li>
            <li>Very sharp, work very well.  </li>

            <li> Very sharp, work very well.  </li>
            <li> I am old enough that my hands have developed a slight shake, so it is taking me time to get used to using them, and not sure I would recommend them for older people to use themselves......</li>
            <li> Not sharp and thin enough on the ends</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as expected!</li>
            <li> Sharp and well made nippers.  </li>
            <li> They are sharp too, so no tugging.</li>
            <li> These nippers are sharp and have stayed so.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stick, break, or scrape metal like other ones do.</li>
            <li> These are well made but extremely sharp clippers and the angle is quite steep.  </li>
            <li> It is sharp, which is what it should be, but if one is not accustomed to using a cuticle nipper, start slowly and practice taking off tiny bits at a time.</li>
            <li> Very sharp.</li>
            <li> These are sharp enough, but the spring mechanism makes them somewhat difficult to use.</li>
            <li> no more.</li>
            <li> I always use Tweezerman cuticle nippers and usually buy a pair once a year.  </li>
            <li> And they were expensive.  </li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with Tweezerman.</li>
            <li> So amazed and Disappointed that &amp;#34;Tweezerman&amp;#34; put out such a bad product!</li>
            <li> Really disappointing.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as expected! Disappointed</li>
            <li> This was a reorder.  I like the nippers I bought for myself - I bought a second pair for a friend.</li>
            <li> The tip&#x27;s opening range is very little, does not allow you to control the tool easily. I would expect better with this price.</li>
            <li> Very good quality. They serve its purpose well.</li>
            <li> WOW is all I can say. This is the best cuticle snip I have ever had.</li>
            <li> Not sharp and thin enough on the ends</li>
            <li> Sharp and well made nippers.  They will trim nails even though the package tells you they&#x27;re not made for that purpose.  Grip on handles could be improved.</li>
            <li> When I first got these clippers they worked fine and I gave them five stars, but I&#x27;ve had them less than a year and they already broke.  I use them twice per month.  The clasp that keeps the clippers in tact (notch) will not hold together and the clippers don&#x27;t work properly.  I will now go to another clipper offered by Amazon and toss these away.  I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> Had high expectation, as I love their tweezers.  These are sharp enough, but the spring mechanism makes them somewhat difficult to use. They work good enough to keep as a backup, but I&#x27;m still on a quest to find something better.  I can&#x27;t recommend them, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> good edge on the nippers but jaws don&#x27;t open very wide. Hinge isn&#x27;t very springy.</li>
            <li> These nippers are perfect for doing my manicure. Unlike the cheap kind, these have two springs that are hooked together and they never pop out and snap your hand like the cheapies to.  They are sharp too, so no tugging.</li>
            <li> These are good and sharp.  Love them!</li>
            <li> Works well.  Definitely recommend. It is sharp, which is what it should be, but if one is not accustomed to using a cuticle nipper, start slowly and practice taking off tiny bits at a time.</li>
            <li> They did not open properly and then the spring did not work at all!...right out of the box.  Couldn&#x27;t believe it!  And they were expensive.  As I am now in Panama, couldn&#x27;t return them.  So amazed and Disappointed that &amp;#34;Tweezerman&amp;#34; put out such a bad product!</li>
            <li> Shark endorses the Tweezers to cut his Son&#x27;s Baby Shark Nails!</li>
            <li> Great product, does the job well. Very durable.</li>
            <li> Have always been Revlon fan...no more. These nippers are sharp and have stayed so.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I always use Tweezerman cuticle nippers and usually buy a pair once a year.  Occasionally I have had problems with the spring not working and had to return them but this pair works beautifully, just as they should.</li>
            <li> This product is a bit smaller than I expected, but arrived in good condition and works well.</li>
            <li> Tweezernan only make the best</li>
            <li> These are precise and sharp. I like the spring mechanism. It doesn&#x27;t stick, break, or scrape metal like other ones do. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I had always heard of these. Bottomline: they really are as good as their reputation says. I play music instruments and am fastidious about hand care. These are sine qua non!</li>
            <li> SHARP EXCELLENT - DOES NOT TRIM TOO MUCH OF THE CUTICLE</li>
            <li> Best cuticle nippers ever, they stay sharp for a long time.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, reasonable price</li>
            <li> Great quality and easy to use.  I was most pleased with my purchases, all of them from Tweezerman.  Great quality.</li>

            <li> Nippers are the tool of my trade for over 20 years. You can never go wrong with Tweezerman. Reasonably priced and well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Good nippers, cuts well</li>
            <li> Tweezerman Professional Stainless Steel cuticle clippers are wonderful. They&#x27;re high quality and easy to use. Definitely the best cuticle clippers I&#x27;ve every owned.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for both professional manicurists and do-it-your-self nail technicians.</li>
            <li> Not like old Tweezermans. These are made in India and not Germany. There is no spring to the hinge - you have to pull them apart each nip you make. Really disappointing.</li>
            <li> Not as sharp as my old pair!</li>
            <li> Exactly like the one my manicurist uses.</li>
            <li> Great product. Professional grade. Very sharp.</li>
            <li> Razor shar, get close and personal to the cuticle and works smoothly - all at a fair price.</li>
