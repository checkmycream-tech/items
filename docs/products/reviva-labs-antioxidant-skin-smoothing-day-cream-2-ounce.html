    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used this product and its predessors for 10 years.  Great stuff for guys after a shave.  Leaves no oily residue and will take years off your face.</li>
            <li> This is a very good day cream and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it. It is a nice daily moisturizer for dry skin. The reason why I love this brand is because they do not use all kinds of chemicals and preservatives.  It is a natural product that also does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> Within two weeks, I noticed that my skin felt smoother. There is no smell to the product, which is a plus for me. Definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m 56 and have been using this for years. In addition, i saw on Dr Oz,&lt;br /&gt;mentioning ingredients that make for a great face creme. Yup, this one&lt;br /&gt;has them.</li>
            <li> I called this product \\&quot;faithful\\&quot; because it has been with me for years and years.  I am in my sixties and I contribute my smooth, wrinkle-free skin to this product. I have been purchasing this cream for years but at a much higher pricer.  When I found this cream on the internet (Amazon), I wanted to buy jars and jars of it at this price.  I wear this \\&quot;day cream\\&quot; during the day and Reviva has another similar product, I use at night.  I call this cream \\&quot;faithful\\&quot;.  I wear it on my skin and it has never betrayed me.  It does smooth my skin and I appear to have \\&quot;wrinkle-free\\&quot; skin.</li>
            <li> Works great to relieve and protect dry skin.  Love the price and quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time.  I&#x27;m past 65 years old and have few wrinkles!</li>
            <li> This is not organic. It has parabens listed in the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I love this cream, as well as other similar products made by Reviva.  It hydrates and renews my skin as advertised.  Best of all, my sensitive skin has responded well to it.  I tried many different skin creams, spending and wasting money, as I had reactions to so many of them and most did not live up to their advertising.  This is my daily cream now.</li>
            <li> Very smooth texture. Glides on easily. Absorbs quickly. Lasts all day. Doesn&#x27;t interfere with foundation (many creams keep foundation on &#x27;top&#x27; of your skin...this doesn&#x27;t). A little dab will do ya. Great price. Great at minimizing lines and wrinkles. I absolutely love it and don&#x27;t/won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  I&#x27;ve used it for years.</li>
            <li> Good product. Need quite a bit for dryer skin</li>
            <li> I loved the cream at first, but after a some days of daily use I was full of painful acne. Two of its ingredients (octyl palmitate, glyceryl strearate) are well known to cause break outs.</li>
            <li> Reviva&#x27;s Antioxidant &amp; Texturizing Day Cream was not good for me. Since I used the Day Cream and the Night Cream, I do not know which product caused the problems: My hopes were dashed. Flareup of fine bumps to clogged hair follicles makes it difficult for me to promote the products. I so looked forward to this cream and the night cream being right for me.  :o(</li>
            <li> Very hydrating!! Love it!</li>
            <li> Very good product. My face stays hydrated and soft all day.</li>
            <li> I am being treated by a dermatologist for skin darkening spots--melasma  (also some sun damage and hyper pigmentation).  He prescribed hydroquinone 4% bleach cream and then a retin A product to exfoliate.  Both are working quite well and cheaper (about $80 for both--not covered by insurance) than the $700 spa items I got 3 years ago!  He said to find a moisture cream with Vitamins C and E as ingredients because the two bleaching/exfoliating creams would dry my skin out.  I searched Amazon for moisturizers with these ingredients and read tons of reviews.  I selected a day cream and a night cream (Beautiful Intensive Repair Night Cream).  Both have C and E and green tea also which I like.  I like that the Reviva has aloe vera as well.  This moisturizer is so wonderful.  It goes on with a damp sticky feeling that soaks right in after about 15 minutes and I can then put on make up.  I put it on top of my sunscreen.  It&#x27;s really a great product.  I ordered 2 containers and was glad I did!</li>
            <li> I use this cream under a facial serum before applying make up. I wait 5 minutes after applying the cream to allow it to soak in before adding serum and this gives me the best result.</li>
