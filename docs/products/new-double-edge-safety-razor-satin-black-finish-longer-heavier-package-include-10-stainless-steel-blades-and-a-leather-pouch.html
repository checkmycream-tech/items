            <li>Nice balanced weight and a nice handle length.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First off, it comes in a nice box, with a package of 10 razor blades.</li>
            <li>The handle was very comfortable and nonslip.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t matter, this is a very smooth shaving razor.</li>
            <li>I decided to give it a try and the performance was not short of excellent!!  </li>
            <li>I am going to buy one for my father, I am sure he will like it.&lt;br /&gt;No paint problems, still after a 8 months of use.</li>
            <li>it was an enjoyable shave.</li>
            <li>Overall I give it an 8 out of 10, the matte finish isn&#x27;t the best is</li>
            <li>This is a great razor for the beginning wet shaver or the experienced one.</li>
            <li>This was on the top plate on the bottom side at the edge where it would come in contact with the blade the most.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t swivel and no safety guard, it is ok though...</li>
            <li>I was provided this for free in exchange for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made of quality materials, and is quite hefty - much more so than the plastic ones I&#x27;d been using, so it took a couple minutes to get used tot</li>
            <li>The top portion is curves, which I found helped me to get a closer shave in the joint.</li>
            <li>My conclusion is this is a very nice razor at a very affordable price, I do recommend it.</li>
            <li>Trumpers Rose shave cream and a Vulfix Super Badger Brush.</li>
            <li>Great shave, highly recommended, worth every dollar and more.</li>
            <li>This is a very mild razor.</li>
            <li>For me, this razor gives a closer shave is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I had a very nice 2 pass shave without any nicks or cuts that left my face smooth, didn&#x27;t need to go 1 more pass or even touch any spots up.</li>
            <li>buddy said its a learning process but this thing was smooth and easy</li>
            <li>I noticed that with a blade it comes apart easy if you like to clean your razor and blade after each use.</li>
            <li>All in all this is a great addition to my razor collection, This will be in my regular rotation.</li>
            <li>Okay, let me preface this review by saying that I am a confirmed straight razor shaver, love them, will never leave them.</li>
            <li>It shipped and arrived promptly and securely packaged.</li>
            <li>This product is worth every dollar and gives a sleek look you would get at a barber shop!</li>
            <li>It comes with 10 Astra Stainless razor blades ( not the Platinums) but in fairness of the review I opted for my favorite blades.</li>
            <li>It is attractive, well made, and allows for an extremely close shave.</li>
            <li>The razor is way different than the others and very safe, I recommend it to anyone with 100% satisfaction.</li>
            <li>The weight of the head is near perfect in my opinion, I didn&#x27;t need any pressure on my shaving strokes other than just the weight of the head.</li>
            <li>3 days worth of beard growth.</li>
            <li>This was a nice enough razor.</li>
            <li>This is a nice double edge razor.</li>
            <li>Kinda cheap, the paint started chipping off the top of the razor after the first or second use.</li>
            <li>The weight is distributed right wear</li>
            <li>This is my first safety razor and I can honestly say I will not go back to the multi blade $20 a razor brands.  </li>
            <li>Astra Super Stainless (came with the razor)</li>
            <li>For those who say that it&#x27;s only the blade that gives you a smooth clean shave I beg to differ.</li>
            <li>First time using this razor.</li>
            <li>it began to chip off after the first use.</li>
            <li>The handle provides a nice grip even when wet so</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I love the heft, I like the size, and I like the solid feel of razor contact</li>
            <li>The paint actually gave a more positive grip on the razor.</li>
            <li>It seems to be brass that is coated, this makes for a good heavy feel that gives you positive feedback in your hand unlike some of the lighter ones that you can&#x27;t really feel in your hand.</li>
            <li>The razor is all matte black coated in paint with a nice finish.</li>
            <li>A quick session with a pocket knife and the issue was fixed.</li>
            <li>If you like this item because it&#x27;s got a nice black matte finish, think again.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice weight to it, and I really like the black finish.</li>
            <li>Rapira Platinum Lux 4 stars Feather Stainless</li>
            <li>I really like this razor.</li>
            <li>and I got a really close shave on my underarms, legs, and bikini line.</li>
            <li>After going through my normal straight razor face prep</li>
            <li>It has a nice heft to it and is comfortable in my hand compared to a few other DE&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never had a more harsh shave in my life.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on the lookout for a new DE and thought this would fill the need for me.</li>
            <li>Wow wow wow....</li>
            <li>I would directly compare this to an Edwin Jagger DL89.</li>
            <li>I will keep using this razor, it won&#x27;t be my daily shaver as I still like my straights too much</li>
            <li>My beard is not very heavy, I&#x27;ve been using DE on and off for 40 yrs</li>
            <li>The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is because I LOVE the black coating, but it has easily chipped away at the corners and edges, even after only a month and half of regular, but daily use.</li>
            <li>I like that it is flat black to give a modern twist to a classic razor.</li>
            <li>but normal guys be careful.</li>
            <li>My 1st impression of this razor was favorable, I like the look of it and really like the black satin finish.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s definitely a keeper, especially since it&#x27;s a bit less wasteful than the disposable razors I&#x27;d been using.</li>
            <li> never used a single blade before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month now and the black finish still looks the same as it did when it arrived.</li>
            <li> It provides a closed shave with no irritation whatsoever...</li>
            <li> and I only had one trouble spot</li>
            <li> Other than tha safety razor losing its black finish the functionality is unaffected...</li>
            <li> I have not had the paint chip like other reviewers.</li>
            <li> I did nick myself once, going over a scab from an insect bite, but other than that</li>
            <li> I get from this Safety Razor, when compared with other models.</li>
            <li> in other words if you want a black razor this one will not remain black after a few uses.</li>
            <li> After shaving I cleaned the razor and looked closely at the finish as some of the reviews stated the black finish &amp;#34;washed&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> it was my first Safety Razor, and I have since bought another, only to be disappointed when comparing it to this BB Black razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a week and the black paint is chipping off already.  </li>
            <li> Try using a DE that has little to no weight in the head or the weight is not distributed correctly, then tell me it&#x27;s just the blade</li>
            <li> , it takes a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> It has a black coating that stays fairly slick when you use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Razor the past four months.</li>
            <li> There was a small piece of dirt that had gotten under the paint.</li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t mean that I don&#x27;t like a little variety in my morning shave and have in the past used a DE razor on occasion.</li>
            <li> Please note out of the box because of the matte finish the baseplate and cap had to be forced apart each time.</li>
            <li> It started chipping on the edges of the head and is slowly growing from there.  :</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ll warn you, if you don&#x27;t have a heavy beard you&#x27;ll be sorry.</li>

            <li> This product is worth every dollar and gives a sleek look you would get at a barber shop! love it!</li>
            <li> Kinda cheap, the paint started chipping off the top of the razor after the first or second use. Other than tha safety razor losing its black finish the functionality is unaffected...in other words if you want a black razor this one will not remain black after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Wow wow wow.... this is one of the best razors I have ever had, no doubt about it.. I decided to give it a try and the performance was not short of excellent!!  It provides a closed shave with no irritation whatsoever...what else can I ask for.  I am going to buy one for my father, I am sure he will like it.&lt;br /&gt;No paint problems, still after a 8 months of use. Great buy!!!</li>
            <li> Handle needs some ridges to keep from being slippery.</li>
            <li> First time using this razor. Arrived today. 3 days worth of beard growth. The tools: BBNY razor , Proraso Sandalwood shave cream, and a Gillette Silver Blue. It comes with 10 Astra Stainless razor blades ( not the Platinums) but in fairness of the review I opted for my favorite blades. The GSBs. The razor is all matte black coated in paint with a nice finish. I took off one star because mine came with a tiny chip underneath the cap. Should not effect performance at all but let&#x27;s see if it holds over time. Now for the performance. The razor glided through 3 days of growth with no issues. Zero pulling or tugging. The handle was very comfortable and nonslip. I had no issues whatsoever. My hands were soapy too. Nice balanced weight and a nice handle length. I did a two pass shave and I only had one trouble spot but it was my fault. All in all it was an enjoyable shave. Please note out of the box because of the matte finish the baseplate and cap had to be forced apart each time. That problem took care of itself after inserting the blade. I noticed that with a blade it comes apart easy if you like to clean your razor and blade after each use.</li>
            <li> The product did not come with the leather carrying case as specified in the product description.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Razor the past four months. Overall I give it an 8 out of 10, the matte finish isn&#x27;t the best is it began to chip off after the first use. The razor itself serves its purpose well.</li>
            <li> never used a single blade before. buddy said its a learning process but this thing was smooth and easy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great piece of equipment. The razor is way different than the others and very safe, I recommend it to anyone with 100% satisfaction.</li>
            <li> My shaving setup is Trumpers Rose shave cream and a Vulfix Super Badger Brush. Blades used: Astra Super Stainless (came with the razor) 3 stars Personna Blue 3 stars Rapira Platinum Lux 4 stars Feather Stainless 5 stars  This is a great razor for the beginning wet shaver or the experienced one. This is a very mild razor. I would directly compare this to an Edwin Jagger DL89. Shave wise I see no difference. The razor is well crafted. There is no play in the razor head. I have been shaving with this razor for 2 weeks with a variety of blades. I did knock off 1 star for an issue with the paint. There was a small piece of dirt that had gotten under the paint. This was on the top plate on the bottom side at the edge where it would come in contact with the blade the most. This in turn caused the blade to warp. A quick session with a pocket knife and the issue was fixed. I have not had the paint chip like other reviewers. The paint actually gave a more positive grip on the razor. All in all this is a great addition to my razor collection, This will be in my regular rotation.</li>
            <li> Okay, let me preface this review by saying that I am a confirmed straight razor shaver, love them, will never leave them. That doesn&#x27;t mean that I don&#x27;t like a little variety in my morning shave and have in the past used a DE razor on occasion. I&#x27;ve been on the lookout for a new DE and thought this would fill the need for me. It shipped and arrived promptly and securely packaged. My 1st impression of this razor was favorable, I like the look of it and really like the black satin finish. It has a nice heft to it and is comfortable in my hand compared to a few other DE&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used. After going through my normal straight razor face prep I lathered up and started my shave. I&#x27;ll admit my DE technique is lacking especially since it&#x27;s been awhile since I&#x27;ve used one. It didn&#x27;t matter, this is a very smooth shaving razor. The weight is distributed right wear it needs to be. The weight of the head is near perfect in my opinion, I didn&#x27;t need any pressure on my shaving strokes other than just the weight of the head. The handle provides a nice grip even when wet so no issues there either. I had a very nice 2 pass shave without any nicks or cuts that left my face smooth, didn&#x27;t need to go 1 more pass or even touch any spots up. For those who say that it&#x27;s only the blade that gives you a smooth clean shave I beg to differ. Try using a DE that has little to no weight in the head or the weight is not distributed correctly, then tell me it&#x27;s just the blade, The razor makes all the difference and this one does just what it should. After shaving I cleaned the razor and looked closely at the finish as some of the reviews stated the black finish &amp;#34;washed&amp;#34; off or whatever, Not on mine, looks just as good as it did when I opened the box. I will keep using this razor, it won&#x27;t be my daily shaver as I still like my straights too much but I can guarantee you it&#x27;s not going to be collecting dust on a shelf. My conclusion is this is a very nice razor at a very affordable price, I do recommend it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t swivel and no safety guard, it is ok though...not all I was expecting, though</li>
            <li> Excellent Gift! I bought this for my Dad and he loves it! It is attractive, well made, and allows for an extremely close shave. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for an amazing safety razor.</li>
            <li> I really like this razor. It has a nice weight to it, and I really like the black finish. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month now and the black finish still looks the same as it did when it arrived. It&#x27;ll stay in my regular rotation of DE Safety Razors.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and sophisticated razor! Great shave, highly recommended, worth every dollar and more.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Awesome clean shave!  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This was a nice enough razor. It has a black coating that stays fairly slick when you use it. The handle srews out of the head for the blade change, it takes a little getting used to. (If you put the head together, there are alignment pins that will help, it makes it easier.) It seems to be brass that is coated, this makes for a good heavy feel that gives you positive feedback in your hand unlike some of the lighter ones that you can&#x27;t really feel in your hand. Over all I would buy this one again given the choice.</li>
            <li> I was provided this for free in exchange for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, it comes in a nice box, with a package of 10 razor blades. It&#x27;s made of quality materials, and is quite hefty - much more so than the plastic ones I&#x27;d been using, so it took a couple minutes to get used tot he weight. The biggest issue I had was that it didn&#x27;t come with instructions, so I had to figure out how to get the blade on through trial and error. Once it was on though, I didn&#x27;t have any issues. The handle is a good size for my hands (I&#x27;m a woman) and I got a really close shave on my underarms, legs, and bikini line. The top portion is curves, which I found helped me to get a closer shave in the joint. I did nick myself once, going over a scab from an insect bite, but other than that I didn&#x27;t have any issues. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s definitely a keeper, especially since it&#x27;s a bit less wasteful than the disposable razors I&#x27;d been using.</li>
            <li> This is a nice double edge razor. But I&#x27;ll warn you, if you don&#x27;t have a heavy beard you&#x27;ll be sorry. My beard is not very heavy, I&#x27;ve been using DE on and off for 40 yrs and I&#x27;ve never had a more harsh shave in my life. It was almost like using a stright razor. This razor will be good for you gorillas out there but normal guys be careful.</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor and I can honestly say I will not go back to the multi blade $20 a razor brands.  For me, this razor gives a closer shave is easy to use.  I like that it is flat black to give a modern twist to a classic razor.</li>
            <li> I like this razor a lot...it was my first Safety Razor, and I have since bought another, only to be disappointed when comparing it to this BB Black razor. The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is because I LOVE the black coating, but it has easily chipped away at the corners and edges, even after only a month and half of regular, but daily use. Otherwise, I love the heft, I like the size, and I like the solid feel of razor contact I get from this Safety Razor, when compared with other models.</li>
            <li> If you like this item because it&#x27;s got a nice black matte finish, think again.  I&#x27;ve had it for a week and the black paint is chipping off already.  It started chipping on the edges of the head and is slowly growing from there.  :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re in the market, I&#x27;d go with a plated chrome model.  Also, I would suggest one with a butterfly opening for blade changes.  It&#x27;s easier to manage.</li>
