            <li>bright red).&lt;br</li>
            <li>My boyfriend always says how good my hair smells when I use this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And the fragrance smells so good.</li>
            <li>Good job Loreal.</li>
            <li>The product smells good but doesn&#x27;t work for my type of hair.</li>
            <li>Smells good too.</li>
            <li>good product.</li>
            <li>I bought this based on the Amazon reviews and because I had read that this product is a good Kerastese doup.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied as of now.</li>
            <li>It is a great product and I will be ordering more for family members.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this hair product!</li>
            <li>I love the smell too!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>That stuff is amazing, but it&#x27;s intended for every day use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The best part is that my hair feels fuller and has so much body and bounce.</li>
            <li>While I wish it was even more chemical free and safe for you hair, it is among the best options for color treated hair at the drugstore.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice that I can style it without damaging it.</li>
            <li>In fact, I found it very easy to rinse out.</li>
            <li>It makes it very easy to use in the shower.</li>
            <li>Fresh smelling and scalp eels great,</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair throughout the day because it feels so amazing.</li>
            <li>Wanted a good sulfate free shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>It smells great, like salon quality products and the price is right.</li>
            <li>both are wonderful products, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>Well I have tried many many products out there.</li>
            <li>I love love the smoothness and the smell.</li>
            <li>However, the results were MUCH better than I ever anticipated.</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>My favorite conditioner...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many conditioners out there</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is sulfate-free and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>but I was not as satisfied as I hoped I would be.  </li>
            <li>Conditioner sulfate free!</li>
            <li>I use this the most in my conditioner rotation.</li>
            <li>I love the smell</li>
            <li>but it just may not be the best product to deep condition with.</li>
            <li>My scalp looks better than it did using Head n Shoulders.</li>
            <li>Much better for your skin with the sulfate-free.</li>
            <li>I love the L&#x27;oreal Everpure/Everstrong lines.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this line of L&#x27;Oreal shampoos and conditioners.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t go more than a day without washing it.</li>
            <li>the smell is one of my favorite things about this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love how it smells.</li>
            <li>It is wonderful for daily use.</li>
            <li>I love the squeeze top.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more manageable</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve gotten more compliments.</li>
            <li>Hair is, in fact, the most reliable indicator of whether a person is healthy.</li>
            <li>bottom line is that none of the 5 products are magical</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner and shampoo.  </li>
            <li>LOVE that.</li>
            <li>box dye, mind you), highlighted it with bleach, highlighted it some more with permanant hair color,then I toned it twice.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I did not give this produce a fair try because I didn&#x27;t use it much.</li>
            <li>Rosemary and mint were a pleasant surprise that keep the hair smelling great all day long!</li>
            <li>hair feels incredibly smooth after using this and makes my hair gleam with healthy shine.</li>
            <li>I needed something more moisturizing and softener, i thought that using sulfate free products would help my hair to improve, but it didn&#x27;t help at all.</li>
            <li>It worked great on my hair, but I developed an allergic reaction and had to stop using it.</li>
            <li>love the way that it really moisturizes my ends but doesn&#x27;t make my scalp oily and doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel like I have product residue.&lt;br /&gt;100% RECOMMEND!!!</li>
            <li>Easy.</li>
            <li>I just do not care for the strong minty odor.  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend.</li>
            <li>The scent is extremely strong until it dries</li>
            <li>and then it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>I was so glad when I first saw this in CVS and read that they use NO animal ingredients and are Vegan to boot!</li>
            <li>a week of using this conditioner I could tell a HUGE difference in the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li>and I must say that Loreal you have outdone yourself, you should be proud and give yourself a pat on the back.</li>
            <li>Light.</li>
            <li>and I was attracted to it because it is sulfate free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sulfate free</li>
            <li>/&gt;Below is a detailed review of each product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(3.8 stars) ($0.54/ounce) - If the shampoo does most of the moisturizing \\&quot;work,\\&quot; then the conditioner seems kind of like the sealant to lock it in and protect it all day, and to make your hair more \\&quot;manageable.\\&quot; This conditioner does that job well enough</li>
            <li>I purchased this product along with the shampoo after reading several reviews on Amazon about how great it was for your hair.  </li>
            <li>I think you&#x27;ll be surprised how good it is for a drugstore product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care for the smell of it, it&#x27;s not horrible but could be better.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, both the conditioner and the shampoo, they are the best I have used, my hair gets dry especially at this time of the year.  </li>
            <li>They are thick and rich and work wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Loreal for make such a great and cheap product.</li>
            <li>That means it also requires a good amount of the blue gel to work it through all of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That means it also requires a good amount of the blue gel to work it through all of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now my long hair is bouncy, shiny, tangle free and silky soft + smells incredible.  </li>
            <li>a bit pricey, however I have not been able to buy this particular one in the stores</li>
            <li>- It works noticeably better than my old shampoo (Aussie Smooth).</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s because hydrated hair is pretty much what healthy hair</li>
            <li>I recommend using all three because they really made my hair smooth and manageable.</li>
            <li>It rarely tangles.</li>
            <li>It smells fresh however.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve switched to a different sulfate free shampoo &amp; conditioner and I&#x27;m liking it much better.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft, shiny, and healthy.</li>
            <li>Have tried many, many other brands, but this one works for me.  </li>
            <li>They were right -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right amount of added hydration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This conditioner and the shampoo leave my hair very soft and silky smooth.</li>
            <li>price of this product is very reasonable and you get a generous amount of product in the bottle.</li>
            <li>really like the minty clean scent, my husband even commented on how much he likes the smell.&lt;br /&gt;Within</li>
            <li>My hair already looks and feels healthier after the first use.</li>
            <li>It has never been so soft shiny and tangle free as it is now.</li>
            <li>first time I purchased this hydrating conditioner I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything miraculously transforming.</li>
            <li>My hair is color-treated, bleached and damaged and when I use this conditioner, it leaves my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling gross, weighted or coated, it makes it feel softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li>This seems to have the same effect as the Frieda conditioner (see below), except that it makes my hair even slightly more helmet-y.</li>
            <li>I have tried numerous shampoos and conditioners as I am always trying to make my hair look and feel better.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel the difference after the first time I used the shampoo/conditioner but after a week.</li>
            <li>Either they didn&#x27;t do much of anything, worked for a while then stopped, or made my hair shiny and healthy, but only for a fraction of the day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;P.S. - Many of these same products are probably available at your local Wal-Mart (or whatever), and probably for a 10-25% lower price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>It makes my hair soft and full.</li>
            <li>Maybe it would be worth it if it gave my hair a brilliant luster or thickness, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much at all, at least not above what the shampoo and conditioner are already doing.</li>

            <li>White product easy to dispense.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair super soft.</li>
            <li>Thanks Loreal a dedicated customer.</li>
            <li>This stuff really moisturizes but does NOT weigh your hair down.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really nourishes it</li>
            <li>I really like shampoo/conditioner combo.</li>
            <li>When I was in my teens and 20s, my hair was very greasy.</li>
            <li>so I really didn&#x27;t think I would like</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s so much cheaper than Kerasilk.</li>
            <li>This is among the better conditioners I&#x27;ve used, especially for the price, as far as detangling, softening, etc.  </li>
            <li>The one exception is the Generic version of Paul Mitchells Super Strong Deep Conditioner.</li>
            <li>When I use this on my dry, slightly over-processed hair, it looks great.</li>
            <li>I use a blowdryer and straighten Iron quiet frequently and after using this, my hair has found a new love.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair with no body.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t have high expectations.</li>
            <li>Healthy hair is also the result of things like drinking water and eating right and avoiding excessive sun or heat.</li>
            <li>I actually have to agree that it&#x27;s not a bad dupe.</li>
            <li>I tried so many different deep conditioners, but none of them gave me the results I wanted.</li>
            <li>but I have noticed a mild to moderate improvement in shine, darkness, and thickness.</li>
            <li>So rather than recommending a particular product, I recommend that you do some trials and see what works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product and it has completely transformed my dry, brittle hair into soft, silky, moisturized hair.</li>
            <li>It works well enough and makes my hair nice and dark and helmet-y</li>
            <li>It works well enough and makes my hair nice and dark and helmet-y</li>
            <li>Has an odd smell that turned me off pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know of any other cheap conditioner that still gives moisture to my ends.</li>
            <li>I live by this product now.</li>
            <li>You apply it to dry hair at night, work it through the ends, and then sleep with your hair in a mildly goopy state.</li>

            <li>Other reviewers have commented that this conditioner is hard to rinse out, but I haven&#x27;t experienced that at all.</li>
            <li>The first time I used the conditioner, I was planning on leaving it in for a while because I wanted to deep condition.</li>
            <li>It does however smooth my hair down</li>
            <li>I was a classic too-manly-for-hair-care male until I recently resolved (out of either vanity or self-respect, or maybe both) to start attending more carefully to my health/appearance/grooming.</li>
            <li>I dye my hair quite often and even though I only use ammonia free color, my hair and scalp are chronically dry.</li>
            <li>I use it after my Clear Hair and Scalp Therapy Nourishing Shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy somewhat frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>It has never been so soft and tamed.</li>
            <li>Overall I really like this conditioner.</li>
            <li>This conditioner has a minty smell and when rinsed out, leaves my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any problems so far with an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li>Plus, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s doing much to make my hair healthier because you only apply it to the end of the hair and not to the scalp.</li>
            <li>I had read some caveman-y theories about how hair products damage our hair because they crowd out the natural moisturizing chemicals and blah blah.</li>

            <li>B002PBCABY L&#x27;Oreal EverStrong Overnight Treatment]] (2.5 stars) ($1.76/ounce) - I have only used it a few times but haven&#x27;t noticed anything magical.</li>
            <li>B002PBCABY L&#x27;Oreal EverStrong Overnight Treatment]] (2.5 stars) ($1.76/ounce) - I have only used it a few times but haven&#x27;t noticed anything magical.</li>
            <li>I have thick curly hari and this product felt like it was drying out my hair when it was in, but it washed out completely and my hair felt OK afterwards.  </li>
            <li>It has a very strong distinct smell, was thick and hard to lather.  </li>
            <li>No other product could touch what this does.</li>
            <li>Gave the shampoo and conditioner a try after reading positive other reviews.  </li>
            <li>This was not packaged correctly (generally these bottles are wrapped in plastic to prevent spillage) the bottles were standalone in a box.</li>
            <li>This conditioner would probably have a more desirable effect for people with long (at least shoulder-length) hair.</li>
            <li>Hair is, of course, at the front line of that battle, so I interrogated some professional hair people and did some Internet browsing and learned that hair care is only partly a matter of what products you use.</li>
            <li>Another thing I learned while researching hair is that we are all unique little flowers with very different filaments on our noggins that respond differently to different things.</li>
            <li>then spent a decent (if not ridiculous) amount of time browsing Amazon&#x27;s hydrating hair products and reading the reviews, and then I experimented with 5 different, relatively inexpensive</li>
            <li>I have naturally dry, wavy and frizzy hair -- and I&#x27;m growing out my (Japanese) straight perm.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair that I style everyday!</li>
            <li>, I have tried the other smells and don&#x27;t like them as much.  </li>
            <li>Having long curly hair, this is the only product that I can use and comb right thru when wet.</li>
            <li>Half my hair is still stick straight from the perm and this &#x27;system&#x27; is saving me from wanted to buzz my head.</li>
            <li>However, when I used it after that first time and left the conditioner in a for a few minutes it no longer burns.</li>
            <li>The bottles are too small for my super long wavy hair.</li>
            <li>Well, this product is not too expensive and although I haven&#x27;t used it for a long time, I really like the minty smell right now!</li>

            <li> While I wish it was even more chemical free and safe for you hair, it is among the best options for color treated hair at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also nice that I can style it without damaging it.</li>
            <li> In fact, I found it very easy to rinse out.</li>
            <li> It makes it very easy to use in the shower.</li>
            <li> Fresh smelling and scalp eels great,</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair throughout the day because it feels so amazing.</li>
            <li> Wanted a good sulfate free shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> It smells great, like salon quality products and the price is right.</li>
            <li> both are wonderful products, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> Well I have tried many many products out there.</li>
            <li> I love love the smoothness and the smell.</li>
            <li> However, the results were MUCH better than I ever anticipated.</li>
            <li> Love the smell.</li>
            <li> My favorite conditioner...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many conditioners out there</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is sulfate-free and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> but I was not as satisfied as I hoped I would be.  </li>
            <li> Conditioner sulfate free!</li>
            <li> I use this the most in my conditioner rotation.</li>
            <li> I love the smell</li>
            <li> but it just may not be the best product to deep condition with.</li>
            <li> My scalp looks better than it did using Head n Shoulders.</li>
            <li> Much better for your skin with the sulfate-free.</li>
            <li> I love the L&#x27;oreal Everpure/Everstrong lines.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this line of L&#x27;Oreal shampoos and conditioners.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t go more than a day without washing it.</li>
            <li> the smell is one of my favorite things about this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love how it smells.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful for daily use.</li>
            <li> I love the squeeze top.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more manageable</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve gotten more compliments.</li>
            <li> Hair is, in fact, the most reliable indicator of whether a person is healthy.</li>
            <li> bottom line is that none of the 5 products are magical</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner and shampoo.  </li>
            <li> LOVE that.</li>
            <li> box dye, mind you), highlighted it with bleach, highlighted it some more with permanant hair color,then I toned it twice.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I did not give this produce a fair try because I didn&#x27;t use it much.</li>
            <li> Rosemary and mint were a pleasant surprise that keep the hair smelling great all day long!</li>
            <li> hair feels incredibly smooth after using this and makes my hair gleam with healthy shine.</li>
            <li> I needed something more moisturizing and softener, i thought that using sulfate free products would help my hair to improve, but it didn&#x27;t help at all.</li>
            <li> It worked great on my hair, but I developed an allergic reaction and had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> love the way that it really moisturizes my ends but doesn&#x27;t make my scalp oily and doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel like I have product residue.&lt;br /&gt;100% RECOMMEND!!!</li>
            <li> Easy.</li>
            <li> I just do not care for the strong minty odor.  </li>
            <li> I strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> The scent is extremely strong until it dries</li>
            <li> and then it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I was so glad when I first saw this in CVS and read that they use NO animal ingredients and are Vegan to boot!</li>
            <li> a week of using this conditioner I could tell a HUGE difference in the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> and I must say that Loreal you have outdone yourself, you should be proud and give yourself a pat on the back.</li>
            <li> Light.</li>
            <li> and I was attracted to it because it is sulfate free.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sulfate free</li>
            <li> /&gt;Below is a detailed review of each product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (3.8 stars) ($0.54/ounce) - If the shampoo does most of the moisturizing \\&quot;work,\\&quot; then the conditioner seems kind of like the sealant to lock it in and protect it all day, and to make your hair more \\&quot;manageable.\\&quot; This conditioner does that job well enough</li>
            <li> I purchased this product along with the shampoo after reading several reviews on Amazon about how great it was for your hair.  </li>
            <li> I think you&#x27;ll be surprised how good it is for a drugstore product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care for the smell of it, it&#x27;s not horrible but could be better.  </li>
            <li> I love this product, both the conditioner and the shampoo, they are the best I have used, my hair gets dry especially at this time of the year.  </li>
            <li> They are thick and rich and work wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Loreal for make such a great and cheap product.</li>
            <li> That means it also requires a good amount of the blue gel to work it through all of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That means it also requires a good amount of the blue gel to work it through all of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now my long hair is bouncy, shiny, tangle free and silky soft + smells incredible.  </li>
            <li> a bit pricey, however I have not been able to buy this particular one in the stores</li>
            <li> - It works noticeably better than my old shampoo (Aussie Smooth).</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s because hydrated hair is pretty much what healthy hair</li>
            <li> I recommend using all three because they really made my hair smooth and manageable.</li>
            <li> It rarely tangles.</li>
            <li> It smells fresh however.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve switched to a different sulfate free shampoo &amp; conditioner and I&#x27;m liking it much better.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft, shiny, and healthy.</li>
            <li> Have tried many, many other brands, but this one works for me.  </li>
            <li> They were right -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the right amount of added hydration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This conditioner and the shampoo leave my hair very soft and silky smooth.</li>
            <li> price of this product is very reasonable and you get a generous amount of product in the bottle.</li>
            <li> really like the minty clean scent, my husband even commented on how much he likes the smell.&lt;br /&gt;Within</li>
            <li> My hair already looks and feels healthier after the first use.</li>
            <li> It has never been so soft shiny and tangle free as it is now.</li>
            <li> first time I purchased this hydrating conditioner I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything miraculously transforming.</li>
            <li> My hair is color-treated, bleached and damaged and when I use this conditioner, it leaves my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling gross, weighted or coated, it makes it feel softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li> This seems to have the same effect as the Frieda conditioner (see below), except that it makes my hair even slightly more helmet-y.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous shampoos and conditioners as I am always trying to make my hair look and feel better.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel the difference after the first time I used the shampoo/conditioner but after a week.</li>
            <li> Either they didn&#x27;t do much of anything, worked for a while then stopped, or made my hair shiny and healthy, but only for a fraction of the day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;P.S. - Many of these same products are probably available at your local Wal-Mart (or whatever), and probably for a 10-25% lower price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> It makes my hair soft and full.</li>
            <li> Maybe it would be worth it if it gave my hair a brilliant luster or thickness, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much at all, at least not above what the shampoo and conditioner are already doing.</li>

            <li> White product easy to dispense.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair super soft.</li>
            <li> Thanks Loreal a dedicated customer.</li>
            <li> This stuff really moisturizes but does NOT weigh your hair down.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really nourishes it</li>
            <li> I really like shampoo/conditioner combo.</li>
            <li> When I was in my teens and 20s, my hair was very greasy.</li>
            <li> so I really didn&#x27;t think I would like</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s so much cheaper than Kerasilk.</li>
            <li> This is among the better conditioners I&#x27;ve used, especially for the price, as far as detangling, softening, etc.  </li>
            <li> The one exception is the Generic version of Paul Mitchells Super Strong Deep Conditioner.</li>
            <li> When I use this on my dry, slightly over-processed hair, it looks great.</li>
            <li> I use a blowdryer and straighten Iron quiet frequently and after using this, my hair has found a new love.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair with no body.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t have high expectations.</li>
            <li> Healthy hair is also the result of things like drinking water and eating right and avoiding excessive sun or heat.</li>
            <li> I actually have to agree that it&#x27;s not a bad dupe.</li>
            <li> I tried so many different deep conditioners, but none of them gave me the results I wanted.</li>
            <li> but I have noticed a mild to moderate improvement in shine, darkness, and thickness.</li>
            <li> So rather than recommending a particular product, I recommend that you do some trials and see what works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and it has completely transformed my dry, brittle hair into soft, silky, moisturized hair.</li>
            <li> It works well enough and makes my hair nice and dark and helmet-y</li>
            <li> It works well enough and makes my hair nice and dark and helmet-y</li>
            <li> Has an odd smell that turned me off pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know of any other cheap conditioner that still gives moisture to my ends.</li>
            <li> I live by this product now.</li>
            <li> You apply it to dry hair at night, work it through the ends, and then sleep with your hair in a mildly goopy state.</li>

            <li> Other reviewers have commented that this conditioner is hard to rinse out, but I haven&#x27;t experienced that at all.</li>
            <li> The first time I used the conditioner, I was planning on leaving it in for a while because I wanted to deep condition.</li>
            <li> It does however smooth my hair down</li>
            <li> I was a classic too-manly-for-hair-care male until I recently resolved (out of either vanity or self-respect, or maybe both) to start attending more carefully to my health/appearance/grooming.</li>
            <li> I dye my hair quite often and even though I only use ammonia free color, my hair and scalp are chronically dry.</li>
            <li> I use it after my Clear Hair and Scalp Therapy Nourishing Shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy somewhat frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> It has never been so soft and tamed.</li>
            <li> Overall I really like this conditioner.</li>
            <li> This conditioner has a minty smell and when rinsed out, leaves my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any problems so far with an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> Plus, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s doing much to make my hair healthier because you only apply it to the end of the hair and not to the scalp.</li>
            <li> I had read some caveman-y theories about how hair products damage our hair because they crowd out the natural moisturizing chemicals and blah blah.</li>

            <li> B002PBCABY L&#x27;Oreal EverStrong Overnight Treatment]] (2.5 stars) ($1.76/ounce) - I have only used it a few times but haven&#x27;t noticed anything magical.</li>
            <li> B002PBCABY L&#x27;Oreal EverStrong Overnight Treatment]] (2.5 stars) ($1.76/ounce) - I have only used it a few times but haven&#x27;t noticed anything magical.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hari and this product felt like it was drying out my hair when it was in, but it washed out completely and my hair felt OK afterwards.  </li>
            <li> It has a very strong distinct smell, was thick and hard to lather.  </li>
            <li> No other product could touch what this does.</li>
            <li> Gave the shampoo and conditioner a try after reading positive other reviews.  </li>
            <li> This was not packaged correctly (generally these bottles are wrapped in plastic to prevent spillage) the bottles were standalone in a box.</li>
            <li> This conditioner would probably have a more desirable effect for people with long (at least shoulder-length) hair.</li>
            <li> Hair is, of course, at the front line of that battle, so I interrogated some professional hair people and did some Internet browsing and learned that hair care is only partly a matter of what products you use.</li>
            <li> Another thing I learned while researching hair is that we are all unique little flowers with very different filaments on our noggins that respond differently to different things.</li>
            <li> then spent a decent (if not ridiculous) amount of time browsing Amazon&#x27;s hydrating hair products and reading the reviews, and then I experimented with 5 different, relatively inexpensive</li>
            <li> I have naturally dry, wavy and frizzy hair -- and I&#x27;m growing out my (Japanese) straight perm.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair that I style everyday!</li>
            <li> , I have tried the other smells and don&#x27;t like them as much.  </li>
            <li> Having long curly hair, this is the only product that I can use and comb right thru when wet.</li>
            <li> Half my hair is still stick straight from the perm and this &#x27;system&#x27; is saving me from wanted to buzz my head.</li>
            <li> However, when I used it after that first time and left the conditioner in a for a few minutes it no longer burns.</li>
            <li> The bottles are too small for my super long wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Well, this product is not too expensive and although I haven&#x27;t used it for a long time, I really like the minty smell right now!</li>
            <li> The conditioner cuts through my long hair without weighing it down too much.</li>
            <li> (seriously blue based and blue-purple based dyes make my hair copper, but when I shampoo and condition with this stuff and barely comb it and air dry, my waves and curls come out bouncy and defined.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that my hair during those months was surprisingly less nappy and gross than I expected, and it&#x27;s maybe even true that the artificial chemicals we put on our scalps have some serious, unwelcome consequences, but all I can say is that I much prefer how my hair looks and feels after it&#x27;s been shampooed, to the point that I&#x27;m willing to take whatever risks those chemicals may pose.</li>
            <li> My haircolor still sucks right now</li>
            <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough, but this conditioner does nothing to African American hair...</li>
            <li> My hair was damaged -- chemically processed and flat ironed daily!</li>
            <li> But then, inexpicably, over the last several months, my hair has become extremely dry.</li>
            <li> (he also has curly hair and until now, complains that conditioning products cause his hair to go flat).</li>
            <li> Slightly pricey, but worth it, as it only takes a small amount.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used even more expensive color safe/sulfate free shampoos that don&#x27;t perform half as well, sometimes even worse.</li>

            <li> /&gt;This is a first for me, but I can&#x27;t think of a single negative thing to say about this conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair generally is dry and I&#x27;ve noted an immediate improvement.</li>
            <li> My hair became dry and there were split ends.</li>
            <li> Ultimately, however, my hair was made more prone to tangling, and painful knots.  </li>
            <li> After perms, it would feel brittle and look dry.</li>
            <li> My hair is relaxed and dry</li>
            <li> I recommend it to anybody with dry hair.</li>
            <li> Even after I dry my hair, I can still smell this conditioner in it.</li>
            <li> My hair has also been slowly losing its thickness and body as I&#x27;ve gotten older</li>
            <li> I color my hair and from going Blonde Highlights to brown and now dark Auburn</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I am used to it or if I simply have been rinsing it out after just a short period of time.</li>
            <li> Given what I&#x27;ve seen from the different products, I will probably settle into a routine of using a small amount of the Frieda shampoo and conditioner daily, and then using an overnight treatment maybe once a month (but probably not the L&#x27;Oreal one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With this shampoo, my hair stays wet after a shower about 40% longer</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It was as silky as the other reviews said.  </li>
            <li> but I only use a little bit of it because it makes my hair a little too helmet-y for my liking.</li>
            <li> but so do the other conditioners.</li>
            <li> but so do the other conditioners.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the very expensive Kerasilk for years and recently decided to give this a try (primarily because I was too lazy to drive to the beauty supply shop).</li>
            <li> I think it might partially be damaged from highlighting and a dry shampoo I tried, but it might also be because I&#x27;m in my late 30s.</li>
            <li> It never leaves my weighed down or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a scent that is a little too much like a household cleaning product, but it&#x27;s a faint smell and goes away after the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , this is the conditioner, so on the subject of hair softening, it does just that.</li>
            <li> I actually pair this with Redken&#x27;s Anti-Snap and seriously, my hair is silky for like, two days.</li>
            <li> So I was a little hesitant to try this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I was also a little hesitant about the smell.</li>
            <li> After a shower, when I comb my wet hair, I can hardly even feel it because there is so little resistance against the comb.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t a huge change, but was still annoying.</li>
            <li> , you have to dab a few blotches of it onto your damp hair and then brush it through.</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything beyond what the other conditioners do.</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything beyond what the other conditioners do.</li>
            <li> I have very thick wavy/curly long hair.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely shocked that a hair product that I purchased in a grocery store was able to outperform my expensive, high-end salon hair products.</li>
            <li> In other words, my hair becomes a weird combination of wet and airy.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re suffering from excessive dryness, and struggling with maintaining volume while treating dryness, give this conditioner a shot.</li>
            <li> Also, it has an initially-strong scent that faintly lingers in my hair all day, even when I only use a dime-sized amount.</li>
            <li> but it was dull.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, but not too think.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That doesn&#x27;t mean I recommend (or don&#x27;t)</li>
            <li> My ends were in some serious need of moisture.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My hair already looks and feels healthier after the first use. It smells great, like salon quality products and the price is right.</li>
            <li> Gave the shampoo and conditioner a try after reading positive other reviews.  They were right - both are wonderful products, especially for the price.  My hair generally is dry and I&#x27;ve noted an immediate improvement. Have tried many, many other brands, but this one works for me.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Well I have tried many many products out there.Expensive products to not so costly and I must say that Loreal you have outdone yourself, you should be proud and give yourself a pat on the back. I use the Everpure Moisturizing Shampoo and Everstrong reconstruct conditioner, and the hair serum. Together these work some awesome magic. I color my hair and from going Blonde Highlights to brown and now dark Auburn my hair was getting quiet a workout.It was dry and breaking off badly. No other product could touch what this does. I have naturally wavy somewhat frizzy hair. I use a blowdryer and straighten Iron quiet frequently and after using this, my hair has found a new love. It has never been so soft shiny and tangle free as it is now. I love love the smoothness and the smell. Nothing else ever for me. Please NEVER discontinue these products. A must have. Now my long hair is bouncy, shiny, tangle free and silky soft + smells incredible.  Thanks Loreal a dedicated customer.</li>
            <li> I dye my hair quite often and even though I only use ammonia free color, my hair and scalp are chronically dry. My hair has also been slowly losing its thickness and body as I&#x27;ve gotten older and it&#x27;s been difficult treating the dryness while maintaining volume and body.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Loreal&#x27;s Ever____ products for years, always with great results (especially when I was dying my hair bright red).&lt;br /&gt;The first time I purchased this hydrating conditioner I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything miraculously transforming. I just thought it might add some extra moisture before using my Mythic Oil on my ends. However, the results were MUCH better than I ever anticipated. This stuff really moisturizes but does NOT weigh your hair down.&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels incredibly smooth after using this and makes my hair gleam with healthy shine. The best part is that my hair feels fuller and has so much body and bounce. My scalp loves it too. It really nourishes it and when I use this conditioner my scalp does not flake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it smells great. Herbal, but not in an aggressive way. My boyfriend always says how good my hair smells when I use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the key to how well this works for me is that I use the regular shampoo and not the hydrating one in conjunction with this conditioner. It&#x27;s just the right amount of added hydration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re suffering from excessive dryness, and struggling with maintaining volume while treating dryness, give this conditioner a shot. I think you&#x27;ll be surprised how good it is for a drugstore product. My expensive Joico shampoos and conditioners haven&#x27;t gotten much love since this came into my life.</li>
            <li> Love the smell. Reminds me of a spa. I have very thick wavy/curly long hair. It has never been so soft and tamed. It rarely tangles. I also use the shampoo that goes along with it.</li>
            <li> My favorite conditioner...a bit pricey, however I have not been able to buy this particular one in the stores</li>
            <li> *Taking a break from midterm studying*  I really like shampoo/conditioner combo. I used to use 2 in 1 shampoo/conditioners from Head&amp; Shoulders and Panteen. My hair became dry and there were split ends. I decided I need to spend more money and buy some expensive shampoo and conditioner. Well, this product is not too expensive and although I haven&#x27;t used it for a long time, I really like the minty smell right now! I am very satisfied as of now.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hair product! I&#x27;ve tried so many conditioners out there and I get dandruff or itchy scalp. I love the fact that it is sulfate-free and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. My hair is color-treated, bleached and damaged and when I use this conditioner, it leaves my hair soft and smooth. I love the smell too!</li>
            <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough, but this conditioner does nothing to African American hair... The smell is soothing though, and it leaves a tingling feeling!</li>
            <li> I love this product, both the conditioner and the shampoo, they are the best I have used, my hair gets dry especially at this time of the year.  Product shipped on time.</li>
            <li> I bought the matching shampoo and conditioner because they both had very good reviews- but I was not as satisfied as I hoped I would be.  The smell was very nice, and reminded me of products from a spa.  Ultimately, however, my hair was made more prone to tangling, and painful knots.  This wasn&#x27;t a huge change, but was still annoying.</li>
            <li> I was so glad when I first saw this in CVS and read that they use NO animal ingredients and are Vegan to boot! This conditioner and the shampoo leave my hair very soft and silky smooth. Plus getting here on Amazon at this price was a great bonus! I will definitely continue to use this product. Oh and did I mention that the scent is wonderful? Rosemary and mint were a pleasant surprise that keep the hair smelling great all day long!</li>
            <li> This is among the better conditioners I&#x27;ve used, especially for the price, as far as detangling, softening, etc.  I just do not care for the strong minty odor.  Jeez, L&#x27;Oreal, if I wanted my hair to smell like mint, I&#x27;d shampoo with toothpaste!! Just too medicinal.</li>
            <li> Conditioner sulfate free! That´s whats up. Thanks Loreal for make such a great and cheap product. Everybody should try. I strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I had a sample of the shampoo, conditioner, and overnight repair treatment. I could not believe the results. I rushed out to buy it. I am African-American and had a problem with the texture of my hair. After perms, it would feel brittle and look dry. I don&#x27;t use grease because it clogs the pores; however, when I use these products, my hair looks awesome. And the fragrance smells so good. I live by this product now. I plan to purchase my next set at Amazon because the savings increase with subscription. Good job Loreal. Finally, a company that caters to the African-American community as well!</li>
            <li> The product smells good but doesn&#x27;t work for my type of hair. I needed something more moisturizing and softener, i thought that using sulfate free products would help my hair to improve, but it didn&#x27;t help at all.</li>
            <li> I use this the most in my conditioner rotation. I don&#x27;t shampoo daily (but when I do, it&#x27;s with the EverStrong Shampoo). For curly hair, I use conditioner daily and scrub it in as if it were shampoo. I have excellent results with this product, as does my husband (he also has curly hair and until now, complains that conditioning products cause his hair to go flat). No flatness with this product. Light. Easy. I use it as a leave-in, also. Can use it daily. Slightly pricey, but worth it, as it only takes a small amount. Smells great, too! Bonus!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Overall I really like this conditioner. My hair is relaxed and dry and I was attracted to it because it is sulfate free. The first time I used the conditioner, I was planning on leaving it in for a while because I wanted to deep condition. However, after about 5 minutes my scalp started to burn from the mint, so I had to rinse it out. However, when I used it after that first time and left the conditioner in a for a few minutes it no longer burns. I am not sure if I am used to it or if I simply have been rinsing it out after just a short period of time. It makes my hair soft and full. I recommend it to anybody with dry hair. I love the smell but it just may not be the best product to deep condition with.</li>
            <li> Great smell, great sensation on my scalp!</li>
            <li> Has an odd smell that turned me off pretty quickly. I kinda feel like this one is all promotion and no actual use of product. My hair is curly but not unmanageable, and I did not notice any difference at all. To be honest, I did not give this produce a fair try because I didn&#x27;t use it much. The reason for that is because it left my hair smelling noticeably like the product, and I find the smell to be almost clinical. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> My scalp looks better than it did using Head n Shoulders. Much better for your skin with the sulfate-free. Smells good too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sulfate free and I use it because I have had keratin treatment on my hair. It supposedly helps to keep my keratin from stripping.  That is the only reason why I use the combo. I have npt seen any difference in my hair&#x27;s health 5 years of using it. It smells fresh however. White product easy to dispense.</li>
            <li> actually it&#x27;s good,but just like a regular shampoo...&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t see any differences  between regular shampoo and this item&lt;br /&gt;and it smells really bad</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!!!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use the cordinating shampoo, I just use the conditioner (I use Suave shampoo).&lt;br /&gt;I really like the minty clean scent, my husband even commented on how much he likes the smell.&lt;br /&gt;Within a week of using this conditioner I could tell a HUGE difference in the ends of my hair. I have long, fine hair that I style everyday! My ends were in some serious need of moisture.&lt;br /&gt;I love the way that it really moisturizes my ends but doesn&#x27;t make my scalp oily and doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel like I have product residue.&lt;br /&gt;100% RECOMMEND!!!</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this, but after sticking with it for a few weeks it just left my hair really sticky feeling. The bottles are too small for my super long wavy hair. The scent is extremely strong until it dries and then it&#x27;s fine. I&#x27;ve switched to a different sulfate free shampoo &amp; conditioner and I&#x27;m liking it much better.</li>
            <li> I love the L&#x27;oreal Everpure/Everstrong lines. While I wish it was even more chemical free and safe for you hair, it is among the best options for color treated hair at the drugstore. I&#x27;ve used even more expensive color safe/sulfate free shampoos that don&#x27;t perform half as well, sometimes even worse. While I do still see my color draining when it&#x27;s washed, it&#x27;s not as bad as regular shampoo and my hair color DOES last longer.&lt;br /&gt;Now, this is the conditioner, so on the subject of hair softening, it does just that. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling gross, weighted or coated, it makes it feel softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li> good product. Fresh smelling and scalp eels great,</li>
            <li> I LOVE this line of L&#x27;Oreal shampoos and conditioners.  They are thick and rich and work wonderfully.  The rosemary mint smell great, I have tried the other smells and don&#x27;t like them as much.  I have been using these for about a year now and have finally found a product I want to stick with!</li>
            <li> This conditioner has a minty smell and when rinsed out, leaves my hair soft and shiny.  It is a great product and I will be ordering more for family members.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care for the smell of it, it&#x27;s not horrible but could be better.  It does however smooth my hair down so it&#x27;s not so frizzy.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal -- please do not take this product off the market. I absolutely love this product and it has completely transformed my dry, brittle hair into soft, silky, moisturized hair. My hair was damaged -- chemically processed and flat ironed daily! Now when I comb my hair, I do not experience any breakage. My hair is super-moisturized and softer than I can describe. I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair throughout the day because it feels so amazing. I am absolutely shocked that a hair product that I purchased in a grocery store was able to outperform my expensive, high-end salon hair products. I actually stopped using my $25 bottle of designer hair conditioner in favor of this product.</li>
            <li> Wanted a good sulfate free shampoo and conditioner. This smells gross like chemicals.</li>
            <li> When I was in my teens and 20s, my hair was very greasy. I couldn&#x27;t go more than a day without washing it. But then, inexpicably, over the last several months, my hair has become extremely dry. I think it might partially be damaged from highlighting and a dry shampoo I tried, but it might also be because I&#x27;m in my late 30s. I don&#x27;t know. But my hair literally looked and felt like straw. I tried so many different deep conditioners, but none of them gave me the results I wanted. Either they didn&#x27;t do much of anything, worked for a while then stopped, or made my hair shiny and healthy, but only for a fraction of the day. The one exception is the Generic version of Paul Mitchells Super Strong Deep Conditioner. That stuff is amazing, but it&#x27;s intended for every day use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a bad experience with L&#x27;oreal Damage Erasing Balm. It worked great on my hair, but I developed an allergic reaction and had to stop using it. So I was a little hesitant to try this conditioner. I really didn&#x27;t have high expectations. I was also a little hesitant about the smell. Rosemary and Mint? I&#x27;m not a big fan of mint anything (taste or smell) so I really didn&#x27;t think I would like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the smell is one of my favorite things about this conditioner. I absolutely love how it smells. Even after I dry my hair, I can still smell this conditioner in it. It&#x27;s not overpowering, but you can definitely smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a first for me, but I can&#x27;t think of a single negative thing to say about this conditioner. I use it after my Clear Hair and Scalp Therapy Nourishing Shampoo. A little goes a long way. It&#x27;s thick, but not too think. It absorbs well into my hair. Other reviewers have commented that this conditioner is hard to rinse out, but I haven&#x27;t experienced that at all. In fact, I found it very easy to rinse out. It leaves my hair soft, shiny, and healthy. I haven&#x27;t had any problems so far with an allergic reaction. It is wonderful for daily use. It never leaves my weighed down or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price of this product is very reasonable and you get a generous amount of product in the bottle. I love the squeeze top. It makes it very easy to use in the shower. I would recommend this product to others and will repurchase.</li>
            <li> Last year I decided to stop coloring my gray hair but it was dull. Since switching to Everstrong it&#x27;s more manageable and I&#x27;ve gotten more compliments. It&#x27;s also nice that I can style it without damaging it.</li>
            <li> I use this conditioner and the accompanying shampoo and couldn&#x27;t be happier. The conditioner cuts through my long hair without weighing it down too much. It leaves my hair super soft.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hari and this product felt like it was drying out my hair when it was in, but it washed out completely and my hair felt OK afterwards.  It was as silky as the other reviews said.  I will go back to Joico.</li>
            <li> I was a classic too-manly-for-hair-care male until I recently resolved (out of either vanity or self-respect, or maybe both) to start attending more carefully to my health/appearance/grooming. Hair is, of course, at the front line of that battle, so I interrogated some professional hair people and did some Internet browsing and learned that hair care is only partly a matter of what products you use. Healthy hair is also the result of things like drinking water and eating right and avoiding excessive sun or heat. Hair is, in fact, the most reliable indicator of whether a person is healthy. (See the Wikipedia page on \\&quot;hair care,\\&quot; for starters.) And I learned that when it comes to hair products, I should look for ones that say \\&quot;hydrating.\\&quot; (This as opposed to \\&quot;moisturizing,\\&quot; which merely gives the appearance of hydration.) That&#x27;s because hydrated hair is pretty much what healthy hair *is.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then spent a decent (if not ridiculous) amount of time browsing Amazon&#x27;s hydrating hair products and reading the reviews, and then I experimented with 5 different, relatively inexpensive products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that none of the 5 products are magical but I have noticed a mild to moderate improvement in shine, darkness, and thickness. (If you have recommendations for a near-magical product, I&#x27;m counting on you to let me know.) Given what I&#x27;ve seen from the different products, I will probably settle into a routine of using a small amount of the Frieda shampoo and conditioner daily, and then using an overnight treatment maybe once a month (but probably not the L&#x27;Oreal one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That doesn&#x27;t mean I recommend (or don&#x27;t) any of these products for you. Another thing I learned while researching hair is that we are all unique little flowers with very different filaments on our noggins that respond differently to different things. So rather than recommending a particular product, I recommend that you do some trials and see what works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below is a detailed review of each product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* L&#x27;Oreal EverStrong Conditioner (My rating: 3.2 stars) (Current price: $0.66/ounce) - This seems to have the same effect as the Frieda conditioner (see below), except that it makes my hair even slightly more helmet-y. Also, it has an initially-strong scent that faintly lingers in my hair all day, even when I only use a dime-sized amount. It&#x27;s a smell that I would describe as endurable but not pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* [[ASIN:B0034F7F2E John Frieda Frizz-Ease Shampoo]] (4.3 stars) ($0.60/ounce) - It works noticeably better than my old shampoo (Aussie Smooth). With this shampoo, my hair stays wet after a shower about 40% longer and it retains a subtle moisture all day. After a shower, when I comb my wet hair, I can hardly even feel it because there is so little resistance against the comb. In other words, my hair becomes a weird combination of wet and airy. The shampoo seems to work best when I leave it in for a minute or two before rinsing. I only need to use about a nickel-sized amount (I have medium-to-shaggy hair). It has a scent that is a little too much like a household cleaning product, but it&#x27;s a faint smell and goes away after the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* [[ASIN:B0034F3VW2 John Frieda Frizz-Ease Conditioner]] (3.8 stars) ($0.54/ounce) - If the shampoo does most of the moisturizing \\&quot;work,\\&quot; then the conditioner seems kind of like the sealant to lock it in and protect it all day, and to make your hair more \\&quot;manageable.\\&quot; This conditioner does that job well enough but I only use a little bit of it because it makes my hair a little too helmet-y for my liking. Maybe you like that from a conditioner--I don&#x27;t. I prefer that my hair move in the breeze. This conditioner would probably have a more desirable effect for people with long (at least shoulder-length) hair. As for the scent, I would describe it as \\&quot;neutral.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* [[ASIN:B000UPOBRI Paul Mitchell leave-in conditioner]] (3.0 stars) ($1.03/ounce) - My second-biggest complaint with this product is that it is sort of annoying to apply - after the shower, you have to dab a few blotches of it onto your damp hair and then brush it through. My biggest complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything beyond what the other conditioners do. It works well enough and makes my hair nice and dark and helmet-y but so do the other conditioners. Plus, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s doing much to make my hair healthier because you only apply it to the end of the hair and not to the scalp. That means it also requires a good amount of the blue gel to work it through all of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* [[ASIN:B002PBCABY L&#x27;Oreal EverStrong Overnight Treatment]] (2.5 stars) ($1.76/ounce) - I have only used it a few times but haven&#x27;t noticed anything magical. You apply it to dry hair at night, work it through the ends, and then sleep with your hair in a mildly goopy state. I didn&#x27;t check carefully, but I would be surprised if your hair doesn&#x27;t leave a mark on your pillowcase.  And it takes a lot of goop, even for a guy with reasonably short hair like me. Maybe it would be worth it if it gave my hair a brilliant luster or thickness, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much at all, at least not above what the shampoo and conditioner are already doing. I am unlikely to get it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. - Many of these same products are probably available at your local Wal-Mart (or whatever), and probably for a 10-25% lower price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.P.S. - A couple years ago, I experimented with using no hair products at all... for months. I had read some caveman-y theories about how hair products damage our hair because they crowd out the natural moisturizing chemicals and blah blah. All I can say is that it didn&#x27;t work for me. It&#x27;s true that my hair during those months was surprisingly less nappy and gross than I expected, and it&#x27;s maybe even true that the artificial chemicals we put on our scalps have some serious, unwelcome consequences, but all I can say is that I much prefer how my hair looks and feels after it&#x27;s been shampooed, to the point that I&#x27;m willing to take whatever risks those chemicals may pose.est complaint with this product is that it is sort of annoying to apply - after the shower, you have to dab a few blotches of it onto your damp hair and then brush it through.

            <li> Excellent product.  One of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous shampoos and conditioners as I am always trying to make my hair look and feel better. I have returned to this product on three different occasions.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product along with the shampoo after reading several reviews on Amazon about how great it was for your hair.  It has a very strong distinct smell, was thick and hard to lather.  The worst thing about the product however, was that it made my hair fall out by the handful, and that was every time I used it.  I could use it Monday and Tuesday and run my fingers through my hair just out of the shower and there would be 25-30 strands of hair in my hand.  I could use another product on Wednesday of the same week and have only 2-3 hairs fall out after washing.  I am a firm believer that there is something in this product that just was very bad for my hair.  I won&#x27;t ever try it again, nor recommend it to anyone else.  My hair has been great since I quit using it.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner and shampoo.  Having long curly hair, this is the only product that I can use and comb right thru when wet. So disappointed they discontinued this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the very expensive Kerasilk for years and recently decided to give this a try (primarily because I was too lazy to drive to the beauty supply shop). I love it! And it&#x27;s so much cheaper than Kerasilk.</li>
            <li> This was not packaged correctly (generally these bottles are wrapped in plastic to prevent spillage) the bottles were standalone in a box. Needless to say the bottle of conditioner was all over the box when i opened it. This was very disappointing and messy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a conditioner that has great feedback and is backed by research. I&#x27;m impressed by the results. I didn&#x27;t feel the difference after the first time I used the shampoo/conditioner but after a week. I also used the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Overnight Treatment. I recommend using all three because they really made my hair smooth and manageable. I have naturally dry, wavy and frizzy hair -- and I&#x27;m growing out my (Japanese) straight perm. Half my hair is still stick straight from the perm and this &#x27;system&#x27; is saving me from wanted to buzz my head. AND it has no sulfates!!!! LOVE that. Would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair with no body. I always thought &amp;#34;thickening&amp;#34; was a marketing gimmick but this actually makes a big difference!</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the Amazon reviews and because I had read that this product is a good Kerastese doup. I actually have to agree that it&#x27;s not a bad dupe. When I use this on my dry, slightly over-processed hair, it looks great. I recently played hairdresser and I dyed my hair with demi-perm, then threw permanent hair color over it (box dye, mind you), highlighted it with bleach, highlighted it some more with permanant hair color,then I toned it twice. My haircolor still sucks right now (seriously blue based and blue-purple based dyes make my hair copper, but when I shampoo and condition with this stuff and barely comb it and air dry, my waves and curls come out bouncy and defined. I don&#x27;t know of any other cheap conditioner that still gives moisture to my ends. I actually pair this with Redken&#x27;s Anti-Snap and seriously, my hair is silky for like, two days.</li>
