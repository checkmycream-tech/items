            <li>just incase :o)</li>
            <li>with a good strop stays sharper than a Razor LOL.</li>
            <li>Sturdy handle and good blade.</li>
            <li>Good blade, plastic handle which I prefer metal myself</li>
            <li>All around a good start up razor.</li>
            <li>Made in China, it is about as good a blade as I have seen from China.</li>
            <li>Excellent quality and fantastic performance</li>
            <li>This razor came in good shape.</li>
            <li>Gold Dollars can be good affordable shavers.</li>
            <li>Regrettably I could not shave off arm hairs even with a good lather.  </li>
            <li>Good razor with a plastic handle.</li>
            <li>Good weight and heft.</li>
            <li>Needs a good sharpening before use.</li>
            <li>razor that received good reviews on the forums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The good</li>
            <li>So there are the good</li>
            <li>/&gt;The blade is made in China, but the steel is of good quality.</li>
            <li>I give it three stars but it might not be fair to it.</li>
            <li>The price is what makes it good to use as a started razor.</li>
            <li>Good weight, feel.  </li>
            <li>I ended up buying a vintage Sheffield razor for $20 in great shape and better quality.</li>
            <li>But when it arrived, I gave it a good stropping (100 strokes) and it shaves amazing...</li>
            <li>For the price I was very satisfied.</li>
            <li>/&gt;razor comes with a business card stating it was sharpened and hones on the finest of tools and by the most experienced professionals.</li>
            <li>Having a good shave takes a bit of time, but it&#x27;s a nice gift to give to yourself.</li>
            <li>excellent straight razor.</li>
            <li>Excellent shave-ready straight razor.</li>
            <li>It looked nice, but I decided to return -</li>
            <li>I suggest for beginners to get the Vanderhagen Deluxe shave kit for around $10 at Walmart/Target</li>
            <li>But for $50, you get a razor that shaves just as good as razors costing much more.</li>
            <li>It shaved nicely.</li>
            <li>Engraved rather than stamped markings are a nice touch.</li>
            <li>Otherwise nice start up razor.</li>
            <li>This razor has a nice weight and a nice feel.</li>
            <li>the color of the writing on the blade does come off whenever you wipe on the blade with a cloth, which is kind of sketchy.&lt;br /&gt;the problem that i have seen is..</li>
            <li>I got this as a travel razor, if it got lost I&#x27;m not out a fortune or my nice buffalo</li>
            <li>The razor is nice for the price.</li>
            <li>a nice weight to it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very good quality razor for someone like me who is just beginning to use a straight razor.</li>
            <li>there a good, cheap &amp;#34;Solingen&amp;#34; blade out there..?</li>
            <li>--I&#x27;d expect to pay $60 or more to replace them..)  </li>
            <li>blade is going to have to be &amp;#34;monitored&amp;#34; all the time to be sure there isn&#x27;t a defect from banging the blade into the handle (from some alignment problem</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s better than a &amp;#34;shavette&amp;#34;.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Mostly I plan to employ the Gold Dollar when traveling, as I&#x27;d rather lose it than one of the others.  </li>
            <li>I gave it three stars as it required honing --for me-- and two of the water stones each cost more than the razor.  </li>
            <li>a great starter straight razor.</li>
            <li>and I have enjoyed it</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m satisfied with this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased...</li>
            <li>Blade pulls more hairs out than it cuts.  </li>
            <li>It acted more like a comb than a razor.</li>
            <li>was a gold dollar razor he told me that I would be better to buy a vintage razor</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll have something and many sellers</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d gotten for much more money.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m sure you will take better care of your razors, but he has almost ruined this razor after TWO WEEKS by not taking care of it....</li>
            <li>: It&#x27;s a nice cheap razor that comes &amp;#34;razor sharp&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It also works great and as always using a straight razor makes you feel like a badass.</li>
            <li>but i am watching to see if it holds up ok</li>
            <li>I cannot speak to the truth of this statement and am leaning more towards FALSE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>the razor shaves very nice but the handle is VERY flimsy and I feel like it will break.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you get shaving soap and a nice brush and warm your face up with a hot towel - it makes all the difference.  </li>
            <li>lol he is was still new at it!</li>
            <li>and i can get a pretty good shave with those</li>
            <li>First BUNCH of shaves won&#x27;t feel as good as disposable razor, but read up on technique and stay with it.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted, good to go from the box.</li>
            <li>I got a pretty darned good shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For example, Dovo &amp; Thiers Issard sharpen their razors at the factory, but a good number of people don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s good enough to shave with.</li>
            <li>Very good especially for the money.  </li>
            <li>Was aligned perfectly in the center of the scales.</li>
            <li>OK,,, the handle is cheap plastic</li>
            <li>Apparently, if you want a great razor, you have to spend $100 or more.</li>
            <li>I could purchase again, I would just save up an extra $60 and get a Dovo, those seem to get alot of great reviews, and that way you&#x27;ll know for sure that if you arent shaving well, its YOU not the blade :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say that if you want to try a straight razor this is a good one to start with.</li>
            <li>The Dovo gives a better shave in tight areas but the Gold Dollar 208 carbon steel blade is an excellent change up blade.</li>
            <li>would love to own a Dovo or Hinkles razor but for the money, this razor does the job very well</li>
            <li>I also noticed it didn&#x27;t slice through hair as easily as my replaceable blade had.</li>
            <li>From there honing and stropping came easy.</li>
            <li>That is an easy trade-off.</li>
            <li>It passes the hair test and arm test easily.</li>
            <li>great razor, was shave ready right out of the box.</li>
            <li>If your new to stright razor shaving this is a good choice.</li>
            <li>If you feel like experimenting, this razor is fine.  </li>
            <li>The razor is fine.</li>
            <li>Razor is fine</li>
            <li>The scales on this thing if made from cheap flimsy plastic.</li>
            <li>The scales are flimsy and cheap, as stated in another review.</li>
            <li>Cheap construction.</li>
            <li>seems really light.</li>
            <li>Great simple razor.</li>
            <li>It just felt cheap.</li>
            <li>The maker&#x27;s mark is stamped into the blade fairly lightly.</li>
            <li>downside, as stated is the cheap scales.  </li>
            <li>but I will say that for a beginner razor and for someone who doesn&#x27;t want to invest in a $150-$500 razor this is a great starting point</li>
            <li>you cant properly fit fingers on this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sound like a sword unsheathing.</li>
            <li>The weight of it is light</li>
            <li>It does not have a beautiful polish and shows some minor defects throughout the blade.  </li>
            <li>The edge can be made better, but this blade was more &amp;#34;shave ready&amp;#34; than a couple costly &amp;#34;shave readY&#x27; blades</li>
            <li>so far so good.  </li>
            <li>They offered a refund but the pr guy was like I&#x27;ll make sure it right</li>
            <li>It makes him enjoy shaving and leaves him with a getting smooth clean shave and</li>
            <li>Good first straight razor.</li>
            <li>Received the product promptly and was excited to try out the blade.  </li>
            <li>But the edge is clean and it shaves well.  </li>
            <li>a tool for learning how to do a straight razor shave, this is a good, reasonably priced option.</li>
            <li>My son is excited to learn more about how to use a straight razor</li>
            <li>This is totally my fault, and not a failing of the blade - but a carbon steel razor would sharpen better and more easily.</li>
            <li>Special Razor and i am not here to promote Dovo as they need no promotion....</li>
            <li>After honing with Naniwa 5K, 8K and 12K grit stones and stropping, it shaved fairly well and is occasionally used in rotation with two Dovos and a Thiers Issard.  </li>
            <li>Well, as it turned out this razor was only good for about one shave before i needed to put it to the stones for honing.</li>
            <li>Second shave was not as good.  </li>
            <li>I am giving it 4 stars because it does give an OK shave out of the box and is very inexpensive compared to what are known as quality razors.</li>
            <li>I am NOT that patient, nor as skilled to use a straight razor, but he is.  </li>
            <li>What you may not know is that most razors are not sold as shave ready.</li>
            <li>Overall, good buy.</li>
            <li>the handle, while handsome and modern, does seem kind of rickety but has held up well so far.</li>
            <li>, its usually left up to me if i want them to stay in good quality.</li>
            <li>It shaved fairly well and is really a back up travel blade.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The shave was ok up to the point of having to do the chin area where the whiskers are much thicker.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s okay for a already honed straight razor.</li>
            <li>Ready to shave out of the box, tight pins and perfect for the beginner</li>
            <li>This thing is razor sharp, and I was quite happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>This review is giving 2 stars only because it&#x27;s the best Chinese razor I&#x27;ve ever seen</li>
            <li>Great starting straight razor, recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>First off this Razor comes from Hong Kong and can be purchased for 18.00 bucks elsewhere with free shipping.</li>
            <li>Great beginner razor, would highly recommend this to someone new to straight razors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Glad I did, this thing is truely shave ready and gave me a nice comfortable shave that didn&#x27;t tug and rip the hair out like the other one.</li>
            <li>I do recommend this product, if you can afford new and better scales, and fix the alignment of the blade.</li>
            <li>Carbon Steel is easy to sharpen and also maintains its edge very well.&lt;br /&gt;Bear</li>
            <li>I also have a 5/8\\&quot; full hollow Dovo, and fairly often I prefer this razor to my Dovo.</li>
            <li>I use it in rotation with  2 other razors that are considerably older and have great rep, and this razor keeps up with them just fine.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m proud that he wants to learn the original way (after sharp rocks and stones).</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed, would recommend to a friend!</li>
            <li>Very nice razor and very sharp.</li>
            <li>Shaving with it is as smooth and effortless as straight razors come.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The razor is very well made and comfortable to handle and use.</li>
            <li>I have even seen a Straight Razor called the Gold Dollar that can be bought for $3.54 with free shipping from Hong Kong.</li>
            <li>Gold Dollar #208 is worth</li>
            <li>Was a good price, and everything I expected.</li>
            <li>worth every penny.</li>
            <li>* worth $45.  </li>
            <li>Not crazy about synthetic material scales (handle).</li>
            <li>You can find many vintage straight razors that use a much better grade steel for close to the same money</li>
            <li>Great razor for the price, came sharp right out of the box no need to sharpen at all, just strop it and its ready</li>
            <li>First the razor was not shave ready I emailed them they assured me that the razor was fine</li>
            <li>the name should be almost shave ready had to sharpen it, after that it did pretty good and finally got the shave i was looking for</li>
            <li>I wish I would have taken a refund what good happened due to this</li>
            <li>bought this razor with high hopes of not having to worry about honing it but only giving it a good stropping.</li>
            <li>Takes some honing and stopping to get it right.</li>
            <li>Took a while to shape to right geometry on a coarser water stone, but it did work.</li>
            <li>I have shaved with many straight razors and was looking for a replacement to start new.</li>
            <li>Personally, I find the carbon scales to be relatively attractive, some of the better and more expensive Spyderco knives (like the Caly 3) have carbon fiber scales.  </li>
            <li>Good sharp razor ready out</li>
            <li>in mind that this is a 50 dollar razor, and with a little bit of effort with waterstones and good stropping</li>
            <li>closer inspection showed all sorts of nicks and shapes that if i lloked closer the first time could have seen.</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver ready and it came that way!  </li>
            <li>I would buy it again, but I only need one per lifetime :-)</li>
            <li>It works for shaving pretty well.</li>
            <li>I first received it</li>
            <li>I have a very coarse beard and am hoping that sharpening will give me a better shave.  </li>
            <li>The shave ready straight razor was one of my 26 year old son&#x27;s favorite Christmas presents.  </li>
            <li>It came shave ready - literally!  </li>
            <li>Not shave ready!</li>
            <li>should have giving up after the first 3 times i cut</li>
            <li>/&gt;i give it 2 stars since it is a fail.&lt;br /&gt;i never rate anything higher than a 3</li>
            <li>I did a few passes on the strop just for good measure.</li>
            <li>It has the right weight to it so as to not put to much pressure on the blade while shaving yourself.</li>
            <li>Usable right out of the package thanks to asharperrazor company.</li>
            <li>Right out of the package, I just stropped it a little, and was able to get a very close, fairly comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>Nice Sharp Blade.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think a veteran straight razor user would be satisfied, but for a newbie like me</li>
            <li>My first straight razor was a Dovo.  </li>
            <li>This is my first straight razor and</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t shave ready but pretty close</li>
            <li>Tried my first straight razor shave with this thing.</li>
            <li>Since this was my first straight razor, I did a lot of research before purchasing.  </li>
            <li>This is just about the cheapest razor you&#x27;ll find that is ready for a first timer.  </li>
            <li>my boyfriend of 3 1/2 years recently told me that he wanted a straight razor after watching some classic movies with handsome men getting professional shaves, and i told him to go to a barber and see if he liked the results of a straight razor shave before he actually purchased one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to keep sharp when you have a  barber&#x27;s strop and is one of the closest shaves with no skin irritation that you can get.</li>
            <li>but, don&#x27;t like the thing swinging open so easily..  </li>
            <li>I have been using the Gold Dollar straight razor since 7/16/2013, it was my first straight razor</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s your first straight razor, be ready for the learning curve.</li>
            <li>Also, make sure you dry the blade thoroughly when done as it will rust.</li>
            <li>If you want to try out straight razor shaving for the first time do yourself a favor and buy a vintage straight razor</li>
            <li>definitely cheaper and less irritation tool some getting used to but definitely great</li>
            <li>did nothing more than a few quick passes on a strop and shaved to see how it would go.  </li>
            <li>What the 18.00 bucks gets you is a cheap, low grade straight razor.</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>Razor was shave ready</li>
            <li>It was shave ready out of the box..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s shave ready</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t show it in the picture, but this razor is a cheap Chinese Gold Dollar brand that could be purchased for 9 bucks.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s not saying much.</li>
            <li>The lack of a case to protect it is absolute thoughtlessness from the manufacturer/supplier..  </li>
            <li>As marketed it&#x27;s shave ready out of the box.</li>
            <li>It was specifically said to be shave ready.  </li>
            <li>very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a straight razor with replaceable blades for a while now</li>
            <li>but I wanted to step up to the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a razor to gaze at an marvel over it&#x27;s beauty, but I do recommend it if all you want is a capable straight razor for close morning shaves.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a begginer with straight edge razors</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done some research and am beginning to get the feeling that I should have spent more money on a proven quality blade.  </li>
            <li>This razor came shave ready as advertised.</li>
            <li>I am an official straight razor junkie.</li>
            <li>I have convinced a couple of friends to convert to straight razor shaving as well.</li>
            <li>The selling point for me was that it was ready to shave, but as a gift...</li>
            <li>Ready to shave out of the box.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t shave ready out of the box.</li>
            <li>even thought I really like the razor and had to send it out to be sharpened....</li>
            <li>That 2 foot fall into my sink absolutely shattered the blade.  </li>
            <li>I  would recommend this razor to anyone that want&#x27;s to use a straight razor.</li>
            <li>They will put &#x27;shave ready&#x27;, low-calorie, cut-throat, sugar-free, fat-free, sodium-free, whatever gets you to buy it.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re just getting into straight razor shaving, this is the razor for you.</li>
            <li>I bought a $200 boker elite which I was told came shave ready and was not.</li>
            <li>The razor was shave ready.</li>
            <li>I recommend it for anyone at any and all levels of straight razor shaving.</li>
            <li>have them shave ready for you.</li>
            <li>But there is a sense of confidence that comes with the ability of using a straight razor without making yourself.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>I have been using straight razors for a while now.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>Shave Ready razor is a joke.</li>
            <li>I would find myself having to switch over to the parker to finish the job since it tugged so much.</li>
            <li>I do believe, however, that if you get this razor honed and sharpened it will work really well.</li>
            <li>Gave it 4 stars since it really was not shave ready</li>
            <li>It really does come shave ready and</li>
            <li>I really would recommend this straight razor.</li>
            <li>Much of what people have described as inability to hold an edge may be inexperience with stripping etc.  </li>
            <li>blade is heavy and swings out of the handle (part way) on it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li>It holds an edge nicely, arrived almost shave ready, though it did need stropped and honed very slightly.</li>
            <li>He said that he really likes it and works good when it is sharp enough.</li>
            <li>I am new to straight-razor shaving, and this was my first, entry-level razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure it would break with little use.</li>
            <li>Handle is plastic and doesn&#x27;t feel very quality, but the blade is the main concern when buying a razor, and this fills the bill.</li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone learning how to maintain a high carbon steel straight razor.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s a cheap blade and a hell of a deal overall, but even so the scales could&#x27;ve been just a little bit more</li>
            <li>The scales are a cheap plastic also with minor defects throughout.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s beautiful and shaves well, but quite expensive.  </li>
            <li>I am new to shaving with a straight razor</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nicer; I got it for $20 on sale, the soap is better and I can&#x27;t find a badger brush for $20 by itself much less in a kit with cup, soap, and razor holder.</li>
            <li>I love a company that buys a item for more than less than half the price....</li>
            <li>I keep it dry at all times probably because it is cheap steal</li>
            <li>I bought this for $10, mainly to practice honing.</li>
            <li>Makes a decent party favor for someone who does not plan to ever use it.</li>
            <li>I got it stropped it 50 times and got a decent shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;you cannot fold the blade back without striking it on the handle and dulling it subsequently.</li>
            <li>But this razor shipped quickly and was &amp;#34;razor&amp;#34; sharp right out of the box.</li>
            <li>I highly promote this razor</li>
            <li>/&gt;i highly recommend this one.....&lt;br /&gt;Dovo</li>
            <li>Coupled with &amp;#34;The Art Of Shaving&amp;#34; and a few other accessories, its a great way to learn how to care for your face.</li>
            <li>I do wish the handle was a little more sturdy</li>
            <li>Comes sharp, easy to handle.</li>
            <li>For the price you may get to try out wet shaving on the cheap, or you may also have to buy a strop.  </li>
            <li>Worth buying for low cost!</li>
            <li>I used it in rotation with my Dovo full hollow ground straight razor.</li>
            <li>I plan to buy a few more blades to establish a seven day rotation.</li>
            <li>After a few shaves, I figured I could get a better edge on it, and tried to hone it using my Lansky sharpening kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a &amp;#34;beginner level&amp;#34; razor made by nit-wits that can&#x27;t drill the handle right (so the blade goes back into the handle in a &amp;#</li>
            <li>Very sharp and easy to sharpen and maintain with a strop.</li>
            <li>I must confess that the price had me skeptical, but I was happy and surprised by this product.</li>
            <li>A decent downside is that the handle is plastic and not extremely firm.</li>
            <li>The razor is sharp and very useful.</li>
            <li>I literally have no other straight razor to compare it to, but I can say from my experience, that it works.</li>
            <li>When I ordered the razor, it came barely shave ready.  </li>
            <li>This was worth $10-15 max not too long ago.  </li>
            <li>My first shave with this gave me a closer shave than my regular disposable razor.  </li>
            <li>It came sharp and after a few stokes on the strop it produced a good cut.</li>
            <li>I ordered this to have something to alternate with my then main straight, a Dovo 5/8 full hollow.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re very careful with it and get it sharpened, I&#x27;m sure it would serve you well (especially for ~40 bucks)</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s &amp;#34;head-and-shoulders&amp;#34; above the Chinese &amp;#34;shavette&amp;#34;, with the stainless steel blades that peel the first layer of skin off with the whiskers..  </li>
            <li>Yes it is very easy to catch yourself and I have several small scars to prove it.</li>
            <li>I love the sound it makes when its cutting the hairs.</li>
            <li>On the outside of the case you need to remove a sticker that tells you it is shave ready and you are not allowed to hone it or else you void a warranty.</li>
            <li>That is likely to be a subjective judgment, and all I can say is that I did not find it to be shave ready for me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking on eBay and local antique shops for a second straight razor, but this Gold Dollar is reasonably priced and does the job it was designed for.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want to spend too much to try shaving this way, i personally recommend it.</li>
            <li>Even early .</li>
            <li>so I figured I would go old school.  </li>
            <li>The seller says the razor is professionally sharpened by the people at ASharperRazor.com.</li>
            <li>If you find you don&#x27;t like the straight razor experience you can still sell the vintage razor and get your money back.</li>
            <li>to him, everything is replaceable and i don&#x27;t really share that state of mind - especially when its my money.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this junk.</li>
            <li>though it failed the hair test i decided it was a good idea to shave with it for some reason??&lt;br /&gt;i</li>
            <li>The hollow grind makes for an extremely thin blade, it&#x27;s a bit noisy, but the edge holding capability of the steel is good and sharpens/strops back to true in a short period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Super sharp!</li>
            <li>The edge longevity is on par with every other real straight</li>
            <li>No matter how well you sharpen it, at the first use and it will loose its sharpness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to wet shaving with a straight razor.</li>
            <li>You are more likely to cut yourself with a dull blade believe it or not.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sharp, I had to sharpen it.</li>
            <li>Gold Dollar straight razor came shave ready, but hand grinding left a sharp angle on the blade near the tail, I sharpened it with a coarse/fine diamond sharpener and finished it up with a strop and various strop compounds.  </li>
            <li>Sharp and exactly what I wanted for a beginners razor.</li>
            <li>It seemed to be pretty sharp and I gave it a shot.</li>
            <li>This is a half hollow 6/8 inch and as such probably more forgiving of mis-strokes.  </li>
            <li>I stropped it with green buffing compound several strokes, stropped it on the canvas with out buffing compound several strokes, stropped it on leather for a dozen or so strokes, and the razor is shaving fine now.</li>
            <li>give green light on buying only old russian 1950&#x27;s 1960&#x27;s razors and of course the German brands&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would reccomend this to people curious to Straight Razor shaving.</li>
            <li>Was not shave ready, Amazon gave a partial refund.</li>
            <li>I bought the wet shave razor out of fustration with the boker straight.</li>
            <li>And then a lower grain whetstone or take it to a professional to be properly sharpened.  </li>
            <li>Shaves okay... not great.</li>
            <li>The thinner blades are superior in all respects , thicker blades are cumbersome when concentrating on honing the cutting edge.</li>
            <li>a 1939 German made razor and the near 100 year old blade shaved like I was cutting warm butter buyer</li>
            <li>I should&#x27;ve listen to the other reviews and got a dovo straight razor.</li>
            <li>Unless specifically advertised as shave ready, you are rolling the dice as to how sharp the razor will be.</li>
            <li>i understand not all razors come sharp, but this one specifically stated in description that it is ready to go!&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>But....its definitely not sharp enough.</li>
            <li>If they ground down the entire length of the blade to a sharp cutting edge you would have a great deal because the blade really holds an edge!</li>
            <li>it comes wrapped in bubble wrap, and considering its so dang sharp, keep it far FAR away from kids, considering i cut myself on it when i opened it to wrap it for christmas.....</li>
            <li>Probably a drop straight down on a table or something.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does go dull rather quickly, hence always stropping.</li>
            <li>I was excited at first but very soon disappointed.</li>
            <li>Got a decent, not great, shave right out of the box.  </li>
            <li>You aren&#x27;t going to find a shave ready razor for less unless you go antique shop diving and pay someone to sharpen whatever</li>
            <li>I hoped it would have a nice quality feel, but I was very disappointed with the cheap plastic handle.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that it is a little heavier than my straight razor that costs 5 times what I paid for this one.</li>
            <li>It may be that not everyone who sharpens these at \\&quot;A Sharper Razor\\&quot; is that good, or maybe some one has an occasional bad day.  </li>

            <li> Sturdy handle and good blade.</li>
            <li> Good blade, plastic handle which I prefer metal myself</li>
            <li> All around a good start up razor.</li>
            <li> Made in China, it is about as good a blade as I have seen from China.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and fantastic performance</li>
            <li> This razor came in good shape.</li>
            <li> Gold Dollars can be good affordable shavers.</li>
            <li> Regrettably I could not shave off arm hairs even with a good lather.  </li>
            <li> Good razor with a plastic handle.</li>
            <li> Good weight and heft.</li>
            <li> Needs a good sharpening before use.</li>
            <li> razor that received good reviews on the forums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The good</li>
            <li> So there are the good</li>
            <li> /&gt;The blade is made in China, but the steel is of good quality.</li>
            <li> I give it three stars but it might not be fair to it.</li>
            <li> The price is what makes it good to use as a started razor.</li>
            <li> Good weight, feel.  </li>
            <li> I ended up buying a vintage Sheffield razor for $20 in great shape and better quality.</li>
            <li> But when it arrived, I gave it a good stropping (100 strokes) and it shaves amazing...</li>
            <li> For the price I was very satisfied.</li>
            <li> /&gt;razor comes with a business card stating it was sharpened and hones on the finest of tools and by the most experienced professionals.</li>
            <li> Having a good shave takes a bit of time, but it&#x27;s a nice gift to give to yourself.</li>
            <li> excellent straight razor.</li>
            <li> Excellent shave-ready straight razor.</li>
            <li> It looked nice, but I decided to return -</li>
            <li> I suggest for beginners to get the Vanderhagen Deluxe shave kit for around $10 at Walmart/Target</li>
            <li> But for $50, you get a razor that shaves just as good as razors costing much more.</li>
            <li> It shaved nicely.</li>
            <li> Engraved rather than stamped markings are a nice touch.</li>
            <li> Otherwise nice start up razor.</li>
            <li> This razor has a nice weight and a nice feel.</li>
            <li> the color of the writing on the blade does come off whenever you wipe on the blade with a cloth, which is kind of sketchy.&lt;br /&gt;the problem that i have seen is..</li>
            <li> I got this as a travel razor, if it got lost I&#x27;m not out a fortune or my nice buffalo</li>
            <li> The razor is nice for the price.</li>
            <li> a nice weight to it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good quality razor for someone like me who is just beginning to use a straight razor.</li>
            <li> there a good, cheap &amp;#34;Solingen&amp;#34; blade out there..?</li>
            <li> --I&#x27;d expect to pay $60 or more to replace them..)  </li>
            <li> blade is going to have to be &amp;#34;monitored&amp;#34; all the time to be sure there isn&#x27;t a defect from banging the blade into the handle (from some alignment problem</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s better than a &amp;#34;shavette&amp;#34;.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great product highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Mostly I plan to employ the Gold Dollar when traveling, as I&#x27;d rather lose it than one of the others.  </li>
            <li> I gave it three stars as it required honing --for me-- and two of the water stones each cost more than the razor.  </li>
            <li> a great starter straight razor.</li>
            <li> and I have enjoyed it</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m satisfied with this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased...</li>
            <li> Blade pulls more hairs out than it cuts.  </li>
            <li> It acted more like a comb than a razor.</li>
            <li> was a gold dollar razor he told me that I would be better to buy a vintage razor</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll have something and many sellers</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d gotten for much more money.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m sure you will take better care of your razors, but he has almost ruined this razor after TWO WEEKS by not taking care of it....</li>
            <li> : It&#x27;s a nice cheap razor that comes &amp;#34;razor sharp&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It also works great and as always using a straight razor makes you feel like a badass.</li>
            <li> but i am watching to see if it holds up ok</li>
            <li> I cannot speak to the truth of this statement and am leaning more towards FALSE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> the razor shaves very nice but the handle is VERY flimsy and I feel like it will break.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you get shaving soap and a nice brush and warm your face up with a hot towel - it makes all the difference.  </li>
            <li> lol he is was still new at it!</li>
            <li> and i can get a pretty good shave with those</li>
            <li> First BUNCH of shaves won&#x27;t feel as good as disposable razor, but read up on technique and stay with it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted, good to go from the box.</li>
            <li> I got a pretty darned good shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For example, Dovo &amp; Thiers Issard sharpen their razors at the factory, but a good number of people don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s good enough to shave with.</li>
            <li> Very good especially for the money.  </li>
            <li> Was aligned perfectly in the center of the scales.</li>
            <li> OK,,, the handle is cheap plastic</li>
            <li> Apparently, if you want a great razor, you have to spend $100 or more.</li>
            <li> I could purchase again, I would just save up an extra $60 and get a Dovo, those seem to get alot of great reviews, and that way you&#x27;ll know for sure that if you arent shaving well, its YOU not the blade :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say that if you want to try a straight razor this is a good one to start with.</li>
            <li> The Dovo gives a better shave in tight areas but the Gold Dollar 208 carbon steel blade is an excellent change up blade.</li>
            <li> would love to own a Dovo or Hinkles razor but for the money, this razor does the job very well</li>
            <li> I also noticed it didn&#x27;t slice through hair as easily as my replaceable blade had.</li>
            <li> From there honing and stropping came easy.</li>
            <li> That is an easy trade-off.</li>
            <li> It passes the hair test and arm test easily.</li>
            <li> great razor, was shave ready right out of the box.</li>
            <li> If your new to stright razor shaving this is a good choice.</li>
            <li> If you feel like experimenting, this razor is fine.  </li>
            <li> The razor is fine.</li>
            <li> Razor is fine</li>
            <li> The scales on this thing if made from cheap flimsy plastic.</li>
            <li> The scales are flimsy and cheap, as stated in another review.</li>
            <li> Cheap construction.</li>
            <li> seems really light.</li>
            <li> Great simple razor.</li>
            <li> It just felt cheap.</li>
            <li> The maker&#x27;s mark is stamped into the blade fairly lightly.</li>
            <li> downside, as stated is the cheap scales.  </li>
            <li> but I will say that for a beginner razor and for someone who doesn&#x27;t want to invest in a $150-$500 razor this is a great starting point</li>
            <li> you cant properly fit fingers on this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sound like a sword unsheathing.</li>
            <li> The weight of it is light</li>
            <li> It does not have a beautiful polish and shows some minor defects throughout the blade.  </li>
            <li> The edge can be made better, but this blade was more &amp;#34;shave ready&amp;#34; than a couple costly &amp;#34;shave readY&#x27; blades</li>
            <li> so far so good.  </li>
            <li> They offered a refund but the pr guy was like I&#x27;ll make sure it right</li>
            <li> It makes him enjoy shaving and leaves him with a getting smooth clean shave and</li>
            <li> Good first straight razor.</li>
            <li> Received the product promptly and was excited to try out the blade.  </li>
            <li> But the edge is clean and it shaves well.  </li>
            <li> a tool for learning how to do a straight razor shave, this is a good, reasonably priced option.</li>
            <li> My son is excited to learn more about how to use a straight razor</li>
            <li> This is totally my fault, and not a failing of the blade - but a carbon steel razor would sharpen better and more easily.</li>
            <li> Special Razor and i am not here to promote Dovo as they need no promotion....</li>
            <li> After honing with Naniwa 5K, 8K and 12K grit stones and stropping, it shaved fairly well and is occasionally used in rotation with two Dovos and a Thiers Issard.  </li>
            <li> Well, as it turned out this razor was only good for about one shave before i needed to put it to the stones for honing.</li>
            <li> Second shave was not as good.  </li>
            <li> I am giving it 4 stars because it does give an OK shave out of the box and is very inexpensive compared to what are known as quality razors.</li>
            <li> I am NOT that patient, nor as skilled to use a straight razor, but he is.  </li>
            <li> What you may not know is that most razors are not sold as shave ready.</li>
            <li> Overall, good buy.</li>
            <li> the handle, while handsome and modern, does seem kind of rickety but has held up well so far.</li>
            <li> , its usually left up to me if i want them to stay in good quality.</li>
            <li> It shaved fairly well and is really a back up travel blade.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The shave was ok up to the point of having to do the chin area where the whiskers are much thicker.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s okay for a already honed straight razor.</li>
            <li> Ready to shave out of the box, tight pins and perfect for the beginner</li>
            <li> This thing is razor sharp, and I was quite happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This review is giving 2 stars only because it&#x27;s the best Chinese razor I&#x27;ve ever seen</li>
            <li> Great starting straight razor, recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> First off this Razor comes from Hong Kong and can be purchased for 18.00 bucks elsewhere with free shipping.</li>
            <li> Great beginner razor, would highly recommend this to someone new to straight razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Glad I did, this thing is truely shave ready and gave me a nice comfortable shave that didn&#x27;t tug and rip the hair out like the other one.</li>
            <li> I do recommend this product, if you can afford new and better scales, and fix the alignment of the blade.</li>
            <li> Carbon Steel is easy to sharpen and also maintains its edge very well.&lt;br /&gt;Bear</li>
            <li> I also have a 5/8\\&quot; full hollow Dovo, and fairly often I prefer this razor to my Dovo.</li>
            <li> I use it in rotation with  2 other razors that are considerably older and have great rep, and this razor keeps up with them just fine.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m proud that he wants to learn the original way (after sharp rocks and stones).</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed, would recommend to a friend!</li>
            <li> Very nice razor and very sharp.</li>
            <li> Shaving with it is as smooth and effortless as straight razors come.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The razor is very well made and comfortable to handle and use.</li>
            <li> I have even seen a Straight Razor called the Gold Dollar that can be bought for $3.54 with free shipping from Hong Kong.</li>
            <li> Gold Dollar #208 is worth</li>
            <li> Was a good price, and everything I expected.</li>
            <li> worth every penny.</li>
            <li> * worth $45.  </li>
            <li> Not crazy about synthetic material scales (handle).</li>
            <li> You can find many vintage straight razors that use a much better grade steel for close to the same money</li>
            <li> Great razor for the price, came sharp right out of the box no need to sharpen at all, just strop it and its ready</li>
            <li> First the razor was not shave ready I emailed them they assured me that the razor was fine</li>
            <li> the name should be almost shave ready had to sharpen it, after that it did pretty good and finally got the shave i was looking for</li>
            <li> I wish I would have taken a refund what good happened due to this</li>
            <li> bought this razor with high hopes of not having to worry about honing it but only giving it a good stropping.</li>
            <li> Takes some honing and stopping to get it right.</li>
            <li> Took a while to shape to right geometry on a coarser water stone, but it did work.</li>
            <li> I have shaved with many straight razors and was looking for a replacement to start new.</li>
            <li> Personally, I find the carbon scales to be relatively attractive, some of the better and more expensive Spyderco knives (like the Caly 3) have carbon fiber scales.  </li>
            <li> Good sharp razor ready out</li>
            <li> in mind that this is a 50 dollar razor, and with a little bit of effort with waterstones and good stropping</li>
            <li> closer inspection showed all sorts of nicks and shapes that if i lloked closer the first time could have seen.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver ready and it came that way!  </li>
            <li> I would buy it again, but I only need one per lifetime :-)</li>
            <li> It works for shaving pretty well.</li>
            <li> I first received it</li>
            <li> I have a very coarse beard and am hoping that sharpening will give me a better shave.  </li>
            <li> The shave ready straight razor was one of my 26 year old son&#x27;s favorite Christmas presents.  </li>
            <li> It came shave ready - literally!  </li>
            <li> Not shave ready!</li>
            <li> should have giving up after the first 3 times i cut</li>
            <li> /&gt;i give it 2 stars since it is a fail.&lt;br /&gt;i never rate anything higher than a 3</li>
            <li> I did a few passes on the strop just for good measure.</li>
            <li> It has the right weight to it so as to not put to much pressure on the blade while shaving yourself.</li>
            <li> Usable right out of the package thanks to asharperrazor company.</li>
            <li> Right out of the package, I just stropped it a little, and was able to get a very close, fairly comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Nice Sharp Blade.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think a veteran straight razor user would be satisfied, but for a newbie like me</li>
            <li> My first straight razor was a Dovo.  </li>
            <li> This is my first straight razor and</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t shave ready but pretty close</li>
            <li> Tried my first straight razor shave with this thing.</li>
            <li> Since this was my first straight razor, I did a lot of research before purchasing.  </li>
            <li> This is just about the cheapest razor you&#x27;ll find that is ready for a first timer.  </li>
            <li> my boyfriend of 3 1/2 years recently told me that he wanted a straight razor after watching some classic movies with handsome men getting professional shaves, and i told him to go to a barber and see if he liked the results of a straight razor shave before he actually purchased one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to keep sharp when you have a  barber&#x27;s strop and is one of the closest shaves with no skin irritation that you can get.</li>
            <li> but, don&#x27;t like the thing swinging open so easily..  </li>
            <li> I have been using the Gold Dollar straight razor since 7/16/2013, it was my first straight razor</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s your first straight razor, be ready for the learning curve.</li>
            <li> Also, make sure you dry the blade thoroughly when done as it will rust.</li>
            <li> If you want to try out straight razor shaving for the first time do yourself a favor and buy a vintage straight razor</li>
            <li> definitely cheaper and less irritation tool some getting used to but definitely great</li>
            <li> did nothing more than a few quick passes on a strop and shaved to see how it would go.  </li>
            <li> What the 18.00 bucks gets you is a cheap, low grade straight razor.</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> Razor was shave ready</li>
            <li> It was shave ready out of the box..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shave ready</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t show it in the picture, but this razor is a cheap Chinese Gold Dollar brand that could be purchased for 9 bucks.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s not saying much.</li>
            <li> The lack of a case to protect it is absolute thoughtlessness from the manufacturer/supplier..  </li>
            <li> As marketed it&#x27;s shave ready out of the box.</li>
            <li> It was specifically said to be shave ready.  </li>
            <li> very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a straight razor with replaceable blades for a while now</li>
            <li> but I wanted to step up to the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a razor to gaze at an marvel over it&#x27;s beauty, but I do recommend it if all you want is a capable straight razor for close morning shaves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a begginer with straight edge razors</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done some research and am beginning to get the feeling that I should have spent more money on a proven quality blade.  </li>
            <li> This razor came shave ready as advertised.</li>
            <li> I am an official straight razor junkie.</li>
            <li> I have convinced a couple of friends to convert to straight razor shaving as well.</li>
            <li> The selling point for me was that it was ready to shave, but as a gift...</li>
            <li> Ready to shave out of the box.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t shave ready out of the box.</li>
            <li> even thought I really like the razor and had to send it out to be sharpened....</li>
            <li> That 2 foot fall into my sink absolutely shattered the blade.  </li>
            <li> I  would recommend this razor to anyone that want&#x27;s to use a straight razor.</li>
            <li> They will put &#x27;shave ready&#x27;, low-calorie, cut-throat, sugar-free, fat-free, sodium-free, whatever gets you to buy it.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re just getting into straight razor shaving, this is the razor for you.</li>
            <li> I bought a $200 boker elite which I was told came shave ready and was not.</li>
            <li> The razor was shave ready.</li>
            <li> I recommend it for anyone at any and all levels of straight razor shaving.</li>
            <li> have them shave ready for you.</li>
            <li> But there is a sense of confidence that comes with the ability of using a straight razor without making yourself.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> I have been using straight razors for a while now.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> Shave Ready razor is a joke.</li>
            <li> I would find myself having to switch over to the parker to finish the job since it tugged so much.</li>
            <li> I do believe, however, that if you get this razor honed and sharpened it will work really well.</li>
            <li> Gave it 4 stars since it really was not shave ready</li>
            <li> It really does come shave ready and</li>
            <li> I really would recommend this straight razor.</li>
            <li> Much of what people have described as inability to hold an edge may be inexperience with stripping etc.  </li>
            <li> blade is heavy and swings out of the handle (part way) on it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li> It holds an edge nicely, arrived almost shave ready, though it did need stropped and honed very slightly.</li>
            <li> He said that he really likes it and works good when it is sharp enough.</li>
            <li> I am new to straight-razor shaving, and this was my first, entry-level razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure it would break with little use.</li>
            <li> Handle is plastic and doesn&#x27;t feel very quality, but the blade is the main concern when buying a razor, and this fills the bill.</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone learning how to maintain a high carbon steel straight razor.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a cheap blade and a hell of a deal overall, but even so the scales could&#x27;ve been just a little bit more</li>
            <li> The scales are a cheap plastic also with minor defects throughout.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful and shaves well, but quite expensive.  </li>
            <li> I am new to shaving with a straight razor</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nicer; I got it for $20 on sale, the soap is better and I can&#x27;t find a badger brush for $20 by itself much less in a kit with cup, soap, and razor holder.</li>
            <li> I love a company that buys a item for more than less than half the price....</li>
            <li> I keep it dry at all times probably because it is cheap steal</li>
            <li> I bought this for $10, mainly to practice honing.</li>
            <li> Makes a decent party favor for someone who does not plan to ever use it.</li>
            <li> I got it stropped it 50 times and got a decent shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;you cannot fold the blade back without striking it on the handle and dulling it subsequently.</li>
            <li> But this razor shipped quickly and was &amp;#34;razor&amp;#34; sharp right out of the box.</li>
            <li> I highly promote this razor</li>
            <li> /&gt;i highly recommend this one.....&lt;br /&gt;Dovo</li>
            <li> Coupled with &amp;#34;The Art Of Shaving&amp;#34; and a few other accessories, its a great way to learn how to care for your face.</li>
            <li> I do wish the handle was a little more sturdy</li>
            <li> Comes sharp, easy to handle.</li>
            <li> For the price you may get to try out wet shaving on the cheap, or you may also have to buy a strop.  </li>
            <li> Worth buying for low cost!</li>
            <li> I used it in rotation with my Dovo full hollow ground straight razor.</li>
            <li> I plan to buy a few more blades to establish a seven day rotation.</li>
            <li> After a few shaves, I figured I could get a better edge on it, and tried to hone it using my Lansky sharpening kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a &amp;#34;beginner level&amp;#34; razor made by nit-wits that can&#x27;t drill the handle right (so the blade goes back into the handle in a &amp;#</li>
            <li> Very sharp and easy to sharpen and maintain with a strop.</li>
            <li> I must confess that the price had me skeptical, but I was happy and surprised by this product.</li>
            <li> A decent downside is that the handle is plastic and not extremely firm.</li>
            <li> The razor is sharp and very useful.</li>
            <li> I literally have no other straight razor to compare it to, but I can say from my experience, that it works.</li>
            <li> When I ordered the razor, it came barely shave ready.  </li>
            <li> This was worth $10-15 max not too long ago.  </li>
            <li> My first shave with this gave me a closer shave than my regular disposable razor.  </li>
            <li> It came sharp and after a few stokes on the strop it produced a good cut.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to have something to alternate with my then main straight, a Dovo 5/8 full hollow.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re very careful with it and get it sharpened, I&#x27;m sure it would serve you well (especially for ~40 bucks)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s &amp;#34;head-and-shoulders&amp;#34; above the Chinese &amp;#34;shavette&amp;#34;, with the stainless steel blades that peel the first layer of skin off with the whiskers..  </li>
            <li> Yes it is very easy to catch yourself and I have several small scars to prove it.</li>
            <li> I love the sound it makes when its cutting the hairs.</li>
            <li> On the outside of the case you need to remove a sticker that tells you it is shave ready and you are not allowed to hone it or else you void a warranty.</li>
            <li> That is likely to be a subjective judgment, and all I can say is that I did not find it to be shave ready for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking on eBay and local antique shops for a second straight razor, but this Gold Dollar is reasonably priced and does the job it was designed for.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to spend too much to try shaving this way, i personally recommend it.</li>
            <li> Even early .</li>
            <li> so I figured I would go old school.  </li>
            <li> The seller says the razor is professionally sharpened by the people at ASharperRazor.com.</li>
            <li> If you find you don&#x27;t like the straight razor experience you can still sell the vintage razor and get your money back.</li>
            <li> to him, everything is replaceable and i don&#x27;t really share that state of mind - especially when its my money.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this junk.</li>
            <li> though it failed the hair test i decided it was a good idea to shave with it for some reason??&lt;br /&gt;i</li>
            <li> The hollow grind makes for an extremely thin blade, it&#x27;s a bit noisy, but the edge holding capability of the steel is good and sharpens/strops back to true in a short period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Super sharp!</li>
            <li> The edge longevity is on par with every other real straight</li>
            <li> No matter how well you sharpen it, at the first use and it will loose its sharpness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to wet shaving with a straight razor.</li>
            <li> You are more likely to cut yourself with a dull blade believe it or not.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sharp, I had to sharpen it.</li>
            <li> Gold Dollar straight razor came shave ready, but hand grinding left a sharp angle on the blade near the tail, I sharpened it with a coarse/fine diamond sharpener and finished it up with a strop and various strop compounds.  </li>
            <li> Sharp and exactly what I wanted for a beginners razor.</li>
            <li> It seemed to be pretty sharp and I gave it a shot.</li>
            <li> This is a half hollow 6/8 inch and as such probably more forgiving of mis-strokes.  </li>
            <li> I stropped it with green buffing compound several strokes, stropped it on the canvas with out buffing compound several strokes, stropped it on leather for a dozen or so strokes, and the razor is shaving fine now.</li>
            <li> give green light on buying only old russian 1950&#x27;s 1960&#x27;s razors and of course the German brands&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would reccomend this to people curious to Straight Razor shaving.</li>
            <li> Was not shave ready, Amazon gave a partial refund.</li>
            <li> I bought the wet shave razor out of fustration with the boker straight.</li>
            <li> And then a lower grain whetstone or take it to a professional to be properly sharpened.  </li>
            <li> Shaves okay... not great.</li>
            <li> The thinner blades are superior in all respects , thicker blades are cumbersome when concentrating on honing the cutting edge.</li>
            <li> a 1939 German made razor and the near 100 year old blade shaved like I was cutting warm butter buyer</li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve listen to the other reviews and got a dovo straight razor.</li>
            <li> Unless specifically advertised as shave ready, you are rolling the dice as to how sharp the razor will be.</li>
            <li> i understand not all razors come sharp, but this one specifically stated in description that it is ready to go!&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> But....its definitely not sharp enough.</li>
            <li> If they ground down the entire length of the blade to a sharp cutting edge you would have a great deal because the blade really holds an edge!</li>
            <li> it comes wrapped in bubble wrap, and considering its so dang sharp, keep it far FAR away from kids, considering i cut myself on it when i opened it to wrap it for christmas.....</li>
            <li> Probably a drop straight down on a table or something.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does go dull rather quickly, hence always stropping.</li>
            <li> I was excited at first but very soon disappointed.</li>
            <li> Got a decent, not great, shave right out of the box.  </li>
            <li> You aren&#x27;t going to find a shave ready razor for less unless you go antique shop diving and pay someone to sharpen whatever</li>
            <li> I hoped it would have a nice quality feel, but I was very disappointed with the cheap plastic handle.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it is a little heavier than my straight razor that costs 5 times what I paid for this one.</li>
            <li> It may be that not everyone who sharpens these at \\&quot;A Sharper Razor\\&quot; is that good, or maybe some one has an occasional bad day.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t do it right, and ended up with an actually less sharp blade.</li>
            <li> it goes dull fairly quickly but as long as you sharpen it before each use it works well</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shave ready is a term used by the wet shaving community to denote a razor that is sharp enough to shave with.</li>
            <li> but I have no other straight razor to compare to and my facial hair is the least of any white guy you will ever meet.</li>
            <li> Doesnt lay flat on a stone, due to the flat on the back not going far enough.</li>
            <li> Gold Dollar razors are pretty dull from the factory.</li>
            <li> At the heel end, the back end of the blade, the cutting edge is the same thickness as at the shoulder, the top of the blade.</li>
            <li> I recommend this straight razor for those who want to try a straight razor but are skeptical.</li>
            <li> I did find the same razor for less than half the price that said it was not shave ready.</li>
            <li> Just watch a couple Utubes on how to properly use, maintain and IF you miss cutting your throat before watching the experts you will love it as I now do.</li>
            <li> However, after honing it and stropping with Green Chrome Oxide and then stropping on soft leather</li>
            <li> so long playing computer games that he has a long beard.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll probably want to upgrade before too long, like I do.</li>
            <li> The Scales are plastic, the blade is sharp enough to shave with.  </li>
            <li> Actually with a bit of honing and stropping the blade is quite sharp.</li>
            <li> I noticed this through a loupe, seeing if the edge was sharp enough.....</li>
            <li> I returned this razor because after only three uses, properly drying, and taking care of the razor... it started rusting a little bit.</li>
            <li> Then I saw after sending it in, that other sellers on Amazon are selling the same razor for $19.</li>
            <li> if you have big fingers and dont mind all the other stuff i wrote, still dont buy it</li>
            <li> I not only recommend but would go a step further and say don&#x27;t waste your money on another.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first when I seen the price and mixed reviews...</li>
            <li> so I used it on the second half in.</li>
            <li> Barely sharp enough to cut anything, let alone razor sharp.</li>
            <li> My primary objection is that they did NOT grind down the entire blade to a cutting edge.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s when I found this is actually a stainless blade, and a little  hard to hone.</li>
            <li> Every other razor costing under $100 is not a real straight razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> when you closed it the blade would run into edge of plastic (undoing your work of honing/stropping).</li>
            <li> In my opinion a sheer waste of money.</li>
            <li> am not a fan of the plastic scales, and mine are no properly aligned, as the blade has caught on the scales while closing a few times.</li>
            <li> handle is very flimsy and thin...</li>
            <li> I started with a parker shavette razor a few weeks ago and just recently bought the Gold Dollar.</li>
            <li> but seriously they weren&#x27;t kidding when the said it was professionally sharpened.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;Hair-cutting katana&amp;#34; is sharp.  </li>
            <li> Sharp as hell</li>
            <li> If it had come as sharp as I honed it to, I&#x27;d give it four stars.  </li>
            <li> Quite sharp.</li>
            <li> Lets you know how sharp it should be every shave.  </li>
            <li> I know this due to the laser etching was removed...</li>
            <li> Due to</li>
            <li> and it cam sharp as can be and wasnt warped or bend at all.</li>
            <li> like the other guys said.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is sharp enough.</li>
            <li> but it comes fairly sharp and putting it on an 8,000 grind stone would do the finishing touch.</li>
            <li> It does in fact give a closer shave than any of my other safety razors.</li>
            <li> Cannot recommend this highly enough if you are serious about beginning to wet shave.</li>
            <li> Shaving with a straight razor isn&#x27;t for the faint of heart or for people in a hurry.</li>
            <li> Not worth what i paid but does the job.</li>
            <li> Thought the blade is sharper than a tack, it&#x27;s uneven and off center.</li>
            <li> Holy sharp Batman!  </li>
            <li> Fromm razors do not come very sharp.</li>
            <li> Luckily no damage to the blade occurred and stropping corrected any dulling that may have occurred.</li>
            <li> and it is now a precise cutting machine!</li>
            <li> --It should have a little &amp;#34;drag&amp;#34; to put it into &amp;#34;operation&amp;#34;..  </li>
            <li> It shaves just as as any of my other razors if not better.</li>
            <li> Have used it now for a few weeks with no complaints.</li>
            <li> However seeing improvements with each round of the whetstone.</li>
            <li> I stropped it a few times before using it</li>
            <li> I strop a few times after each shave</li>
            <li> the blade/scale were uneven in that</li>
            <li> Must be dried IMMEDIATELY and THOROUGHLY otherwise blade will rust.</li>
            <li> Piece of garbage and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I cut myself a few times with it.</li>
            <li> Holds an edge for a few days&lt;br</li>
            <li> very sharp!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy.</li>
            <li> JUST BUY A DOVO!!&lt;br /&gt;Razor not sharp, it fails the hair test.</li>
            <li> This Gold Dollar shaves just as well, but it&#x27;s pretty ugly.  </li>
            <li> --Dangerous--&lt;br /&gt;--I&#x27;m not an amateur</li>
            <li> fails human and cat hair test.</li>
            <li> Not sure if that comes with experience, or if the blade is the deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have purchased some expensive straight razors that have left me disappointed.</li>
            <li> It does not take an edge, it does not keep an edge, and it is hard to use.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s build quality and dull &amp;</li>
            <li> Respect yourself and don&#x27;t throw away your hard earned money.  </li>
            <li> Dull as a butter knife.jad to send off to have edge put on it.</li>
            <li> Strop compounds are cheaper than buying an expensive dual grit stone and makes for less stropping than plain leather would.  </li>
            <li> This causes a big &amp;#34;bump&amp;#34; at the heel end of the cutting surface.</li>
            <li> Therefore when you try and hone the blade you are constantly chipping the edges of your stone because the blade edge, the cutting part, the blade thickens at the heel.</li>
            <li> I purchased several razors including very expensive ones.  </li>
            <li> bad: After about a week my razor started getting marks similar to surface rust</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not happy that I got a $17.00 razor for forty some dollars just because it was honed.</li>
            <li> not happy with</li>
            <li> /&gt;--Overall, the execution of manufacture of this razor is deficient.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is poorly made.  </li>
            <li> not happy at all,</li>
            <li> I got tired of spending $20 for 4 replacement blades</li>
            <li> he has a list of razors that he will not hone due to bad steel about five or six on the list</li>
            <li> but Ill keep it as a beater.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I&#x27;ve returned it.</li>
            <li> Well constructed nothing wrong...</li>
            <li> I find it difficult to use as I have never used one before.</li>
            <li> I stress, very thin plastic.</li>
            <li> --This is dangerous.  </li>
            <li> However, the blade did come with a dent on the cutting end of the blade ...</li>
            <li> The blade has a Gold Dollar logo embossed on it and made in China stamped at the base.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this for my husband. He absolutely loves it. It makes him enjoy shaving and leaves him with a getting smooth clean shave and No razor burn. I recommend this straight razor for those who want to try a straight razor but are skeptical. Worth buying for low cost!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend ordered this to start shaving. He said that he really likes it and works good when it is sharp enough.</li>
            <li> Solid beginners&#x27; razor. Takes some honing and stopping to get it right. Have used it now for a few weeks with no complaints. Still haven&#x27;t gotten the edge perfect. However seeing improvements with each round of the whetstone. Would recommend to anyone learning how to maintain a high carbon steel straight razor. When you can manage this one properly then buy a Dovo.</li>
            <li> Razor was shave ready so I was happy about that. I did find the same razor for less than half the price that said it was not shave ready. So I&#x27;m not happy that I got a $17.00 razor for forty some dollars just because it was honed.</li>
            <li> Shaves okay... not great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sharp, I had to sharpen it.</li>
            <li> On the outside of the case you need to remove a sticker that tells you it is shave ready and you are not allowed to hone it or else you void a warranty. I left it be. naked eye inspection didnt notice anything. Tore my face to shreds. Red rip marks all over my face from this blade. I have shaved with many straight razors and was looking for a replacement to start new. closer inspection showed all sorts of nicks and shapes that if i lloked closer the first time could have seen. following day my face looked like krueger attacked me in my sleep.</li>
            <li> excellent straight razor. It was shave ready out of the box.. I stropped it a few times before using it but I didn&#x27;t have to. I highly promote this razor</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shave ready but it holds an edge like a damp phone book. It didn&#x27;t show it in the picture, but this razor is a cheap Chinese Gold Dollar brand that could be purchased for 9 bucks. This review is giving 2 stars only because it&#x27;s the best Chinese razor I&#x27;ve ever seen but that&#x27;s not saying much. I was excited at first but very soon disappointed.</li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve listen to the other reviews and got a dovo straight razor. The scales on this thing if made from cheap flimsy plastic. Thought the blade is sharper than a tack, it&#x27;s uneven and off center. I do recommend this product, if you can afford new and better scales, and fix the alignment of the blade.</li>
            <li> Shaves like a charm. Sturdy handle and good blade.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;Hair-cutting katana&amp;#34; is sharp.  That&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve got to say about it.&lt;br /&gt;The blade is heavy and swings out of the handle (part way) on it&#x27;s own.  --This is dangerous.  --It should have a little &amp;#34;drag&amp;#34; to put it into &amp;#34;operation&amp;#34;..  --After it slips outward, there is a lot of &amp;#34;drag&amp;#34; to get it into &amp;#34;operation position&amp;#34;..  (perhaps, the drilling of the handle is &amp;#34;cocked&amp;#34;..?)&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s &amp;#34;head-and-shoulders&amp;#34; above the Chinese &amp;#34;shavette&amp;#34;, with the stainless steel blades that peel the first layer of skin off with the whiskers..  But, when I fold the blade back into the handle, the blade hits a bit of the handle..  There&#x27;s going to be a &amp;#34;nick&amp;#34; in this blade that will tend to scar when shaving..&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like how rounded the end is either.  This is a &amp;#34;beginner level&amp;#34; razor made by nit-wits that can&#x27;t drill the handle right (so the blade goes back into the handle in a &amp;#34;protected fasion&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had two excellent razors (both stolen) that cost $25 and $35.  (Please, this was before the inflation of today..  --I&#x27;d expect to pay $60 or more to replace them..)  Both of these blades were from Solingen, Germany.  --This is what I wanted and could not find.&lt;br /&gt;I settled on this &amp;#34;Gold Dollar&amp;#34; (POS)..  --It didn&#x27;t come with a protective, plastic case to put the blade in..  --It came in a plastic bag.&lt;br /&gt;The blade is going to have to be &amp;#34;monitored&amp;#34; all the time to be sure there isn&#x27;t a defect from banging the blade into the handle (from some alignment problem I&#x27;ve already mentioned).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;But, it&#x27;s better than a &amp;#34;shavette&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;--Overall, the execution of manufacture of this razor is deficient.  The lack of a case to protect it is absolute thoughtlessness from the manufacturer/supplier..  --Perhaps, there is no &amp;#34;parallelism&amp;#34; in the blade where it is mounted to the handle..&lt;br /&gt;It looks like I have to fix something Ibought &amp;#34;brand-new&amp;#34; with expectations that it was &amp;#34;well-thought-out&amp;#34;..  I&#x27;m stuck with &amp;#34;re-engineering/machining&amp;#34; the product to meet &amp;#34;useability and predictivity&amp;#34; standards.&lt;br /&gt;--The Gold Dollar #208 is worth it&#x27;s weight in lint!&lt;br /&gt;It is poorly made.  lacks protective case..  Sharp as hell but, don&#x27;t like the thing swinging open so easily..  --Dangerous--&lt;br /&gt;--I&#x27;m not an amateur shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Isn&#x27;t there a good, cheap &amp;#34;Solingen&amp;#34; blade out there..?</li>
            <li> As marketed it&#x27;s shave ready out of the box. Good blade, plastic handle which I prefer metal myself but it suffices. I strop a few times after each shave his isn&#x27;t nessecary but I like to keep the blade on point.  All around a good start up razor. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Excellent shave-ready straight razor. Coupled with &amp;#34;The Art Of Shaving&amp;#34; and a few other accessories, its a great way to learn how to care for your face. Its a well balanced blade that holds its edge very nicely.</li>
            <li> great razor, was shave ready right out of the box. Would buy another one without hesitation</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver ready and it came that way!  I use it in rotation with  2 other razors that are considerably older and have great rep, and this razor keeps up with them just fine.</li>
            <li> Great product highly recommended! Good sharp razor ready out the box will re order as needed! Very very very great!</li>
            <li> It looked nice, but I decided to return - the blade/scale were uneven in that when you closed it the blade would run into edge of plastic (undoing your work of honing/stropping). I ended up buying a vintage Sheffield razor for $20 in great shape and better quality.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to have something to alternate with my then main straight, a Dovo 5/8 full hollow.  This is a half hollow 6/8 inch and as such probably more forgiving of mis-strokes.  It was specifically said to be shave ready.  That is likely to be a subjective judgment, and all I can say is that I did not find it to be shave ready for me.  YMMV.  I stropped it up before trying to shave with it and after a couple of passes set it aside, as I had a set of water stones on order from elsewhere.  After honing with Naniwa 5K, 8K and 12K grit stones and stropping, it shaved fairly well and is occasionally used in rotation with two Dovos and a Thiers Issard.  Mostly I plan to employ the Gold Dollar when traveling, as I&#x27;d rather lose it than one of the others.  I gave it three stars as it required honing --for me-- and two of the water stones each cost more than the razor.  If it had come as sharp as I honed it to, I&#x27;d give it four stars.  It may be that not everyone who sharpens these at \\&quot;A Sharper Razor\\&quot; is that good, or maybe some one has an occasional bad day.  I don&#x27;t know.  Personally, I find the carbon scales to be relatively attractive, some of the better and more expensive Spyderco knives (like the Caly 3) have carbon fiber scales.  Look it up, they are not cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;July 1 2014 edit:  I have moved this into my regular rotation.  After honing &amp; with pre-shave stropping, it is an excellent shaver.  For the money, it is a solid buy, but may require honing, as mine and others&#x27; did.  Adding a star to my review.</li>
            <li> I have a few straight razors, and I am not a snob. I bought this for $10, mainly to practice honing. The scales are flimsy and cheap, as stated in another review. The stamping on the blade is ink print. Made in China, it is about as good a blade as I have seen from China. That said, the one I have will never shave my face well. It does not take an edge, it does not keep an edge, and it is hard to use. Makes a decent party favor for someone who does not plan to ever use it.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and fantastic performance</li>
            <li> a great starter straight razor. it goes dull fairly quickly but as long as you sharpen it before each use it works well</li>
            <li> This razor came in good shape. Was aligned perfectly in the center of the scales. Was shave-ready out of the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Sharp and polished.&lt;br /&gt;Fits dead-center of the scales and flush.&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;Strops up very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Plastic scales don&#x27;t make for a showy razor, but that&#x27;s not the point!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Gold Dollar straight razor since 7/16/2013, it was my first straight razor and I have enjoyed it immensely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gold Dollar straight razor came shave ready, but hand grinding left a sharp angle on the blade near the tail, I sharpened it with a coarse/fine diamond sharpener and finished it up with a strop and various strop compounds.  Strop compounds are cheaper than buying an expensive dual grit stone and makes for less stropping than plain leather would.  The hollow grind makes for an extremely thin blade, it&#x27;s a bit noisy, but the edge holding capability of the steel is good and sharpens/strops back to true in a short period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would love to own a Dovo or Hinkles razor but for the money, this razor does the job very well and I don&#x27;t see myself upgrading anytime soon.  I suggest for beginners to get the Vanderhagen Deluxe shave kit for around $10 at Walmart/Target, the soap and brush are great for a beginner set.  I upgraded to a Vanderhagen Luxury shave set recently and it&#x27;s nicer; I got it for $20 on sale, the soap is better and I can&#x27;t find a badger brush for $20 by itself much less in a kit with cup, soap, and razor holder.</li>
            <li> The Scales are plastic, the blade is sharp enough to shave with.  I got it stropped it 50 times and got a decent shave.  Great beginner razor, would highly recommend this to someone new to straight razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to wet shaving with a straight razor. I&#x27;ve been using a straight razor with replaceable blades for a while now and i can get a pretty good shave with those but I wanted to step up to the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this razor with high hopes of not having to worry about honing it but only giving it a good stropping. Well, as it turned out this razor was only good for about one shave before i needed to put it to the stones for honing. I also noticed it didn&#x27;t slice through hair as easily as my replaceable blade had. However, after honing it and stropping with Green Chrome Oxide and then stropping on soft leather I got this razor to be truly shave ready.&lt;br /&gt;The Carbon Steel is easy to sharpen and also maintains its edge very well.&lt;br /&gt;Bear in mind that this is a 50 dollar razor, and with a little bit of effort with waterstones and good stropping this razor performs like a 150 dollar razor. I would buy it again, but I only need one per lifetime :-)</li>
            <li> My first straight razor was a Dovo.  It&#x27;s beautiful and shaves well, but quite expensive.  This Gold Dollar shaves just as well, but it&#x27;s pretty ugly.  It does not have a beautiful polish and shows some minor defects throughout the blade.  The scales are a cheap plastic also with minor defects throughout.  But the edge is clean and it shaves well.  I&#x27;ve been looking on eBay and local antique shops for a second straight razor, but this Gold Dollar is reasonably priced and does the job it was designed for.  It&#x27;s not a razor to gaze at an marvel over it&#x27;s beauty, but I do recommend it if all you want is a capable straight razor for close morning shaves.</li>
            <li> I changed the handle on it to a hand-carved yew piece I worked on. It works for shaving pretty well. This is my first straight razor and I strop it a lot before each use (20 on the synthetic, 70 on the leather, and use the synthetic side with buffing composite material (white) every two weeks or so).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first received it I took it to a sharpener and asked for it to be sharpened. Three days later he said it could not be any sharper and he wouldn&#x27;t touch it. That&#x27;s the shave-ready proof of their claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does go dull rather quickly, hence always stropping. I do sometimes strop before a final against-the-grain shave on my chin, which makes a difference believe it or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m satisfied with this but I have no other straight razor to compare to and my facial hair is the least of any white guy you will ever meet. Works for me though and shave is the closest I think possible. Like, NO stubble at all. The ends of the cut hairs are almost deeper than the skin itself after a thorough shave.</li>
            <li> Get one, your pocketbook will thank you later.  Just watch a couple Utubes on how to properly use, maintain and IF you miss cutting your throat before watching the experts you will love it as I now do.</li>
            <li> the name should be almost shave ready had to sharpen it, after that it did pretty good and finally got the shave i was looking for</li>
            <li> Cheap construction. Doesnt lay flat on a stone, due to the flat on the back not going far enough. Scales or blade is warped and the edge hits the scales when you close it. not happy at all, but Ill keep it as a beater.</li>
            <li> Changed the way I look at shaving definitely cheaper and less irritation tool some getting used to but definitely great</li>
            <li> Great razor for the price, came sharp right out of the box no need to sharpen at all, just strop it and its ready</li>
            <li> Nice Sharp Blade. I do wish the handle was a little more sturdy seems really light. For the price I would definately buy again and recommend</li>
            <li> Was a good price, and everything I expected. This thing is razor sharp, and I was quite happy with my purchase. If you don&#x27;t want to spend too much to try shaving this way, i personally recommend it. Does the job quite well.</li>
            <li> They buffed off the Made in China along with the Gold Dollar Logo all the while trying to re-market it as a WSP product. Gold Dollars can be good affordable shavers.</li>
            <li> Great simple razor. Quite sharp. If it&#x27;s your first straight razor, be ready for the learning curve. First BUNCH of shaves won&#x27;t feel as good as disposable razor, but read up on technique and stay with it. Having a good shave takes a bit of time, but it&#x27;s a nice gift to give to yourself. NOT for the &amp;#34;hurried&amp;#34; man.</li>
            <li> bday gift for hubby and he uses it religiously! even cut him self once lol he is was still new at it! very sharp! he uses the strop with it no need for a stone at all in my opinion but i think he bought one just incase :o)</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first when I seen the price and mixed reviews... But when it arrived, I gave it a good stropping (100 strokes) and it shaves amazing... I&#x27;m not a begginer with straight edge razors and I have to say it makes a great entry level/backup razor I&#x27;m pleased... I would reccomend this to people curious to Straight Razor shaving.</li>
            <li> The razor came on time . Even early . But lost its edge after one use . Any suggestions on how to get it back to a razor I can use . I like everything about it but that .</li>
            <li> Got a decent, not great, shave right out of the box.  Second shave was not as good.  I believe I inadvertantly dulled the blade with improper stropping.  I now need to order sharpening stones to sharpen blade.  I have a very coarse beard and am hoping that sharpening will give me a better shave.  Blade pulls more hairs out than it cuts.  I&#x27;ve done some research and am beginning to get the feeling that I should have spent more money on a proven quality blade.  The photos show an unstamped blade.  The blade has a Gold Dollar logo embossed on it and made in China stamped at the base.  I am giving it 4 stars because it does give an OK shave out of the box and is very inexpensive compared to what are known as quality razors.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t shave ready but pretty close</li>
            <li> I bought this razor during Christmas shopping season via Amazon. This razor came shave ready as advertised. I used it in rotation with my Dovo full hollow ground straight razor. The Dovo gives a better shave in tight areas but the Gold Dollar 208 carbon steel blade is an excellent change up blade. I plan to buy a few more blades to establish a seven day rotation. I am an official straight razor junkie. I have convinced a couple of friends to convert to straight razor shaving as well.</li>
            <li> The shave ready straight razor was one of my 26 year old son&#x27;s favorite Christmas presents.  I am NOT that patient, nor as skilled to use a straight razor, but he is.  It was also a very good value.  John  Littleton CO</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted, good to go from the box.</li>
            <li> I purchased several razors including very expensive ones.  This IS the one I now use exclusive!  I not only recommend but would go a step further and say don&#x27;t waste your money on another.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor as a gift. I hoped it would have a nice quality feel, but I was very disappointed with the cheap plastic handle. I stress, very thin plastic. I&#x27;m pretty sure it would break with little use. Needless to say, I&#x27;ve returned it. The selling point for me was that it was ready to shave, but as a gift... It just felt cheap.</li>
            <li> Actually with a bit of honing and stropping the blade is quite sharp. My primary objection is that they did NOT grind down the entire blade to a cutting edge. At the heel end, the back end of the blade, the cutting edge is the same thickness as at the shoulder, the top of the blade. This causes a big &amp;#34;bump&amp;#34; at the heel end of the cutting surface. Therefore when you try and hone the blade you are constantly chipping the edges of your stone because the blade edge, the cutting part, the blade thickens at the heel. If they ground down the entire length of the blade to a sharp cutting edge you would have a great deal because the blade really holds an edge! OK,,, the handle is cheap plastic but,,, it&#x27;s the blade you shave with!</li>
            <li> Already having it honed is great for beginners. Lets you know how sharp it should be every shave.  Recommend strop and soap with this.</li>
            <li> #1rated muscle force 1dosen,t show you the ingredients in the product you supicious</li>
            <li> Ready to shave out of the box. with a good strop stays sharper than a Razor LOL. worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I got this razor so I didn&#x27;t have to take one of my more expensive razors with me when I traveled. It shaves just as as any of my other razors if not better. If your new to stright razor shaving this is a good choice. Even thought it is &amp;#34;shave ready&amp;#34; I suggest taking it to be honed.</li>
            <li> Received the product promptly and was excited to try out the blade.  Regrettably I could not shave off arm hairs even with a good lather.  It acted more like a comb than a razor.</li>
            <li> Buy something else, unless you have an unemployed nephew who has sat around the around the house so long playing computer games that he has a long beard.  After trying it, I gave it to him for his twenty-seventh birthday.  I can&#x27;t wait to see how that comes out.</li>
            <li> Good first straight razor. Wasn&#x27;t shave ready out of the box. I stropped it with green buffing compound several strokes, stropped it on the canvas with out buffing compound several strokes, stropped it on leather for a dozen or so strokes, and the razor is shaving fine now.</li>
            <li> even thought I really like the razor and had to send it out to be sharpened.... I love a company that buys a item for more than less than half the price.... have boxes printed up and then sells the razor for 2 1/2 times the price.....  This is a gold dollar razor. I know this due to the laser etching was removed... I noticed this through a loupe, seeing if the edge was sharp enough..... don&#x27;t be fooled like I was people, go to gold dollar site and buy for the fraction of the price.... effin greedy companies</li>
            <li> Was not shave ready, Amazon gave a partial refund. Made in China, you can still see the tooling. Will try to put a edge on it.</li>
            <li> Holy sharp Batman!  I got tired of spending $20 for 4 replacement blades so I figured I would go old school.  There is a learning curve to the technique and you will cut yourself at some point.  Make sure you get shaving soap and a nice brush and warm your face up with a hot towel - it makes all the difference.  Also, make sure you dry the blade thoroughly when done as it will rust.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to pretend that I know everything about carbon steel.  I&#x27;ve heard that it was brittle, but I think there&#x27;s also a build quality issue here.  When I ordered the razor, it came barely shave ready.  I was about to take it to a sharpener when I accidentially dropped it into my sink.  That 2 foot fall into my sink absolutely shattered the blade.  Due to it&#x27;s build quality and dull &amp;#34;shave ready&amp;#34; edge I&#x27;m marking it a 3.  If you&#x27;re very careful with it and get it sharpened, I&#x27;m sure it would serve you well (especially for ~40 bucks)</li>
            <li> Good razor with a plastic handle. Very sharp and easy to sharpen and maintain with a strop.</li>
            <li> Very nice razor and very sharp. It has the right weight to it so as to not put to much pressure on the blade while shaving yourself. That way you don&#x27;t take a chance on getting cut. Thank&#x27;s for a great product. I  would recommend this razor to anyone that want&#x27;s to use a straight razor.</li>
            <li> If you feel like experimenting, this razor is fine.  But it is *NOT* worth $45.  This was worth $10-15 max not too long ago.  Stop exporting your hard-earned C@$H to CHINA and buy a real GERMAN made razor.  The Chinese will put whatever label on their product to get you to buy it. They will put &#x27;shave ready&#x27;, low-calorie, cut-throat, sugar-free, fat-free, sodium-free, whatever gets you to buy it.  Don&#x27;t spend $45 on this mass-produced, razor-bump producing letter opener.  Respect yourself and don&#x27;t throw away your hard earned money.  Don&#x27;t take my word for it, look at the review by RAZOR experts: Go to the \\&quot;straightrazorplaceDOTcom\\&quot; website and look for the \\&quot;Brands_of_Straight_Razors_to_avoid\\&quot; . Caveat Emptor.  Educate yourself before buying anything thinking it is a &#x27;deal&#x27;.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re just getting into straight razor shaving, this is the razor for you. I wish I would have seen this befor I bought a $200 boker elite which I was told came shave ready and was not. I bought the wet shave razor out of fustration with the boker straight. I&#x27;m Glad I did, this thing is truely shave ready and gave me a nice comfortable shave that didn&#x27;t tug and rip the hair out like the other one. Don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did... this is a great razor for the begginer.</li>
            <li> The seller says the razor is professionally sharpened by the people at ASharperRazor.com. Whoever sharpened the razor, they did a great job. Shaving with it is as smooth and effortless as straight razors come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave ready is a term used by the wet shaving community to denote a razor that is sharp enough to shave with. What you may not know is that most razors are not sold as shave ready. Unless specifically advertised as shave ready, you are rolling the dice as to how sharp the razor will be. For example, Dovo &amp; Thiers Issard sharpen their razors at the factory, but a good number of people don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s good enough to shave with. Fromm razors do not come very sharp. Gold Dollar razors are pretty dull from the factory. Every other razor costing under $100 is not a real straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Razor&lt;br /&gt;The razor is made from hardened carbon steel. That means it rusts. So, any water drops you leave on it will stain the blade. The edge longevity is on par with every other real straight razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brand name is painted on. It&#x27;s just there. It is what it is. The maker&#x27;s mark is stamped into the blade fairly lightly. The pins are machine pinned. The scales are plastic with a carbon fiber look. The jimps on the bottom are done by machine and could be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, for all it&#x27;s faults, it&#x27;s not a $100 razor, nor is it claiming to be. It&#x27;s a $50 razor. You aren&#x27;t going to find a shave ready razor for less unless you go antique shop diving and pay someone to sharpen whatever you found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: This razor is not an heirloom piece. It is 100% workhorse. But for $50, you get a razor that shaves just as good as razors costing much more.</li>
            <li> The razor is very well made and comfortable to handle and use. My son is excited to learn more about how to use a straight razor and I&#x27;m proud that he wants to learn the original way (after sharp rocks and stones).</li>
            <li> The razor was shave ready. It shaved nicely. However, for the money invest in a Dovo. A Sharper Razor is great to deal with and id recommend them as a seller</li>
            <li> Works great! Super sharp! Sturdy handle with a great carbon fiber look. Exactly what I needed, would recommend to a friend!</li>
            <li> Very good especially for the money.  Took a while to shape to right geometry on a coarser water stone, but it did work. From there honing and stropping came easy. Good weight and heft. Engraved rather than stamped markings are a nice touch. Not crazy about synthetic material scales (handle). Must be dried IMMEDIATELY and THOROUGHLY otherwise blade will rust.</li>
            <li> This takes practice and use. I have watched a few youtube videos for shaving with a straight razor. It&#x27;s not easy. But this razor shipped quickly and was &amp;#34;razor&amp;#34; sharp right out of the box. It&#x27;s a very good quality razor for someone like me who is just beginning to use a straight razor. I recommend it for anyone at any and all levels of straight razor shaving.</li>
            <li> Tried my first straight razor shave with this thing. It definitely beats safety razors and sharper too. I should upgrade my shaving cream as the gilette stuff I use seem to stick to the blade especially if there&#x27;s not enough water. Didn&#x27;t split hairs dropped on it but I plan to strop/hone it in the future.</li>
            <li> The razor is great: it was sharpened and honed. It was just what I needed to begin shaving with one blade. However, the blade did come with a dent on the cutting end of the blade ... Probably a drop straight down on a table or something. I shaved without realizing this, and I couldn&#x27;t return it. Nevertheless, I had someone fix the flaw and it is now a precise cutting machine!</li>
            <li> The razor is fine. Well constructed nothing wrong... But....its definitely not sharp enough. Needs a good sharpening before use. And im not talking about a strop. It needs a honing with a stone. Otherwise nice start up razor.</li>
            <li> The razor is sharp and very useful. It remains in the handle until use and cleans up well.good product for the money</li>
            <li> Handle is plastic and doesn&#x27;t feel very quality, but the blade is the main concern when buying a razor, and this fills the bill. It holds an edge nicely, arrived almost shave ready, though it did need stropped and honed very slightly. Overall, good buy.</li>
            <li> First the razor was not shave ready I emailed them they assured me that the razor was fine so I used it on the second half in. Pass it cut my face in the middle of the blade so I looked at the the blade under a 60 times micro scope I have for my Mac and you could see where the blade was bent over an 8th of and in. They offered a refund but the pr guy was like I&#x27;ll make sure it right so I received it still won&#x27;t cut a strand of hair just hanging on a brush I wish I would have taken a refund what good happened due to this is I met a man that sharpens every thing from axes to razor he has a list of razors that he will not hone due to bad steel about five or six on the list was a will not sharpen was a gold dollar razor he told me that I would be better to buy a vintage razor and I did so I got a 1939 German made razor and the near 100 year old blade shaved like I was cutting warm butter buyer beware no what your buying</li>
            <li> This razor has a nice weight and a nice feel. For the price I was very satisfied. I also have a 5/8\\&quot; full hollow Dovo, and fairly often I prefer this razor to my Dovo. Great starting straight razor, recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Shave ready&amp;#34;? BS. Barely sharp enough to cut anything, let alone razor sharp.</li>
            <li> This razor is great! It came sharp and after a few stokes on the strop it produced a good cut. I have purchased some expensive straight razors that have left me disappointed. I must confess that the price had me skeptical, but I was happy and surprised by this product. You can&#x27;t beat it for the price or the quality for the price. The only thing is that it is a little heavier than my straight razor that costs 5 times what I paid for this one. That is an easy trade-off.</li>
            <li> Great razor. I took it out of the box and shaved hair off my hand. Sharp and exactly what I wanted for a beginners razor.</li>
            <li> What you are paying for and what you are getting are two different things. First off this Razor comes from Hong Kong and can be purchased for 18.00 bucks elsewhere with free shipping. What the 18.00 bucks gets you is a cheap, low grade straight razor. The rest of the money you have spent is to say they professionally honed and stroped the blade.It has to be honed and stroped before you can shave with it or you will butcher your face. It&#x27;s like putting chrome wheels on a Pinto and trying to pass it off as a Cadillac, you&#x27;ve still got a Pinto at a Cadillac price. You can find many vintage straight razors that use a much better grade steel for close to the same money and you&#x27;ll have something and many sellers have them shave ready for you. If you find you don&#x27;t like the straight razor experience you can still sell the vintage razor and get your money back. This Hong Kong Razor is just a novelty throw away item. I have even seen a Straight Razor called the Gold Dollar that can be bought for $3.54 with free shipping from Hong Kong. If you want to try out straight razor shaving for the first time do yourself a favor and buy a vintage straight razor and you&#x27;ll be money ahead.</li>
            <li> The edge can be made better, but this blade was more &amp;#34;shave ready&amp;#34; than a couple costly &amp;#34;shave readY&#x27; blades I&#x27;d gotten for much more money.&lt;br /&gt;I did nothing more than a few quick passes on a strop and shaved to see how it would go.  I got a pretty darned good shave.&lt;br /&gt;The downside, as stated is the cheap scales.  Yes, it&#x27;s a cheap blade and a hell of a deal overall, but even so the scales could&#x27;ve been just a little bit more substantial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Shaving with a straight razor isn&#x27;t for the faint of heart or for people in a hurry. It&#x27;s very easy to keep sharp when you have a  barber&#x27;s strop and is one of the closest shaves with no skin irritation that you can get. Yes it is very easy to catch yourself and I have several small scars to prove it. But there is a sense of confidence that comes with the ability of using a straight razor without making yourself. This is a must for any manly man.</li>
            <li> my boyfriend of 3 1/2 years recently told me that he wanted a straight razor after watching some classic movies with handsome men getting professional shaves, and i told him to go to a barber and see if he liked the results of a straight razor shave before he actually purchased one. he loved it! so i happened upon this one for christmas and it cam sharp as can be and wasnt warped or bend at all. the handle, while handsome and modern, does seem kind of rickety but has held up well so far. the color of the writing on the blade does come off whenever you wipe on the blade with a cloth, which is kind of sketchy.&lt;br /&gt;the problem that i have seen is..well, my boyfriend doesnt take the best care of his things, its usually left up to me if i want them to stay in good quality. to him, everything is replaceable and i don&#x27;t really share that state of mind - especially when its my money. so i noticed that he didn&#x27;t wipe off the blade well enough - or at alll... - after shaving one morning and that there were water spots all over the blade, so i cleaned the blade off and noticed then that the ink came off of the blade  as well as...there were rust spots!!! i&#x27;m sure you will take better care of your razors, but he has almost ruined this razor after TWO WEEKS by not taking care of it....&lt;br /&gt;also, this doesnt come with a carrying case and doesn&#x27;t have a blade lock. it comes wrapped in bubble wrap, and considering its so dang sharp, keep it far FAR away from kids, considering i cut myself on it when i opened it to wrap it for christmas.....&lt;br /&gt;hope this helps!!!</li>
            <li> I am new to straight-razor shaving, and this was my first, entry-level razor. I literally have no other straight razor to compare it to, but I can say from my experience, that it works. Right out of the package, I just stropped it a little, and was able to get a very close, fairly comfortable shave. After a few shaves, I figured I could get a better edge on it, and tried to hone it using my Lansky sharpening kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s when I found this is actually a stainless blade, and a little  hard to hone. I didn&#x27;t do it right, and ended up with an actually less sharp blade. This is totally my fault, and not a failing of the blade - but a carbon steel razor would sharpen better and more easily. I got it back into shape, and I can still shave with it, but I&#x27;ll need to take another crack at honing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a tool for learning how to do a straight razor shave, this is a good, reasonably priced option. You&#x27;ll probably want to upgrade before too long, like I do.</li>
            <li> takes time to get used to shaving with it and there is definitely a point in time when you start shaving with it that you will start looking for sweeney todd in the mirror while you are shaving.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor and used a honing stone and a strop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can forget the hanging hair test. No matter how well you sharpen it, at the first use and it will loose its sharpness. In my opinion a sheer waste of money.</li>
            <li> Since this was my first straight razor, I did a lot of research before purchasing.  This was the only &amp;#34;economy&amp;#34; razor that received good reviews on the forums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s great!  It came shave ready - literally!  My first shave with this gave me a closer shave than my regular disposable razor.  I&#x27;m a fan, and I didn&#x27;t have to invest several hundred dollars to see if I&#x27;d like this style of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think a veteran straight razor user would be satisfied, but for a newbie like me it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> the razor shaves very nice but the handle is VERY flimsy and I feel like it will break.  Not worth what i paid but does the job.</li>
            <li> Not shave ready! Dull as a butter knife.jad to send off to have edge put on it. Avoid this razor</li>
            <li> The good: It&#x27;s a nice cheap razor that comes &amp;#34;razor sharp&amp;#34; haha but seriously they weren&#x27;t kidding when the said it was professionally sharpened. It also works great and as always using a straight razor makes you feel like a badass. So there are the good things.&lt;br /&gt;the bad: After about a week my razor started getting marks similar to surface rust and I can&#x27;t get them off also I keep it dry at all times probably because it is cheap steal but I will say that for a beginner razor and for someone who doesn&#x27;t want to invest in a $150-$500 razor this is a great starting point</li>
            <li> Ready to shave out of the box, tight pins and perfect for the beginner</li>
            <li> I returned this razor because after only three uses, properly drying, and taking care of the razor... it started rusting a little bit. Then I saw after sending it in, that other sellers on Amazon are selling the same razor for $19. Apparently, if you want a great razor, you have to spend $100 or more.</li>
            <li> Comes sharp, easy to handle. A decent downside is that the handle is plastic and not extremely firm. I would probably buy something to sharpen it as well. You are more likely to cut yourself with a dull blade believe it or not.</li>
            <li> so far so good.  but i am watching to see if it holds up ok</li>
            <li> Item as described, delivered on time.</li>
            <li> For the price you may get to try out wet shaving on the cheap, or you may also have to buy a strop.  And then a whetstone.  And then a lower grain whetstone or take it to a professional to be properly sharpened.  Its a gamble, the difference between what each buyer gets in terms of being &amp;#34;shave ready&amp;#34; is massive so be advised what leaves the factory is inconsistent.</li>
            <li> I got this as a travel razor, if it got lost I&#x27;m not out a fortune or my nice buffalo handled razor.&lt;br /&gt;The blade is made in China, but the steel is of good quality. It came honed and only required stropping to use. It shaved fairly well and is really a back up travel blade.&lt;br /&gt;I am not a fan of the plastic scales, and mine are no properly aligned, as the blade has caught on the scales while closing a few times. Luckily no damage to the blade occurred and stropping corrected any dulling that may have occurred.</li>
            <li> I have been using straight razors for a while now.&lt;br /&gt;Just like the other guys said.....JUST BUY A DOVO!!&lt;br /&gt;Razor not sharp, it fails the hair test. fails human and cat hair test. i understand not all razors come sharp, but this one specifically stated in description that it is ready to go!&lt;br /&gt;Even though it failed the hair test i decided it was a good idea to shave with it for some reason??&lt;br /&gt;i should have giving up after the first 3 times i cut myself.&lt;br /&gt;Physical problems with the razor. handle is very flimsy and thin...it bends in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;you cannot fold the blade back without striking it on the handle and dulling it subsequently. blade not aligned to properly go into the handle BECAUSE the handle is flimsy. when looking at the blade lengthwise i see sharpening and shaping flaws everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i got this delivered same day and its going back next day. if you have big fingers and dont mind all the other stuff i wrote, still dont buy it you cant properly fit fingers on this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;razor comes with a business card stating it was sharpened and hones on the finest of tools and by the most experienced professionals. I cannot speak to the truth of this statement and am leaning more towards FALSE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you plan on experimenting with this razor dont do it before a big date and dont plan on going anywhere for a day or two. cuts and irritation looks like you were tortured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give green light on buying only old russian 1950&#x27;s 1960&#x27;s razors and of course the German brands&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;spend extra, but keep your face, you only get one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i highly recommend this one.....&lt;br /&gt;Dovo Special Razor and i am not here to promote Dovo as they need no promotion....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i give it 2 stars since it is a fail.&lt;br /&gt;i never rate anything higher than a 3 unless im keeping the item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is sharp enough. I honed and still don&#x27;t seem to shave as effortlessly as some of the videos i&#x27;ve seen on youtube. Not sure if that comes with experience, or if the blade is the deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could purchase again, I would just save up an extra $60 and get a Dovo, those seem to get alot of great reviews, and that way you&#x27;ll know for sure that if you arent shaving well, its YOU not the blade :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Shave Ready razor is a joke. Can&#x27;t cut butter. Piece of garbage and a waste of money. Do not waste your money on this junk.</li>
            <li> The razor is nice for the price. I give it three stars but it might not be fair to it. I find it difficult to use as I have never used one before. I cut myself a few times with it. That is not the fault of the razor, it&#x27;s mine. I&#x27;d say that if you want to try a straight razor this is a good one to start with. The price is what makes it good to use as a started razor.</li>
            <li> I started with a parker shavette razor a few weeks ago and just recently bought the Gold Dollar. It seemed to be pretty sharp and I gave it a shot. I did a few passes on the strop just for good measure. The shave was ok up to the point of having to do the chin area where the whiskers are much thicker. I would find myself having to switch over to the parker to finish the job since it tugged so much. I do believe, however, that if you get this razor honed and sharpened it will work really well. I love the sound it makes when its cutting the hairs. Sound like a sword unsheathing. Gave it 4 stars since it really was not shave ready but it comes fairly sharp and putting it on an 8,000 grind stone would do the finishing touch.</li>
            <li> The thinner blades are superior in all respects , thicker blades are cumbersome when concentrating on honing the cutting edge.</li>
            <li> Holds an edge for a few days&lt;br /&gt;Arrives sharp&lt;br /&gt;Has a nice weight to it&lt;br /&gt;Rusts like hell if you don&#x27;t get all water off of it</li>
            <li> I am new to shaving with a straight razor so I am still getting used to using it. It does in fact give a closer shave than any of my other safety razors. I can only improve my technique and get a still closer shave.</li>
            <li> This product is great! It really does come shave ready and all. I didn&#x27;t strop it or anything. I just got mines from ordering it 2 days ago and it was great. It passes the hair test and arm test easily. I really would recommend this straight razor. It may need to be stropped a couple times if you&#x27;d like before shaving. Otherwise, I am satisfied with my purchase. The weight of it is light but that&#x27;s okay for a already honed straight razor.</li>
            <li> Razor is fine but it&#x27;s not honed and when you buy a razor like this for $40.00 or so no matter what they say your going to have to get it honed. All and all I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li> This is just about the cheapest razor you&#x27;ll find that is ready for a first timer.  Usable right out of the package thanks to asharperrazor company. Much of what people have described as inability to hold an edge may be inexperience with stripping etc.  great razor to practice on and use as well.  Good weight, feel.  Cannot recommend this highly enough if you are serious about beginning to wet shave.</li>
