            <li>great longlasting curls!</li>
            <li>Everythin is good and the shipment in it best condition,</li>
            <li>It would have worked great</li>
            <li>Great I appreciate it and my hair looks great</li>
            <li>This seemed like a great idea, but the barrel has to go both ways for it to be usable.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s great and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>, let me tell you why this is the most incredible thing in the world as for some</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>I wanted to buy an all-purpose kind of hair tool</li>
            <li>I liked it for about a month or so</li>
            <li>Product works well; would have liked a stand to hold iron when it is on.</li>
            <li>love it and have convinced many others to get one too</li>
            <li>My hair looks more frizzy and damaged after using this tool.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>In another fifteen minutes I was able to bump curl it.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this styler on my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair was in full Angela Davis Afro (if she just woke up without picking it out)  </li>
            <li>Super Curly\\&quot; Hair (By \\&quot;Naturally Super Curly\\&quot; let me transcribe that</li>
            <li>Maybe for someone with long hair that is not curly this might be a good alternative to a curling iron.</li>
            <li>Please listen to me regarding this hot iron!</li>
            <li>I like this rotation iron, it gives my hair fun spiral curls.  </li>
            <li>It is a different technique but with practice , it is now my favorite styler.</li>
            <li>So much easier for me to style my hair now!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty color and it works well, just wouldn&#x27;t spend $105 for it again.</li>
            <li>I have had hot combs over a fire only to have the top of my ears burned and for the rain or humidity to make it nappy</li>
            <li>I prefer the 3/4 inch barrel because I like my curls to be tighter, but regardless, the video in the description is pretty spot on - my hair really does go from straw to silk in seconds when I use this.</li>
            <li>less than fifteen minutes of someone who has struggled doing her own hair for god knows how long (along with touching up the roots)</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>Highly, highly recommend!</li>
            <li>thanks ðŸ‘Œ</li>
            <li>have very curly, kinky hair</li>
            <li>my hair was soft and straight.  </li>
            <li>I learned early on that African American Hair needs to be DRY before you put any super hot heat on it.  </li>
            <li>It actually does give volume and it is much quicker than curling.  </li>
            <li>hair is completely straightened and curled in under 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This has all the functions - I can get my hair silky straight, into tight spiral curls, or a gentle, bouncy body wave</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t have to spend so much money on multiple ones that help achieve different kinds of styles.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a forty nine year old African American woman who over the years has had everything done to my coarse \\&quot;Naturally</li>

            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a forty nine year old African American woman who over the years has had everything done to my coarse \\&quot;Naturally</li>
            <li> When I finally finished my hair, it looked the same as when I use my flat iron, and I really doubt that it causes any less damage than a quality flat</li>
            <li> have had a basket of flat irons and curling irons all for different uses.  </li>
            <li> I am right-handed, but you have to use your left hand if you want to curl your bangs down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There would be no way in hell that I would buy the wet to dry Instyler</li>
            <li> so I am always looking for something that can style my hair with less damage than a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I EXPECTED</li>
            <li> if I spent the time to get used to it, I just don&#x27;t see any advantage to using it.  </li>
            <li> Harder to style hair.</li>
            <li> had I wanted to have my hair flip up on one side and turn under on the other.  </li>
            <li> Now with 2 clicks of the handle, the barrel rotates in the other direction.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had stopped using heat on my hair for the past 3 years and decided to ease my way back into it.</li>
            <li> I started out with the original InStyler one-way rotating barrel and was continually frustrated.  </li>
            <li> It is very awkward, and the barrel only rotates in one direction, so you have to keep switching it around to get it to go the right way, and if you forget which way</li>
            <li> DOES NOT GIVE THE TIGHT CRUL</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to</li>
            <li> Although I like the straightener, I feel like I could have gotten the same quality from something less expensive.</li>
            <li> have had every relaxer in the world that has broken the ends off my hair to bits (along with it sitting in my head too long and burning my scalp).  </li>
            <li> I hardly do anything to my hair, but when I do, I try this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten compliments, but it was hard work.</li>
            <li> With the one-way rotating barrel, trying to maneuver the InStyler around without burning myself was almost impossible.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with the InStyler, and I returned it.</li>

            <li> DOES NOT GIVE THE TIGHT CRUL I EXPECTED</li>
            <li> Although this item is a 3/4 barrel, it does not work for short, coarse hair. Will pass on to my niece who has longer hair.</li>
            <li> LOVE this styler on my fine hair.  It actually does give volume and it is much quicker than curling.  It is a different technique but with practice , it is now my favorite styler.</li>
            <li> I like this rotation iron, it gives my hair fun spiral curls.  Just wish it too had the reversible barrel like the bigger one has.&lt;br /&gt;Came in the mail in a timely manner, in fact, it came days before the estimated time of delivery given.</li>
            <li> Works really well. I have both sizes and this one gets closer to the scalp.</li>
            <li> I started out with the original InStyler one-way rotating barrel and was continually frustrated.  It would have worked great had I wanted to have my hair flip up on one side and turn under on the other.  With the one-way rotating barrel, trying to maneuver the InStyler around without burning myself was almost impossible.  I returned it and purchased the 2-way rotating barrel - what a world of difference!  Now with 2 clicks of the handle, the barrel rotates in the other direction.&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation:&lt;br /&gt;InStyler Max 2-Way Rotating Iron 3/4&amp;#34; for short hair&lt;br /&gt;InStyler Max 2-Way Rotating Iron 1-1/4&amp;#34; for shoulder length or longer hair</li>
            <li> This is a miracle hair tool for me. I had stopped using heat on my hair for the past 3 years and decided to ease my way back into it. I wanted to buy an all-purpose kind of hair tool so I didn&#x27;t have to spend so much money on multiple ones that help achieve different kinds of styles. This has all the functions - I can get my hair silky straight, into tight spiral curls, or a gentle, bouncy body wave and it&#x27;s all really simple. I prefer the 3/4 inch barrel because I like my curls to be tighter, but regardless, the video in the description is pretty spot on - my hair really does go from straw to silk in seconds when I use this. Highly, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t straighten that well</li>
            <li> Everythin is good and the shipment in it best condition, thanks ðŸ‘Œ</li>
            <li> Great I appreciate it and my hair looks great</li>
            <li> If it broke tomorrow I would be ordering one the same day...love it and have convinced many others to get one too</li>
            <li> I love it!  So much easier for me to style my hair now!</li>
            <li> I got one as a gift 2 yrs ago. I hardly do anything to my hair, but when I do, I try this. I&#x27;ve burned myself 3x with it and it&#x27;s left hyper pigmented scars... I&#x27;ve gotten compliments, but it was hard work. There&#x27;s definitely a learning curve. It works if you can do it. I just can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with the InStyler, and I returned it. I am right-handed, but you have to use your left hand if you want to curl your bangs down. It is very awkward, and the barrel only rotates in one direction, so you have to keep switching it around to get it to go the right way, and if you forget which way it is going it kinks your hair all up if it&#x27;s short or medium length like mine.&lt;br /&gt;I have very curly, kinky hair so I am always looking for something that can style my hair with less damage than a flat iron. This seemed like a great idea, but the barrel has to go both ways for it to be usable. When I finally finished my hair, it looked the same as when I use my flat iron, and I really doubt that it causes any less damage than a quality flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;Even if I spent the time to get used to it, I just don&#x27;t see any advantage to using it.  Maybe for someone with long hair that is not curly this might be a good alternative to a curling iron.</li>
            <li> Although I like the straightener, I feel like I could have gotten the same quality from something less expensive. It&#x27;s a pretty color and it works well, just wouldn&#x27;t spend $105 for it again. And I can&#x27;t get over the noise it makes when it spins. Otherwise it&#x27;s great and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Please listen to me regarding this hot iron! I liked it for about a month or so but then it ruined my hair!!! The brush pulls my hair out and also breaks it off. I am now in the process of doing a mayonnaise treatment once a week to repair the damage. My hair looks more frizzy and damaged after using this tool. I have thrown it out.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work the way it was stated. Harder to style hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  My 3rd one!  I use this every day !</li>
            <li> this unit fried my wife&#x27;s hair.  larger unit works well but this one is disaster. sent back. not rcmd at all.</li>
            <li> I just got this on my doorstep an hour ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is completely straightened and curled in under 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, let me tell you why this is the most incredible thing in the world as for some it just seems like it&#x27;s no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a forty nine year old African American woman who over the years has had everything done to my coarse \\&quot;Naturally Super Curly\\&quot; Hair (By \\&quot;Naturally Super Curly\\&quot; let me transcribe that like I&#x27;m Keegan Michael-Key&#x27;s translator for Jordan Peele&#x27;s Obama:  &#x27;My head is nappy as hell&#x27;!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had every relaxer in the world that has broken the ends off my hair to bits (along with it sitting in my head too long and burning my scalp).  I have had hot combs over a fire only to have the top of my ears burned and for the rain or humidity to make it nappy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had a basket of flat irons and curling irons all for different uses.  All for them to produce results that makes me just comb back my hair after two hours of wrestling to just put on a wig cap and a wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without even looking at the directions, I plugged this thing in.  My hair was in full Angela Davis Afro (if she just woke up without picking it out)  when I took out the braids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In less than fifteen minutes of someone who has struggled doing her own hair for god knows how long (along with touching up the roots) my hair was soft and straight.  In another fifteen minutes I was able to bump curl it.  All this with one product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The term \\&quot;Holy S***.  Products over-hyped on Infomercials actually do work\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There would be no way in hell that I would buy the wet to dry Instyler (No.  I learned early on that African American Hair needs to be DRY before you put any super hot heat on it.  If I want to bald...I can use a electric razor)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this thing?  Well.  Holy S***.  It does work.</li>
            <li> love it! great longlasting curls!</li>
            <li> Love it.  It takes a little getting used to and I only use it to straighten my hair.  Don&#x27;t know how it would work if you wanted curls.  Like the smaller barrel especially around the nape of my neck.</li>
            <li> Product works well; would have liked a stand to hold iron when it is on.</li>
