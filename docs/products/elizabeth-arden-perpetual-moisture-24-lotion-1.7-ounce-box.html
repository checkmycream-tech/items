            <li>Good for morning under makeup or at nite.</li>
            <li>I thought this might be a good replacement for Velva Moisture Film.  </li>
            <li>Good points.</li>
            <li>Elizabeth Arden always has made good moisturizers.</li>
            <li>So, keep up the good work and keep the prices low.&lt;br /&gt;howard</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product for moisturizing and allows foundation to go on much more easily.</li>
            <li>I am sure it will fit perfectly to my needs.</li>
            <li>Will have better comments (hopefully!)</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was excited that this moisturizer included good for your skin antioxidants and cell communicating ingredients.</li>
            <li>It has a very light fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I am really very exited to use it, yay and happy</li>
            <li>This stuff is magic.</li>
            <li>much better than products which are sold four times of this price.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>i just love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I like the product, it absorbs well and the price on amazon is so much better than retail.</li>
            <li>It provides a very nice level of moisture and absorbs quickly, and it doesn&#x27;t bother even the most sensitive skin on my face around my eyes, etc.  </li>
            <li>and it keeps my face smooth.</li>
            <li>you will have a genuine velvety skin in am.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this moisturizer and in many ways, I do.</li>
            <li>I am sure this product would be just as great as other EA products, but for some reason my neck broke out.</li>
            <li>This is a light moisturizer that soaks in quickly and does not leave an oily residue,  </li>
            <li>A while back I bought some at the mall full price, and liked the product but not the price.</li>
            <li>Moisturizes without being heavy and, best of all, not heavily perfumed.  </li>
            <li>Normally they cost a LOT more when purchased in China or Hong Kong - double or more.</li>
            <li>I have dry to normal skin, but my skin is fair and quite sensitive (break out with redness in response to many skin products, including Clinique).  </li>
            <li>I always buy it from Marshalls, it is the first time I buy it here.</li>
            <li>will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>The texture is silky and light, leaving my skin soft but not greasy.</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>Very hydrating but not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>The neck lines really tell the age of one, so always take care of the neck area just like your face.</li>
            <li>My absolute go-to moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I even really like the packaging.</li>
            <li>I have another bottle ready to go</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using up my old stuff first</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I wear Chanel foundation and have been able to dab a little of this in on my dryer areas even over my makeup to rehydrate...dab</li>
            <li>This is my favorite everyday moisturizer by far.  </li>
            <li>I usually pay much more in a dept store.  </li>
            <li>Have been using this for at least 4 mos.. or more..  </li>
            <li>The scent is subtle and pleasant, and it doesn&#x27;t feel oily or heavy on the skin.</li>
            <li>but I was willing to overlook the scent with all of the other pluses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately after the 2nd day of use, I noticed several tiny red bumps near my eyes and on my forehead.</li>
            <li>I live in the extreme conditions of Colorado and apply this moisturizer twice daily</li>

            <li> I just turned 38 and my skin went from combination to very dry...</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, breaks my face out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really a fan</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nongreasy, skin feels silky after, and it&#x27;s a nice base for foundation.</li>
            <li> My only complaint..</li>
            <li> In the past I relied on thick creams to moisturize my dry skin, but I have since transitioned to layering lightweight products instead such as hydrating toners and serums.</li>
            <li> I would say it&#x27;s comparable to Lancome&#x27;s moisturizers but for half the price.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not greasy or icky!  </li>
            <li> Gave this a try, but it&#x27;s not nearly as good...</li>
            <li> Sadly my search for an affordable, quality moisturizer continues.</li>
            <li> so I use it at night and as a base for my foundation.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing!</li>

            <li> I am sure it will fit perfectly to my needs. I am really very exited to use it, yay and happy</li>
            <li> I started using Perpetual Moisture 24 when the moisturizer I had used for years disappeared.  This is a light moisturizer that soaks in quickly and does not leave an oily residue,  It has a very light fragrance.  I use this in the morning before putting on my makeup.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer.  I usually pay much more in a dept store.  Very hydrating but not greasy at all.  Good for morning under makeup or at nite.</li>
            <li> I thought this might be a good replacement for Velva Moisture Film.  It wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I am sure this product would be just as great as other EA products, but for some reason my neck broke out. I have very fair skin and I must be allergic to this item. I always put cream on my neck. The neck lines really tell the age of one, so always take care of the neck area just like your face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using up my old stuff first so have only used this a couple of times.  Will have better comments (hopefully!) when I start using it daily.  It&#x27;s definitely not greasy or icky!  Good points.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic. The scent is subtle and pleasant, and it doesn&#x27;t feel oily or heavy on the skin. My absolute go-to moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Lots of moisture!  Great under make up or face.  I even put on my arms!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed! I keep using this lotion for about 3 years. I always buy it from Marshalls, it is the first time I buy it here. This lotion is very different with what I bought from Marshalls!</li>
            <li> https://www.amazon.com/review/review-your-purchases/ref&#x3D;pe_250480_145942760_cm_1_star4?_encoding&#x3D;UTF8&amp;asins&#x3D;B00NVVU9DI%3A4%2C&amp;channel&#x3D;ec_dgt&amp;crAuthToken&#x3D;gBCbrrU5m5wTv0rm3ThuYJ%2F%2Bge4Spu3TvFOzgnEAAAADAAAAAFXDlqlyYXcAAAAA&amp;customerId&#x3D;A3EXGDFXLIY7EJ#</li>
            <li> I just turned 38 and my skin went from combination to very dry...I wear Chanel foundation and have been able to dab a little of this in on my dryer areas even over my makeup to rehydrate...dab...don&#x27;t spread as it will clump.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer I have ever used.  I live in the extreme conditions of Colorado and apply this moisturizer twice daily and it keeps my face smooth.</li>
            <li> much better than products which are sold four times of this price. will buy more in the future. love it</li>
            <li> Excellent cream great moisture wonderful product worth the money.</li>
            <li> i just love this lotion. you will have a genuine velvety skin in am. will buy again</li>
            <li> I have dry to normal skin, but my skin is fair and quite sensitive (break out with redness in response to many skin products, including Clinique).  This is my favorite everyday moisturizer by far.  I would say it&#x27;s comparable to Lancome&#x27;s moisturizers but for half the price.

            <li> Was not even close to the Elizabeth Arden Velva Moisture Film.  Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> A while back I bought some at the mall full price, and liked the product but not the price. I have oily combination skin, so I apply some gratiae eye cream around my eyes and edge of lips, but wanted something non-greasy for the rest of my face. I like the product, it absorbs well and the price on amazon is so much better than retail.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes without being heavy and, best of all, not heavily perfumed.  I have very dry skin so I use it at night and as a base for my foundation.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, breaks my face out.  Wish I could return it.</li>
            <li> Elizabeth Arden always has made good moisturizers. I used to sell Elizabeth Arden in a Department Store.  She has great products.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this moisturizer and in many ways, I do. In the past I relied on thick creams to moisturize my dry skin, but I have since transitioned to layering lightweight products instead such as hydrating toners and serums. With this routine, I find my skin to be much clearer and softer without the heavy feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited that this moisturizer included good for your skin antioxidants and cell communicating ingredients. The texture is silky and light, leaving my skin soft but not greasy. The price point was especially sweet (bought mine for $15) and it seemed to be almost perfect. I even really like the packaging. The scent is meh. I&#x27;m not really a fan but I was willing to overlook the scent with all of the other pluses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately after the 2nd day of use, I noticed several tiny red bumps near my eyes and on my forehead. I stopped use and the bumps went away. Sadly my search for an affordable, quality moisturizer continues.</li>
            <li> Elizabeth Arden discontinued Velva Moisturizing Lotion last year (for reasons beyond me) and I have been looking for something similar to replace it.  (I used it daily for 40 years.)  Gave this a try, but it&#x27;s not nearly as good...</li>
            <li> It seems to work for me..and that is very good..:)  It absorbs very nicely..!!  Have been using this for at least 4 mos.. or more..  I have another bottle ready to go cause you can&#x27;t tell when you are running out..  My only complaint..</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for moisturizing and allows foundation to go on much more easily. I really like it!</li>
            <li> I got these for a friend who uses them regularly. Normally they cost a LOT more when purchased in China or Hong Kong - double or more. So, keep up the good work and keep the prices low.&lt;br /&gt;howard</li>
