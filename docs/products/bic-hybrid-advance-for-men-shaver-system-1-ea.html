    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I bought these after my best friend recommended them.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for the best, these probably aren&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li>replaceable baldes (the 6 advertised PLUS 2 extras) - NICE TOUCH!!!</li>
            <li>I also got a very good surprise when I opened the package.</li>
            <li>These bic razors, even though they don&#x27;t even have a moisturizing strip, shave surprisingly well.</li>
            <li>I always get razor bumps no matter how good the razor, shaving cream, I&#x27;ve tried everything.  </li>
            <li>maybe it depends on your beard, but i switched to this bic razor to save some money and have been very pleased.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for the best bang for your buck, you&#x27;ve come to the right place.</li>
            <li>Awesome razors, thanks BIC!</li>
            <li>It feels good in my hand and is easy to control.</li>
            <li>When shaving, the trick is to use a good quality shaving gel and apply light pressure to minimize friction and resultant skin irritation.</li>
            <li>Unlike most handle-n-blade systems, you don&#x27;t buy a starter kit with a reusable handle and a couple of blades and then buy refill packs of, say, six or eight blades.</li>
            <li>I paid at a local discount store, I feel like this is an excellent value and one I will continue to purchase and use.</li>
            <li>I saw that the three blade design looked \\&quot;open\\&quot;, and realized I would be able to rinse them out, also.    </li>
            <li>BIC has  had my business for over 2 years now, and will continue too :)</li>
            <li>He had tried many brands of disposable razors and this is his favorite.</li>
            <li>Great shave, reasonably priced, and comes with plenty of refills.</li>
            <li>I get nice clean shaves with no cuts every time.</li>
            <li>Great razor if you have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>These are my favorite disposable razor because of the aggressive blade angle and the light resistance on the pivoting head.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve already stated, this BIC Disposable razor is at least as good as the majority of dispoables out there and at a very good price too.</li>
            <li>Well, it seems as if the fine folks at Bic have heard me--sort of.</li>
            <li>The blades are not as smooth as others in the market.</li>
            <li>The blade is held at a comfortable angle, unlike the Mach 3, and it delivers a close and comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bic has successfully carved out a unique middle ground that straddles both the handle-n-blade and disposable categories.</li>
            <li>Original review:  </li>
            <li>and you can&#x27;t rinse them out or clean them</li>
            <li>It was not a bad face shave when using dove shave cream</li>
            <li>Of course they don&#x27;t provide a fantastic shave experience, but they work very well if you use a very light shave gel (no/low foam, no thick creams).    </li>
            <li>Some genius designer took a nice open-blade design, then blocked the back of the blades with a strip of plastic!</li>
            <li>I used to use razors like this in middle school when I started shaving, honestly that&#x27;s about who these should be for.</li>
            <li>Omg I just got done shaving with this hybrid bic razor setup, Highly disappointed I thought I was getting a real good deal and was kinda happy to find what I thought would be my new razor blades for quite some time.</li>
            <li>I have used these before and they are better than other razors, also cheaper, I bought a Schick Hydro, it skims over the top.</li>
            <li>Who wants a razor handle that you can&#x27;t clean?  </li>
            <li>For many years, I have wondered why disposable razors cost less than comparable razor blades (e.g., Gillette Sensor 3 blades  and Sensor 3 Disposable razors) even though they contain more plastic.</li>
            <li>i get a great shave and blades last a while, but i only every two or three days.</li>
            <li>Finally a non-disposable razor with an easy to clean handle.  </li>
            <li>Gives a decent shave - not anywhere near as good as the competing Gillete or Schick products - but decent shave - the first time or two... after you use it twice, my recommendation is throw away the blade and put in a new one!  </li>
            <li>At that rate, you can use each cartridge once and still enjoy significant savings over Mach3 or similar cartridges.    </li>
            <li>The handle is lightweight and made more like that of a better quality disposable razor than those of more expensive handle-n-blade systems like the Gillette Mach 3.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t they test them first?</li>
            <li>I want to find an alternative, really I do!  </li>
            <li>Mine didn&#x27;t make it through the first shaving and I&#x27;m not that hairy.  </li>
            <li>While these aren&#x27;t a Mach 3, they also don&#x27;t cost anywhere as much as Mach 3 replacement blades.  </li>
            <li>After doing so, I&#x27;ve found these blades can provide a shave that&#x27;s very close to the Mach 3 for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>The shave wasn&#x27;t even remotely close, it did give the appearance that it was mostly gone.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with the Bic Hybrid Advance 3 in that it shaved nice and close with no noticeable drag.</li>
            <li>Rally glad BIC entered the market and gave the other comapnies some comepetition since they price their stuff way too high!</li>
            <li>Like most other disposables, it floats when you drop it in a basin of water.</li>
            <li>The blade held hair far too easily and was difficult to clean, I was shaving a good 3 weeks worth of beard, so that&#x27;s expected.</li>
            <li>I found myself constantly going over an area 2-3 times just to make sure that I was removing the hair properly.</li>
            <li>I owned an electric for a few years and it was ok</li>
            <li>I saw these when I needed new blades for the Mach III.</li>
            <li>And they are so cheap I actually change them regularly.</li>
            <li>I first bought these because I am a Gillette Mach III user, and I like the \\&quot;open blade\\&quot; design of the Mach blades.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to using higher end shave tech, but my grandma will occasionally buy me something.</li>
            <li>Maybe if you are already 100% clean shaven before using these blades and used a new one every day without ever missing a day, then I suppose they could work.  </li>
            <li>The Bic Hybrid 3 offers a handle-n-blade system at the price point of a pack of disposable razors, but with a catch--the whole thing is ultimately disposable.</li>
            <li>All the hair cuttings just rinse right out, as they are open front and back.    </li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve been able to drag a brand new blade across my face and have it still leave beard with multiple strokes which lets just are not enjoyable.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine how the highly paid and educated designers at Bic could have missed such a fundamental error before millions of these went out the door.</li>
            <li>The experience is like dragging a normal razor you&#x27;ve used daily for over a month.  </li>
            <li>On the other hand, my skin is fairly sensitive and I can&#x27;t stand cheap razors that have a lot of drag.</li>
            <li>There is no lubrication, the blades are not sharp and tear up your face.  </li>
            <li>Unlike what other have said, this razor works really well and for the price</li>
            <li>and I have never been able to bring myself to commit to buying an old fashioned safety razor or an expensive electric.</li>
            <li>No longer five stars, because the massive quantity from my earlier order was apparently a fluke.</li>
            <li>When the last blade goes dull, you just toss the whole thing and get another one because each pack of six blades comes with a new handle.</li>
            <li>These blades are so bad I can&#x27;t comprehend a situation where someone would find them any good.  </li>

            <li> These blades are so bad I can&#x27;t comprehend a situation where someone would find them any good.  </li>
            <li> Seriously my chin is burning right now.</li>
            <li> Each of the 6 count packages were actually a &amp;#34;6+2 package&amp;#34; meaning that each of the three individual packages had a single disposable shaver handle along with &amp;#34;8&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> the way, I shave almost daily, with a rough beard (I&#x27;m Italian), and one razor will last me 2 weeks....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Judging from other user reviews I&#x27;ve read, a lot of people, especially those accustomed to more expensive handle-n-blade systems, don&#x27;t get the concept.</li>
            <li> ; which should last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> Basic single blade razor put this to shame.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter how long it lasts, give me a disposable razor instead... or this one!&lt;br /&gt;By</li>
            <li> And compared to other 3 blade razors on the market, this one is not even in the same ballpark!</li>
            <li> Shaves become less comfortable after the first one with a new blade, downright uncomfortable by the second or third shave and painful beyond that...</li>
            <li> NO decent razors out there that don&#x27;t carry the Gillette or Schick name?  </li>
            <li> It is hopelessly frustrating to see such an obvious engineering fail on a major product, and know that I am the one who has to pay for it and lose my money, and have to still go out and spend money on the one done right.</li>
            <li> Years back I use to buy the cheap Bic single blade disposable and they weren&#x27;t that bad</li>
            <li> The environmentalist in me likes the concept because I feel like I&#x27;m putting a little less plastic into the waste stream than if I were using a comparable number of high quality disposable</li>
            <li> For the $5.39 (roughly 90 cents a blade)</li>
            <li> But not very well...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what these other guys on here are talkin&#x27;</li>
            <li> I have a medium-to-thick beard and this razor allows me to have to shave every other day.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s less rough on the face, the blades are sharp also.  </li>
            <li> I would have never purchased this product if I had known it was possible to for a modern shaving product to be so bad.  </li>
            <li> switched to a worn out mach 3 half way through shaving.</li>
            <li> Despite their imperfections, they get five stars because you get 108 cartridges for less than $20.</li>
            <li> I was halfway through my first shave, and the blade was useless!</li>
            <li> only complaint is i have a hard time finding them.</li>
            <li> There is no need to pay for the heavy Gillette lying advertisements when you can BIC it.</li>
            <li> So I gave them a go, because I don&#x27;t want to waste my grandmother&#x27;s money.</li>
            <li> The price of the handle and six blades was half the price of a small pack of the Gillette blades.</li>
            <li> beard isn&#x27;t terribly heavy, so I don&#x27;t have the problem some users have reported of the blade clogging up excessively.</li>
            <li> , I expected this to be an improvement, but alas that is not the case.</li>
            <li> I have the worst skin irritation from shaving Ive ever had and more cuts then Ive ever had.</li>
            <li> Overall, it was uncomfortable and dragged a lot.</li>
            <li> I really hate how much razors cost</li>
            <li> I hate all the razor handles that have tight grooves that are impossible to clean.  </li>
            <li> but when I went downstairs things went very very bad, the shave was not smooth or even the itch as things started to grow back</li>
            <li> This product left me disappointed and with irritated skin.</li>
            <li> These are ABSOLUTELY the worst razors I have ever used.</li>
            <li> These are by far the worst razor I have ever used, even worse that dollar store razors.  </li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re totally useless.  </li>
            <li> was worse then a bad case of crabs</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed with the Bic Hybrid Advance Disposable razor.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Both shaves were dreadful and painful!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!  </li>
            <li> The worst razor I&#x27;ve ever used!!!</li>
            <li> Worst shave ever!</li>

            <li> I was looking for an alternative to my regular Gillette Fusion to save some money but folks this kit is not even close as a solution.  I would have never purchased this product if I had known it was possible to for a modern shaving product to be so bad.  The experience is like dragging a normal razor you&#x27;ve used daily for over a month.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve been able to drag a brand new blade across my face and have it still leave beard with multiple strokes which lets just are not enjoyable.  I can use a fusion for weeks and not have that experience.  Years back I use to buy the cheap Bic single blade disposable and they weren&#x27;t that bad, I expected this to be an improvement, but alas that is not the case.</li>
            <li> I found this at my local target for 5 bucks and decided to try it out.  It was not a bad face shave when using dove shave cream but when I went downstairs things went very very bad, the shave was not smooth or even the itch as things started to grow back was worse then a bad case of crabs</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed with the Bic Hybrid Advance Disposable razor. I only used one refill blade for 2 shaves. Both shaves were dreadful and painful!! The blades are not as smooth as others in the market. Basic single blade razor put this to shame. And compared to other 3 blade razors on the market, this one is not even in the same ballpark! It&#x27;s not even playing the same sport!</li>
            <li> I have used these before and they are better than other razors, also cheaper, I bought a Schick Hydro, it skims over the top. There is no need to pay for the heavy Gillette lying advertisements when you can BIC it.</li>
            <li> For many years, I have wondered why disposable razors cost less than comparable razor blades (e.g., Gillette Sensor 3 blades  and Sensor 3 Disposable razors) even though they contain more plastic. Well, it seems as if the fine folks at Bic have heard me--sort of. The Bic Hybrid 3 offers a handle-n-blade system at the price point of a pack of disposable razors, but with a catch--the whole thing is ultimately disposable. Unlike most handle-n-blade systems, you don&#x27;t buy a starter kit with a reusable handle and a couple of blades and then buy refill packs of, say, six or eight blades. Each Hybrid Advance 3 kit comes with six blades and a disposable handle. When the last blade goes dull, you just toss the whole thing and get another one because each pack of six blades comes with a new handle. Bic has successfully carved out a unique middle ground that straddles both the handle-n-blade and disposable categories. The environmentalist in me likes the concept because I feel like I&#x27;m putting a little less plastic into the waste stream than if I were using a comparable number of high quality disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judging from other user reviews I&#x27;ve read, a lot of people, especially those accustomed to more expensive handle-n-blade systems, don&#x27;t get the concept. The thing you have to bear in mind is this is ultimately a disposable razor. The handle is lightweight and made more like that of a better quality disposable razor than those of more expensive handle-n-blade systems like the Gillette Mach 3. Like most other disposables, it floats when you drop it in a basin of water. That said, I like the shape of the handle. It feels good in my hand and is easy to control. The blade is held at a comfortable angle, unlike the Mach 3, and it delivers a close and comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beard isn&#x27;t terribly heavy, so I don&#x27;t have the problem some users have reported of the blade clogging up excessively. On the other hand, my skin is fairly sensitive and I can&#x27;t stand cheap razors that have a lot of drag. I was pleasantly surprised with the Bic Hybrid Advance 3 in that it shaved nice and close with no noticeable drag. In my opinion, it outperforms some of more expensive alternatives. It was like going through butter. Different people have different beards and different skin, so your mileage may vary. For the $5.39 (roughly 90 cents a blade) I paid at a local discount store, I feel like this is an excellent value and one I will continue to purchase and use.</li>
            <li> While these aren&#x27;t a Mach 3, they also don&#x27;t cost anywhere as much as Mach 3 replacement blades.  When shaving, the trick is to use a good quality shaving gel and apply light pressure to minimize friction and resultant skin irritation. After doing so, I&#x27;ve found these blades can provide a shave that&#x27;s very close to the Mach 3 for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> This took off a section of my friend&#x27;s skin on her leg! Don&#x27;t buy this razor! It&#x27;s taken months for her leg to even start to scab over!!.</li>
            <li> I first bought these because I am a Gillette Mach III user, and I like the \\&quot;open blade\\&quot; design of the Mach blades. The Gillette&#x27;s never clog, because I can simply rinse them out under running water. All the hair cuttings just rinse right out, as they are open front and back.    Not so for the Bic Hybrids. I saw these when I needed new blades for the Mach III. The price of the handle and six blades was half the price of a small pack of the Gillette blades. I saw that the three blade design looked \\&quot;open\\&quot;, and realized I would be able to rinse them out, also.    Wrong. Some genius designer took a nice open-blade design, then blocked the back of the blades with a strip of plastic! I was halfway through my first shave, and the blade was useless! It was clogged with hair, and there was no way to get it out. I finished the shave with a second blade, already composing a letter to Bic in my head. Then I came here and wrote this.    Do I sound annoyed? It is hopelessly frustrating to see such an obvious engineering fail on a major product, and know that I am the one who has to pay for it and lose my money, and have to still go out and spend money on the one done right. I can&#x27;t imagine how the highly paid and educated designers at Bic could have missed such a fundamental error before millions of these went out the door. Didn&#x27;t they test them first?</li>
            <li> Omg I just got done shaving with this hybrid bic razor setup, Highly disappointed I thought I was getting a real good deal and was kinda happy to find what I thought would be my new razor blades for quite some time. I have the worst skin irritation from shaving Ive ever had and more cuts then Ive ever had. Seriously my chin is burning right now. My next stop is to email bic and tell them what a pos rip off this was.</li>
            <li> maybe it depends on your beard, but i switched to this bic razor to save some money and have been very pleased.  i get a great shave and blades last a while, but i only every two or three days. don&#x27;t mind the gruff look between shaves.  only complaint is i have a hard time finding them.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!  Gives a decent shave - not anywhere near as good as the competing Gillete or Schick products - but decent shave - the first time or two... after you use it twice, my recommendation is throw away the blade and put in a new one!  Shaves become less comfortable after the first one with a new blade, downright uncomfortable by the second or third shave and painful beyond that...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are there NO decent razors out there that don&#x27;t carry the Gillette or Schick name?  I want to find an alternative, really I do!  But nothing else seems to work well...</li>
            <li> As a female, I&#x27;m a a fan of male razors for a closer shave. I bought these after my best friend recommended them. These are ABSOLUTELY the worst razors I have ever used. Do NOT buy these. After I shave with them, there are a million nicks and razor burns on my legs and blood everywhere. These are going in the trash.</li>
            <li> I really hate how much razors cost and I have never been able to bring myself to commit to buying an old fashioned safety razor or an expensive electric. I owned an electric for a few years and it was ok but its worn out now. These bic razors, even though they don&#x27;t even have a moisturizing strip, shave surprisingly well. I get nice clean shaves with no cuts every time. And they are so cheap I actually change them regularly. I always found myself trying to stretch gilette blades since they were 3 to 4 bucks a pop. If you are looking for the best, these probably aren&#x27;t it. If you are looking for the best bang for your buck, you&#x27;ve come to the right place.</li>
            <li> Finally a non-disposable razor with an easy to clean handle.  I hate all the razor handles that have tight grooves that are impossible to clean.  Who wants a razor handle that you can&#x27;t clean?  It doesn&#x27;t matter how long it lasts, give me a disposable razor instead... or this one!&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I shave almost daily, with a rough beard (I&#x27;m Italian), and one razor will last me 2 weeks.... I don&#x27;t know what these other guys on here are talkin&#x27; about.&lt;br /&gt;My only wish is that I could buy separate cartridges... and a 2-blade razor would be nicer than the cumbersome 3-blade.</li>
            <li> The worst razor I&#x27;ve ever used!!! Cut the heck out of my face and neck and it&#x27;s not even a close shave. My face is on fire and there&#x27;s blood all over my sink. DO NOT buy this razor!</li>
            <li> These razors get the job done. I have a medium-to-thick beard and this razor allows me to have to shave every other day. Saves money, and comes with 6 cartrides (rather than 6 indivdual handles, saving space, plastic, and the environment). Rally glad BIC entered the market and gave the other comapnies some comepetition since they price their stuff way too high! BIC has  had my business for over 2 years now, and will continue too :) Awesome razors, thanks BIC!</li>
            <li> Great razor if you have sensitive skin.  I always get razor bumps no matter how good the razor, shaving cream, I&#x27;ve tried everything.  It finally came to me that I might be having a reaction to the lubrication strip on the razors... And voilà it worked, no reaction.</li>
            <li> Unlike what other have said, this razor works really well and for the price it&#x27;s a big plus.  I prefer it over the Mach 3 , it&#x27;s less rough on the face, the blades are sharp also.  I always been a fan of Bic razors but this one is a step up for them.</li>
            <li> I purchased these razors at a drugstore while waiting for my Hyrdro refills to come in.    There is no lubrication, the blades are not sharp and tear up your face.  These blades leaves razor irritation everywhere.  These are by far the worst razor I have ever used, even worse that dollar store razors.  I cannot believe Bic would put out a product like this.  Where is the quality control???</li>
            <li> These blades are so bad I can&#x27;t comprehend a situation where someone would find them any good.  Maybe if you are already 100% clean shaven before using these blades and used a new one every day without ever missing a day, then I suppose they could work.  Otherwise they clog instantly and you can&#x27;t rinse them out or clean them and they&#x27;re totally useless.  Mine didn&#x27;t make it through the first shaving and I&#x27;m not that hairy.  I feel so blatantly robbed that I don&#x27;t even want to use Bic pens any more.  Back to Mach III blades for me.</li>
            <li> Yes, they are razors, and they do work. But not very well... I&#x27;m used to using higher end shave tech, but my grandma will occasionally buy me something. So I gave them a go, because I don&#x27;t want to waste my grandmother&#x27;s money. The blade held hair far too easily and was difficult to clean, I was shaving a good 3 weeks worth of beard, so that&#x27;s expected. The shave wasn&#x27;t even remotely close, it did give the appearance that it was mostly gone. Overall, it was uncomfortable and dragged a lot. I found myself constantly going over an area 2-3 times just to make sure that I was removing the hair properly. I used to use razors like this in middle school when I started shaving, honestly that&#x27;s about who these should be for. This product left me disappointed and with irritated skin.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve already stated, this BIC Disposable razor is at least as good as the majority of dispoables out there and at a very good price too. I had purchased the &amp;#34;Set of three, 6-count packages&amp;#34; which should last me a very long time. I also got a very good surprise when I opened the package. Each of the 6 count packages were actually a &amp;#34;6+2 package&amp;#34; meaning that each of the three individual packages had a single disposable shaver handle along with &amp;#34;8&amp;#34; replaceable baldes (the 6 advertised PLUS 2 extras) - NICE TOUCH!!!</li>
            <li> My husband loves these blades. He had tried many brands of disposable razors and this is his favorite. I just wish the price would not have gone up.</li>
            <li> Worst shave ever! Very disappointed. switched to a worn out mach 3 half way through shaving. I couldn&#x27;t get the hair out of the blades.</li>
            <li> Original review:  These are my favorite disposable razor because of the aggressive blade angle and the light resistance on the pivoting head. Of course they don&#x27;t provide a fantastic shave experience, but they work very well if you use a very light shave gel (no/low foam, no thick creams).    Despite their imperfections, they get five stars because you get 108 cartridges for less than $20. At that rate, you can use each cartridge once and still enjoy significant savings over Mach3 or similar cartridges.    UPDATE:  No longer five stars, because the massive quantity from my earlier order was apparently a fluke. This last order, I only received three packages, each with six blades (last time, I got 3 boxes, each with 6 packages inside). At that rate, it&#x27;s competitive with drugstore/supermarket prices, but it&#x27;s not a screaming deal.</li>
            <li> My go-to razor - just bought a second one for keeping at my partner&#x27;s house!! Great shave, reasonably priced, and comes with plenty of refills.</li>
