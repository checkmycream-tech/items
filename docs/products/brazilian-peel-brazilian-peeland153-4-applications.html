            <li>/&gt;Really great product</li>
            <li>This is a great product, but the expiration dates are bogus.</li>
            <li>bRAZILLIAN PEEL WORKS GREAT.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>, I have found that with age, my skin is not as bright and \\&quot;glowy\\&quot; as it once was.</li>
            <li>Also, as always, wear a good sun screen when outside.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>I tried this product because of the good review I heard on Dr. Oz.  </li>
            <li>, it must be good.</li>
            <li>TherEfore to be fair , I can,t comment on the way it worked.</li>
            <li>So I was happy to read about this in Allure, a reputable source that I trust.  </li>
            <li>And have been very pleased with the results after two applications.  </li>
            <li>She saw pretty wonderful results!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I got a syringe as a free sample from Sephora, which was great because I was planning to buy it anyway.</li>
            <li>I look freaking amazing, if I do say so myself.</li>
            <li>That was about all that I liked.</li>
            <li>That was about all that I liked.</li>
            <li>My skin was always in a nice condition with no break-outs.</li>
            <li>it didnt even feel warm  to my skin after 20 mins.</li>
            <li>It is honestly glowing.</li>
            <li>When you squeeze out the the tube, thus combining the 2 chambers ingredients in your hand, you can feel it warm immediately as you mix them.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use, just squirt it into your hand, stir until warm and apply to face and neck area.</li>
            <li>I barely experienced any tingling or warmth, and I was able to get through the full 10 minutes easily, even stalling a minute or two before rinsing.</li>
            <li>I barely experienced any tingling or warmth, and I was able to get through the full 10 minutes easily, even stalling a minute or two before rinsing.</li>
            <li>I was able to leave it on my neck/decolletage for 6 minutes w/o incident since I do not use Retin-A there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I had the money to continually buy it, maybe I would see more results.</li>
            <li>Even 1000 reviews WONT be able to tell you what will work on your face.  </li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m buying some more.</li>
            <li>apply a bit more to problem areas and have never had an issue with redness</li>
            <li>I am a user for life. :)</li>
            <li>I get better peels with results at the spa.</li>
            <li>I pay about 10 dollars more per peel at the spa and have a relaxing pampering experience.</li>
            <li>Scrubs and masks made from your kitchen work better.  </li>
            <li>I do not have many wrinkles</li>
            <li>so I am cautious as to whether or not I want to try it again to see if I see more results.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the results, very pleased, at home is worth it.</li>
            <li>I will recommend for a mild peel and your skin is much better after the peel, gives you a nice glow</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve used it fresh many times) and it did not mix or warm</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a very good time to review, as I have only used one application out of the 4 pc.</li>
            <li>with favorite Cleanser (I use Purity)&lt;br /&gt;-Exfoliate with Kate Sommerville Exfolikate or even St Ives Apricot scrub&lt;br /&gt;-Slather on Brazilian Peel&lt;br /&gt;-Moisturize with whatever I have available</li>
            <li>easy to apply -- break the cap, dispense into hand and mix with fingertip</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, if you are feeling like your face needs a quick fix and a \\&quot;pick me up\\&quot;, I will say that I truly love this product and if you need to buy it now, I can justify the purchase with the fact that it does do a great job and results ARE apparent.</li>
            <li>BUT if your new to peeling, this is a good way to work up to something stronger.</li>
            <li>Which is fine, they fan and mist your face.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this product after my first use!</li>
            <li>After rinsing, my skin was smooth.</li>
            <li>After rinsing, my skin was smooth.</li>
            <li>tried to get a sample but none available.  </li>
            <li>my skins now looks bright and is so soft.  </li>
            <li>Sephora gave me a free sample to try.</li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>section)-- so, if you can wait it out, snag a free sample before you commit to the $78 price tag for 4 of them</li>
            <li>&quot; kind of day, I will use this product and am pleased with resultts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sooo, bottom line, I have found that by exfoliating prior to using this -- for the 35+ ladies -- you WILL get better results&lt;</li>
            <li>My skin has never been this smooth.</li>
            <li>MY SKIN IS SMOOTH.  </li>
            <li>It totally is pricey but it gives good results and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>My post acne scars were diminished significantly.</li>
            <li>My acne has diminished markedly since using 4 times and I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I was really excited when i recieved this product from Sephora-</li>
            <li>Although I love experimenting and dabbling with the latest and greatest product, I hardly ever expect that a product will live up to its hype</li>
            <li>It kind of freaked me out at first, because you mix it in the palm of your hand, and then this stuff turns fiery hot and you&#x27;re supposed to spread it all over your face.</li>
            <li>My skin tone is noticeably more even a day or so after application, and after the fourth application-my skin is still becoming more even.</li>
            <li>(instructions say to use full tube across neck and decolletage area).</li>
            <li>This alone earns it 1 full star.</li>
            <li>(instructions say to use full tube across neck and decolletage area).</li>
            <li>This alone earns it 1 full star.</li>
            <li>Sephora is true to their promise...</li>
            <li>i returned it for a full refund.  </li>
            <li>I paid full price for 4 applications that were set to expire in October of 2012.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good peel for those just starting out with peels.</li>
            <li>I really need to use  more applications to see if there is any difference, I am hoping there will be</li>
            <li>From all the products out there, this one is by far #1 on my list for quick, effective peels without burning or peeling, and you can go out right after you use it!  </li>
            <li>For the price compared to doctor&#x27;s office products and some over-the-counter products that don&#x27;t work, this is one month&#x27;s worth of peels, and it&#x27;s well worth the cost!</li>
            <li>I must admit,the product seemed a bit mild for something with a reported Glycolic percentage of 30%.</li>
            <li>she overall has a more glowing complexion and she looks more youthful after using this product.</li>
            <li>Because of the high concentration of glycolic acid, make sure to follow instructions and not leave it on longer than recommended.</li>
            <li>TRY to get FREE SAMPLES first before spending a fortune on skincare.   </li>
            <li>I was pleased with how it helped to clear up blemishes and tighten pores.</li>
            <li>A reasonably good facial will leave your skin smoother and brighter from just being massaged so much and this will duplicate that effect without the massage.</li>
            <li>The results weren&#x27;t worth the price of the product.</li>
            <li>I use it the day before or even the day of a special outing or event, so my face is tight and smooth, and your makeup will go on nicely.  </li>
            <li>skin really looks great-- for days, if not longer when I adhere to the steps above and is highly noticeable to others</li>
            <li>Right after using this product-do not use a retinoid.</li>
            <li>30% is considered a higher concentration (especially for an in-home peel), and individuals that are not accustom to using glycolic peels will probably experience peeling or redness of some kind.</li>
            <li>Sure costs a lot less, and actually works!For firming, I added the Loreal products (Revitalift double-lifting stuff), which seems to work fairly well (for now).</li>
            <li>, I cannot justify buying this when I was able to purchase a 35% bottle from Skin Laboratory through Amazon for only $18.95.</li>
            <li>You do the math: would you rather pay $19 or $600 when the $19 version is the exact strength it is advertised to be?</li>
            <li>After spending over $40,000 (yes) for prescription products at plastic surgeons&#x27; offices and hundreds of over the counter products, I have to say that this gentle peel does what it says!  </li>
            <li>Perhaps it works better on younger skin...</li>
            <li>More for the personal attention than anything else.</li>
            <li>When I tried the following steps below, I was IN LOVE with the product and the results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>br /&gt;It does sting a bit at first but is tolerable</li>
            <li>It burns a bit at first so keep it away from your eyes and lips.  </li>
            <li>It did make my skin baby soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Overall I recommend this product to everyone because it has helped with my acne and with a more even skin tone.  </li>
            <li>skin did feel so smooth &amp; soft, but results were very temporary.  </li>
            <li>After years of having this gentle peel done at my Dermatologists Office, it  is such a convenience to be able to do it one&#x27;s own home and for much less money per application too![[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Since I have heard horror stories of people burning their faces off with Glycolic peels, I was very intimidated by my first self-peel.</li>
            <li>I have heard horror stories of people burning their faces off with Glycolic peels, I was very intimidated by my first self-peel.</li>
            <li>I gave it a first try and did not see much for a result.</li>
            <li>my pores and shrinked dramatically, my acne is pretty much non-existant, and it doesn&#x27;t burn your face off.</li>
            <li>I think classic &#x27;european&#x27; facials are truly lovely things.</li>
            <li>A little warm and stinging at first</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 57 years old, olive-skinned, and spent most of my life ignoring sunscreen and tanning whenever sun came around, so if Porcelana works this well for me (I had lots of age spots!)</li>
            <li>If you are over 40, I highly recommend this product for a woman or man!  </li>
            <li>No home peel I tried ever did much to change my skin&#x27;s texture or brighten things up</li>
            <li>I like that this product is gentle, but also works.</li>
            <li>it is gentle and works.</li>
            <li>I have very acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I did like the product, it just didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li>can not see any differents in my skin.save your money this stuff cost to much and does nothing.skin</li>
            <li>I absolutely saw no difference in my skin after using thie product.  </li>
            <li>so it really doesn&#x27;t deliver any heat to the face.</li>
            <li>minutes two days in a row w/o any incident, but my 1st use of a 35% Glycolic Acid Peel was close to damaging my skin in the most sensitive areas after only 2 minutes!</li>
            <li>I was excited to try it, but scared at the same time.</li>
            <li>so I was surprised when I tried this peel and saw improvement in my skin after the first application.</li>
            <li>Maybe in a few more years...</li>
            <li>My friend recommended this product to me and though I was skeptical at first, I really liked it the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>First off, this is not a product that is anywhere NEAR a professional strength peel but also, it is not promoted as that either.</li>
            <li>I was able to repeat the procedure with the second half the next day, and I still didn&#x27;t experience anything close to a true AHA peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was able to repeat the procedure with the second half the next day, and I still didn&#x27;t experience anything close to a true AHA peel.      </li>
            <li>/&gt;Brazilian was my first AHA peel, but not my last.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I didn&#x27;t listen and put it on my lips and left it on for like an hour.</li>
            <li>This peel however did something to my skin that after two days of the first application, my face got so red and blistered I&#x27;m freaking out and embarrassed to go out.</li>
            <li>I used it exactly accoridng to directions, and also used their daily pads in between treatments; everything as suggested by the company.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would suggest saving your money and either using a real 35% peel for full effects (I used SL, but there are other great peels available for low prices), or if you are worried about burns, buy a good PH neutralizer to go with the 35% peel and mix them together in a small glass cup before applying so you can get the gentleness of Brazilian Peel w/o the outrageous price tag.</li>

            <li>While my skin looked nice after using the Brazilian Peel, I did not really see any long lasting effects.  </li>
            <li>oily, somewhat pigmented, a few fine lines, acne prone, 20-something</li>
            <li>I have moderately sensitive skin, and I use a low-dose of Retin-A nightly.</li>
            <li>My face is tighter all over (I do put it directly under my eyes and eyelids</li>
            <li>While my acne scars/hyper-pigmentation didn&#x27;t budge, I absolutely saw an improvement in the texture, brightness and overall quality of my skin.</li>
            <li>I did not see real results until I ordered my second pack of 4 and was using that.</li>
            <li>Would not waste money on this product</li>
            <li>I am not seeing much difference from this product&#x27;s results then with a regular over the counter peel.</li>
            <li>When I turned 28, for some reason, my face decided to get adult acne.</li>
            <li>I have had professional 30% and they will burn.</li>
            <li>If your skin is sensitive, you might want to first try it on a small area, and always use it at a time when you won&#x27;t spent much time in the sun such as on a Sunday night when you&#x27;ll be inside working most of the week.</li>
            <li>I liked that it got rid of any small, dry, scaly spots I had from the Retin-A.</li>
            <li>I liked that it got rid of any small, dry, scaly spots I had from the Retin-A.</li>
            <li>Folks, I have actually never bothered to submit a review (too lazy) but as a natural born skeptic, I thought it worth getting the word out that this product is worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>Buff Puff (body type and face type) to exfoliate areas of chest, upper arms, and face, where spots were), used in shower daily, then applied Porcelana consistently, each day and night.</li>
            <li>In the old days I had plenty of money to head off to the dermatologist for a little treatment -- now, not so much!  </li>
            <li>I went on birth control, started using a Clarisonic, and got a professional facial peel, all of which I believe have helped alot.</li>
            <li>I had one professional facial peel which was $150, and peeled my face off!</li>
            <li>I purchased several boxes directly from the company which do not expire until 2015</li>
            <li>I gained weight that was unneccesary, use the Clarisonic religiously, and starting using this peel product after my professional peel.</li>
            <li>I am not a doctor-but from personal experience I can tell you skin will have irritation and may burn a little when an retinoid is applied right after.   </li>
            <li>The SL peel is a 30ml size bottle claiming at least 15 peels, and it really is full strength.</li>
            <li>I use this about once a month (due to high price).</li>
    </ol>

            <li> with favorite Cleanser (I use Purity)&lt;br /&gt;-Exfoliate with Kate Sommerville Exfolikate or even St Ives Apricot scrub&lt;br /&gt;-Slather on Brazilian Peel&lt;br /&gt;-Moisturize with whatever I have available</li>
            <li> easy to apply -- break the cap, dispense into hand and mix with fingertip</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, if you are feeling like your face needs a quick fix and a \\&quot;pick me up\\&quot;, I will say that I truly love this product and if you need to buy it now, I can justify the purchase with the fact that it does do a great job and results ARE apparent.</li>
            <li> BUT if your new to peeling, this is a good way to work up to something stronger.</li>
            <li> Which is fine, they fan and mist your face.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this product after my first use!</li>
            <li> After rinsing, my skin was smooth.</li>
            <li> After rinsing, my skin was smooth.</li>
            <li> tried to get a sample but none available.  </li>
            <li> my skins now looks bright and is so soft.  </li>
            <li> Sephora gave me a free sample to try.</li>
            <li> Enjoy.</li>
            <li> section)-- so, if you can wait it out, snag a free sample before you commit to the $78 price tag for 4 of them</li>
            <li> &quot; kind of day, I will use this product and am pleased with resultts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sooo, bottom line, I have found that by exfoliating prior to using this -- for the 35+ ladies -- you WILL get better results&lt;</li>
            <li> My skin has never been this smooth.</li>
            <li> MY SKIN IS SMOOTH.  </li>
            <li> It totally is pricey but it gives good results and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> My post acne scars were diminished significantly.</li>
            <li> My acne has diminished markedly since using 4 times and I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I was really excited when i recieved this product from Sephora-</li>
            <li> Although I love experimenting and dabbling with the latest and greatest product, I hardly ever expect that a product will live up to its hype</li>
            <li> It kind of freaked me out at first, because you mix it in the palm of your hand, and then this stuff turns fiery hot and you&#x27;re supposed to spread it all over your face.</li>
            <li> My skin tone is noticeably more even a day or so after application, and after the fourth application-my skin is still becoming more even.</li>
            <li> (instructions say to use full tube across neck and decolletage area).</li>
            <li> This alone earns it 1 full star.</li>
            <li> (instructions say to use full tube across neck and decolletage area).</li>
            <li> This alone earns it 1 full star.</li>
            <li> Sephora is true to their promise...</li>
            <li> i returned it for a full refund.  </li>
            <li> I paid full price for 4 applications that were set to expire in October of 2012.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good peel for those just starting out with peels.</li>
            <li> I really need to use  more applications to see if there is any difference, I am hoping there will be</li>
            <li> From all the products out there, this one is by far #1 on my list for quick, effective peels without burning or peeling, and you can go out right after you use it!  </li>
            <li> For the price compared to doctor&#x27;s office products and some over-the-counter products that don&#x27;t work, this is one month&#x27;s worth of peels, and it&#x27;s well worth the cost!</li>
            <li> I must admit,the product seemed a bit mild for something with a reported Glycolic percentage of 30%.</li>
            <li> she overall has a more glowing complexion and she looks more youthful after using this product.</li>
            <li> Because of the high concentration of glycolic acid, make sure to follow instructions and not leave it on longer than recommended.</li>
            <li> TRY to get FREE SAMPLES first before spending a fortune on skincare.   </li>
            <li> I was pleased with how it helped to clear up blemishes and tighten pores.</li>
            <li> A reasonably good facial will leave your skin smoother and brighter from just being massaged so much and this will duplicate that effect without the massage.</li>
            <li> The results weren&#x27;t worth the price of the product.</li>
            <li> I use it the day before or even the day of a special outing or event, so my face is tight and smooth, and your makeup will go on nicely.  </li>
            <li> skin really looks great-- for days, if not longer when I adhere to the steps above and is highly noticeable to others</li>
            <li> Right after using this product-do not use a retinoid.</li>
            <li> 30% is considered a higher concentration (especially for an in-home peel), and individuals that are not accustom to using glycolic peels will probably experience peeling or redness of some kind.</li>
            <li> Sure costs a lot less, and actually works!For firming, I added the Loreal products (Revitalift double-lifting stuff), which seems to work fairly well (for now).</li>
            <li> , I cannot justify buying this when I was able to purchase a 35% bottle from Skin Laboratory through Amazon for only $18.95.</li>
            <li> You do the math: would you rather pay $19 or $600 when the $19 version is the exact strength it is advertised to be?</li>
            <li> After spending over $40,000 (yes) for prescription products at plastic surgeons&#x27; offices and hundreds of over the counter products, I have to say that this gentle peel does what it says!  </li>
            <li> Perhaps it works better on younger skin...</li>
            <li> More for the personal attention than anything else.</li>
            <li> When I tried the following steps below, I was IN LOVE with the product and the results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It does sting a bit at first but is tolerable</li>
            <li> It burns a bit at first so keep it away from your eyes and lips.  </li>
            <li> It did make my skin baby soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Overall I recommend this product to everyone because it has helped with my acne and with a more even skin tone.  </li>
            <li> skin did feel so smooth &amp; soft, but results were very temporary.  </li>
            <li> After years of having this gentle peel done at my Dermatologists Office, it  is such a convenience to be able to do it one&#x27;s own home and for much less money per application too![[ASIN:</li>

            <li> my pores and shrinked dramatically, my acne is pretty much non-existant, and it doesn&#x27;t burn your face off.</li>
            <li> I think classic &#x27;european&#x27; facials are truly lovely things.</li>
            <li> A little warm and stinging at first</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 57 years old, olive-skinned, and spent most of my life ignoring sunscreen and tanning whenever sun came around, so if Porcelana works this well for me (I had lots of age spots!)</li>
            <li> If you are over 40, I highly recommend this product for a woman or man!  </li>
            <li> No home peel I tried ever did much to change my skin&#x27;s texture or brighten things up</li>
            <li> I like that this product is gentle, but also works.</li>
            <li> it is gentle and works.</li>
            <li> I have very acne prone skin.</li>

            <li> I absolutely saw no difference in my skin after using thie product.  </li>

            <li> minutes two days in a row w/o any incident, but my 1st use of a 35% Glycolic Acid Peel was close to damaging my skin in the most sensitive areas after only 2 minutes!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try it, but scared at the same time.</li>
            <li> so I was surprised when I tried this peel and saw improvement in my skin after the first application.</li>
            <li> Maybe in a few more years...</li>
            <li> My friend recommended this product to me and though I was skeptical at first, I really liked it the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> First off, this is not a product that is anywhere NEAR a professional strength peel but also, it is not promoted as that either.</li>
            <li> I was able to repeat the procedure with the second half the next day, and I still didn&#x27;t experience anything close to a true AHA peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was able to repeat the procedure with the second half the next day, and I still didn&#x27;t experience anything close to a true AHA peel.      </li>
            <li> /&gt;Brazilian was my first AHA peel, but not my last.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I didn&#x27;t listen and put it on my lips and left it on for like an hour.</li>
            <li> This peel however did something to my skin that after two days of the first application, my face got so red and blistered I&#x27;m freaking out and embarrassed to go out.</li>
            <li> I used it exactly accoridng to directions, and also used their daily pads in between treatments; everything as suggested by the company.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would suggest saving your money and either using a real 35% peel for full effects (I used SL, but there are other great peels available for low prices), or if you are worried about burns, buy a good PH neutralizer to go with the 35% peel and mix them together in a small glass cup before applying so you can get the gentleness of Brazilian Peel w/o the outrageous price tag.</li>

            <li> While my skin looked nice after using the Brazilian Peel, I did not really see any long lasting effects.  </li>
            <li> oily, somewhat pigmented, a few fine lines, acne prone, 20-something</li>
            <li> I have moderately sensitive skin, and I use a low-dose of Retin-A nightly.</li>
            <li> My face is tighter all over (I do put it directly under my eyes and eyelids</li>
            <li> While my acne scars/hyper-pigmentation didn&#x27;t budge, I absolutely saw an improvement in the texture, brightness and overall quality of my skin.</li>
            <li> I did not see real results until I ordered my second pack of 4 and was using that.</li>
            <li> Would not waste money on this product</li>
            <li> I am not seeing much difference from this product&#x27;s results then with a regular over the counter peel.</li>
            <li> When I turned 28, for some reason, my face decided to get adult acne.</li>
            <li> I have had professional 30% and they will burn.</li>
            <li> If your skin is sensitive, you might want to first try it on a small area, and always use it at a time when you won&#x27;t spent much time in the sun such as on a Sunday night when you&#x27;ll be inside working most of the week.</li>
            <li> I liked that it got rid of any small, dry, scaly spots I had from the Retin-A.</li>
            <li> I liked that it got rid of any small, dry, scaly spots I had from the Retin-A.</li>
            <li> Folks, I have actually never bothered to submit a review (too lazy) but as a natural born skeptic, I thought it worth getting the word out that this product is worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Buff Puff (body type and face type) to exfoliate areas of chest, upper arms, and face, where spots were), used in shower daily, then applied Porcelana consistently, each day and night.</li>
            <li> In the old days I had plenty of money to head off to the dermatologist for a little treatment -- now, not so much!  </li>
            <li> I went on birth control, started using a Clarisonic, and got a professional facial peel, all of which I believe have helped alot.</li>
            <li> I had one professional facial peel which was $150, and peeled my face off!</li>
            <li> I purchased several boxes directly from the company which do not expire until 2015</li>
            <li> I gained weight that was unneccesary, use the Clarisonic religiously, and starting using this peel product after my professional peel.</li>
            <li> I am not a doctor-but from personal experience I can tell you skin will have irritation and may burn a little when an retinoid is applied right after.   </li>
            <li> The SL peel is a 30ml size bottle claiming at least 15 peels, and it really is full strength.</li>
            <li> I use this about once a month (due to high price).</li>
            <li> Considering the tiny amount I used for face, neck, &amp; decolletage, I think I might get about 30 peels out of the SL bottle (NOT Brazilian), which would mean anywhere from $300-$600 worth of equivalent applications of Brazilian.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, and wanted to diminish age spots, plus maybe firm my skin a bit.</li>
            <li> I read a review somewhere suggesting it might be as much as 10% strength in reality, but I&#x27;d be shocked if Brazilian Peels is even THAT strong.</li>
            <li> Have used this a few times in the past -- Sephora will typically offer a tube as a free sample with purchase online every few months (no special code needed, and I have always found them available in the \\&quot;choose 3 samples\\&quot;</li>
            <li> You can get similar results for around $10 by using over the counter exfoliant mixed with crushed chewable vitamin C</li>
            <li> I get a little peeling and more dramatic results from it.</li>
            <li> Fine lines are lessened and the dreaded 10x mirror is not quite as scary.  </li>
            <li> The product is a little pricey, but I would rather spend $80 a month for clear skin than hundreds at a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> The product naturally warms as you spread it on your face, and for some can sting a little.</li>
            <li> I have spent thousands of dollars at the dermatologist, just to have my problems come back.</li>
            <li> I noticed no real differences in my apperance, but it was noticable the day of use only.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t notice any long term improvement.</li>
            <li> It only heats up in your hand for a sec</li>
            <li> : This peel is marketed as a 30% Glycolic Acid level peel, but they add a neutralizer to it (the other side of the syringe), which severely reduces the actual acid strength.</li>
            <li> but they are dry, cakey and do not mix as they should.  </li>
            <li> After one month (4 applications)of the brazilian peel,  I didn&#x27;t have a single break out for weeks.</li>
            <li> I can see a tiny bit of difference, but not worth the $78.  </li>
            <li> (JC Penny, Sephora, or AHA themselves) make sure you can get a refund if it is bad.  </li>
            <li> I had read about the Brazilian Peel and was curious to try this product.</li>
            <li> My skin had minimal softening</li>
            <li> At the end of four weeks treatment ($100+),I saw no real difference (or, anything I did see was a placebo effect</li>
            <li> I dislike a product taking advantage of people by marketing their product as something it is not, and I also dislike that this product may mislead users into believing they are accustomed to a 30% Glycolic Acid when a real percentage of that ratio might cause some serious damage!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using the rest of the syringes ( and btw I only use half and fridge the othe half) as a weekly treatment in btween my prof peels</li>
            <li> SHIPPING WAS LONG AND AFTER USING THE PRODUCT TWICE, I HAVE BROKEN OUT INTO BIG RED WELTS AND BUMPS ALL OVER MY FACE.</li>
            <li> I have noticed my pores appear to slightly smaller and less clogged for a few days after application.</li>
            <li> I have, in the past, simply cleansed &amp; applied this -- with \\&quot;ok\\&quot; results.</li>
            <li> After wiping it off your skin is slightly smoother, firmer and lines are minimally reduced.</li>
            <li> It helped fade my dark spots.</li>
            <li> This is milder and less expensive and really works.</li>
            <li> but the swelling won&#x27;t come down.</li>
            <li> When I washed it off, my skin was tighter, smoother and my dark spots were slightly diminished.</li>
            <li> I used half the tube b/c</li>
            <li> I used half the tube b/c</li>
            <li> It took all four treatments (I wouldn&#x27;t do half as some people state, I used it all and just rubbed the slight excess onto my  hands).  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 36, combination skin and some lines at forehead and slightly in the corners of my eyes</li>
            <li> Also I will use half the tube and recap to get 8 applications instead of 4, making it quite a bargain.  </li>
            <li> I shared the product with my Mom- using half on my face and half on her.</li>
            <li> my wrinkles appear to be a slight bit better.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> IT REDUCES PORES AND PEELS AWAY DARK ,DRAB LAYERS OF DEAD SKIN.  </li>
            <li> but it settles down after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Seems like it should be a little stronger or something.</li>
            <li> Little pricey...</li>
            <li> while you do a few emails.  </li>
            <li> MONEY WASTED.</li>
            <li> Once a month I seem to breakout with a few zits.</li>
            <li> but I do have a few line lines-none of had any noticeable reduction after using the four applications.   </li>
            <li> It was messy to use and didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Did this for about three months without missing, now do about three times weekly, and age spots have reduced by about 75%.</li>
            <li> I could barely leave the serious peel on my face for 2 minutes, unlike the weak Brazilian Peel.</li>
            <li> Currently, I have filed a complaint with the State of Oregon Consumer Fraud Division because AHA refuses to refund me $230 for boxes I bought several months ago which have gone bad and dried up already even though they expire in 2015.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll splurge.</li>
            <li> This is a 30% glycolic peel, which is difficult to find outside of a dermatologist office.</li>
            <li> I didn;t waste my money!).</li>
            <li> If this isn&#x27;t a chemical reaction that implies some serious ingredients then I don&#x27;t know what is.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I have ever lasting scars from the 8 months of this random acne that I had endured.</li>
            <li> Only buy from Sephora and even they told me 1 out of 4 vials in each box are bad.</li>
            <li> BEWARE OF FALSE ADVERTISING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I saw very little results after 4 applications and this is a very expensive product</li>
            <li> I found it to be very weak, and for the price ($20 per application?</li>
            <li> I was quite skeptical.</li>
            <li> They replaced it with samples that were equally stale.</li>
            <li> I have read reviews on here how individuals have used this product once a month because they thought it was too expensive and trying to conserve it.</li>
            <li> Disappointing for the price.</li>
            <li> Product goes bad even before expiration date.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I dislike a product taking advantage of people by marketing their product as something it is not, and I also dislike that this product may mislead users into believing they are accustomed to a 30% Glycolic Acid when a real percentage of that ratio might cause some serious damage! I left Brazilian on my face 10+ minutes two days in a row w/o any incident, but my 1st use of a 35% Glycolic Acid Peel was close to damaging my skin in the most sensitive areas after only 2 minutes! BEWARE OF FALSE ADVERTISING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s why I rated it low: This peel is marketed as a 30% Glycolic Acid level peel, but they add a neutralizer to it (the other side of the syringe), which severely reduces the actual acid strength. I read a review somewhere suggesting it might be as much as 10% strength in reality, but I&#x27;d be shocked if Brazilian Peels is even THAT strong. I found it to be very weak, and for the price ($20 per application? Are you kidding me?), I cannot justify buying this when I was able to purchase a 35% bottle from Skin Laboratory through Amazon for only $18.95. The SL peel is a 30ml size bottle claiming at least 15 peels, and it really is full strength. Considering the tiny amount I used for face, neck, &amp; decolletage, I think I might get about 30 peels out of the SL bottle (NOT Brazilian), which would mean anywhere from $300-$600 worth of equivalent applications of Brazilian. You do the math: would you rather pay $19 or $600 when the $19 version is the exact strength it is advertised to be? I could barely leave the serious peel on my face for 2 minutes, unlike the weak Brazilian Peel. I was able to leave it on my neck/decolletage for 6 minutes w/o incident since I do not use Retin-A there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brazilian was my first AHA peel, but not my last. I got a syringe as a free sample from Sephora, which was great because I was planning to buy it anyway. I was excited to try it, but scared at the same time. I have moderately sensitive skin, and I use a low-dose of Retin-A nightly. Since I have heard horror stories of people burning their faces off with Glycolic peels, I was very intimidated by my first self-peel. I used half the tube b/c I was only doing my face (instructions say to use full tube across neck and decolletage area). I barely experienced any tingling or warmth, and I was able to get through the full 10 minutes easily, even stalling a minute or two before rinsing. After rinsing, my skin was smooth. I liked that it got rid of any small, dry, scaly spots I had from the Retin-A. That was about all that I liked. This alone earns it 1 full star. I was able to repeat the procedure with the second half the next day, and I still didn&#x27;t experience anything close to a true AHA peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest saving your money and either using a real 35% peel for full effects (I used SL, but there are other great peels available for low prices), or if you are worried about burns, buy a good PH neutralizer to go with the 35% peel and mix them together in a small glass cup before applying so you can get the gentleness of Brazilian Peel w/o the outrageous price tag.I have heard horror stories of people burning their faces off with Glycolic peels, I was very intimidated by my first self-peel. I used half the tube b/c I was only doing my face (instructions say to use full tube across neck and decolletage area).

            <li> I use this about once a month (due to high price). That said, it definitely improves my skin. If your skin is sensitive, you might want to first try it on a small area, and always use it at a time when you won&#x27;t spent much time in the sun such as on a Sunday night when you&#x27;ll be inside working most of the week. Also, as always, wear a good sun screen when outside.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003IIUN6W Brazilian Peel Brazilian Peel(tm) 4 Applications]]</li>
            <li> I gave it a first try and did not see much for a result. Seems like it should be a little stronger or something.</li>
            <li> I have gone and paid 100.&#x27;s of dollars for this.... I am pleased with the results, very pleased, at home is worth it.</li>
            <li> While my skin looked nice after using the Brazilian Peel, I did not really see any long lasting effects.  If I had the money to continually buy it, maybe I would see more results.</li>
            <li> I tried the product after reading about it in Allure.  In the old days I had plenty of money to head off to the dermatologist for a little treatment -- now, not so much!  So I was happy to read about this in Allure, a reputable source that I trust.  It took all four treatments (I wouldn&#x27;t do half as some people state, I used it all and just rubbed the slight excess onto my  hands).  After four weeks I looked noticably brighter and smoother.  Fine lines are lessened and the dreaded 10x mirror is not quite as scary.  For $20 a pop how can you complain about this is my attitude.  10 minutes on and off while you do a few emails.  Couldn&#x27;t be easier.  I&#x27;ve recommended this to friends as well.</li>
            <li> After spending over $40,000 (yes) for prescription products at plastic surgeons&#x27; offices and hundreds of over the counter products, I have to say that this gentle peel does what it says!  The first time I used it, I didn&#x27;t listen and put it on my lips and left it on for like an hour. Shame on me!  My lips burned and peeled, but my face didn&#x27;t suffer.  Now, I use it for the designated time and after applying it from forehead to chest, I leave it on for 10 minutes.  As a 46-year-old woman, I can see how it wouldn&#x27;t be needed for someone in their 20&#x27;s at all, but over 40, this works!  My face is tighter all over (I do put it directly under my eyes and eyelids cause I don&#x27;t follow ALL the directions), and it&#x27;s lighter, like I used a hyperpigmentation cream (none of those work).  The results last only a couple days, and you are supposed to use this once a week to achieve solid results.  I use it the day before or even the day of a special outing or event, so my face is tight and smooth, and your makeup will go on nicely.  From all the products out there, this one is by far #1 on my list for quick, effective peels without burning or peeling, and you can go out right after you use it!  I look awake, refreshed, tighter, and my chest area looks smoother and lighter as well. When your read all these reviews, some don&#x27;t tell their age.  If you are over 40, I highly recommend this product for a woman or man!  For the price compared to doctor&#x27;s office products and some over-the-counter products that don&#x27;t work, this is one month&#x27;s worth of peels, and it&#x27;s well worth the cost!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never been allergic to any cosmetic products before. My skin was always in a nice condition with no break-outs. This peel however did something to my skin that after two days of the first application, my face got so red and blistered I&#x27;m freaking out and embarrassed to go out. My foundation won&#x27;t cover the damage done and I took allergy medication but the swelling won&#x27;t come down. I would not recommend this product at all.</li>
            <li> Bought Brazillian Peel at Sephora after reading dozens of reviews.  tried to get a sample but none available.  Once can research extensively but each person&#x27;s skin is different.  I returned it because it didnt do anything..it didnt even feel warm  to my skin after 20 mins. There was no visible difference to my skin after.  Perhaps it works better on younger skin...I am 48.   Sephora is true to their promise...i returned it for a full refund.  Clerk gave me sample of kate peel...brown gritty substance. used this  morning and felt burn in 2 mins. my skins now looks bright and is so soft.  TRY to get FREE SAMPLES first before spending a fortune on skincare.   Even 1000 reviews WONT be able to tell you what will work on your face.  Good luck.</li>
            <li> I had read about the Brazilian Peel and was curious to try this product.It is very easy to use, just squirt it into your hand, stir until warm and apply to face and neck area.I was pleased with how it helped to clear up blemishes and tighten pores.I would definitely order this product again through Amazon.</li>
            <li> The price has gone up on some sites.  I recommend it and I am on my second box of 3.</li>
            <li> Sephora gave me a free sample to try. I was quite skeptical. No home peel I tried ever did much to change my skin&#x27;s texture or brighten things up but this product actually did. A little warm and stinging at first but it settles down after a few minutes. When I washed it off, my skin was tighter, smoother and my dark spots were slightly diminished. And that was just one application. It totally is pricey but it gives good results and is easy to use. So, I&#x27;m buying some more. I think classic &#x27;european&#x27; facials are truly lovely things. More for the personal attention than anything else. A reasonably good facial will leave your skin smoother and brighter from just being massaged so much and this will duplicate that effect without the massage. Perfect for an evening of self-pampering. Enjoy.</li>
            <li> Have used this a few times in the past -- Sephora will typically offer a tube as a free sample with purchase online every few months (no special code needed, and I have always found them available in the \\&quot;choose 3 samples\\&quot; section)-- so, if you can wait it out, snag a free sample before you commit to the $78 price tag for 4 of them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you are feeling like your face needs a quick fix and a \\&quot;pick me up\\&quot;, I will say that I truly love this product and if you need to buy it now, I can justify the purchase with the fact that it does do a great job and results ARE apparent. I have, in the past, simply cleansed &amp; applied this -- with \\&quot;ok\\&quot; results. When I tried the following steps below, I was IN LOVE with the product and the results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Cleanse with favorite Cleanser (I use Purity)&lt;br /&gt;-Exfoliate with Kate Sommerville Exfolikate or even St Ives Apricot scrub&lt;br /&gt;-Slather on Brazilian Peel&lt;br /&gt;-Moisturize with whatever I have available&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin really looks great-- for days, if not longer when I adhere to the steps above and is highly noticeable to others&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 36, combination skin and some lines at forehead and slightly in the corners of my eyes, I have found that with age, my skin is not as bright and \\&quot;glowy\\&quot; as it once was. Brazilain peel did make me feel otherwise. Whenever I have a \\&quot;blah\\&quot; kind of day, I will use this product and am pleased with resultts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sooo, bottom line, I have found that by exfoliating prior to using this -- for the 35+ ladies -- you WILL get better results&lt;br /&gt;It does sting a bit at first but is tolerable&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to apply -- break the cap, dispense into hand and mix with fingertip&lt;br /&gt;I apply a bit more to problem areas and have never had an issue with redness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really great product</li>
            <li> Little pricey...skin did feel so smooth &amp; soft, but results were very temporary.  You can get similar results for around $10 by using over the counter exfoliant mixed with crushed chewable vitamin C</li>
            <li> It burns a bit at first so keep it away from your eyes and lips.  It did make my skin baby soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I received one application of this Brazilian Peel as a sample from Sephora, and Oh. MY. GOD. This stuff is amazing! It kind of freaked me out at first, because you mix it in the palm of your hand, and then this stuff turns fiery hot and you&#x27;re supposed to spread it all over your face. But I did, and it worked! (Who knew boiling acid could be so good for your skin?!) I was amazed by the results. My skin has never been this smooth. I look freaking amazing, if I do say so myself. I SO want to buy more of this, but it&#x27;s ridiculously expensive so I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll splurge. Maybe in a few more years...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost always expecting to be duped by the beauty industry. Although I love experimenting and dabbling with the latest and greatest product, I hardly ever expect that a product will live up to its hype so I was surprised when I tried this peel and saw improvement in my skin after the first application. I must admit,the product seemed a bit mild for something with a reported Glycolic percentage of 30%. While my acne scars/hyper-pigmentation didn&#x27;t budge, I absolutely saw an improvement in the texture, brightness and overall quality of my skin. It is honestly glowing. Folks, I have actually never bothered to submit a review (too lazy) but as a natural born skeptic, I thought it worth getting the word out that this product is worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> I like that this product is gentle, but also works. I did not see real results until I ordered my second pack of 4 and was using that. It helped fade my dark spots. I would get this again bc it is gentle and works.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this product after my first use! After just one application I noticed that the redness in my face was reduced and my skin felt softer. I have very acne prone skin. I have spent thousands of dollars at the dermatologist, just to have my problems come back. After one month (4 applications)of the brazilian peel,  I didn&#x27;t have a single break out for weeks. My post acne scars were diminished significantly. The product is a little pricey, but I would rather spend $80 a month for clear skin than hundreds at a dermatologist. I am a user for life. :)</li>
            <li> This product does not work. I get better peels with results at the spa. I pay about 10 dollars more per peel at the spa and have a relaxing pampering experience. Would not waste money on this product</li>
            <li> Got this product and I am on week 3, so I have used 3 peels.  I can see a tiny bit of difference, but not worth the $78.  Scrubs and masks made from your kitchen work better.  Quite dissappointed.</li>
            <li> SHIPPING WAS LONG AND AFTER USING THE PRODUCT TWICE, I HAVE BROKEN OUT INTO BIG RED WELTS AND BUMPS ALL OVER MY FACE. MONEY WASTED. ALL THE HYPE IS JUST THAT HYPE. SAVE YOUR MONEY</li>
            <li> My friend recommended this product to me and though I was skeptical at first, I really liked it the first time I used it.  When you squeeze out the the tube, thus combining the 2 chambers ingredients in your hand, you can feel it warm immediately as you mix them. If this isn&#x27;t a chemical reaction that implies some serious ingredients then I don&#x27;t know what is.  After wiping it off your skin is slightly smoother, firmer and lines are minimally reduced. I have never gotten a peel at a dermatologist but I imagine this to be a weaker formula that won&#x27;t leave you red and peeling days later. Also I will use half the tube and recap to get 8 applications instead of 4, making it quite a bargain.  My acne has diminished markedly since using 4 times and I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! After years of having this gentle peel done at my Dermatologists Office, it  is such a convenience to be able to do it one&#x27;s own home and for much less money per application too![[ASIN:B003IIUN6W Brazilian Peel Brazilian Peel(TM) 4 Applications]]</li>
            <li> This is a great product, but the expiration dates are bogus. I paid full price for 4 applications that were set to expire in October of 2012. The product did not work anymore (I&#x27;ve used it fresh many times) and it did not mix or warm up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned it to the store and they refused to give me a refund. They replaced it with samples that were equally stale. I will never purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This is a 30% glycolic peel, which is difficult to find outside of a dermatologist office. 30% is considered a higher concentration (especially for an in-home peel), and individuals that are not accustom to using glycolic peels will probably experience peeling or redness of some kind. I did not have any of these issues and was very happy with the results.  Once a month I seem to breakout with a few zits. When I time the application of this peel correctly, I can avoid my prolonged breakouts all together. My skin tone is noticeably more even a day or so after application, and after the fourth application-my skin is still becoming more even. I have noticed my pores appear to slightly smaller and less clogged for a few days after application. I do not have many wrinkles but I do have a few line lines-none of had any noticeable reduction after using the four applications.   The product naturally warms as you spread it on your face, and for some can sting a little. Because of the high concentration of glycolic acid, make sure to follow instructions and not leave it on longer than recommended. Right after using this product-do not use a retinoid. I am not a doctor-but from personal experience I can tell you skin will have irritation and may burn a little when an retinoid is applied right after.   Overall I recommend this product to everyone because it has helped with my acne and with a more even skin tone.  Skin type: oily, somewhat pigmented, a few fine lines, acne prone, 20-something</li>
            <li> Ordered this product because I was looking for something to help wrinkles and age spots and saw this product discussed on the Dr. Oz show.  I saw very little results after 4 applications and this is a very expensive product so I am cautious as to whether or not I want to try it again to see if I see more results.</li>
            <li> It was messy to use and didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I was really excited when i recieved this product from Sephora- i did a lot of homework and this stuff was supposed to be GOOD!   I did like the product, it just didn&#x27;t do much for me. I shared the product with my Mom- using half on my face and half on her. She saw pretty wonderful results! I am 24, shes 50. It made her skin glow! After all 4 uses- I noticed no real differences in my apperance, but it was noticable the day of use only. For my Mom- she overall has a more glowing complexion and she looks more youthful after using this product.</li>
            <li> I am not seeing much difference from this product&#x27;s results then with a regular over the counter peel. Disappointing for the price.</li>
            <li> can not see any differents in my skin.save your money this stuff cost to much and does nothing.skin no brighter no tighter when befor i used it.its not a peel.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. My face didn&#x27;t peel at all. I watched a video on YouTube about the appilcation and read the instructions before I used it. I left it on my face longer the 2nd. time and even longer the 3rd time, still no peeling. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> When I turned 28, for some reason, my face decided to get adult acne. I never had acne EVER in my life before and I had those deep, puss and blood, ridden acne. Needless to say, I have ever lasting scars from the 8 months of this random acne that I had endured. I went on birth control, started using a Clarisonic, and got a professional facial peel, all of which I believe have helped alot. It&#x27;s been about 6 months since I got myself off of the BC, bc I gained weight that was unneccesary, use the Clarisonic religiously, and starting using this peel product after my professional peel. First off, this is not a product that is anywhere NEAR a professional strength peel but also, it is not promoted as that either. I have read reviews on here how individuals have used this product once a month because they thought it was too expensive and trying to conserve it. It says to use once a week (because it&#x27;s a system) and if used a directed, you will see results! I had one professional facial peel which was $150, and peeled my face off! This is milder and less expensive and really works. I&#x27;m on the brink of 30, but my pores and shrinked dramatically, my acne is pretty much non-existant, and it doesn&#x27;t burn your face off. I&#x27;m a fan!!!</li>
            <li> bRAZILLIAN PEEL WORKS GREAT. I ACTUALLY LEARNED ABOUT IT FROM THE DR. OZ SHOW. MY SKIN IS SMOOTH.  IT REDUCES PORES AND PEELS AWAY DARK ,DRAB LAYERS OF DEAD SKIN.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Product goes bad even before expiration date.  I purchased several boxes directly from the company which do not expire until 2015 but they are dry, cakey and do not mix as they should.  I have used this product before so I know what it is supposed to be like.  Sephora pulled this product from their stores because of this problem, but no matter who you buy it from (JC Penny, Sephora, or AHA themselves) make sure you can get a refund if it is bad.  Currently, I have filed a complaint with the State of Oregon Consumer Fraud Division because AHA refuses to refund me $230 for boxes I bought several months ago which have gone bad and dried up already even though they expire in 2015.  AHA will not return my phone calls or emails.  Only buy from Sephora and even they told me 1 out of 4 vials in each box are bad.</li>
            <li> I absolutely saw no difference in my skin after using thie product.  Perhaps my age had something to do with it. It may work on younger skin.</li>
            <li> Yes, it works! I will recommend for a mild peel and your skin is much better after the peel, gives you a nice glow</li>
            <li> The results weren&#x27;t worth the price of the product. My skin had minimal softening but I didn&#x27;t notice any long term improvement.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because of the good review I heard on Dr. Oz.  And have been very pleased with the results after two applications.  My skin is definitely clearer and the pores smaller.  ...my wrinkles appear to be a slight bit better.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using the product.  A very good buy.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, and wanted to diminish age spots, plus maybe firm my skin a bit. I used it exactly accoridng to directions, and also used their daily pads in between treatments; everything as suggested by the company. At the end of four weeks treatment ($100+),I saw no real difference (or, anything I did see was a placebo effect so I could convince myself I didn;t waste my money!). About two months later, I switched to: Buff Puff (body type and face type) to exfoliate areas of chest, upper arms, and face, where spots were), used in shower daily, then applied Porcelana consistently, each day and night. Did this for about three months without missing, now do about three times weekly, and age spots have reduced by about 75%. Sure costs a lot less, and actually works!For firming, I added the Loreal products (Revitalift double-lifting stuff), which seems to work fairly well (for now). I&#x27;m 57 years old, olive-skinned, and spent most of my life ignoring sunscreen and tanning whenever sun came around, so if Porcelana works this well for me (I had lots of age spots!), it must be good. And no, I don&#x27;t sell the stuff, or work for anyone who does!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good peel for those just starting out with peels. I have had professional 30% and they will burn. Which is fine, they fan and mist your face. Then after several minutes it&#x27;s neutralied. I get a little peeling and more dramatic results from it. The Bra.Peel is delivered at once with the neutraliser in the dual syringe.It only heats up in your hand for a sec so it really doesn&#x27;t deliver any heat to the face. You can&#x27;t make a mistake with it. I&#x27;m using the rest of the syringes ( and btw I only use half and fridge the othe half) as a weekly treatment in btween my prof peels I do 4 times a year. I am 60 and people think I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s. Bottom line. I won&#x27;t buy it again BUT if your new to peeling, this is a good way to work up to something stronger.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a very good time to review, as I have only used one application out of the 4 pc. kit. TherEfore to be fair , I can,t comment on the way it worked. I really need to use  more applications to see if there is any difference, I am hoping there will be, This was  the BRAZILIAN PEEL</li>
