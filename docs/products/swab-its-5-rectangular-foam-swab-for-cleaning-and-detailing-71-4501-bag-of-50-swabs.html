            <li>Great idea just too big for my purpose.</li>
            <li>These swaps can clean the head easily.</li>
            <li>used for applying gummipledge on rubber of car very useful.</li>
            <li>I actually use these to clean my firearms and they do a great</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are great for light-detailing and minor cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are excellent for hard to get places and put grease on smoothly.</li>
            <li>I bought these swabs to clean my washer/dryer combo.</li>
            <li>I used one (soaked with isopropyl alcohol) to clean the blades on a muffin fan.</li>
            <li>One of my friends suggested using these foam tipped swabs instead of cotton tipped swabs to clean areas in my sewing machine.</li>
            <li>Using to clean a pistol</li>

            <li>Good swab foam kits, I use them to clean my roland digital printer.</li>
            <li>I enter my car in different car shows and these swabs are excellent for cleaning various parts of the car.  </li>

            <li>I know some people love these swabs, but I find frequently that they fall apart too quickly.  </li>
            <li>They do a very good job of cleaning in hard to reach areas of the car...</li>
            <li>Anyway, they&#x27;re the right length to reach the heads and the capstans with out any difficulty.</li>
            <li>They are WAY BETTER than using regular q-tips.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only way they can be better is if the head can be wider.</li>
            <li>so I can get to them exactly as I want or need them.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>They also are a bit large to fit in many spaces and don&#x27;t really enable you to get any elbow grease on the pad except for at the very center of the backing-stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s perfect for cleaning hard to reach areas such as the chamber in my AR.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for lint free swabs for delicate surfaces, this kind will do the job.</li>
            <li>When I was done I ran the swab (which was by then pretty much black) under warm tap water.</li>
            <li>I use the swabs to clean those challenging small spaces.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see it came out nearly as clean as new.</li>
            <li>These swabs work very well.</li>
            <li>The foam seems very durable.</li>
            <li>They are very well made.</li>
            <li>My company converts 9-track computer tapes to modern formats.</li>
            <li>I use them to clean the tape head on a digital camera.</li>
            <li>but I find these tear fairly easily over rough spots.</li>
            <li>I use them mainly for detailing my BMW and the wheels on her dodge caravan.  </li>
            <li>I recommend highly</li>
            <li>I even sealed the grout on my new tile floor with these.  </li>
            <li>and you are left with a clean white surface again.  </li>
            <li>Since the tapes I get are 30 years old, the oxide contaminates the read/write head.</li>
            <li>Can clean any tight space and they don&#x27;t shed.  </li>
            <li>Bought these to clean tight areas on some alloy wheels.</li>
            <li>Great product for cleaning hard to reach areas, such as door jams, heater vents and down in the engine bay.</li>
            <li>Useful swabs for cleaning with solvents or other cleaning agents.</li>
            <li>They were exactly what I needed for cleaning my wide format printer.  </li>
            <li>I knocked of one star (really should be only half a star) because the handles flex a little too easily.</li>

            <li> So, getting re-use out of them like this will make the package last a long time.</li>

            <li> Also like the round tip swabs with the long handles.  </li>
            <li> and they are too big compared to a tapered cotton swap to get the really hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The don&#x27;t seem to break down even with the heavy solvents and oils that I use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Better than q-tips in the sense that no cotton is left behind.</li>
            <li> I have used them to clean the base of my sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> My wife also uses them when painting furniture- getting in to those small areas.  </li>
            <li> Each swab lasts at least 6 cleanings of the rubber gasket after each load.</li>
            <li> You can get in the nooks &amp; crannies without leaving behind any&lt;br /&gt;part of the swab&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY</li>
            <li> I consider them disposable and throw them away when dirty.</li>
            <li> Toothpaste tends to stick at the base of the toothbrush.  </li>

            <li> I bought these swabs to clean my washer/dryer combo. They are a Godsend! Each swab lasts at least 6 cleanings of the rubber gasket after each load. They are WAY BETTER than using regular q-tips. LOVE THEM!&lt;br /&gt;The only way they can be better is if the head can be wider.</li>
            <li> Great cleaning accessory for my VCR heads.</li>
            <li> Excellent for firearm cleaning and maintenance.</li>
            <li> I use these for cleaning my guns and find the swab it&#x27;s perfect for cleaning hard to reach areas such as the chamber in my AR.  They are sturdy, so don&#x27;t break as others I&#x27;ve used would. Also the applicator is foam so it leaves no particles in the cleaning area.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  Good for lintless cleaning of hard-to-reach electronics.</li>
            <li> works great, very good for cleaning of fire arms,, have used them in space industry.</li>
            <li> Wonderful to have for so many uses. I advertise them to my friends and family, I distribute them, all the 3 kinds of swabs around my home and among personal accessories--so I can get to them exactly as I want or need them.</li>
            <li> These swabs work very well. I used one (soaked with isopropyl alcohol) to clean the blades on a muffin fan. The blades were particularly grimy -- even had mildew or some other funky mold on them, but cleaned up real nice. When I was done I ran the swab (which was by then pretty much black) under warm tap water. I was surprised to see it came out nearly as clean as new. So, getting re-use out of them like this will make the package last a long time. The foam seems very durable. I knocked of one star (really should be only half a star) because the handles flex a little too easily. They could be a bit stiffer, but this is a minor quibble.</li>
            <li> I love these swabs. Also like the round tip swabs with the long handles.  Works like Q Tip without the&lt;br /&gt;FUZZ !&lt;br /&gt;I have used these before and love em.  You can get in the nooks &amp; crannies without leaving behind any&lt;br /&gt;part of the swab&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> One of my friends suggested using these foam tipped swabs instead of cotton tipped swabs to clean areas in my sewing machine. I found that they are really great for getting into the guts of my machine. The lint sticks to the swab and I can remove it and use the swab again.</li>
            <li> I own a printing company and use these to clean inside our printers. They are very well made. I recommend highly</li>
            <li> I enter my car in different car shows and these swabs are excellent for cleaning various parts of the car.  They do a very good job of cleaning in hard to reach areas of the car...</li>
            <li> Lasts for ever and does a great job</li>
            <li> I really like these swabs, almost perfect design.  The only criticism is that the handles could be slightly longer to allow you to insert them deeply from the rear into the chamber.  Otherwise they work perfectly and can be cleaned and reused multiple times. All you have to do is squeeze the swab end between your fingers inside a rag and all the dirt or grease comes out in a second and you are left with a clean white surface again.  Try to do that with a cotton swab. I have cleaned two guns about 5 times with one swab.  Very good value.</li>
            <li> I actually use these to clean my firearms and they do a great job.&lt;br /&gt;The don&#x27;t seem to break down even with the heavy solvents and oils that I use.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone that wants to apply or remove any substance without leaving any lint behind like a normal cotton q-tip would.</li>
            <li> Great Product and reusable.</li>
            <li> nothing too fancy but you get what you need. used for applying gummipledge on rubber of car very useful. will use.</li>
            <li> These swab have so many uses.  Can clean any tight space and they don&#x27;t shed.  I even sealed the grout on my new tile floor with these.  The brushes and roller applicators were messy, but this was perfect.  I&#x27;ve cleaned the ink heads on my printer, the rubber flange on the ice and water dispenser on my fridge, etc.  Very handy swabs.</li>
            <li> I use them for gun cleaning. They are excellent for hard to get places and put grease on smoothly. I consider them disposable and throw them away when dirty.</li>
            <li> These swabs are great!  I use them mainly for detailing my BMW and the wheels on her dodge caravan.  The swabs are a perfect tool to clean the tailpipes and hard to get places inside the cars.  My wife also uses them when painting furniture- getting in to those small areas.  I have used them to clean the base of my sonicare toothbrush.  Toothpaste tends to stick at the base of the toothbrush.  When cleaning my lawn mower and edger I use the swabs to clean those challenging small spaces.</li>
            <li> Very nicely made foam tipped swabs. I am already finding a lot of uses for them. I would purchase these again from this seller/</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for.  I use it with MG Chemicals 824 99.9% Isopropyl Alcohol (also an Amazon purchase) and it seems to get the job done perfectly.</li>
            <li> durable.  lots of uses and cheap considering the quantity you receive</li>
            <li> These are okay. Using to clean a pistol and they are too big compared to a tapered cotton swap to get the really hard to reach places. So for me, I&#x27;d still need to have a supply of taper tip cotton swaps and if that&#x27;s the case then I&#x27;ll just use them instead rather than have some of each on hand. Great idea just too big for my purpose. I also find they are not as durable as I expected. Some reviews talk about cleaning and re-using which I didn&#x27;t plan on doing but I find these tear fairly easily over rough spots. I do like the stick / handle on these though.</li>
            <li> These swabs are perfect for cleaning my tape heads on my home cassette players. (YEAH I STILL HAVE &#x27;EM!!!) Anyway, they&#x27;re the right length to reach the heads and the capstans with out any difficulty. Glad there still around!!! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Useful swabs for cleaning with solvents or other cleaning agents. Well made. Good quality. If you are looking for lint free swabs for delicate surfaces, this kind will do the job.</li>

            <li> Great product for cleaning hard to reach areas, such as door jams, heater vents and down in the engine bay. Every car detailer should&lt;br /&gt;own these.</li>
            <li> Good swab foam kits, I use them to clean my roland digital printer. Its the perfect size to clean around the heads.</li>
            <li> My company converts 9-track computer tapes to modern formats. Since the tapes I get are 30 years old, the oxide contaminates the read/write head. These swaps can clean the head easily. I selected foam swaps so they don&#x27;t leave any lint.</li>
