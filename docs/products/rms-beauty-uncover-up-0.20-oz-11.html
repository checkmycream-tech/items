    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It also matches my undertone PERFECTLY.</li>
            <li>but if you know how to layer this with a good setting powder you can master a flawless look.</li>
            <li>I tried it, and it works beautifully.  </li>
            <li>This may work great for some people, but it wasn&#x27;t what I was hoping for at that price.</li>
            <li>So its not all that great for blemishes</li>
            <li>very nice product;  as good as the blush.</li>
            <li>Wear it with a good primer.</li>
            <li>Love RMS!</li>
            <li>in all, I love the formula but the packaging is problematic but I&#x27;ll continue to buy it anyway!</li>
            <li>I like that I am doing something amazing for my body like eliminating hundreds of toxins switching over.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Normally my skin doesn&#x27;t do well with coconut oil, but this foundation doesn&#x27;t seem to upset my skin, which is awesome!</li>
            <li>My favorite -  Use good 90% or more Aloe Vera Gel as a primer under RMS Un-Coverup then use RMS Un-Powder over top.</li>
            <li>My favorite -  Use good 90% or more Aloe Vera Gel as a primer under RMS Un-Coverup then use RMS Un-Powder over top.</li>
            <li>I ordered this based on the reviews I read that said it makes a good all over foundation and can be applied lightly with fingertips.  </li>
            <li>This was the first RMS purchase I ever made and while it sounded great &amp;#34;on</li>
            <li>If you have a good primer that you love, by all means use it - but be aware you will use a LOT more product with a primer since Un Cover-Up is designed to be smoothed over your warm skin and primer creates a dry/tacky surface for makeup to adhere to.</li>
            <li>This is ok.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I love RMS products.</li>
            <li>I will still continue to buy it since I do love it.ngs. 4.</li>
            <li>I will still continue to buy it since I do love it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS FOUNDATION /CONCEALER.  </li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>The 11 color is perfect for my yellow undertone, redness-prone, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>And a clean product!</li>
            <li>And after three hours it disappeared, I had strong filling that I forgot to apply the corrector.</li>
            <li>Since I make my own soaps and personal care products, I will probably end up just making my own makeup that is better suited to my needs.</li>
            <li>Color matches perfectly, and as long as you awrm it up well, it goes on super smoothly.</li>
            <li>pink)&lt;br /&gt;can be blended with just a warm finger or gentle pats from a moist Beauty Blender&lt;br /&gt;unscented</li>
            <li>I loved that the ingredients were natural or organic, without all the chemicals.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great at covering undereye circles without adding weight, and it doesn&#x27;t settle into fine lines, but for me my favorite way to use it is in the dark recess between the bridge of the nose and lid.</li>
            <li>Its pigmented well and is super easy to blend.</li>
            <li>: This product goes on easily with the warmth of your fingertips, not a brush, but if you put it over freshly moisturized skin you&#x27;ll probably look oily within an hour or so.</li>
            <li>Super smooth, moisturizing, sheer good coverage.</li>
            <li>I removed all of this with coconut oil and followed up with my mild soap made for rosacea sufferers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be very happy if they chose to release a larger version of this product, or an actual foundation that could be used with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the absolute best look with this concealer/foundation you have a few options 1.</li>
            <li>MY NEW FAVORITE.  </li>
            <li>It give a lovely finish and looks very natural.  </li>
            <li>Great for under eyes and any uneven tone.</li>
            <li>Together, they look fantastic and last all day, but as it uses so much more product I tent to skip these two things.</li>
            <li>I still think it&#x27;s worth using, and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I still think it&#x27;s worth using, and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I have pretty crappy skin, but most people are surprised when I say that.</li>
            <li>At first it went on kind of cakey, but that&#x27;s probably because of my dry winter skin.</li>
            <li>i have a hard time finding a yellow/ olive undertone foundation and this is honestly the only good one ive ever come across.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Further: my skin felt hot and irritated within an hour of application.</li>
            <li>so when you&#x27;re getting ready in a hurry (like before work!)</li>
            <li>Cover-Up under my eyes and over any imperfections showing through the first two layers.</li>
            <li>I have a pretty good skin with small imperfections.</li>
            <li>Wear it alone and be prepared to touch it up around midday, which honestly is NOT a big deal with this foundation since it&#x27;s so easy to apply with your fingertips anyway</li>
            <li>I am new to natural and 100 percent chemical free make up.  </li>
            <li>I read a lot of good reviews about this concealer and for first few days I thought that it&#x27;s normal reaction for new organic product.</li>
            <li>Lightweight but covers very well.  </li>
            <li>and really shouldn&#x27;t need too much touch up unless you need to Blot.</li>
            <li>Powder alone creates problems that start about an hour after application, the makeup really needs to be well adhered to your skin with primer in order or use powder.</li>
            <li>I moved on to other concealers and like them better.</li>
            <li>RMS Un-Powder works much better than other powders with this product</li>
            <li>RMS Un-Powder works much better than other powders with this product</li>
            <li>It eventually blended into my skin, and it provided some decent coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>little pot is adorable, but the glass chipped from bouncing around in my makeup bag&lt;</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that even though it&#x27;s a coconut oil based product, it works really well with my silicone-based foundation (Guerlain Lingerie de Peau in Beige Claire).</li>
            <li>It doesnt hide your skin but definitely improves the look of it which is what foundation should do right?</li>
            <li>I am able to apply lightly to my t zone, where I need some coverage, and slightly heavier on a few areas of redness on my cheeks and chin.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a natural look this is the makeup for you!</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s sort of somewhere between a concealer and a foundation, and they want you to really only use it in problem areas or to even skin tone, I&#x27;m sure that my usage is probably a little more than average, but I&#x27;ve heard this complaint more than once.</li>

            <li>I really do like RMS living luminizer (although it is also tiny and way overpriced), but for me, this is just one of those &amp;#34;emporer&#x27;s new clothes&amp;#34; products/brands.</li>
            <li>, if you want to use this product every day or use it for a larger area of the face instead of just two or three spots, expect to run out fast.</li>
            <li>I like that it is non toxic and 100 percent natural.  </li>
            <li>rate this 5 stars because it looks natural</li>
            <li>, it is natural, and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li>Yes, it requires some getting used to as far as application and what you can and can&#x27;t do with it.</li>

            <li>Yes, it requires some getting used to as far as application and what you can and can&#x27;t do with it.</li>
            <li>First, despite warming it on my fingers this enhanced and highlighted dry skin I thought I&#x27;d exfoliated.</li>
            <li>I use this \\&quot;concealer\\&quot; as my foundation, a little goes a long way, but for this price I wish that it came with more product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was a little hesitant to buy this, since it had coconut oil, which despite its benefits has been known to clog pores (4 or 5 on the scale, which is pretty high).</li>
            <li>At the end of the day my face was itchy and red with a lot of new acnes.</li>
            <li>Maybe this product works for dry skin, but not for a normal and combined!</li>
            <li>Unlike most concealers, this does not create a flat, grey toned dead zone on your face where applied.</li>
            <li>Also, since I&#x27;m just using it as a concealer (and a little goes a long way), I&#x27;m not too worried about blowing through the tiny jar too quickly.</li>
            <li>Even if a little can go a long way, I didn&#x27;t feel like what I got was really worth the</li>

            <li> You may look oily no matter what, so be prepared for that, and be aware that powder will make Un Cover-Up crease a LOT and collect oddly in your pores and become impossible to touch up without removing.</li>
            <li> not a huge deal, but becomes a pain when you&#x27;re running behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is not easy to cope with in Boston in December.</li>
            <li> The little container lasts a while too!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cover very well and makes my skin peel until red and thin. :(</li>
            <li> size was also small for a foundation.</li>
            <li> I was not sure I would like this product.  </li>
            <li> I usually use mineral makeup and I don&#x27;t like the feel of foundation.  </li>
            <li> although I suspect because RMS Un-Powder is made with Silica and very few powders are made with just Silica.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Whoa, my skin HATED this! First, despite warming it on my fingers this enhanced and highlighted dry skin I thought I&#x27;d exfoliated. No amount would cover up a dark freckle under one of my eyes. This never set, it smeared onto a sweater. Despite even application of my Josie Maran Watercolor gelee blush, the blush looked as it was applied on bare and very uneven skin. It simply does not layer, unlike its description on RMS&#x27;s website, etc. A GIANT disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further: my skin felt hot and irritated within an hour of application. I removed all of this with coconut oil and followed up with my mild soap made for rosacea sufferers. For the next two days parts of my face were covered in patches of eczema -- around my lips, nostrils, chin and forehead. This is not easy to cope with in Boston in December. I have returned this.</li>
            <li> This is ok. I loved that the ingredients were natural or organic, without all the chemicals. At first it went on kind of cakey, but that&#x27;s probably because of my dry winter skin. It eventually blended into my skin, and it provided some decent coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little hesitant to buy this, since it had coconut oil, which despite its benefits has been known to clog pores (4 or 5 on the scale, which is pretty high). Either this or the titanium dioxide caused me to break out, which I never do anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size was also small for a foundation. The container is about the size of some eye shadow containers. Even if a little can go a long way, I didn&#x27;t feel like what I got was really worth the $36.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin care and makeup is very personal. This may work great for some people, but it wasn&#x27;t what I was hoping for at that price. Since I make my own soaps and personal care products, I will probably end up just making my own makeup that is better suited to my needs.</li>
            <li> very nice product;  as good as the blush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. It doesn&#x27;t break me out, which I almost expected because it has coconut oil in it. However, it&#x27;s not good for summertime skin. It definitely needs to be set with powder or this baby will smudge and run everywhere. I don&#x27;t like how it just sits in a layer on my skin. Although greasy, it helps to apply if your face is moisturized first, as it is hard to move around on dry skin. It&#x27;s hard to explain. I won&#x27;t be repurchasing.&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you want to use this product every day or use it for a larger area of the face instead of just two or three spots, expect to run out fast. It is tiny! Definitely lacking in  bang for the buck. I really do like RMS living luminizer (although it is also tiny and way overpriced), but for me, this is just one of those &amp;#34;emporer&#x27;s new clothes&amp;#34; products/brands.</li>
            <li> Worked well but got greasy. I stopped using it because the concealer in the container got greasy and that put me off. I moved on to other concealers and like them better.</li>
            <li> Super smooth, moisturizing, sheer good coverage. And a clean product! no toxic nasties. It isn&#x27;t a thick coverage cover up, but it does the job well! I use it as my all over foundation.</li>
            <li> I love RMS products. This is no different. Lightweight cover up. Great for under eyes and any uneven tone. Not meant to cover acne.  If you have problematic skin, I would go with something heavier.</li>
            <li> Unlike most concealers, this does not create a flat, grey toned dead zone on your face where applied.</li>
            <li> I am new to natural and 100 percent chemical free make up.  I am used to the thick bondo that I have used for years so this will take some getting used to.  I like that it is non toxic and 100 percent natural.  I like that I am doing something amazing for my body like eliminating hundreds of toxins switching over.&lt;br /&gt;I am thnakful</li>
            <li> Lightweight but covers very well.  The little container lasts a while too!</li>
            <li> Love RMS! If you&#x27;re looking for a natural look this is the makeup for you! I&#x27;m also a fan because it contains coconut oil and doesn&#x27;t have the bad chemicals found in typical makeup. Only downside is that it&#x27;s a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> After trying, and being disappointed with, a lot of natural foundations I decided to give RMS a try. Normally my skin doesn&#x27;t do well with coconut oil, but this foundation doesn&#x27;t seem to upset my skin, which is awesome! I use this \\&quot;concealer\\&quot; as my foundation, a little goes a long way, but for this price I wish that it came with more product. This is a TINY container, I hit pan after 17 days of using this as a foundation (and trying to be conservative!). I&#x27;d be very happy if they chose to release a larger version of this product, or an actual foundation that could be used with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wear: This product goes on easily with the warmth of your fingertips, not a brush, but if you put it over freshly moisturized skin you&#x27;ll probably look oily within an hour or so. You may look oily no matter what, so be prepared for that, and be aware that powder will make Un Cover-Up crease a LOT and collect oddly in your pores and become impossible to touch up without removing. For the absolute best look with this concealer/foundation you have a few options 1. Wear it alone and be prepared to touch it up around midday, which honestly is NOT a big deal with this foundation since it&#x27;s so easy to apply with your fingertips anyway and really shouldn&#x27;t need too much touch up unless you need to Blot. 2. Wear it with a good primer. If you have a good primer that you love, by all means use it - but be aware you will use a LOT more product with a primer since Un Cover-Up is designed to be smoothed over your warm skin and primer creates a dry/tacky surface for makeup to adhere to. 3. Wear it with a primer AND powder. If you want to use powder with this concealer/foundation then you almost have to wear a primer. Powder alone creates problems that start about an hour after application, the makeup really needs to be well adhered to your skin with primer in order or use powder. Together, they look fantastic and last all day, but as it uses so much more product I tent to skip these two things. 4. My favorite -  Use good 90% or more Aloe Vera Gel as a primer under RMS Un-Coverup then use RMS Un-Powder over top. RMS Un-Powder works much better than other powders with this product, I have no idea why although I suspect because RMS Un-Powder is made with Silica and very few powders are made with just Silica.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rate this 5 stars because it looks natural, it is natural, and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out. Yes, it requires some getting used to as far as application and what you can and can&#x27;t do with it. I still think it&#x27;s worth using, and I will continue to use it. My only REAL disappointment is that the product is SO tiny that it looks, at this time, that it will last only about 1 month as a foundation. Since it&#x27;s sort of somewhere between a concealer and a foundation, and they want you to really only use it in problem areas or to even skin tone, I&#x27;m sure that my usage is probably a little more than average, but I&#x27;ve heard this complaint more than once. I will still continue to buy it since I do love it.ngs. 4. My favorite -  Use good 90% or more Aloe Vera Gel as a primer under RMS Un-Coverup then use RMS Un-Powder over top.

            <li> This was the first RMS purchase I ever made and while it sounded great &amp;#34;on paper,&amp;#34; I was skeptical about how it would compare to my usual concealer (Hourglass Hidden Corrective Concealer in Pearl). I was pleasantly surprised that even though it&#x27;s a coconut oil based product, it works really well with my silicone-based foundation (Guerlain Lingerie de Peau in Beige Claire). It&#x27;s great at covering undereye circles without adding weight, and it doesn&#x27;t settle into fine lines, but for me my favorite way to use it is in the dark recess between the bridge of the nose and lid. It brightens the area and even seems to make my eyeshadow last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;creamy texture&lt;br /&gt;excellent color match (truly neutral, not too yellow, not too pink)&lt;br /&gt;can be blended with just a warm finger or gentle pats from a moist Beauty Blender&lt;br /&gt;unscented&lt;br /&gt;totally non-irritating&lt;br /&gt;long lasting&lt;br /&gt;a lot of product in that small pot, seems to last forever&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;the little pot is adorable, but the glass chipped from bouncing around in my makeup bag&lt;br /&gt;there&#x27;s no rubber seal on the metal lid, so if you don&#x27;t use it for awhile, the surface of the product may sweat a little and get a dry &amp;#34;skin&amp;#34; on the surface&lt;br /&gt;all of the eye products are in the same packaging - so when you&#x27;re getting ready in a hurry (like before work!) it makes it difficult to grab just what you need. and if the stickers come off the bottom, you have to open each pot to know what&#x27;s in it. not a huge deal, but becomes a pain when you&#x27;re running behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I love the formula but the packaging is problematic but I&#x27;ll continue to buy it anyway!</li>
            <li> Color matches perfectly, and as long as you awrm it up well, it goes on super smoothly. I recommend without reservation</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cover very well and makes my skin peel until red and thin. :(</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS FOUNDATION /CONCEALER.  MY NEW FAVORITE.  IM NEVER GOING BACK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its made with a base of coconut oil which for me is the oil of gods with all its antibacterial, antimicrobial, antifungal properties, and vitamins.  Its pigmented well and is super easy to blend. It doesnt hide your skin but definitely improves the look of it which is what foundation should do right? So its not all that great for blemishes but if you know how to layer this with a good setting powder you can master a flawless look. It also matches my undertone PERFECTLY. i have a hard time finding a yellow/ olive undertone foundation and this is honestly the only good one ive ever come across. I just love it.</li>
            <li> I use this as the last step of my makeup application. I start with a BB cream/primer, add a layer of loose powder mineral foundation, then dab &amp;#34;Un&amp;#34; Cover-Up under my eyes and over any imperfections showing through the first two layers. It works like a dream! The 11 color is perfect for my yellow undertone, redness-prone, acne-prone skin. I have pretty crappy skin, but most people are surprised when I say that. Makeup tricks like these make a world of difference! Also, since I&#x27;m just using it as a concealer (and a little goes a long way), I&#x27;m not too worried about blowing through the tiny jar too quickly.</li>
            <li> I was not sure I would like this product.  I usually use mineral makeup and I don&#x27;t like the feel of foundation.  I ordered this based on the reviews I read that said it makes a good all over foundation and can be applied lightly with fingertips.  I tried it, and it works beautifully.  I am able to apply lightly to my t zone, where I need some coverage, and slightly heavier on a few areas of redness on my cheeks and chin.  It give a lovely finish and looks very natural.  I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> The worst thing I ever had! This miracle concealer doesn&#x27;t correct anything. I have a pretty good skin with small imperfections. I started to test the corrector on the area under my eyes. No positive results at all. And after three hours it disappeared, I had strong filling that I forgot to apply the corrector.The next disadvantage - oily finish, unhealthy gloss, ugly oily skin. I read a lot of good reviews about this concealer and for first few days I thought that it&#x27;s normal reaction for new organic product. So I started to apply it on my nose and cheeks. It was like a mask on my face. At the end of the day my face was itchy and red with a lot of new acnes. I was shocked. Maybe this product works for dry skin, but not for a normal and combined!</li>
