            <li> it remains retracted until cover is placed on other end as it forces brush forward for use.</li>
            <li> You remove the cover, turn it around and put it on the other end.</li>
            <li> By putting it on the other end the brush tip comes out.</li>
            <li> Just an average brush.</li>
            <li> I find it a little too flexible</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get one that&#x27;s not retractable unless you like messy.</li>
            <li> Stiff, sheds bristles.</li>
            <li> It is thicker than brushes I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> A little thin</li>

            <li> Just right for outlining your lips. Keeps lipstick from bleeding!!!</li>
            <li> This a great lip brush. The bristle&#x27;s are just the right length. They haven&#x27;t fallen out yet. The bristle&#x27;s are not that soft but, it gives precise application and even coverage for putting on my lipstick.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I need it to do.  Compact and Efficient.</li>
            <li> This lipstick brush is &#x27;just&#x27; what I was looking for!  This bristles are sturdy but just enough to draw a fine outline, soft enough for lips.</li>
            <li> perfect for carrying in purse. this retractible brush has a safeguard to protect accidental seperation of cover from brush. it remains retracted until cover is placed on other end as it forces brush forward for use.</li>
            <li> A little thin but I LUV IT</li>
            <li> I find it a little too flexible otherwise it is just fine.</li>
            <li> Best retractable lip brush around for the money!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thinner than the brush I replaced it with but it satisfactorily serves my needs.  I would buy it again in a heartbeat.  Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> product as pictured, very pleased with purchase</li>
            <li> This is a very nice brush and terrific for putting on lip stick.</li>

            <li> Small, easy to use, and fits in purse.</li>
            <li> Got this for my elderly mother, who cannot apply lipstick without one. She said it&#x27;s easy to hold, the bristles are very fine and soft. Don&#x27;t get one that&#x27;s not retractable unless you like messy.</li>
            <li> Nice brush - it is soft and the retracting part works well.  I would prefer it to pick up more product so that i didn&#x27;t have to load the brush multiple times.</li>
            <li> Everything according as promised! Good product , maybe not as thick as I expected.</li>
            <li> This lip brush worked well.  It applied the lipstick evenly and smoothly.</li>
            <li> Love this lip brush, having thin lips calls for lip brushes or my attempts to put on lip color looks like child&#x27;s play. I like this one a lot, I just need to start in the middle of my lips, which is what it says to do in the first place.</li>
            <li> The wife lost her favorite retractable, probably some where in the car just hiding, and I ordered two of these.  They seem to the working just fine and while she will likely put them in reserve if her fancy one shows up, she is satisfied.</li>
            <li> I like it.  It has been pretty reliable so far.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a friend and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Stiff, sheds bristles.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice brush.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This lip brush has a cover. You remove the cover, turn it around and put it on the other end. By putting it on the other end the brush tip comes out. If you lose the cover you can&#x27;t use the brush. Be careful to keep track of the top cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is soft and has a tapered tip. It is thicker than brushes I&#x27;ve had in the past. It is a good balance of stiffness with suppleness.</li>
