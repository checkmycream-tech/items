            <li>It looks like something that comes out of a gumball machine very cheaply made and gaudy.</li>
            <li>Even more beautiful in real life.</li>
            <li>Pretty, colorful, great deal!  </li>
            <li>Very pretty, good girl style item.</li>
            <li>Love this item simple but spruced my out fit up looked great and felt beautiful</li>
            <li>and I got a lot of complements for several people as it is very attractive to the eye, and it is perfect for special events or including in a normal day of work, and the material is resistant and will endure longer</li>
            <li>If buying it for a,wedding or event make sure order it three to four weeks before the planned event.</li>
            <li>More sparkly.</li>
            <li>There is a lot more purple and lavender in this comb than the picture shows</li>
            <li>The design of the clip is just stunning.</li>
            <li>But I glued it to a better clip and wear it a lot.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I wish I got more.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s okay for the price I guess.</li>
            <li>The stones shine bright and colorful in the sunlight.  </li>
            <li>Okay, this is not a clip.</li>
            <li>Look&#x27;s lovely on hair .</li>
            <li>Great looking clip I purchased for a fun and free friend.  </li>
            <li>The packaging could have been better, all in all</li>
            <li>Takes hair from blan to elegant.</li>
            <li>I have already ordered FIVE more for friends and family.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with both product and Seller.</li>
            <li>I am glad that I didn&#x27;t spend more on it.</li>
            <li>and it would have cost more to return it</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>OK.</li>
            <li>OK?</li>

            <li>It has more of a purple tint to it.</li>
            <li>I bought this hair clip for myself and love it.</li>

            <li>(Note, I don&#x27;t think it will hold your hair by itself--it is more designed to be inserted into a self-sustaining style like a bun as a decoration.)  </li>
            <li>Its better to ask more and provide customer with a better quality stuff... would not recommend this product</li>

            <li>It came fairly soon and is pretty.</li>
            <li>Beautiful but the flowers came off after one use, by an adult not a child</li>
            <li>Beautiful and classy.</li>
            <li>It is more colorful than the picture, and it is really nice :) It will play up a bun and give it some bling.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product, it adds just the right touch to the outfit</li>
            <li>Hopefully the rocks in it don&#x27;t fall out easily like in many hair cheaper accessories.</li>
            <li>Although it didn&#x27;t come very quickly, I still love it and gave it five stars.</li>
            <li>The colors in it are very nice, and in the light it can really sparkle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a present for a friend, but I am really excited about giving it to her because it is absolutely beautiful!.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it was cheap.</li>
            <li>--I have to secure my hair well with a pony tail holder and &amp; be sure to place it</li>
            <li>Nice to wear on a special evening out or to a special event too.</li>
            <li>Super easy to place and stays put!</li>

            <li>Should hold up well and after my wedding would be more than happy to wear it out when go different places.</li>
            <li>Shipped very quickly</li>
            <li>This is unacceptable because from how it broke, I can easily tell the quality wont support it in one piece at all.</li>
            <li>It can break by a baby, easily.</li>
            <li>Very quick delivery, within the week.  </li>
            <li>but it broke so easily</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t get it into my hair easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to use too.</li>
            <li>I Just wish I think of this before my life now is wait easy</li>
            <li>Could go easily to anything from Church to a formal event and look like you paid 100x</li>
            <li>I got this very quickly and at a price I couldn&#x27;t believe.  </li>
            <li>Easy to wear on hair.</li>
            <li>Lovely pin and very eye catching.</li>
            <li>The comb is strong and holds well.  </li>
            <li>When arrived was so happy very pretty; but first time I wore it came apart had to use super glue to keep together.</li>
            <li>It is very cute, and stays in my hair very well.  </li>
            <li>I liked this one it was really pretty</li>
            <li>I liked it, but it broke on the first day of wearing it.</li>
            <li>She was thrilled when we first opened the package.</li>
            <li>The design is quiet beautiful</li>
            <li>These are beautiful enough for a wedding!</li>
            <li>this is such a beautiful hair piece.</li>
            <li>This is such a beautiful piece</li>
            <li>I cannot use these because my hair is fine &amp; will not hold in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Pretty, actually metal, and definitely impressive for the price.  </li>
            <li>My hair is really fine</li>
            <li>Super cute hair accessory.  </li>
            <li>Arrived intact and quick!</li>
            <li>I love sparkly things, and these hair combs are very pretty.  </li>
            <li>Very, very pretty!  </li>
            <li>Very pretty!</li>
            <li>The teeth on this comb are HUGE, jagged and the ends are pointed.</li>
            <li>Could take time to get uses to the screw design on the stick arms part instead of an smooth silky arm</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I ordered it for my granddaughter to wear in her next pagent.</li>
            <li>It looks cheap.</li>
            <li>So gorgeuos and pretty!I don&#x27;t know why it is sooo cheap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll enjoy it while it lasts.</li>
            <li>and it does sparkle in the light .</li>
            <li>Great Christmas present  </li>
            <li>cheap quality stuff...</li>
            <li>and it was cheap</li>
            <li>lol now im gonna see if i can glue it back together or something</li>
            <li>I guess I will need to secure it with some bobby pins.  </li>
            <li>Looks fantastic with any hair style.</li>
            <li>cheap</li>
            <li>Despite it being really cheap, unless you plan on buying something that you have to fix then</li>
            <li>cheap</li>
            <li>I assume it is because they make the combs with whatever they have available.  </li>
            <li>It is a blinking item, shine under the light.</li>
            <li>Cheap looking.</li>
            <li>Plastic clips don&#x27;t last and don&#x27;t do a great job.</li>
            <li>Although it arrived with a broken tine, it was not cost effective to return it, so I improvised and wear it proudly!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have something of quality which if I were to try and purchase this kind of hairpiece anywhere local, it would no doubt cost @</li>
            <li>It broke on the first wear and looks very cheap</li>
            <li>I cant mention that enough.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the money, worth the wait and worth the price!!</li>
            <li>Very sturdy, very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed using this very much.</li>
            <li>It is very pretty and it is made strong.</li>
            <li>I ordered three different hair clips and loved all of them they are made of strong material.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>ok first they send me two pieces.</li>
            <li>I love it so much!</li>
            <li>Beautiful as I expected to be.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m excited to wear it.</li>
            <li>My only con is that I wish it came in more colors! :)</li>
            <li>First of all it took more than 3 weeks to get it and by the time I received it beads had fallen off.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty, but don&#x27;t expect more than that.</li>
            <li>Looks beautiful in the picture but in reality not much.</li>
            <li>very pretty hair clip, i was surprised with the good quality given the price.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful hair comb, which is accurately made and what made me fall in love with it is that is the first hairclip for bun which is curved, not straight, as most manufacturers make, asking bigger money for a piece of cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>The tines bend kinda easily, but totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>it was more then what i expected thank you for the good services</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more they are comfortable, lightweight and hold hair very well.  </li>
            <li>the soldering on the clips were a bit shotty but otherwise beautiful and also the show purple and dark purple in the picture when i recieved light pink/light purple hair pins</li>
            <li>It is very cute but the metal is easily breakable because after the 2nd use of it, one of the teeth fell off.</li>
            <li>For example, if you are a Junior or Senior this year, and you have that special Dinner Dance, or Prom, I would consider ordering it</li>
            <li>I chose to give this five stars because I did not expect to get such a great quality product for such an amazing deal.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>that is comb is best for people with thick or curly hair.</li>
            <li>The whole top part separated from the comb.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the colors and size and will probably by more in different colors if they&#x27;re available.</li>
            <li>I love it so much.</li>
            <li>True to color and style.</li>
            <li>I ordered your stuff and paid in full.</li>
            <li>The price is not bad either.</li>
            <li>A nice decorative comb with long tines for more securing of hair.</li>
            <li>It was very pretty but broke after my first time of using it, not sturdy enough on the hair comb its attached to or was lol</li>
            <li>This is very pretty, not such good quality.</li>
            <li>Very Nice, was suprised it was the size I expected after the earrings I received.  </li>
            <li>they take a few weeks (4-7) to arrive and come from china but are gorgeous!</li>
            <li>This is absolutely pretty, it is so femenine and fine</li>

            <li>When I first received this comb I thought it was beautiful, and the jewelry part of it is, but the very first time I put it in my hair, as soon as I pushed it down into my hair, the jewelry part (the flowers),</li>
            <li>I loved it and was very cute., but when they did not pack it well and came broken.</li>
            <li>but I guess the price i paid for it explains it why it broke so fast and easy</li>
            <li>Very well made , not flimsy , pretty stones..Will keep looking for more ..</li>
            <li>It looks so pretty in my hair!</li>
            <li>pretty!</li>
            <li>It looks EXACTLY like the picture!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s so pretty!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty piece, but may be more age appropriate for a pre-teen or teenage girl.</li>
            <li>It looks soooo pretty!</li>
            <li>I cannot reattach it myself because it is made out of some kind of metal, regular glue, super glue or wood glue</li>
            <li>This hairclip is so cheap yet makes beautiful and elegant the most ugly hairstyle.</li>
            <li>Very high quality but of course since it&#x27;s in china and free shipping it does take a while.</li>
            <li>It was so worth what I payed for it.</li>
            <li>It took almost 3 mos to receive them but they were worth the wait.</li>
            <li>It is bigger than I expected, but is perfect when you pull up your hair.</li>
            <li>very much worth the money.</li>
            <li>Over all worth it.</li>
            <li>This was definitely worth the wait from China.</li>
            <li>Beautiful, and heavy!</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>The metal comb actually holds my hair more securely without the adornments, so I might try to find another way to decorate it.</li>
            <li>The crystals are carefully attached to the metal petals, package is good.</li>
            <li>and it adds a touch of fun and beauty to my hair.</li>
            <li>Loved this one so much , bought a second</li>
            <li>Well worth</li>
            <li>It is totally worth the wait.</li>
            <li>It is solidly made and stays in my hair nicely.</li>
            <li>I love how soft the colors are and</li>
            <li>I truly have gotten my monies worth</li>
            <li>They weren&#x27;t super fast at getting it to me, but everything came in one piece!</li>
            <li>pretty quick considering.</li>
            <li>Very nice, too heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li>It was lovely and I tried to wear it again the same way, but the decorated piece snapped clean off at the solder points when I tried to wiggle it into place.</li>
            <li>The stone is very shinny and well worth the price!</li>
            <li>I received this item right on time.</li>
            <li>still the price is right and epoxy should fix it.</li>
            <li>the crystals fell off right away and had to throw it away.  </li>
            <li>flimsy and the teeth fell off the hair clip right away.</li>
            <li>She put it right into her hair yesterday and wore it all day.  </li>
            <li>I am collecting hair items and this was just right.  </li>
            <li>This is very pretty, it looks so nice, but if you have fine hair I would not recommend this because I do not think it would stay in place, it is heavy.</li>
            <li>If it is like the other two that I have received then I am sure that I will love it, as the other&#x27;s I have thus far as absolutely beautiful.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll enjoy wearing them for a long time.</li>
            <li>In real life it looks exactly as it does on the web site and looks pretty good with different hairstyles.</li>
            <li>FOR MY hair look SPECTACULAR IN ANY MODERN AND SOCIAL EVENT ..</li>
            <li>It barely arrived for my wedding,but so glad it did.</li>
            <li>It IS beautiful, I wish i had at least one chance to use it.</li>
            <li>, delivery was kind of long</li>
            <li>I have dark hair, so it&#x27;s a good decoration.</li>
            <li>Only recommend for people with VERY fine hair.</li>
            <li>It looked betifull after opening the packed but broked pretty much right after putting it on....:</li>
            <li>Looks great, but you&#x27;ll definitely know it&#x27;s there the entire time you wear it.</li>
            <li>It is so pretty, and can be used to make any hair style look a little more elegant.</li>
            <li>Will def actually by a few more soon as gifts for people that love accesories like these as much as I do!</li>
            <li>Its very very sparkly too.</li>
            <li>Like it very much, Will be buying another one</li>
            <li>it was pretty</li>
            <li>It was exactly what was advertized</li>
            <li>Was exactly like in the picture when opened it up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I ordered and showed up pretty fast!</li>
            <li>The product is so pretty</li>
            <li>It is pretty though.</li>
            <li>And, even coming from China, only took 2 weeks at most.</li>
            <li>Pretty,  but the flowers were separated from the comb.  </li>
            <li>exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>It takes a long time to arrive since it comes from China, but the wait is worth it :)</li>
            <li>pretty all gems where on the item like advertised</li>
            <li>This hair clip is just as pretty as it is in the picture</li>
            <li>The hair pin is really pretty.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty though</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty...</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this hair clip and have ordered an extra one just in case something should happen to the first one.</li>
            <li>Very shiny!</li>
            <li>I Bought this clip for my daughter, its really pretty with a hair bun.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li>So pretty.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a must have if you like to just look pretty.</li>
            <li>Was able to glue it back, but haven&#x27;t used it since</li>
            <li>Love it got it in blue</li>
            <li>Still pretty and sparkly, however.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty, and it would work great if your hair wasn&#x27;t too thick.  </li>
            <li>It is really pretty.</li>
            <li>The colors match exactly.</li>
            <li>Would buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>At first I did not like these after I purchased them.</li>
            <li>But, this makes them more solid than the types of barrettes we are accustomed to.</li>
            <li>Make any bun pretty.</li>
            <li>The first time I wore it i bent over and it slid out of my hair and hit the floor and broke.</li>
            <li>Broke the first time putting in my hair.  </li>
            <li>but it was pretty and still stayed on my hair.</li>
            <li>its pretty</li>
            <li>I ordered this on a whim as an inexpensive add on,  It is pretty</li>
            <li>Exactly what i thought it would be.</li>
            <li>Exactly what i thought it would be.</li>
            <li>now I have had things break that I have purchase but never this fast this was a all time record!</li>
            <li>It looks pretty but is not made well.</li>
            <li>I know she will love it all the same.</li>
            <li>It was just as pretty as the picture, but within days it broke</li>
            <li>For the price paid, this is a pretty and sturdy hair pin.</li>
            <li>that makes its so pretty, came off.</li>
            <li>Pretty but not sturdy</li>
            <li>Keep in mind it is exactly as the picture shows and fits nicley tucked ina ponytail or bun.</li>
            <li>Pretty, but broke as soon as I took it out of plastic sleeve, bummer after waiting quite awhile, had to go thru customs,</li>
            <li>i bought this because it looked pretty</li>
            <li>It broke the first time I put it in my hair.  </li>
            <li>This is really pretty.  </li>
            <li>The quality is exactly what I expect it to be for the price.</li>
            <li>but it is NOT a hairclip, It is a pretty comb, but it is, in no way, a clip.</li>
            <li>it might be pretty</li>
            <li>When I first saw this product on Amazon</li>
            <li>I have purchased a lot of hairpins lately and this one has been the biggest HAPPY surprise in a while...</li>
            <li>Would have been pretty.</li>
            <li>The hair clip looks exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>However the quality of this is exactly what you paid.</li>
            <li>Next time I&#x27;ll make sure the shipment is to my house.</li>
            <li>I ordered this on the first of October, and got it yesterday.</li>
            <li>Adorable but way too big.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for to add some bling to my hair.</li>
            <li>But the comb part is plastic and the first time I put it in my hair, one of the plastic teeth broke off.  </li>
            <li>The decorative part is much higher quality than the comb.  </li>
            <li>this is really pretty</li>
            <li>Broke in the first used</li>
            <li>Pretty design, but it broke after wearing it twice.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I really like this!</li>
            <li>Just right - my daughter loves it and feels very dressed up with it.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for a long time for something pretty for my hair without being over the top.</li>
            <li>It is pretty cute and is made of metal so it will long pretty much</li>
            <li>Nice clip for your money a little heavy but good quality.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to show off this pretty hair clip, but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sparkly and pretty</li>
            <li>Shipped pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Beautiful but broken when I received it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still giving it three stars because it is beautiful, but the comb was broken when I received it, so I can&#x27;t even wear it.  </li>
            <li>It is palm size and a bit heavy, so not really easy to use for the side of a bun, but great for the top.</li>
            <li>For the price is worth the wait, very shiny and high end.</li>
            <li>It looked pretty enough, but you could tell the metal was cheap.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve used hair decorations like this, but for this price, it was easy to leap back into it.</li>
            <li>It was a bit too heavy but overall beautiful.</li>
            <li>They are kind of heavy but pretty.</li>
            <li>This is pretty, but it is kind of large and heavy</li>
            <li>the teeth are large, my hair is thinner and does not hold things well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are large.</li>
            <li>Large.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pretty but quality and size I would guess it was for a young lady.  </li>
            <li>I have a few curly haired friends who love these!  </li>
            <li>One cannot expect more from this price,this quality looks good and it came within its delivery time,it&#x27;s little heavy</li>
            <li>Very shiny,pretty,and relieved it is made of metal and not plastic.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>VERY sparkly.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really look like the picture either</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s durable and stays in very well.</li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t really wear it...</li>
            <li>With this price it&#x27;s reasonable.</li>
            <li>Hair clip, better then I expected.</li>
            <li>Not so much for a woman.</li>
            <li>I really think one can get buy just one, with that style.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It holds on my hair very well I plan to order another one</li>
            <li>It is also a lot more pink</li>
            <li>this so much prettier in person, the pictures do not do it justice.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Really inexpensive</li>
            <li>but i really dissappointed</li>
            <li>They need to begin to be a bit more careful about their merchants.</li>
            <li>It is not plastic and its bigger than I thought..hope it will fit in her hair...</li>
            <li>Christmas  Thanks</li>
            <li>It is cute, the quality I had expected also.</li>
            <li>Thanks again.</li>
            <li>if it was not broken within one hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was very inexpensive but made very well.</li>
            <li>and it is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Very Pritty.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this would work well in straight hair.  </li>
            <li>I can tell by looking at the areas where the jewelry piece (the flowers) was attached to the comb, that whoever put it together did not use enough melted metal to securely attach the two pieces together.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I received mine intact and ready to wear.</li>
            <li>It broke really fast.  </li>
            <li>Much prettier than the picture.  </li>
            <li>and it is very well made.</li>
            <li>This is so much prettier in the hand.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I wear very often</li>
            <li>The product looks great when it reached but one of the petals on the flower was broken when I recieved it.</li>
            <li>This is a very Cheep Looking item.</li>
            <li>It did take a whole month to get here</li>
            <li>very sturdy and no issues with the gems falling out after almost a year of owning and using.</li>
            <li>I really like it well.</li>
            <li>In real life its sparkle adds glam to it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Is made better than i expected.</li>
            <li>My wife ordered based on the image what is shown in online.&lt;br /&gt;the one we received was 100% different.&lt;br /&gt;She was very upset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t mind they&#x27;re not made of real jewelry.</li>
            <li>very well package.</li>
            <li>highly recomend this seller!</li>
            <li>The pricing is extemely reasonable.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would get the purple or pink one though.....</li>
            <li>and they have yet to break its really a steal for what you pay and what you get .</li>
            <li>but nothing you can really notice.</li>
            <li>It is fairly heavy and nice looking.</li>
            <li>I really liked this comb but it was too heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li>Loved the pink and white crystals</li>
            <li>While obviously costume jewelry, it is very pretty and large and sparkly!  </li>
            <li>first time I tried to use it tho, on New Year&#x27;s Eve, it separated from the comb.</li>
            <li>I had to file down some loose plastic bits on the comb pieces because they kept catching on my hair instead of sliding in smoothly.</li>
            <li>very pretty and a great gift for my daughters who both have very long thick hair and have to pull it up for orchestra concerts.</li>
            <li>Better than I expected!</li>
            <li>It came sooner than expected which i really like that,  also its very pretty i always wear it when i wear donut hair style since its very hot in Arizona.</li>
            <li>Falls right out of your hair, pretty useless, but looks good if you can get it to stay in your hair.</li>
            <li>I buy a lot of cheap jewelry but this hair clip comb thing is really cheap not sure if I will even ever use it.</li>
            <li>, it looks so expensive, this is definetely a great purchase, it arrive on the exact day it says on the delivery time,</li>
            <li>Nice little inexpensive treat!</li>
            <li>It crowns the head well, in the front, if you wear your hair up, say, in a Ponytail or in a Banana Clip, as I do, and if you stick it through your Bangs going downward toward the face, it kind of looks like a small Tiara.  </li>
            <li>and it is nice and heavy and stays well in my buns and puffs!</li>
            <li>It is very heavy but nice hair comb .</li>
            <li>Decently made.  </li>
            <li>and it arrived in a decent amount of time</li>
            <li>It was better than I had expected by far.</li>
            <li>this is beautiful and should be bought for someone with a lot of long thick hair for it to hold the hair in</li>
            <li>It really is very pretty and will jazz up a simple hairstyle by just popping it in and adding some bling!</li>
            <li>very pretty and actually not flimsy at all.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend checking these out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To use glue that really high tech ,i buy it&lt;br /&gt;Coz</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product and would probably reorder</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It is super pretty, and even though it&#x27;s only a few dollars, it does not look or feel cheap to me at all.</li>
            <li>the trick to putting this on and making it stay a little more put is to comb it as if you&#x27;re going to put it on backwards and the flip it forward.</li>
            <li>Presently surprised!!</li>
            <li>Well, probably a little better</li>
            <li>With this being only $1.90 and FREE SHIPPING, I decided that despite the polarizing (and mostly negative) reviews on Amazon I would go for it because I like to do simple side fishtail braids or a big top knot on days where I need a fun, stylish, yet simple no-fuss hairstyle for going to work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Beautiful, look just like in picture but little heavy for my hair, it kept falling out of my hair.</li>
            <li>I have had nothing but problems with this order, first I did not receive it for christmas,  Then when they sent me out another one (which was nice of them) when I got it, it was broken.</li>
            <li>It dosent look like the one in the picture at all, it is colorful and too different.</li>
            <li>Cute and sturdy hairclip, that can be wear for parties or may be everyday.</li>
            <li>Beautiful but missing a few stones.</li>
            <li>It looks great worn casually or to dress up</li>
            <li>You can tell its a little cheap hair piece from china but its cute and unlike the other reviews, my comb did not break during delivery or once i opened the package.</li>
            <li>I ordered quite a few new hair accessories and of all of them, this was my favorite.</li>
            <li>this comb is very pretty, it dose not hold your hair back by itself but a couple bobbi pins will keep your hair back and then the comb looks so pretty.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t tell right away, and I may go to the craft store one day and replace some of them with different colors.  </li>
            <li>this will add the extra touch of  class and the right amount</li>
            <li>Thankfully it all came in one piece (unlike some of the folks who have reviewed), no stones were loose or missing and it looks surprisingly sturdy and durable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very nice clip in hair piece and not over exaggerated in the &amp;#34;bling&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This accessory is super cute but very heavy for fine hair like mine if you have thick hair</li>
            <li>This is a new staple for evenings out.</li>
            <li>It is about 17-20+ days&#x27; wait for it, depending on where you live.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s means I have to Oder a new one</li>
            <li>It has a good size, enough to hold thick hair.</li>
            <li>but the prongs don&#x27;t feel very strong as I have really thick hair.  </li>
            <li>Very good looking hair clip, for the only reason, I don&#x27;t give it  five stars is because is a little too heavy</li>
            <li>It is very classy looking and quality.</li>
            <li>Never been much for pretty things on my hair, just wash, and  blow dry.</li>
            <li>clearly just won&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li>Broke when we handled it to place in hair, pretty but very fragile.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty and functional and with the low price you can&#x27;t go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It looked so pretty and the price was so low, i couldn&#x27;t resist.</li>
            <li>Waist of money I strongly don&#x27;t recommend getting it!!!!!! :(</li>
            <li>I was surprised it was metal!</li>
            <li>Completely!</li>
            <li>I have bought 3 of these so far!</li>
            <li>But for some reason, in my hands, it appears more juvenile than I had envisioned while looking online.</li>
            <li>You have to have thick hair and not get headaches easily to use this!</li>
            <li>Arrived much quickly then expected.</li>
            <li>This looks super pretty and big on the picture, but it&#x27;s actually cheaper looking in person and seems a bit smaller.</li>
            <li>Not cheap prongs are strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little cheap looking, but it&#x27;s pretty and was at a low cost.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little on the dressy side but does fine with a sundress and sandals too.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty, but also heavier than expected.</li>
            <li>And its also a  little cheap looking.</li>
            <li>looks a little cheap</li>
            <li>I was weary to buy but figured it was cheap and little risk.</li>
            <li>Pinks, purples, clear &amp; iridescent crystals.</li>
            <li>One stone was floating around in the bottom of the clear sleeve that it came in.</li>
            <li>The only thing I can say is that it would be nice to have different colors and styles.&lt;br /&gt;Shipment came earlier than expected.</li>
            <li>However, that is as far as it goes.</li>
            <li>My daughter has wore it several times and the rhinestone still in place, also it holds very well.</li>
            <li>but it came 3 weeks after the wedding~ Make sure to order the hair clip at least 3 months before.</li>
            <li>The picture makes it look a lot larger than it really is.  </li>
            <li>It is much larger than it looks in the picture, and is really sturdy.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find quality like this in any stores near me.  </li>
            <li>I bought them for my young daughters who agreed.</li>
            <li>I was completely in shock</li>
            <li>hair clip was for my 9-yr old daughter&#x27;s recital.</li>
            <li>It came all in one piece with no diamonds missing and is comfortable in my hair.</li>
            <li>i guess since its coming from far away.</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.  </li>
            <li>Well, I acutally bought it so I can round up purchase to get free shipping.</li>
            <li>Although, if you have very silky hair the hair clip can slip out, but it&#x27;s not really a big deal.</li>
            <li>My daughter is a young dancer whoLoves</li>
            <li>Again though, if you are going to pay for something this low in price, don&#x27;t expect too much.</li>
            <li>even that is coming from far</li>
            <li>My 13 yr old loves it.</li>
            <li>This is so lovely, but I have short hair and it is too heavy to work for me.</li>
            <li>If you have thick hair it may be better.</li>
            <li>received the hair clips took a while but ordered four they are nice but one of them came broken.</li>
            <li>Had it not been broken, it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>Looks like it is made from very cheap products and was very small and not like how the picture looks like.</li>
            <li>Very pretty made with high quality materials, its just too heavy.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the $1.80 I spent on it!</li>
            <li>This comb is pretty and it&#x27;s sized to securely hold my hair in a bun, provided I add some bobby pins because the prongs are not quite long enough to keep it tight.</li>
            <li>Super glue should fix it, but I didn&#x27;t expect to get it snapped in half.</li>
            <li>The other went right in the trash.  </li>
            <li>but I have fine hair and this is very heavy.</li>
            <li>The shipping wasn&#x27;t the fastest, but that was exactly what I expected with products from overseas - so I can&#x27;t/won&#x27;t complain about that at all.</li>
            <li>You should just go to your local store and buy nice guaranteed product&#x27;s that will at least last one night of wearing it out.</li>
            <li>This is exactly as described and is strong enough to hold my long thick hair all day without falling out.</li>
            <li>Its very soft and fragile.</li>
            <li>I crimmed my hair and just put it in, and it stayed for over an hour with no other clips.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would definitely recommend this for a little fun and sparkle!</li>
            <li>It is very, very pretty and shiny, not too heavy.</li>
            <li>so there are some wires to &#x27;grab&#x27; at the prongs in order for it to stay in for more than a few minutes before slipping out!</li>
            <li>No good very cheap quality should buy this in person next time</li>
            <li>It looks super in the hair , but as stated , if you have long , thick and heavy hair maybe would be better to buy 2..</li>
            <li>I am mixed, with long curly hair, therefore I&#x27;m very particular about hair accessories.</li>
            <li>The design looks great, however the quality is really bad.  </li>
            <li>This hair clip features various shades of purple and clear crystals.  </li>
            <li>I have priced pieces in bridal shops similar to this that were completely out of this price range.</li>
            <li>The teeth are too far apart for my tiny bun or up-dos, so I gave it away to someone who could appreciate its purple crystals and keep it in their thicker hair.</li>
            <li>This hair accessary was much nicer than I expected.  </li>
            <li>I plan to place a re-order in the near future.</li>
            <li>This hair comb is made of a sturdy plastic and has kind of cheesy looking costume jewelry gems in it.</li>
            <li>Mine is thick and curly, and I had to wear it in a ponytail in order to have something to help secure the clip.  </li>
            <li>This clip would have been beautiful if it had arrived in one piece :(</li>
            <li>Still totally worth the few bucks I paid.</li>
            <li>Yes, delivery is slow – but the range they provided was accurate and it came early than expected considering that I live in NYC and this was shipped from Hong Kong.</li>
            <li>The pin is pretty, and not too heavy this time, but the prongs are rather thick and rounded so that they slip out of finer hair too easily.  </li>
            <li>the prongs are long and they can be used to hold up very long hair, this can be used to pretty up your hair for any up do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve contacted the seller and they&#x27;re sending me a new one, but we&#x27;ll see if this one even arrives in one piece and how long it holds up if it does.</li>
            <li>This one is too heavy and slips right off.</li>
            <li>Very pretty but, on the heavy side luckily I have thick hair</li>
            <li>Would not recommend for fine hair, but it is durable enough for heavy or long hair without having to worry about any breaking or bending!</li>
            <li>Large enough for all kinds of uses, but the ARE pronged combs and will need to be carefully placed.</li>
            <li>Very pretty crystals, appears to be plastic - not sure how well it will hold up.  </li>
            <li>It really is that sharp, so be cautious.</li>
            <li>I am African American with natural hair</li>
            <li>This is very heavy, but looks very pretty in a woman or girl&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this to add some flair to a high pony tail and even though I have long thin fine hair</li>
            <li>I put my hair up in a bun and then put this underneath the bun, and I also put my hair into a French roll and put this clip so that it is right next to the French roll, so not up or down, but beside.</li>
            <li>Can break if dropped repeatedly, but generally durable enough for its intended purpose.</li>
            <li>They are sparkly and pretty heavy.</li>
            <li>This hair clip/comb is pretty heavy.  </li>
            <li>Pretty and feels heavy, giving it that sterling silver quality feel.  </li>
            <li>Took a little long to get shipped to me, but was worth the wait for the price.</li>
            <li>I thought the thing was solid silver at first because the gems are fairly pale.  </li>
            <li>The gem part is very pretty, but the tines are really thick</li>
            <li>Just a pure waste of money.</li>
            <li>These clips are high quality, hands down.</li>
            <li>It has purple, pink &amp; clear rhinestones.</li>

            <li> Looks very elegant.</li>
            <li> Although the title of this product says &amp;#34;hair clip&amp;#34; it is truly a &amp;#34;hair comb&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s very elegant.</li>

            <li> If it were in one piece I&#x27;d love to wear it, and it&#x27;s perfect for special occasions because it&#x27;s so sparkly.</li>
            <li> Which is great because it wont break easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how much more dressy a bun looks when you add this piece to it!  </li>
            <li> clip Beauty Tools is very good, thanks you for the good bissunes</li>
            <li> Really nice.</li>
            <li> But, for the price it is nice.</li>
            <li> Should be a nice piece to wear.</li>
            <li> This was made so nicely for the price.</li>
            <li> The flowers were nicely made and the colors resemble those of the picture.</li>
            <li> and they are so nice and</li>
            <li> Kind of multi colored irradecent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought others like this that I really liked.</li>
            <li> Read many good comments about this product.</li>
            <li> Looked nice but flimsy.</li>
            <li> Nice</li>
            <li> Its nice for the price.</li>
            <li> So sparkly and all the rhinestones are perfectly intact and seems like it&#x27;s put together very well.  </li>
            <li> Grand daughter loved it.</li>
            <li> Excellent, fast service.</li>
            <li> Looks nice, stays in my hair.  </li>
            <li> and it looks good on(for the couple of hours that i was able to)</li>
            <li> It is a nice quality, very sparkly, perfect size.</li>
            <li> I liked the clip a lot.</li>
            <li> Excellent hair clip, looks great on simple updos.</li>
            <li> She got compliments from guests and she really likes it, would be perfect for a wedding as appeared in the picture as well.</li>
            <li> it looks nice in your hair.</li>
            <li> and it is a nice accessory to add to any hair type.</li>
            <li> nice item made of sturdy materials.</li>
            <li> but Once it was in my hair I liked it.</li>
            <li> Nice combs</li>
            <li> My mom liked them</li>
            <li> The colors in this hair comb are a bit muddied, so I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars, but the pattern is nice and</li>
            <li> They are sturdy and look nice.</li>
            <li> This was a cheap deal for an awesome hair comb-It&#x27;s sturdy and not at all cheap looking or made I was worried that would be the case for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> Nice rhinestones.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The flowers are nice.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t wear it in my own though.</li>
            <li> It is beautiful, it is better if you have lots of hair because it does not stay on easily</li>
            <li> This holds it securely and very nicely.</li>
            <li> This hair jewelry was very beautiful and high quality.  </li>
            <li> Very classy, perfect for any occasion.</li>
            <li> Much better than in the pic... love this!</li>
            <li> but I just liked it even more.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and very sturdy I can&#x27;t wait to wear it!</li>
            <li> The good news is, they were cheap.  </li>
            <li> I love this clip because it is really nice.  </li>
            <li> Great item and surprised with the good quality.  </li>
            <li> Super cute, and for sure a great thing to have for summer, or just to wear to town to spruce up your look a bit.</li>
            <li> I enjoy them, will keep them, and give them five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the beautiful large pieces of hair jewelry!!</li>
            <li> They did give quick service and free shipping and it made a beautiful stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and again beautiful</li>
            <li> I really like this hair clip its as beautiful as they show it</li>
            <li> It looks like something that comes out of a gumball machine very cheaply made and gaudy.</li>
            <li> Even more beautiful in real life.</li>
            <li> Pretty, colorful, great deal!  </li>
            <li> Very pretty, good girl style item.</li>
            <li> Love this item simple but spruced my out fit up looked great and felt beautiful</li>
            <li> and I got a lot of complements for several people as it is very attractive to the eye, and it is perfect for special events or including in a normal day of work, and the material is resistant and will endure longer</li>
            <li> If buying it for a,wedding or event make sure order it three to four weeks before the planned event.</li>
            <li> More sparkly.</li>
            <li> There is a lot more purple and lavender in this comb than the picture shows</li>
            <li> The design of the clip is just stunning.</li>
            <li> But I glued it to a better clip and wear it a lot.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I wish I got more.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s okay for the price I guess.</li>
            <li> The stones shine bright and colorful in the sunlight.  </li>
            <li> Okay, this is not a clip.</li>
            <li> Look&#x27;s lovely on hair .</li>
            <li> Great looking clip I purchased for a fun and free friend.  </li>
            <li> The packaging could have been better, all in all</li>
            <li> Takes hair from blan to elegant.</li>
            <li> I have already ordered FIVE more for friends and family.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with both product and Seller.</li>
            <li> I am glad that I didn&#x27;t spend more on it.</li>
            <li> and it would have cost more to return it</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> OK.</li>
            <li> OK?</li>
            <li> At any rate, I am glad I purchased two, just in case I lose one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has more of a purple tint to it.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair clip for myself and love it.</li>
            <li> Love the pinks and pastels</li>
            <li> When the got here they looked even better then the seller showed or could of shown.</li>
            <li> But I love them</li>
            <li> It looks stunning in person, I haven&#x27;t had an issue with it getting stuck in my hair yet.</li>
            <li> Excited to use it some more!</li>
            <li> I will be ordering 2 more.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I guess for the price is okay.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I thought this looked cute, but it&#x27;s gaudy in person.</li>
            <li> Would be cute in a child&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> and I got free shipping!</li>
            <li> This was a wonderful gift, my teenage daughter fell in love with it when she opened it.  </li>
            <li> Everything is sparkly and will sure get attention.</li>
            <li> Elegant.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> and well made :)</li>
            <li> It is absolutely lovely Shipped from Hong Kong  took a while  </li>

            <li> I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> (Note, I don&#x27;t think it will hold your hair by itself--it is more designed to be inserted into a self-sustaining style like a bun as a decoration.)  </li>
            <li> Its better to ask more and provide customer with a better quality stuff... would not recommend this product</li>
            <li> i bought more thing from amazom</li>

            <li> It looks better in person and I would tell everyone where I order it from.</li>
            <li> Love the look but one of the prongs came bent.</li>

            <li> i slide it in over top a bun or ponytail or braid</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well made and won&#x27;t just fall apart like so many things do.</li>

            <li> Super cute!</li>
            <li> very good product is just what I expected for the price we paid, satisfied with the purchase, and would recommend to buy!</li>
            <li> This hair clip is super cute and made of nice materials, it does not snag or damage hair at all</li>
            <li> It came fairly soon and is pretty.</li>
            <li> Beautiful but the flowers came off after one use, by an adult not a child</li>
            <li> Beautiful and classy.</li>
            <li> It is more colorful than the picture, and it is really nice :) It will play up a bun and give it some bling.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product, it adds just the right touch to the outfit</li>
            <li> Hopefully the rocks in it don&#x27;t fall out easily like in many hair cheaper accessories.</li>
            <li> Although it didn&#x27;t come very quickly, I still love it and gave it five stars.</li>
            <li> The colors in it are very nice, and in the light it can really sparkle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a present for a friend, but I am really excited about giving it to her because it is absolutely beautiful!.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it was cheap.</li>
            <li> --I have to secure my hair well with a pony tail holder and &amp; be sure to place it</li>
            <li> Nice to wear on a special evening out or to a special event too.</li>
            <li> Super easy to place and stays put!</li>
            <li> highly recommend this hair clip as both useful and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Should hold up well and after my wedding would be more than happy to wear it out when go different places.</li>
            <li> Shipped very quickly</li>
            <li> This is unacceptable because from how it broke, I can easily tell the quality wont support it in one piece at all.</li>
            <li> It can break by a baby, easily.</li>
            <li> Very quick delivery, within the week.  </li>
            <li> but it broke so easily</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t get it into my hair easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to use too.</li>
            <li> I Just wish I think of this before my life now is wait easy</li>
            <li> Could go easily to anything from Church to a formal event and look like you paid 100x</li>
            <li> I got this very quickly and at a price I couldn&#x27;t believe.  </li>
            <li> Easy to wear on hair.</li>
            <li> Lovely pin and very eye catching.</li>
            <li> The comb is strong and holds well.  </li>
            <li> When arrived was so happy very pretty; but first time I wore it came apart had to use super glue to keep together.</li>
            <li> It is very cute, and stays in my hair very well.  </li>
            <li> I liked this one it was really pretty</li>
            <li> I liked it, but it broke on the first day of wearing it.</li>
            <li> She was thrilled when we first opened the package.</li>
            <li> The design is quiet beautiful</li>
            <li> These are beautiful enough for a wedding!</li>
            <li> this is such a beautiful hair piece.</li>
            <li> This is such a beautiful piece</li>
            <li> I cannot use these because my hair is fine &amp; will not hold in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Pretty, actually metal, and definitely impressive for the price.  </li>
            <li> My hair is really fine</li>
            <li> Super cute hair accessory.  </li>
            <li> Arrived intact and quick!</li>
            <li> I love sparkly things, and these hair combs are very pretty.  </li>
            <li> Very, very pretty!  </li>
            <li> Very pretty!</li>
            <li> The teeth on this comb are HUGE, jagged and the ends are pointed.</li>
            <li> Could take time to get uses to the screw design on the stick arms part instead of an smooth silky arm</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I ordered it for my granddaughter to wear in her next pagent.</li>
            <li> It looks cheap.</li>
            <li> So gorgeuos and pretty!I don&#x27;t know why it is sooo cheap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll enjoy it while it lasts.</li>
            <li> and it does sparkle in the light .</li>
            <li> Great Christmas present  </li>
            <li> cheap quality stuff...</li>
            <li> and it was cheap</li>
            <li> lol now im gonna see if i can glue it back together or something</li>
            <li> I guess I will need to secure it with some bobby pins.  </li>
            <li> Looks fantastic with any hair style.</li>
            <li> cheap</li>
            <li> Despite it being really cheap, unless you plan on buying something that you have to fix then</li>
            <li> cheap</li>
            <li> I assume it is because they make the combs with whatever they have available.  </li>
            <li> It is a blinking item, shine under the light.</li>
            <li> Cheap looking.</li>
            <li> Plastic clips don&#x27;t last and don&#x27;t do a great job.</li>
            <li> Although it arrived with a broken tine, it was not cost effective to return it, so I improvised and wear it proudly!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have something of quality which if I were to try and purchase this kind of hairpiece anywhere local, it would no doubt cost @</li>
            <li> It broke on the first wear and looks very cheap</li>
            <li> I cant mention that enough.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the money, worth the wait and worth the price!!</li>
            <li> Very sturdy, very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using this very much.</li>
            <li> It is very pretty and it is made strong.</li>
            <li> I ordered three different hair clips and loved all of them they are made of strong material.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> ok first they send me two pieces.</li>
            <li> I love it so much!</li>
            <li> Beautiful as I expected to be.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m excited to wear it.</li>
            <li> My only con is that I wish it came in more colors! :)</li>
            <li> First of all it took more than 3 weeks to get it and by the time I received it beads had fallen off.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty, but don&#x27;t expect more than that.</li>
            <li> Looks beautiful in the picture but in reality not much.</li>
            <li> very pretty hair clip, i was surprised with the good quality given the price.  </li>
            <li> Wonderful hair comb, which is accurately made and what made me fall in love with it is that is the first hairclip for bun which is curved, not straight, as most manufacturers make, asking bigger money for a piece of cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> The tines bend kinda easily, but totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> it was more then what i expected thank you for the good services</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more they are comfortable, lightweight and hold hair very well.  </li>
            <li> the soldering on the clips were a bit shotty but otherwise beautiful and also the show purple and dark purple in the picture when i recieved light pink/light purple hair pins</li>
            <li> It is very cute but the metal is easily breakable because after the 2nd use of it, one of the teeth fell off.</li>
            <li> For example, if you are a Junior or Senior this year, and you have that special Dinner Dance, or Prom, I would consider ordering it</li>
            <li> I chose to give this five stars because I did not expect to get such a great quality product for such an amazing deal.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> that is comb is best for people with thick or curly hair.</li>
            <li> The whole top part separated from the comb.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love the colors and size and will probably by more in different colors if they&#x27;re available.</li>
            <li> I love it so much.</li>
            <li> True to color and style.</li>
            <li> I ordered your stuff and paid in full.</li>
            <li> The price is not bad either.</li>
            <li> A nice decorative comb with long tines for more securing of hair.</li>
            <li> It was very pretty but broke after my first time of using it, not sturdy enough on the hair comb its attached to or was lol</li>
            <li> This is very pretty, not such good quality.</li>
            <li> Very Nice, was suprised it was the size I expected after the earrings I received.  </li>
            <li> they take a few weeks (4-7) to arrive and come from china but are gorgeous!</li>

            <li> This hair comb is very pretty &amp;  sparkly.  </li>
            <li> Very pretty hair clip.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s metal purple flowers very pretty bought it for my daughter.</li>
            <li> These are beautiful hair combs sturdy and heavy need a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> havent wore it yet,but i will &#x3D;) need a certain outfit &amp; nicer weather, it can be worn w?anything,but its on the pretty side.</li>
            <li> so maybe after I glue it, I might glue on some reinforcing things and it will be better than new.  </li>
            <li> When I first received this comb I thought it was beautiful, and the jewelry part of it is, but the very first time I put it in my hair, as soon as I pushed it down into my hair, the jewelry part (the flowers),</li>
            <li> I loved it and was very cute., but when they did not pack it well and came broken.</li>
            <li> but I guess the price i paid for it explains it why it broke so fast and easy</li>
            <li> Very well made , not flimsy , pretty stones..Will keep looking for more ..</li>
            <li> It looks so pretty in my hair!</li>
            <li> pretty!</li>
            <li> It looks EXACTLY like the picture!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s so pretty!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty piece, but may be more age appropriate for a pre-teen or teenage girl.</li>
            <li> It looks soooo pretty!</li>
            <li> I cannot reattach it myself because it is made out of some kind of metal, regular glue, super glue or wood glue</li>
            <li> This hairclip is so cheap yet makes beautiful and elegant the most ugly hairstyle.</li>
            <li> Very high quality but of course since it&#x27;s in china and free shipping it does take a while.</li>
            <li> It was so worth what I payed for it.</li>
            <li> It took almost 3 mos to receive them but they were worth the wait.</li>
            <li> It is bigger than I expected, but is perfect when you pull up your hair.</li>
            <li> very much worth the money.</li>
            <li> Over all worth it.</li>
            <li> This was definitely worth the wait from China.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, and heavy!</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> The metal comb actually holds my hair more securely without the adornments, so I might try to find another way to decorate it.</li>
            <li> The crystals are carefully attached to the metal petals, package is good.</li>
            <li> and it adds a touch of fun and beauty to my hair.</li>
            <li> Loved this one so much , bought a second</li>
            <li> Well worth</li>
            <li> It is totally worth the wait.</li>
            <li> It is solidly made and stays in my hair nicely.</li>
            <li> I love how soft the colors are and</li>
            <li> I truly have gotten my monies worth</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t super fast at getting it to me, but everything came in one piece!</li>
            <li> pretty quick considering.</li>
            <li> Very nice, too heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li> It was lovely and I tried to wear it again the same way, but the decorated piece snapped clean off at the solder points when I tried to wiggle it into place.</li>
            <li> The stone is very shinny and well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I received this item right on time.</li>
            <li> still the price is right and epoxy should fix it.</li>
            <li> the crystals fell off right away and had to throw it away.  </li>
            <li> flimsy and the teeth fell off the hair clip right away.</li>
            <li> She put it right into her hair yesterday and wore it all day.  </li>
            <li> I am collecting hair items and this was just right.  </li>
            <li> This is very pretty, it looks so nice, but if you have fine hair I would not recommend this because I do not think it would stay in place, it is heavy.</li>
            <li> If it is like the other two that I have received then I am sure that I will love it, as the other&#x27;s I have thus far as absolutely beautiful.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll enjoy wearing them for a long time.</li>
            <li> In real life it looks exactly as it does on the web site and looks pretty good with different hairstyles.</li>
            <li> FOR MY hair look SPECTACULAR IN ANY MODERN AND SOCIAL EVENT ..</li>
            <li> It barely arrived for my wedding,but so glad it did.</li>
            <li> It IS beautiful, I wish i had at least one chance to use it.</li>
            <li> , delivery was kind of long</li>
            <li> I have dark hair, so it&#x27;s a good decoration.</li>
            <li> Only recommend for people with VERY fine hair.</li>
            <li> It looked betifull after opening the packed but broked pretty much right after putting it on....:</li>
            <li> Looks great, but you&#x27;ll definitely know it&#x27;s there the entire time you wear it.</li>
            <li> It is so pretty, and can be used to make any hair style look a little more elegant.</li>
            <li> Will def actually by a few more soon as gifts for people that love accesories like these as much as I do!</li>
            <li> Its very very sparkly too.</li>
            <li> Like it very much, Will be buying another one</li>

            <li> It is pretty though.</li>
            <li> And, even coming from China, only took 2 weeks at most.</li>
            <li> Pretty,  but the flowers were separated from the comb.  </li>
            <li> exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> It takes a long time to arrive since it comes from China, but the wait is worth it :)</li>
            <li> pretty all gems where on the item like advertised</li>
            <li> This hair clip is just as pretty as it is in the picture</li>

            <li> Love it got it in blue</li>
            <li> Still pretty and sparkly, however.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty, and it would work great if your hair wasn&#x27;t too thick.  </li>
            <li> It is really pretty.</li>
            <li> The colors match exactly.</li>
            <li> Would buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> At first I did not like these after I purchased them.</li>
            <li> But, this makes them more solid than the types of barrettes we are accustomed to.</li>
            <li> Make any bun pretty.</li>
            <li> The first time I wore it i bent over and it slid out of my hair and hit the floor and broke.</li>
            <li> Broke the first time putting in my hair.  </li>
            <li> but it was pretty and still stayed on my hair.</li>
            <li> its pretty</li>
            <li> I ordered this on a whim as an inexpensive add on,  It is pretty</li>
            <li> Exactly what i thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Exactly what i thought it would be.</li>
            <li> now I have had things break that I have purchase but never this fast this was a all time record!</li>
            <li> It looks pretty but is not made well.</li>
            <li> I know she will love it all the same.</li>
            <li> It was just as pretty as the picture, but within days it broke</li>
            <li> For the price paid, this is a pretty and sturdy hair pin.</li>
            <li> that makes its so pretty, came off.</li>
            <li> Pretty but not sturdy</li>
            <li> Keep in mind it is exactly as the picture shows and fits nicley tucked ina ponytail or bun.</li>
            <li> Pretty, but broke as soon as I took it out of plastic sleeve, bummer after waiting quite awhile, had to go thru customs,</li>
            <li> i bought this because it looked pretty</li>
            <li> It broke the first time I put it in my hair.  </li>
            <li> This is really pretty.  </li>
            <li> The quality is exactly what I expect it to be for the price.</li>
            <li> but it is NOT a hairclip, It is a pretty comb, but it is, in no way, a clip.</li>
            <li> it might be pretty</li>
            <li> When I first saw this product on Amazon</li>
            <li> I have purchased a lot of hairpins lately and this one has been the biggest HAPPY surprise in a while...</li>
            <li> Would have been pretty.</li>
            <li> The hair clip looks exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> However the quality of this is exactly what you paid.</li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;ll make sure the shipment is to my house.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on the first of October, and got it yesterday.</li>
            <li> Adorable but way too big.  </li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for to add some bling to my hair.</li>
            <li> But the comb part is plastic and the first time I put it in my hair, one of the plastic teeth broke off.  </li>
            <li> The decorative part is much higher quality than the comb.  </li>
            <li> this is really pretty</li>
            <li> Broke in the first used</li>
            <li> Pretty design, but it broke after wearing it twice.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I really like this!</li>
            <li> Just right - my daughter loves it and feels very dressed up with it.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for a long time for something pretty for my hair without being over the top.</li>
            <li> It is pretty cute and is made of metal so it will long pretty much</li>
            <li> Nice clip for your money a little heavy but good quality.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to show off this pretty hair clip, but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sparkly and pretty</li>
            <li> Shipped pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Beautiful but broken when I received it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still giving it three stars because it is beautiful, but the comb was broken when I received it, so I can&#x27;t even wear it.  </li>
            <li> It is palm size and a bit heavy, so not really easy to use for the side of a bun, but great for the top.</li>
            <li> For the price is worth the wait, very shiny and high end.</li>
            <li> It looked pretty enough, but you could tell the metal was cheap.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve used hair decorations like this, but for this price, it was easy to leap back into it.</li>
            <li> It was a bit too heavy but overall beautiful.</li>
            <li> They are kind of heavy but pretty.</li>
            <li> This is pretty, but it is kind of large and heavy</li>
            <li> the teeth are large, my hair is thinner and does not hold things well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are large.</li>
            <li> Large.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pretty but quality and size I would guess it was for a young lady.  </li>
            <li> I have a few curly haired friends who love these!  </li>
            <li> One cannot expect more from this price,this quality looks good and it came within its delivery time,it&#x27;s little heavy</li>
            <li> Very shiny,pretty,and relieved it is made of metal and not plastic.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> VERY sparkly.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really look like the picture either</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s durable and stays in very well.</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t really wear it...</li>
            <li> With this price it&#x27;s reasonable.</li>
            <li> Hair clip, better then I expected.</li>
            <li> Not so much for a woman.</li>
            <li> I really think one can get buy just one, with that style.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It holds on my hair very well I plan to order another one</li>
            <li> It is also a lot more pink</li>
            <li> this so much prettier in person, the pictures do not do it justice.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Really inexpensive</li>
            <li> but i really dissappointed</li>
            <li> They need to begin to be a bit more careful about their merchants.</li>
            <li> It is not plastic and its bigger than I thought..hope it will fit in her hair...</li>
            <li> Christmas  Thanks</li>
            <li> It is cute, the quality I had expected also.</li>
            <li> Thanks again.</li>
            <li> if it was not broken within one hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was very inexpensive but made very well.</li>
            <li> and it is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Very Pritty.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this would work well in straight hair.  </li>
            <li> I can tell by looking at the areas where the jewelry piece (the flowers) was attached to the comb, that whoever put it together did not use enough melted metal to securely attach the two pieces together.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I received mine intact and ready to wear.</li>
            <li> It broke really fast.  </li>
            <li> Much prettier than the picture.  </li>
            <li> and it is very well made.</li>
            <li> This is so much prettier in the hand.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I wear very often</li>
            <li> The product looks great when it reached but one of the petals on the flower was broken when I recieved it.</li>
            <li> This is a very Cheep Looking item.</li>
            <li> It did take a whole month to get here</li>
            <li> very sturdy and no issues with the gems falling out after almost a year of owning and using.</li>
            <li> I really like it well.</li>
            <li> In real life its sparkle adds glam to it.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Is made better than i expected.</li>
            <li> My wife ordered based on the image what is shown in online.&lt;br /&gt;the one we received was 100% different.&lt;br /&gt;She was very upset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t mind they&#x27;re not made of real jewelry.</li>
            <li> very well package.</li>
            <li> highly recomend this seller!</li>
            <li> The pricing is extemely reasonable.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would get the purple or pink one though.....</li>
            <li> and they have yet to break its really a steal for what you pay and what you get .</li>
            <li> but nothing you can really notice.</li>
            <li> It is fairly heavy and nice looking.</li>
            <li> I really liked this comb but it was too heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li> Loved the pink and white crystals</li>
            <li> While obviously costume jewelry, it is very pretty and large and sparkly!  </li>
            <li> first time I tried to use it tho, on New Year&#x27;s Eve, it separated from the comb.</li>
            <li> I had to file down some loose plastic bits on the comb pieces because they kept catching on my hair instead of sliding in smoothly.</li>
            <li> very pretty and a great gift for my daughters who both have very long thick hair and have to pull it up for orchestra concerts.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected!</li>
            <li> It came sooner than expected which i really like that,  also its very pretty i always wear it when i wear donut hair style since its very hot in Arizona.</li>
            <li> Falls right out of your hair, pretty useless, but looks good if you can get it to stay in your hair.</li>
            <li> I buy a lot of cheap jewelry but this hair clip comb thing is really cheap not sure if I will even ever use it.</li>
            <li> , it looks so expensive, this is definetely a great purchase, it arrive on the exact day it says on the delivery time,</li>
            <li> Nice little inexpensive treat!</li>
            <li> It crowns the head well, in the front, if you wear your hair up, say, in a Ponytail or in a Banana Clip, as I do, and if you stick it through your Bangs going downward toward the face, it kind of looks like a small Tiara.  </li>
            <li> and it is nice and heavy and stays well in my buns and puffs!</li>
            <li> It is very heavy but nice hair comb .</li>
            <li> Decently made.  </li>
            <li> and it arrived in a decent amount of time</li>
            <li> It was better than I had expected by far.</li>
            <li> this is beautiful and should be bought for someone with a lot of long thick hair for it to hold the hair in</li>
            <li> It really is very pretty and will jazz up a simple hairstyle by just popping it in and adding some bling!</li>
            <li> very pretty and actually not flimsy at all.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend checking these out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To use glue that really high tech ,i buy it&lt;br /&gt;Coz</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product and would probably reorder</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It is super pretty, and even though it&#x27;s only a few dollars, it does not look or feel cheap to me at all.</li>
            <li> the trick to putting this on and making it stay a little more put is to comb it as if you&#x27;re going to put it on backwards and the flip it forward.</li>
            <li> Presently surprised!!</li>
            <li> Well, probably a little better</li>
            <li> With this being only $1.90 and FREE SHIPPING, I decided that despite the polarizing (and mostly negative) reviews on Amazon I would go for it because I like to do simple side fishtail braids or a big top knot on days where I need a fun, stylish, yet simple no-fuss hairstyle for going to work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Beautiful, look just like in picture but little heavy for my hair, it kept falling out of my hair.</li>
            <li> I have had nothing but problems with this order, first I did not receive it for christmas,  Then when they sent me out another one (which was nice of them) when I got it, it was broken.</li>
            <li> It dosent look like the one in the picture at all, it is colorful and too different.</li>
            <li> Cute and sturdy hairclip, that can be wear for parties or may be everyday.</li>
            <li> Beautiful but missing a few stones.</li>
            <li> It looks great worn casually or to dress up</li>
            <li> You can tell its a little cheap hair piece from china but its cute and unlike the other reviews, my comb did not break during delivery or once i opened the package.</li>
            <li> I ordered quite a few new hair accessories and of all of them, this was my favorite.</li>
            <li> this comb is very pretty, it dose not hold your hair back by itself but a couple bobbi pins will keep your hair back and then the comb looks so pretty.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t tell right away, and I may go to the craft store one day and replace some of them with different colors.  </li>
            <li> this will add the extra touch of  class and the right amount</li>
            <li> Thankfully it all came in one piece (unlike some of the folks who have reviewed), no stones were loose or missing and it looks surprisingly sturdy and durable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice clip in hair piece and not over exaggerated in the &amp;#34;bling&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This accessory is super cute but very heavy for fine hair like mine if you have thick hair</li>
            <li> This is a new staple for evenings out.</li>
            <li> It is about 17-20+ days&#x27; wait for it, depending on where you live.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s means I have to Oder a new one</li>
            <li> It has a good size, enough to hold thick hair.</li>
            <li> but the prongs don&#x27;t feel very strong as I have really thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Very good looking hair clip, for the only reason, I don&#x27;t give it  five stars is because is a little too heavy</li>
            <li> It is very classy looking and quality.</li>
            <li> Never been much for pretty things on my hair, just wash, and  blow dry.</li>
            <li> clearly just won&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> Broke when we handled it to place in hair, pretty but very fragile.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty and functional and with the low price you can&#x27;t go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It looked so pretty and the price was so low, i couldn&#x27;t resist.</li>
            <li> Waist of money I strongly don&#x27;t recommend getting it!!!!!! :(</li>
            <li> I was surprised it was metal!</li>
            <li> Completely!</li>
            <li> I have bought 3 of these so far!</li>
            <li> But for some reason, in my hands, it appears more juvenile than I had envisioned while looking online.</li>
            <li> You have to have thick hair and not get headaches easily to use this!</li>
            <li> Arrived much quickly then expected.</li>
            <li> This looks super pretty and big on the picture, but it&#x27;s actually cheaper looking in person and seems a bit smaller.</li>
            <li> Not cheap prongs are strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little cheap looking, but it&#x27;s pretty and was at a low cost.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little on the dressy side but does fine with a sundress and sandals too.  </li>
            <li> Very pretty, but also heavier than expected.</li>
            <li> And its also a  little cheap looking.</li>
            <li> looks a little cheap</li>
            <li> I was weary to buy but figured it was cheap and little risk.</li>
            <li> Pinks, purples, clear &amp; iridescent crystals.</li>
            <li> One stone was floating around in the bottom of the clear sleeve that it came in.</li>
            <li> The only thing I can say is that it would be nice to have different colors and styles.&lt;br /&gt;Shipment came earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> However, that is as far as it goes.</li>
            <li> My daughter has wore it several times and the rhinestone still in place, also it holds very well.</li>
            <li> but it came 3 weeks after the wedding~ Make sure to order the hair clip at least 3 months before.</li>
            <li> The picture makes it look a lot larger than it really is.  </li>
            <li> It is much larger than it looks in the picture, and is really sturdy.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find quality like this in any stores near me.  </li>
            <li> I bought them for my young daughters who agreed.</li>
            <li> I was completely in shock</li>
            <li> hair clip was for my 9-yr old daughter&#x27;s recital.</li>
            <li> It came all in one piece with no diamonds missing and is comfortable in my hair.</li>
            <li> i guess since its coming from far away.</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.  </li>
            <li> Well, I acutally bought it so I can round up purchase to get free shipping.</li>
            <li> Although, if you have very silky hair the hair clip can slip out, but it&#x27;s not really a big deal.</li>
            <li> My daughter is a young dancer whoLoves</li>
            <li> Again though, if you are going to pay for something this low in price, don&#x27;t expect too much.</li>
            <li> even that is coming from far</li>
            <li> My 13 yr old loves it.</li>
            <li> This is so lovely, but I have short hair and it is too heavy to work for me.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair it may be better.</li>
            <li> received the hair clips took a while but ordered four they are nice but one of them came broken.</li>
            <li> Had it not been broken, it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> Looks like it is made from very cheap products and was very small and not like how the picture looks like.</li>
            <li> Very pretty made with high quality materials, its just too heavy.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the $1.80 I spent on it!</li>
            <li> This comb is pretty and it&#x27;s sized to securely hold my hair in a bun, provided I add some bobby pins because the prongs are not quite long enough to keep it tight.</li>
            <li> Super glue should fix it, but I didn&#x27;t expect to get it snapped in half.</li>
            <li> The other went right in the trash.  </li>
            <li> but I have fine hair and this is very heavy.</li>
            <li> The shipping wasn&#x27;t the fastest, but that was exactly what I expected with products from overseas - so I can&#x27;t/won&#x27;t complain about that at all.</li>
            <li> You should just go to your local store and buy nice guaranteed product&#x27;s that will at least last one night of wearing it out.</li>
            <li> This is exactly as described and is strong enough to hold my long thick hair all day without falling out.</li>
            <li> Its very soft and fragile.</li>
            <li> I crimmed my hair and just put it in, and it stayed for over an hour with no other clips.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would definitely recommend this for a little fun and sparkle!</li>
            <li> It is very, very pretty and shiny, not too heavy.</li>
            <li> so there are some wires to &#x27;grab&#x27; at the prongs in order for it to stay in for more than a few minutes before slipping out!</li>
            <li> No good very cheap quality should buy this in person next time</li>
            <li> It looks super in the hair , but as stated , if you have long , thick and heavy hair maybe would be better to buy 2..</li>
            <li> I am mixed, with long curly hair, therefore I&#x27;m very particular about hair accessories.</li>
            <li> The design looks great, however the quality is really bad.  </li>
            <li> This hair clip features various shades of purple and clear crystals.  </li>
            <li> I have priced pieces in bridal shops similar to this that were completely out of this price range.</li>
            <li> The teeth are too far apart for my tiny bun or up-dos, so I gave it away to someone who could appreciate its purple crystals and keep it in their thicker hair.</li>
            <li> This hair accessary was much nicer than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I plan to place a re-order in the near future.</li>
            <li> This hair comb is made of a sturdy plastic and has kind of cheesy looking costume jewelry gems in it.</li>
            <li> Mine is thick and curly, and I had to wear it in a ponytail in order to have something to help secure the clip.  </li>
            <li> This clip would have been beautiful if it had arrived in one piece :(</li>
            <li> Still totally worth the few bucks I paid.</li>
            <li> Yes, delivery is slow – but the range they provided was accurate and it came early than expected considering that I live in NYC and this was shipped from Hong Kong.</li>
            <li> The pin is pretty, and not too heavy this time, but the prongs are rather thick and rounded so that they slip out of finer hair too easily.  </li>
            <li> the prongs are long and they can be used to hold up very long hair, this can be used to pretty up your hair for any up do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve contacted the seller and they&#x27;re sending me a new one, but we&#x27;ll see if this one even arrives in one piece and how long it holds up if it does.</li>
            <li> This one is too heavy and slips right off.</li>
            <li> Very pretty but, on the heavy side luckily I have thick hair</li>
            <li> Would not recommend for fine hair, but it is durable enough for heavy or long hair without having to worry about any breaking or bending!</li>
            <li> Large enough for all kinds of uses, but the ARE pronged combs and will need to be carefully placed.</li>
            <li> Very pretty crystals, appears to be plastic - not sure how well it will hold up.  </li>
            <li> It really is that sharp, so be cautious.</li>
            <li> I am African American with natural hair</li>
            <li> This is very heavy, but looks very pretty in a woman or girl&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this to add some flair to a high pony tail and even though I have long thin fine hair</li>
            <li> I put my hair up in a bun and then put this underneath the bun, and I also put my hair into a French roll and put this clip so that it is right next to the French roll, so not up or down, but beside.</li>
            <li> Can break if dropped repeatedly, but generally durable enough for its intended purpose.</li>
            <li> They are sparkly and pretty heavy.</li>
            <li> This hair clip/comb is pretty heavy.  </li>
            <li> Pretty and feels heavy, giving it that sterling silver quality feel.  </li>
            <li> Took a little long to get shipped to me, but was worth the wait for the price.</li>
            <li> I thought the thing was solid silver at first because the gems are fairly pale.  </li>
            <li> The gem part is very pretty, but the tines are really thick</li>
            <li> Just a pure waste of money.</li>
            <li> These clips are high quality, hands down.</li>
            <li> It has purple, pink &amp; clear rhinestones.</li>
            <li> Good for thick hair but not for thin hair</li>
            <li> Neither the length of the prongs nor the width of the comb are adequate to hold a french twist if you have long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> Very pretty, but it hurts to use this, the comb part not properly made, it has metal meshy stuff poking out of it, and every time I put this in my hair it hurt and is even more painful when I take it off, it always ruins my hairstyle.</li>
            <li> Is a preatty hair clip a little bigger than i expected for me that i have fine little hair but still recommended it.</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty comb, although it was just a little heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine, straight, and slippery (and thin; less than 1\\&quot; ponytail diameter) but this comb still stuck in well as long as I don&#x27;t try to insert it into loose styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feels sturdy and durable, and all the crystals were firmly attached in the two I bought (one for me, one for a friend).</li>
            <li> I think it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> so the long tongs don&#x27;t dig into the back of my neck.  </li>
            <li> Of course it will not last long with glue</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this season even though I am usually a full fan of the retailer.</li>
            <li> My toddlers hair is really fine and thin so not much keeps it up, but this does.</li>
            <li> It is not too heavy and stayed in my hair just fine (I do have thick curly hair)</li>
            <li> Quality is okey, pretty enough, but few stone missing even not really obvious anyway.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it will last very long.  </li>
            <li> The supposed crystals are some cheap plastic pieces haphazardly thrown together - all crooked with dried clear glue all over the place, as if it was put together by a two year old.  </li>
            <li> one.&lt;br /&gt; My hair is thick and super heavy , middle back range ,</li>
            <li> The piece is very pretty but was broken when I got it.</li>
            <li> it came broken, could&#x27;nt use it at all, though it is very pretty, dissapointed</li>
            <li> That said, it is really pretty and relatively subtle.</li>
            <li> I took off 1 star because it arrived with a jewel missing and another star got taken off because one of the little pins broke off after my first use.</li>
            <li> When I open the package the flowers were broken from the main piece...too fragile or not enough glue ...poor quality</li>
            <li> but the stems were to long for my hair.</li>
            <li> The picture shows they are long</li>
            <li> Larger than I guess I expected.</li>
            <li> I ordered the one with white crystals and when I got it, it had some pink crystals.</li>
            <li> but it came earlier then expected.</li>
            <li> was that it would take so long to get to me.</li>
            <li> but it was actually pink and white.  </li>
            <li> The comb is long and stays in the hair.</li>
            <li> If you have long locks, buy this.</li>
            <li> The picture doesn&#x27;t do its justice when I received mine it has purple gems as the outter petals and pink towards the middle and a white gem for the center of each flower.</li>
            <li> Its stones are purple and pink and white like a cubic zirconia--the blingy look.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone with long hair that does&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do have curly thick hair, but not enough to snap the piece in half when putting it in for the first time.  </li>
            <li> It is, as I expected for the low price ($1.99), not high quality.</li>
            <li> I really like this and plan to wear with a bun style BUT its a little heavy and and</li>
            <li> Very different from other combs.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair</li>
            <li> The tips of the teeth are a bit rougher than a similar hair comb I purchased &amp; it seems to catch on my hair while sliding it in, so I have to be very careful putting it in</li>
            <li> /&gt;would be decent of the sellers to at least make an exchange.  </li>
            <li> The product it self is ok a little too heavy for thin hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 7 year old for Christmas as a stocking stuffier thinking it was probably just a small plastic clip..</li>
            <li> Not only did this product take a long time to arrive, but quality is less than expected.</li>
            <li> I seem to only use it when I have my hair in a bun, ponytail, I even tease my hair a little if I want it in a particular spot when wearing my hair down,as it is a little heavy on my thin-ish hair.</li>
            <li> I can still use this, but not alone unless it can only hold half my hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I don&#x27;t have a problem keeping these in my hair , ladies with thinner hair , might have a problem keeping these in place, like with sliding or falling out , so what I did was a slight twist and turn to the comb , to add extra security..</li>
            <li> I had to back it with a hidden bobbypin.</li>
            <li> (Note: my hair is past mid back, so there is plenty there to hold up the</li>
            <li> Easy to break when You try in the HAIR and the sheeping was to later its bad quality.</li>
            <li> Its a little bit different then the picture.</li>
            <li> I only had to bend it a little to straighten the tines.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t spend much, but what a waste!!!</li>
            <li> it is classy and delicate looking while still have the bling factor...</li>
            <li> third is so heavy to used this</li>
            <li> Also, in the picture the flowers are purple, though the product itself was pink.</li>
            <li> Not very well made.</li>
            <li> If I knew was pink will never get it</li>
            <li> Mine came in the other day and it came broken in two pieces and the ends of the comb were pretty sharp and rough.</li>
            <li> but overall this was a mistake purchase for me just a waste of $1 as for seller prompt delivery</li>
            <li> In the picture it seems to just be silver gems but mine came with silver, pink and purple gems.</li>
            <li> pennies per what they cost, and it arrived and was pink and purple...</li>
            <li> Missing several stones</li>
            <li> Just what I expected they would be.</li>
            <li> I wish you have it in pink.</li>
            <li> It has the purple and pink.  </li>
            <li> Such a waste of money.</li>
            <li> and I got it sooner than expected</li>
            <li> This is the only hair clip which embraces your head and part of your bun, so that the teeth of the comb are totally hidden!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that 2 of the crystals easily fell out of the comb...glued them back in myself.</li>
            <li> Not strong enough to supper the clip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, I can understand how other people&#x27;s might have broken; my package wasn&#x27;t padded very well.</li>
            <li> I am african american and  I have very thick and long hair.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not worth it to go through the trouble to try and get our money back.</li>
            <li> only thing that I&#x27;m not sure about is that under the purple outer stones were pink ones.  </li>
            <li> three packages were pakaged loose and the fouth was closed up tight around the comb.so</li>
            <li> but the comb things are a little long if you can only make a small bun.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s pretty much useless now.</li>
            <li> and it came in the mail faster than I had expected!</li>
            <li> I tried this in other friends hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This came well-packaged in a small, yellow manila envelope with bubble packaging inside.</li>
            <li> its use to only the thickest of hair, not appropriate for children or people with thinner hair.</li>
            <li> i would like to find it in other colors</li>
            <li> Was not sure what to expect, but was totally amazed when it arrived!</li>
            <li> I ordered 7 only 1 was sent, they say they will resend the missing ones never did!</li>
            <li> Usually when I buy items that are low price</li>
            <li> i belive due to extreme weather</li>
            <li> This is well made and holds the hair securly without any other pins.</li>
            <li> and it sparkles extremely well</li>
            <li> They were packaged with extreme care.</li>
            <li> The photos do them absolutely no justice!</li>
            <li> Only thing is, it&#x27;s a little heavy.</li>
            <li> Heavy, thick, dull and just not what I would call pretty at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty and very heavy, It came broken.</li>
            <li> Look like little girl jewerly plus is pink stone.</li>
            <li> If you miss that ONE week and completely forget THREE months later that you placed this order - you know, while you hold a job and take care of your daily life, they will say, &amp;#34;sorry, too bad, it&#x27;s been 90-days and your grace period is up.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> The person modeling must have a small head and thin hair because this comb does not take up that much space on my head.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t attempt to contact or return because it&#x27;s not worth the hassle.  </li>
            <li> Adds a pop of color to my dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> (((( it&#x27;s not worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Item arrived early but broken.</li>
            <li> so it slides down your hair</li>
            <li> and then it broke, the flower part came from the other part so that was disappointing but its pretty  </li>
            <li> like da other reviews say it&#x27;s heavy</li>
            <li> One other thing I noticed was that the pointy ends of the clip at the bottom are VERY sharp!  </li>
            <li> It looks pretty, but too heavy, it pulls the hair hard and not comfortable to wear it, unless you have very thick hair and are not concerned with hair loss or headache.</li>
            <li> Only buy it if you have reasonably thick hair as it is quite heavy.</li>
            <li> less than 2 bucks deserves a 5 star rating.  </li>
            <li> Not a big deal, but it is thick and heavy and it pulls on my hair...</li>
            <li> Major thing is it was broken.</li>
            <li> _-_ not cool......</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why I expected lightweight...</li>
            <li> but again, travel time is unusually long and made the gift late.</li>
            <li> I do have really long, thick, curly/wavy hair</li>
            <li> I do have thick, long hair, so it works well for me as a decorative hair jewel when I have my hair fashioned in an updo, which is why I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> Need really thick &amp;  long hair for this item.  </li>
            <li> this a heavy peice of head wear, I would gradually slip down.  </li>
            <li> All the little crystals were intact and it arrived after about a month.</li>
            <li> I figured some of you would like to know that little bit of information.</li>
            <li> Shipping was a little timely, but it was shipped almost immediately after payment.  </li>
            <li> It is packaged in a little bag and then in bubble wrap to ensure safety.</li>
            <li> I will keep it and may my hair will grow a little longer so I can use it one day.</li>
            <li> The color in the picture is a little miss leading.  </li>
            <li> It cost a little bit money</li>
            <li> A little heavy</li>
            <li> I had a really hard time getting it out because the ends of some of the comb were rough and turned backward</li>
            <li> its so heavy and the teeth are so thick and wide</li>
            <li> To heavy to stay in your hair</li>
            <li> and it is also heavy.</li>
            <li> The rhinestones were missing all over the pieces and the package when delivered looked like it had been through a war.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> I tried it on and it was too heavy.</li>
            <li> Only one thing to say, it took forever to come and when I received it came broken.</li>
            <li> However, the flower clip is a bit heavy to even put it in your hair.</li>
            <li> I do like it, but feel it might be closer to a four star rating for a few reasons.  </li>
            <li> It is heavy</li>
            <li> In addition, it finally arrived today, broken.</li>
            <li> What a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> its still to heavy.</li>
            <li> I got it in the mail intact, no damage, anything missing or fell apart.</li>
            <li> Though I would say when I put this in my hair, it was a tad bit heavy</li>
            <li> They are way too heavy  for me to use.&lt;br /&gt;More</li>
            <li> The one for my daughter didn&#x27;t last a day broken in 2 pieces.</li>
            <li> but if you have thin hair it will likely fall out.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t mind because I got it for a song, however, anyone who orders should know this is truly just a piece of jewelry that is not made for heavy use.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who doesn&#x27;t mind having a slightly heavy clip in there hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so annoyed about this entire situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I like the look, but it is a bit too heavy for me.</li>
            <li> I find I have to put a few bobby pins into the collection of my gathered hair</li>
            <li> As others have stated, it is quite heavy.  </li>
            <li> Beautifut but too heavy</li>
            <li> but I gave 4stars instead of 5 stars because it was heavy.</li>
            <li> but they are heavy</li>
            <li> heavy..  </li>
            <li> but i expect after a couple uses it will be missing a few gems.</li>
            <li> Took several of weeks to arrived and when it did arrived it was broken.</li>
            <li> When i got the item in its package it was broken and no way for me to attach it back together.</li>
            <li> and I thought about wearing lime green heels with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say this wouldn&#x27;t stay in your hair because it&#x27;s heavy.</li>
            <li> wear one of the five I have everyday</li>
            <li> It was missing one stone</li>
            <li> The design and the crystals are heavy while the actual clips is made of a thin metal.</li>
            <li> A bit big &amp; heavy for my thin hair</li>
            <li> The jeweled piece was broken off the comb, it was missing jewels and an entire petal!  </li>
            <li> Bad quality, it just fall apart the first time I used it, it is not worthy, don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> not sure if it&#x27;s too heavy for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Would be very pretty as a decorative item at the base of a side bun.</li>
            <li> This looks very pretty, but it&#x27;s a piece of crap.</li>
            <li> It came a little late.</li>
            <li> It stays in place well for thick hair and adds that little bling to dress up any outfit.</li>
            <li> This is prettier than it appears but very heavy if you have less hear, need very thick hair, It is also very sharp at the ends</li>
            <li> Broke on first wear :(</li>
            <li> Not sure what.</li>
            <li> not worth the 2 dollars spent sorry</li>
            <li> Way to heavy. cant use it!.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I want to ware them for fear of losing them.</li>
            <li> Heavy clip!</li>
            <li> I have two small children, and I would NOT let them touch this thing.  </li>
            <li> I love this clip, but the flowers are too heavy for the base and it broke after I work it only one time :(</li>
            <li> This product is so unbelievable.</li>
            <li> There is no reason this should have happened as I bought similar pieces and there was nothing wrong with them.  </li>
            <li> have thick hair and it was way to heavy..</li>
            <li> This ended up being extremely cute (WHICH IS SHOCKING)</li>
            <li> I recommend this item if you are looking to make a boring hair day fabulous!</li>
            <li> I am usually hesitant buying something that has stones in it for fear that they will fall out.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s wrong with it, can I get money back?</li>
            <li> Very heavy I may add.  </li>
            <li> This is very heavy.</li>
            <li> Very heavy.</li>
            <li> However, it is VERY heavy.  </li>
            <li> It is very heavy and when I put in my hair the clip fell apart and broke all within five seconds.</li>
            <li> However, it is very heavy and doesnt tend to want to stay in place.</li>
            <li> Just keep in mind that it&#x27;s very heavy</li>
            <li> This item arrived broken and unfortunately is not worth the hassle or shipping to try to return it.</li>
            <li> I have had a hard time keeping it in my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to stay in the hair, and mine didn&#x27;t look anything like the picture.</li>
            <li> Would not purchase again - too hard to put into bun or thicker hair</li>
            <li> They had prices that are hard to beat.</li>
            <li> And it already broken into 3 pieces while i opened the little bag.</li>
            <li> I did not even get to at least wear it once.</li>
            <li> and I wear it at least once a week</li>
            <li> Such a disappointment.</li>
            <li> least $10.00 &amp; up.  </li>
            <li> If you have thin hair, this might be to heavy for your hair.</li>
            <li> The shipping was a bit slow, but coming from out of state I guess it takes a bit.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> so if your hair isn’t too thick I could see how this might not be ideal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This holds any body who has thick hair</li>
            <li> So if you have thick hair this will snag and tear your hair</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s if you can even get it in your hair with the teeth being so thick.</li>
            <li> This is too heavy for my thin hair.</li>
            <li> Not made for thin hair, bulky and heavy.</li>
            <li> Not only did it take a month to get here, I got the wrong one too ! ..</li>
            <li> I mean the flowers seperated from the comb.</li>
            <li> and I really have nothing bad to say!</li>
            <li> If you want the item bad enough, you&#x27;ll wait for it.</li>
            <li> The item arrived late and broken.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not good buisness practice.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that it did not last.</li>
            <li> Big Disappointment!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that it wasn&#x27;t blue</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought it few months ago, but I don&#x27;t receive it even now !!!</li>
            <li> Arrived broken in pieces broken not fixable, I rate this item at a 0 star rating based on the condition the hair clip arrived in</li>
            <li> The flowers arrived broken off of the comb.  </li>
            <li> is one of the worse thing I ever buy it..</li>
            <li> it was broken when it arrives.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with the product.</li>
            <li> it was broken when I receivef it</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get it with thin hair or thick-thick</li>
            <li> When I received it, it was broken.  </li>
            <li> I did receive it broken</li>
            <li> Mine wasn&#x27;t broken when it got here.</li>
            <li> but the comb was completely broken off of flowers.  </li>
            <li> It was broken when I opened the package</li>
            <li> the way it was packaged looked like they knew they were sending a broken one.</li>
            <li> However, the quality of this hair clip was so poor and it was broken in no time.</li>
            <li> Arrived broken.  </li>
            <li> came broken.</li>
            <li> it was broken when I recieved it, was promised another never came</li>
            <li> I received this item broken in two pieces and the stones falling out.</li>
            <li> Not happy with the product</li>
            <li> I received this item broken in two pieces and the stones falling out.  </li>
            <li> hold well tucked into the base of a bun or a french twist.</li>
            <li> It came in the mail broken.</li>
            <li> so it stays If your hair is thin</li>
            <li> It looked like it was broken before i got it and held together with wire.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous!</li>
            <li> seriously, how can you go wrong at this price?&lt;br</li>
            <li> The color is very subtle, so it will work with lots of colors.  </li>
            <li> so can be difficult to keep in place unless you have very thick hair</li>
            <li> The bad news is, they are ugly and the teeth are so wide and dull on the ends that I can&#x27;t imagine they would hold hair well.  </li>
            <li> U&#x27;d be only disappointed!</li>
            <li> I was really unhappy that it came broken.</li>
            <li> Frustrating!</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a terrible buy for younger girls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say, for people with thin/fine hair this would work.</li>
            <li> sorry</li>
            <li> the material is something weird.  </li>
            <li> It is nicely flashy and appears well made.</li>
            <li> sadly the item don&#x27;t doesn&#x27;t look anything like in the picture</li>
            <li> Not too ornate and can be casual or dressy.  </li>
            <li> You could wear for dress or casual.</li>
            <li> So very poorly made.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.</li>
            <li> A piece of it came broken :(</li>
            <li> It kept wilting down from my bun, which was very annoying.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what possessed me to buy this as I am terrible at &amp;#34;doing&amp;#34; my hair.  </li>
            <li> I was wrong!</li>
            <li> a while to get but, again, how can you go wrong at this price?&lt;br /&gt;love it!</li>
            <li> Looks nothing like picture, hard to stay in my hair:( Can&#x27;t wear it, yanks at my hair !!!!</li>
            <li> They sent me a stupid and crappy looking necklace with a cheesy camera charm on it.  </li>
            <li> I was feeling very sad:</li>
            <li> The item is badly designed.</li>
            <li> Bad</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about bad hair day</li>
            <li> I never got to wear it.  :(</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even wear it. :(</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> and it broke off the pin. :(</li>
            <li> Now, I am disappointed..</li>
            <li> A load of crap don&#x27;t bother</li>

            <li> It came fairly soon and is pretty.</li>
            <li> it was pretty but the stems were to long for my hair. The picture shows they are long but I didn&#x27;t think it would be a problem. It was exactly what was advertized</li>
            <li> To heavy to stay in your hair</li>
            <li> Not the very same as the picture</li>
            <li> I bought this item to wear in my wedding as,want hair up in a bun with curls around my face. This item looked like the perfect accessory. Ordered it and waited and waited. After two and a,half weeks it finally arrived. Yes,since it coming all the way from China you do have to give it some time to arrive. Was exactly like in the picture when opened it up. Very shiny,pretty,and relieved it is made of metal and not plastic. Should hold up well and after my wedding would be more than happy to wear it out when go different places. Just note: If buying it for a,wedding or event make sure order it three to four weeks before the planned event. It barely arrived for my wedding,but so glad it did.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how much more dressy a bun looks when you add this piece to it!  This is a new staple for evenings out.</li>
            <li> I love this clip! It looks so pretty in my hair! It&#x27;s exactly what I ordered and showed up pretty fast! Very happy! I would definitely order from tho company again! An may even order more of the clips!!</li>
            <li> I love sparkly things, and these hair combs are very pretty.  Large enough for all kinds of uses, but the ARE pronged combs and will need to be carefully placed.</li>
            <li> Even more beautiful in real life. More sparkly. Looks very elegant or just to use to the mall. Thank You!</li>
            <li> This hair clip features various shades of purple and clear crystals.  It is very cute, and stays in my hair very well.  An excellent value for the price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sad! I was really looking forward to show off this pretty hair clip, but oh! what a surprise! The comb came unattached from the decoration! I was foolishly hoping that because it was made out of metal it would be sturdy but unfortunaly it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It was very pretty but broke after my first time of using it, not sturdy enough on the hair comb its attached to or was lol</li>
            <li> Shipped very quickly and I received it before the estimated date. There is a lot more purple and lavender in this comb than the picture shows but I just liked it even more.</li>
            <li> Arrived broken in pieces broken not fixable, I rate this item at a 0 star rating based on the condition the hair clip arrived in</li>
            <li> This is very pretty comb. The only thing I can say is that it would be nice to have different colors and styles.&lt;br /&gt;Shipment came earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> I loved it and was very cute., but when they did not pack it well and came broken. would recommend that the next trip will send in a box for that so it does not break by this all went well thanks</li>
            <li> The product is so pretty and I can&#x27;t wait to were it and it seems to be a good quality.</li>
            <li> Beautiful but missing a few stones. This is very heavy, but looks very pretty in a woman or girl&#x27;s hair. I put my hair up in a bun and then put this underneath the bun, and I also put my hair into a French roll and put this clip so that it is right next to the French roll, so not up or down, but beside. If you have thin hair, this might be to heavy for your hair.</li>
            <li> Really nice. Durable.</li>
            <li> Very pretty. The teeth are jagged so it would pull out my hair when I tried to take it out. Also, the teeth broke away from the gemmed part so it&#x27;s pretty much useless now. I did get a lot of compliments the handful of times I used it</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t stay in your hair</li>
            <li> Decently made.  Can break if dropped repeatedly, but generally durable enough for its intended purpose.</li>
            <li> The design of the clip is just stunning. I was disappointed that it did not last. The design and the crystals are heavy while the actual clips is made of a thin metal. Not strong enough to supper the clip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not left with two pieces that do not work.</li>
            <li> Larger than I guess I expected. VERY sparkly. Pinks, purples, clear &amp; iridescent crystals. The tines bend kinda easily, but totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> VERY CUTE THIS ACCESSORY FOR HAIR .... LIKE ME FOR MY hair look SPECTACULAR IN ANY MODERN AND SOCIAL EVENT ..</li>
            <li> it went well with my dress. they loved it</li>
            <li> Item arrived early but broken. It is pretty though. I just wish I could wear it. Get what you pay for I suppose.</li>
            <li> This is very pretty, it looks so nice, but if you have fine hair I would not recommend this because I do not think it would stay in place, it is heavy.</li>
            <li> This hair piece is beautiful and looks great in my hair. But the second time I wore it in my hair, it broke off the prongs that hold it in my hair. But I glued it to a better clip and wear it a lot.</li>
            <li> This hair clip is very pretty but I have fine hair and this is very heavy. It will not stay in my hair. If you have thick hair it may be better.</li>
            <li> I purchased this since I wear my hair up every day in the summer.  I have received lots of compliments on it.  Very happy with my purchase and it came in the mail faster than I had expected!</li>
            <li> Not too ornate and can be casual or dressy.  I like the comb aspect of this hair jewelry.  The comb does not pull my hair.</li>
            <li> I liked this one it was really pretty but the teeth on it broke.</li>
            <li> Broke on first wear :(</li>
            <li> This hair comb is made of a sturdy plastic and has kind of cheesy looking costume jewelry gems in it. But, for the price it is nice. I had to file down some loose plastic bits on the comb pieces because they kept catching on my hair instead of sliding in smoothly. But, once done, it fits very nicely. Good for the price. And, even coming from China, only took 2 weeks at most. Bravo there!</li>
            <li> Pretty,  but the flowers were separated from the comb.  I never got to wear it.  :(</li>
            <li> The flowers arrived broken off of the comb.  I&#x27;m going to try to salvage it by attaching the flowers to another barrette I have.</li>
            <li> USE THIS AS A  WEAPON.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed. The product didn&#x27;t get here in good conditions. It was Brocken and like da other reviews say it&#x27;s heavy so it slides down your hair _-_ not cool......</li>
            <li> SO CUTE!!!!!!!!! I LOVE IT AND AM LOOKING FORWARD TO WEARING IT ON SPECIAL OCCASIONS!!! THANK-YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS ITEM!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought it September 9th and recieved it November 22th!!! And it already broken into 3 pieces while i opened the little bag. This is unacceptable because from how it broke, I can easily tell the quality wont support it in one piece at all. Its very soft and fragile. It can break by a baby, easily.</li>
            <li> I really like this and plan to wear with a bun style BUT its a little heavy and and the teeth are large, my hair is thinner and does not hold things well. So that&#x27;s my flaws. All the little crystals were intact and it arrived after about a month.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty and very heavy, It came broken. Bummer, I was waiting for this and now I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> Beautiful Jewelry Flowers Crystal Hair Clips - for hair clip Beauty Tools is very good, thanks you for the good bissunes</li>
            <li> Love this! It us beautiful and will make an awesome gift for a family member. I wish I got more.</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t super fast at getting it to me, but everything came in one piece! And its also a  little cheap looking.</li>
            <li> Beautiful but the flowers came off after one use, by an adult not a child so there wasn&#x27;t any misuse.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pretty. exactly what I needed. It takes a long time to arrive since it comes from China, but the wait is worth it :)</li>
            <li> Broke when we handled it to place in hair, pretty but very fragile.  Would not recommend even with low price</li>
            <li> love it stayed in and beautiful</li>
            <li> ok first they send me two pieces. and the picture looks like one. second the crystal came apart for the clip. third is so heavy to used this is one of the worse thing I ever buy it..</li>
            <li> I took off 1 star because it arrived with a jewel missing and another star got taken off because one of the little pins broke off after my first use. It doesn&#x27;t really look like the picture either but it&#x27;s okay for the price I guess.</li>
            <li> I wear it for a gethogether and everybody like it! I received So many compliments! I love it so much!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect anything too glamerous considereing the price, but it came in two pieces.  The prongs and the flower design were seperate, which defeats the purpose of putting it my hair.  Also, in the picture the flowers are purple, though the product itself was pink.</li>
            <li> Pretty, colorful, great deal!  Very heavy I may add.  The stones shine bright and colorful in the sunlight.  Go for it!</li>
            <li> It is pretty and functional and with the low price you can&#x27;t go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it ti decorate my hair hen I have a bun in it and it stays put and I didn&#x27;t feel like I had to keep redoing it.</li>
            <li> These crystal flowers are beautiful! I should have gotten another one!</li>
            <li> It held up well but the comb things are a little long if you can only make a small bun.</li>
            <li> This hair clip is beautiful and the price is unbeatable. I&#x27;d recommend this hair clip for a beautiful finishing touch on any bun or up-do.</li>
            <li> Very Nice, was suprised it was the size I expected after the earrings I received.  Should be a nice piece to wear.</li>
            <li> It holds really well in messy curls. I crimmed my hair and just put it in, and it stayed for over an hour with no other clips. Love it!</li>
            <li> so nice came just how the picture looked very happy with my purchase!&lt;br /&gt;so pretty all gems where on the item like advertised</li>
            <li> Okay, this is not a clip. It&#x27;s a comb that you put into your hair. It&#x27;s very beautiful and sparkley. It&#x27;s durable and stays in very well. I love it!</li>
            <li> I received this item right on time. The stones are beautiful and the clip looks great in the hair. I would purchase another in a different color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what possessed me to buy this as I am terrible at &amp;#34;doing&amp;#34; my hair.  That said, it is really pretty and relatively subtle.</li>
            <li> 10 score.  Beautiful.  Cons could be ..... Zero.  Pros everything.  Could take time to get uses to the screw design on the stick arms part instead of an smooth silky arm fell that might slip out</li>
            <li> Just received the item today.  Very quick delivery, within the week.  However, that is as far as it goes. Item described as crystal, but it&#x27;s not.  The supposed crystals are some cheap plastic pieces haphazardly thrown together - all crooked with dried clear glue all over the place, as if it was put together by a two year old.  I would give a zero star, if I could.&lt;br /&gt;There are multiple vendors listed for this item.  I purchased mine from Unlimited Diffusion - shipped from Hong Kong, if that make any difference.</li>
            <li> I liked it, but it broke on the first day of wearing it. I have to glue it back together.</li>
            <li> It looks pretty, but too heavy, it pulls the hair hard and not comfortable to wear it, unless you have very thick hair and are not concerned with hair loss or headache.</li>
            <li> This hair clip is just as pretty as it is in the picture and it is also heavy. the trick to putting this on and making it stay a little more put is to comb it as if you&#x27;re going to put it on backwards and the flip it forward. Hopefully the rocks in it don&#x27;t fall out easily like in many hair cheaper accessories.</li>
            <li> pretty! havent wore it yet,but i will &#x3D;) need a certain outfit &amp; nicer weather, it can be worn w?anything,but its on the pretty side. (for me)</li>
            <li> loved this so much.came so quick i would recommend this to all i know&lt;br /&gt;loved this so much.came so quick i would recommend this to all i know</li>
            <li> Very pretty crystals, appears to be plastic - not sure how well it will hold up.  Again, the crystals are very pretty.</li>
            <li> The item is badly designed. I often use comb clips. This one is too heavy and slips right off. I do not recommend buying this item.</li>
            <li> Not very well made. I&#x27;m glad it was cheap. This will be tossed in the trash without being used. Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty comb. Only buy it if you have reasonably thick hair as it is quite heavy.</li>
            <li> I tossed them in the garbage.  The rhinestones were missing all over the pieces and the package when delivered looked like it had been through a war.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Like gumball machine quality.</li>
            <li> The hair pin is really pretty. I have had a hard time keeping it in my hair. It just slide&#x27;s out and bobby pin&#x27;s don&#x27;t keep it in either. It is just me. It&#x27;s pretty though</li>
            <li> It looked so pretty and the price was so low, i couldn&#x27;t resist. I tried it on and it was too heavy. It&#x27;s made out of metal and my hair couldn&#x27;t hold the weight of this hair clip. It kept sliding off. It&#x27;s pretty...shame i can&#x27;t really wear it...</li>
            <li> I am really happy with the product. I have very long hair so I always put my hair in a bun. This holds it securely and very nicely.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hair clip and have ordered an extra one just in case something should happen to the first one. The picture does not do it justice, and the color is much more beautiful in person! I would definitely recommend this hair clip to friends and family.</li>
            <li> Like this, good quality and beautiful color. And does not drop off hair. Very shiny! With this price it&#x27;s reasonable.</li>
            <li> This arrived on time and is very beautiful. I&#x27;m so happy I ordered it for my granddaughter to wear in her next pagent.</li>
            <li> I Bought this clip for my daughter, its really pretty with a hair bun. It looks great worn casually or to dress up</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty but it broke so easily I was trying to use  but  I couldn&#x27;t wear it, it broke apart.</li>
            <li> The item arrived late and broken. I&#x27;ve contacted the seller and they&#x27;re sending me a new one, but we&#x27;ll see if this one even arrives in one piece and how long it holds up if it does. I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because it is beautiful. If it were in one piece I&#x27;d love to wear it, and it&#x27;s perfect for special occasions because it&#x27;s so sparkly. Just wish it were sturier.</li>
            <li> So pretty.  I think it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> This was made so nicely for the price. It&#x27;s a must have if you like to just look pretty. Buy it</li>
            <li> It is not as shown in picture. I ordered the one with white crystals and when I got it, it had some pink crystals. Major thing is it was broken. I would not suggest this product to anyone. Since it is broken..it does not serve the purpose.</li>
            <li> Only one thing to say, it took forever to come and when I received it came broken. I was really unhappy that it came broken. I never got to even use it. The flowers were nicely made and the colors resemble those of the picture. However, the flower clip is a bit heavy to even put it in your hair. I thought it was made of a lighter material.</li>
            <li> Much better than in the pic... love this! It&#x27;s a comb-type clip and looks more expensive than it is. Would def buy again!</li>
            <li> it was broken when it arrives. It looks cheap. I would not recomend it to anyone else. do not buy it.</li>
            <li> I have had nothing but problems with this order, first I did not receive it for christmas,  Then when they sent me out another one (which was nice of them) when I got it, it was broken.</li>
            <li> Arrived much quickly then expected.Look&#x27;s lovely on hair . My daughter has wore it several times and the rhinestone still in place, also it holds very well.</li>
            <li> this was very pretty. sparkly. first time I tried to use it tho, on New Year&#x27;s Eve, it separated from the comb. Was able to glue it back, but haven&#x27;t used it since</li>
            <li> Great looking clip I purchased for a fun and free friend.  Two of the stones had fallen out and were inside the bag at time of receipt, so keep this in mind when you purchase.  The design is beautiful, sparkly!</li>
            <li> Quality is okey, pretty enough, but few stone missing even not really obvious anyway. Need stronger glue to stick the stones on.</li>
            <li> VERY NICE PIECE,  I LIKE THE WAY IT FITS.  I DID NOT GET THE PEACOCK PIECE ,,  BUTI WOULD LIKE TO HAVE GET IT.</li>
            <li> I bought this to add some flair to a high pony tail and even though I have long thin fine hair it works well for that.</li>
            <li> Although it arrived with a broken tine, it was not cost effective to return it, so I improvised and wear it proudly! The packaging could have been better, all in all it is a very lovely piece!</li>
            <li> for the price was great, very pretty item, will be great for what I intended to do with it  great  deal</li>
            <li> Opened the package and the rhinestone piece broke immediately off.  So very poorly made. I was not happy with the product.</li>
            <li> This accessory is super cute but very heavy for fine hair like mine if you have thick hair it might just work perfectly on yours.</li>
            <li> Great piece for the health care field when your hair always has to be up. Takes hair from blan to elegant.</li>
            <li> Awesome product STRONG and sturdy, excellent material used.  Eye turning, glittering and  exceptionally  BEAUTIFUL product -  I have already ordered FIVE more for friends and family.</li>
            <li> This Hair Pin is gorgeous! I did not realize that when I was ordering it, that I was ordering from China, but... If you want the item bad enough, you&#x27;ll wait for it. It crowns the head well, in the front, if you wear your hair up, say, in a Ponytail or in a Banana Clip, as I do, and if you stick it through your Bangs going downward toward the face, it kind of looks like a small Tiara.  Looks great elsewhere in the hair too. It is about 17-20+ days&#x27; wait for it, depending on where you live. I&#x27;m in NY. I figured some of you would like to know that little bit of information. If you like this Hairpin or others you see here on Amazon.com, don&#x27;t hesitate to order it, even if it comes from China or Japan. Just plan well, the event you want it for. For example, if you are a Junior or Senior this year, and you have that special Dinner Dance, or Prom, I would consider ordering it NOW so you&#x27;ll definitely have it in time. Hope that helps all age ranges. This WILL get you compliments ladies! I am pleased with both product and Seller. I would definitely order from this Seller again.</li>
            <li> Love it got it in blue and they are so nice and the price is great</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even get it, it said it would be delivered august 13 never got it. Waist of money I strongly don&#x27;t recommend getting it!!!!!! :(</li>
            <li> This is a very cute comb for the price, but it broke within 3 times of wearing it. Frustrating! I am glad that I didn&#x27;t spend more on it.</li>
            <li> Much too heavy.  You have to have thick hair and not get headaches easily to use this!</li>
            <li> this is beautiful and should be bought for someone with a lot of long thick hair for it to hold the hair in</li>
            <li> I ordered it for my wedding but it came 3 weeks after the wedding~ Make sure to order the hair clip at least 3 months before.</li>
            <li> Sorry but I threw it away it was broken when I receivef it and it would have cost more to return it</li>
            <li> These hair clips are absolutely amazing! The quality is also great, probably better then the stuff they sell at mall kiosks for $40!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> This is very heavy. It&#x27;s hard to stay in the hair, and mine didn&#x27;t look anything like the picture. The colors were completely different.</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty comb, and I think as a comb this pretty that has free shipping AND is less than 2 bucks deserves a 5 star rating.  The colors in it are very nice, and in the light it can really sparkle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I do like it, but feel it might be closer to a four star rating for a few reasons.  1.  The picture makes it look a lot larger than it really is.  I have very thick hair.  The person modeling must have a small head and thin hair because this comb does not take up that much space on my head.  2.  It feels flimsy.  My hair needs its clips and things to be STURDY.  I can still use this, but not alone unless it can only hold half my hair.  3.  One of the gems was off when I received it.  You can&#x27;t tell right away, and I may go to the craft store one day and replace some of them with different colors.  That&#x27;s something I don&#x27;t mind, and I like customizing things.  4.  The colors are different than what is pictured.  I thought the thing was solid silver at first because the gems are fairly pale.  Still pretty and sparkly, however.  &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would still recommend getting this.  It&#x27;s pretty, and it would work great if your hair wasn&#x27;t too thick.  Don&#x27;t get it with thin hair or thick-thick hair(those of you that regularly snap hair band know who you are!).  Shipping was a little timely, but it was shipped almost immediately after payment.  It just takes a while to get to America.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you to the seller!  I&#x27;m enjoying it!</li>
            <li> Because looks Different .&lt;br /&gt;I like the style and the colors in the top.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product a 100%.</li>
            <li> Nice clip for your money a little heavy but good quality. Good for thick hair but not for thin hair</li>
            <li> Great product for the price, you just have to wait as the shipping does take 3 to 4 weeks to receive but its beautiful and I always get compliments on it.</li>
            <li> It is much larger than it looks in the picture, and is really sturdy. It is really pretty. The colors match exactly.</li>
            <li> very pretty and a great gift for my daughters who both have very long thick hair and have to pull it up for orchestra concerts. This product looks and works great. It was so worth what I payed for it.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and very sturdy I can&#x27;t wait to wear it!</li>
            <li> Delivery, on time. Hair clip, better then I expected. Anyone with hair that you can put up in a bun, would just fit perfect. Would buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> This looks super pretty and big on the picture, but it&#x27;s actually cheaper looking in person and seems a bit smaller. It isn&#x27;t a terrible buy for younger girls. Not so much for a woman.</li>
            <li> Not only did it take a month to get here, I got the wrong one too ! ..very disappointed smh</li>
            <li> The design looks great, however the quality is really bad.  When I received it, it was broken.  I even haven&#x27;t used once.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> OK. At first I did not like these after I purchased them. The color looked white on the screen, but now you can see that there is some purple color added, which does give it a bit of elegance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are large. OK? Large. So, I bought 2 to use with a French Twist. I really think one can get buy just one, with that style. At any rate, I am glad I purchased two, just in case I lose one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, five stars for me. BTW, they are made of some metal like material. Not sure what. But, this makes them more solid than the types of barrettes we are accustomed to. It feels like one could break off a part of the pin of the barrette, but who knows. I will take  good care of them. I enjoy them, will keep them, and give them five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the beautiful large pieces of hair jewelry!!</li>
            <li> Its beautiful. It is heavy but i can wear it with my hair up like i planned to anyway. I did receive it broken but everyone has to realize stuff happens in ups delivery. I contacted the seller and git above and beyond customer service. Thanks</li>
            <li> So gorgeuos and pretty!I don&#x27;t know why it is sooo cheap.Hope it wasn&#x27;t made in a sweat shop by kids.</li>
            <li> Very happy with these combs. I have been looking for a long time for something pretty for my hair without being over the top. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> One cannot expect more from this price,this quality looks good and it came within its delivery time,it&#x27;s little heavy but when I use it in my hair it looks great.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying, its not the best quality. Having said that, it was still a very nice product. It has more of a purple tint to it. Kind of multi colored irradecent. I paid $3 and received it in about 3 weeks from China. It is fairly heavy and nice looking.</li>
            <li> This is a comb accessory, it is very elegant and you could use it in different hairstyes. I was surprised it was metal! Which is great because it wont break easily. Like it a lot!</li>
            <li> Beautiful as I expected to be. I always want it to have one of it. Looks very elegant. Make any bun pretty.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair clip for myself and love it.It holds on my hair very well I plan to order another one</li>
            <li> Very pretty clip. Very heavy. The first time I wore it i bent over and it slid out of my hair and hit the floor and broke. Just need to get it in hair good.</li>
            <li> Broke the first time putting in my hair.  Didn&#x27;t even wear it. :( not worth the 2 dollars spent sorry</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sparkly and pretty but the prongs don&#x27;t feel very strong as I have really thick hair.  Love the pinks and pastels, it&#x27;s very nice.</li>
            <li> The product is plastic. In addition, it finally arrived today, broken. I waited for this product for almost two months. What a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> It is beautiful, it is better if you have lots of hair because it does not stay on easily it is metal.</li>
            <li> Beautiful but broken when I received it. It was in two pieces when I pulled it from the envelop. One stone was floating around in the bottom of the clear sleeve that it came in.</li>
            <li> Way to heavy. cant use it!. I tried this in other friends hair. its still to heavy. I wish I didn&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li> Very pretty, but also heavier than expected. It is usable, but I needed a clip or ponytail to help it stay in my hair.</li>
            <li> Very pretty, nice sparkle, perfect for proms, weddings, formal events.  I would recommend it and would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I buy a lot of cheap jewelry but this hair clip comb thing is really cheap not sure if I will even ever use it. It is also a lot more pink then I was expecting. I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Never been much for pretty things on my hair, just wash, and  blow dry. When I saw these I didn&#x27;t get one but two. When the got here they looked even better then the seller showed or could of shown. Not sure if I want to ware them for fear of losing them. The shipping was a bit slow, but coming from out of state I guess it takes a bit. But I love them</li>
            <li> I foolishly ordered this without looking at all the photographs. The description calls it a clip. Bear it mind that it&#x27;s actually a hair comb. I still give it 5 stars because it is absolutely gorgeous. It looks much more expensive than it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that is comb is best for people with thick or curly hair. It was too heavy for my straight hair &amp; kept falling out.</li>
            <li> The title says it all! Absolutely beautiful! Marvelous! Lovely! I still don&#x27;t believe the price I got this at! Although the title of this product says &amp;#34;hair clip&amp;#34; it is truly a &amp;#34;hair comb&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s very elegant. It looks EXACTLY like the picture! No...it looks EVEN BETTER! This accessory has the most beautiful shades of purple. Its very very sparkly too. I got it in the mail intact, no damage, anything missing or fell apart. I was just happy and captivated by its beauty. Though I would say when I put this in my hair, it was a tad bit heavy but it was pretty and still stayed on my hair. I&#x27;m sorry to say, for people with thin/fine hair this would work. I&#x27;m in love with this hair comb, this would be wonderful for a wedding. I would definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful hair comb.  Can&#x27;t find quality like this in any stores near me.  I highly recommend checking these out.</li>
            <li> It dosent look like the one in the picture at all, it is colorful and too different. Not recommending. Bad</li>
            <li> Beautiful and classy. Cant wait to add it to a veil ensemble.</li>
            <li> I lucked out! Mine wasn&#x27;t broken when it got here. I wouldn&#x27;t even care if it was, I&#x27;d try to fix it. It looks stunning in person, I haven&#x27;t had an issue with it getting stuck in my hair yet. Excited to use it some more! I know it&#x27;ll probably tarnish, so I&#x27;ll enjoy it while it lasts. Also, I can understand how other people&#x27;s might have broken; my package wasn&#x27;t padded very well. As I said, I lucked out.</li>
            <li> These clips are absolutely beautiful! I bought them for my young daughters who agreed. They are sparkly and pretty heavy. It took almost 3 mos to receive them but they were worth the wait. The price is not bad either. I will be ordering 2 more.</li>
            <li> The gem part is very pretty, but the tines are really thick and I can&#x27;t get it into my hair easily.</li>
            <li> These are beautiful hair combs sturdy and heavy need a lot of hair. I would purchase these again, they do take forever to come.</li>
            <li> this so much prettier in person, the pictures do not do it justice. I love it. wear it all the time now</li>
            <li> Beautiful, look just like in picture but little heavy for my hair, it kept falling out of my hair. Wish I was plastic.</li>
            <li> My niece will love it!</li>
            <li> I guess for the price is okay. Look like little girl jewerly plus is pink stone. If I knew was pink will never get it crystal white color is the one I want</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy wit my purchase. It has a good size, enough to hold thick hair. perfect for buns and twist. Very classy, perfect for any occasion.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice and elegant brooch.  I love it.  I got a lot of complements.  Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BLANCA MARQUEZ</li>
            <li> I cannot use these because my hair is fine &amp; will not hold in my hair.  They are way too heavy  for me to use.&lt;br /&gt;More money lost I guess.  You don&#x27;t always know what you are getting when you order on line but I think it&lt;br /&gt;would be decent of the sellers to at least make an exchange.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I thought this looked cute, but it&#x27;s gaudy in person. Would be cute in a child&#x27;s hair. I&#x27;ve bought others like this that I really liked.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s wedding, which hasn&#x27;t happened yet, so I don&#x27;t know if this will work for her hair... but it is very pretty.</li>
            <li> this comb is very pretty, it dose not hold your hair back by itself but a couple bobbi pins will keep your hair back and then the comb looks so pretty. I wish it was make in gold tone as well, maybe it will be soon, I hope.</li>
            <li> Really beautiful hair piece. Got it to wear for xmas and I really have nothing bad to say! It was shipped from Asia so it took some time to get here but it came earlier then expected. Really inexpensive and I got free shipping!</li>
            <li> 3 of 4 were bought for Christmas and one for my daughter. The one for my daughter didn&#x27;t last a day broken in 2 pieces. I haven&#x27;t tried to return  because they were bought over a month ago.</li>
            <li> I soon i wear it ,broke ,i recommend to the seller&lt;br /&gt;To use glue that really high tech ,i buy it&lt;br /&gt;Coz its pretty but i really dissappointed</li>
            <li> I ordered this on a whim as an inexpensive add on,  It is pretty but the comb was completely broken off of flowers.  still the price is right and epoxy should fix it.</li>
            <li> I guess its the luck of the draw. Read many good comments about this product. Mine came in the other day and it came broken in two pieces and the ends of the comb were pretty sharp and rough. Such a downer. It IS beautiful, I wish i had at least one chance to use it.</li>
            <li> Easy to break when You try in the HAIR and the sheeping was to later its bad quality. Dont WILL buy again</li>
            <li> This was a wonderful gift, my teenage daughter fell in love with it when she opened it.  Awesome deal for the price</li>
            <li> so inexpensive!  This hair clip/comb is pretty heavy.  I have thick hair so it works but if you have thin hair it will likely fall out.  I like the sparkle and the floral design and the price was really good.  Nice little inexpensive treat!</li>
            <li> A nice decorative comb with long tines for more securing of hair. Everything is sparkly and will sure get attention. Easy to use too.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Exactly what i thought it would be. Elegant. I love it and i&#x27;m excited to wear it. Exactly what i thought it would be. Perfect.</li>
            <li> Broke within a day didn&#x27;t even get to use it. Can be glued back  together but overall this was a mistake purchase for me just a waste of $1 as for seller prompt delivery</li>
            <li> Product broke with 1st usage. Looked nice but flimsy. And by broke I mean the flowers seperated from the comb. Completely!</li>
            <li> Very pretty made with high quality materials, its just too heavy.  Does not hold hair well, slips out of place</li>
            <li> very pretty and it does sparkle in the light . It is very heavy but nice hair comb . Nice</li>
            <li> I am editing this review why? Well because the clip brpke faster than I could type this review do not buy saddly to say but as soon as I went to pick it up and put it in my hair the flowers fell off! Yes fell off I was completely in shock now I have had things break that I have purchase but never this fast this was a all time record! infact it broke faster that nail polish drying (NO LIE)save your money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still giving it three stars because it is beautiful, but the comb was broken when I received it, so I can&#x27;t even wear it.  The whole top part separated from the comb.  I&#x27;m hoping that I can glue it, so I can still try to wear it.</li>
            <li> It was broken when I opened the package and It was a different color. I had to glue it back</li>
            <li> she wears it all the time ,matches almost everything she wears more color variety in this item would be a plus !!!</li>
            <li> Yes, delivery is slow – but the range they provided was accurate and it came early than expected considering that I live in NYC and this was shipped from Hong Kong. With this being only $1.90 and FREE SHIPPING, I decided that despite the polarizing (and mostly negative) reviews on Amazon I would go for it because I like to do simple side fishtail braids or a big top knot on days where I need a fun, stylish, yet simple no-fuss hairstyle for going to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This came well-packaged in a small, yellow manila envelope with bubble packaging inside. Thankfully it all came in one piece (unlike some of the folks who have reviewed), no stones were loose or missing and it looks surprisingly sturdy and durable. It really is very pretty and will jazz up a simple hairstyle by just popping it in and adding some bling! I do have really long, thick, curly/wavy hair so if your hair isn’t too thick I could see how this might not be ideal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m also not using it to actually keep my hair in place, I’m using it only as a decorative piece and for $1.90 it well exceeded my expectations. I would definitely purchase from this seller again. My only con is that I wish it came in more colors! :)</li>
            <li> If it is like the other two that I have received then I am sure that I will love it, as the other&#x27;s I have thus far as absolutely beautiful.</li>
            <li> This item arrived broken and unfortunately is not worth the hassle or shipping to try to return it. It looks pretty but is not made well. Just a pure waste of money. One of several items from Amazon I was not happy with this season even though I am usually a full fan of the retailer. They need to begin to be a bit more careful about their merchants.</li>
            <li> Have not had a chance to use this yet.  Plan on using it when putting up my hair in a French twist.  Seems to be a well made piece.</li>
            <li> prettier than the pic and well made :)</li>
            <li> Beautiful, durable and sturdy. Bought this for my 7 year old for Christmas as a stocking stuffier thinking it was probably just a small plastic clip.. I was wrong! It is not plastic and its bigger than I thought..hope it will fit in her hair... I know she will love it all the same. Definitely a recommended buy.</li>
            <li> Great Christmas present  Picture does not do it justice  It is absolutely lovely Shipped from Hong Kong  took a while  but item made it just in time for Christmas  Thanks</li>
            <li> Its nice for the price. You can tell its a little cheap hair piece from china but its cute and unlike the other reviews, my comb did not break during delivery or once i opened the package. I can tell the jewelry part is glued on to the comb but it still one piece for now.</li>
            <li> I received this beautiful hair clip and was very surprized how beautiful it was.  Considering what I paid for it I was pleasantly surprized how nice it was.  It took a lot longer for me to get it but I&#x27;m happy that I ordered it.</li>
            <li> the crystals fell off right away and had to throw it away.  No good very cheap quality should buy this in person next time</li>
            <li> It is cute, the quality I had expected also. The only thing I was not prepared for as I didn&#x27;t pay attention was that it would take so long to get to me.</li>
            <li> This is prettier than it appears but very heavy if you have less hear, need very thick hair, It is also very sharp at the ends</li>
            <li> I Just wish I think of this before my life now is wait easy I don&#x27;t have to worry about bad hair day</li>
            <li> Cute and sturdy hairclip, that can be wear for parties or may be everyday. It makes to look ur hair to look solemn and party-looking.&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> Falls right out of your hair, pretty useless, but looks good if you can get it to stay in your hair.</li>
            <li> This holds any body who has thick hair</li>
            <li> Pretty and feels heavy, giving it that sterling silver quality feel.  So sparkly and all the rhinestones are perfectly intact and seems like it&#x27;s put together very well.  Can&#x27;t wait to wear it.  Will follow up if anything happens.</li>
            <li> Looks as described. Good purchase.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t like this because the comb part was plastic, so it did not stay in my hair.  It kept wilting down from my bun, which was very annoying.</li>
            <li> This hair clip is beautiful. The picture doesn&#x27;t do it justice. It is bigger than I expected, but is perfect when you pull up your hair.</li>
            <li> received the hair clips took a while but ordered four they are nice but one of them came broken. which is messed up. the way it was packaged looked like they knew they were sending a broken one. three packages were pakaged loose and the fouth was closed up tight around the comb.so how could they not know!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> When arrived was so happy very pretty; but first time I wore it came apart had to use super glue to keep together.</li>
            <li> This arrived quickly and had been wrapped with care. The crystals and metal frame are more lovely then the picture shows. Could go easily to anything from Church to a formal event and look like you paid 100x the price.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy.</li>
            <li> Great item and surprised with the good quality.  Grand daughter loved it.</li>
            <li> Is a preatty hair clip a little bigger than i expected for me that i have fine little hair but still recommended it.</li>
            <li> I love the hair piece.  It is absolutely gorgeous and got here in record time.  I had to loan it to my daughter for her to wear for her dance at school and she loved it to.  Thanks again.</li>
            <li> if it was not broken within one hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair clip was for my 9-yr old daughter&#x27;s recital. She was thrilled when we first opened the package. However, the quality of this hair clip was so poor and it was broken in no time. Big Disappointment!</li>
            <li> I got this very quickly and at a price I couldn&#x27;t believe.  It was just as pretty as the picture, but within days it broke and I had to glue it.  I didn&#x27;t mind because I got it for a song, however, anyone who orders should know this is truly just a piece of jewelry that is not made for heavy use. My daughter hadn&#x27;t even worn it when it broke.  They did give quick service and free shipping and it made a beautiful stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li> It  is horrible.  First of all it took more than 3 weeks to get it and by the time I received it beads had fallen off.  We could not even use it once.</li>
            <li> The picture on the computer does it no justice! this comb is beautiful! I was expecting plastic but it is metal! Well worth the $1.80 I spent on it!</li>
            <li> very good product is just what I expected for the price we paid, satisfied with the purchase, and would recommend to buy!</li>
            <li> very much worth the money. The only problem is it took almost two months to get it.  That did not make me to happy.</li>
            <li> This hair comb is beautiful, but I received it with the decal detached from the comb part. Very pretty, but it&#x27;s unusable. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> This hair clip is super cute and made of nice materials, it does not snag or damage hair at all</li>
            <li> These will be perfect for dressy evening up-dos.  The color is very subtle, so it will work with lots of colors.  Excellent, fast service.</li>
            <li> Like it very much, Will be buying another one</li>
            <li> Would not purchase again - too hard to put into bun or thicker hair</li>
            <li> I tried it couple of time at home.before i use it for the ocassion it broke.</li>
            <li> Very pretty, but it hurts to use this, the comb part not properly made, it has metal meshy stuff poking out of it, and every time I put this in my hair it hurt and is even more painful when I take it off, it always ruins my hairstyle. Otherwise it&#x27;s a very pretty decoration.</li>
            <li> I like it it was more then what i expected thank you for the good services and i like to give 5 stares</li>
            <li> This was very inexpensive but made very well. Not cheap prongs are strong. I would buy again FOR ME AND AS GIFTS.</li>
            <li> My weakness for bling got to me, and I ordered these.  The good news is, they were cheap.  The bad news is, they are ugly and the teeth are so wide and dull on the ends that I can&#x27;t imagine they would hold hair well.  I don&#x27;t recommend bothering with them. And they come all the way from China, so they take forever to arrive.</li>
            <li> The design is quiet beautiful and I got a lot of complements for several people as it is very attractive to the eye, and it is perfect for special events or including in a normal day of work, and the material is resistant and will endure longer</li>
            <li> BEAUTIFUL COLOR I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> LOVELY HAIR ACCESSORY</li>
            <li> For the price paid, this is a pretty and sturdy hair pin.It is good quality&lt;br /&gt;I love it and it is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail today, and I am very pleased with how it looks. I have priced pieces in bridal shops similar to this that were completely out of this price range. This is going to be worn with an $800 formal gown that has amethyst highlights, and it will not look out of place. I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> When I open the package the flowers were broken from the main piece...too fragile or not enough glue ...poor quality</li>
            <li> My clip just arrived today. Although it didn&#x27;t come very quickly, I still love it and gave it five stars. It came all in one piece with no diamonds missing and is comfortable in my hair. It is packaged in a little bag and then in bubble wrap to ensure safety. I recommend this to anyone who doesn&#x27;t mind having a slightly heavy clip in there hair.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT, IT&#x27;S A VERY BEAUTIFUL HAIR PIN. HOWEVER THOUGH IT CAME DAMAGED, SO INSTEAD OF HAVING A PAIR I HAVE ONE.</li>
            <li> Great accessory to dress up an outfit or your hair.  Looks just as described and its well made.  Love it! !</li>
            <li> very pretty and feminine  would buy again</li>
            <li> Heavy clip! I&#x27;m not sure why I expected lightweight... but this is a heavy-duty, metal hair clip. Looks great, but you&#x27;ll definitely know it&#x27;s there the entire time you wear it. Would not recommend for fine hair, but it is durable enough for heavy or long hair without having to worry about any breaking or bending!</li>
            <li> It did not hold hair or keep hair in place</li>
            <li> Great value! Lovely pin and very eye catching. It does take a while for delivery.</li>
            <li> arrived just in pieces. sorry</li>
            <li> Very Pritty. Good quility</li>
            <li> Very pretty and sturdy quality for the price.  A bit big &amp; heavy for my thin hair--I have to secure my hair well with a pony tail holder and &amp; be sure to place it so the long tongs don&#x27;t dig into the back of my neck.  (Note, I don&#x27;t think it will hold your hair by itself--it is more designed to be inserted into a self-sustaining style like a bun as a decoration.)  The teeth are textured.  The tips of the teeth are a bit rougher than a similar hair comb I purchased &amp; it seems to catch on my hair while sliding it in, so I have to be very careful putting it in so i don&#x27;t damage my hair. I bought additional ones for gifts, so I will try to update the review after Christmas to see how it worked on thicker hair.  (I think I&#x27;ll stick them in the gift bows!)</li>
            <li> Very, very pretty!  I received several compliments on the hair clip the day I wore it.  However, it is VERY heavy.  I don&#x27;t think this would work well in straight hair.  Mine is thick and curly, and I had to wear it in a ponytail in order to have something to help secure the clip.  One other thing I noticed was that the pointy ends of the clip at the bottom are VERY sharp!  I have two small children, and I would NOT let them touch this thing.  It really is that sharp, so be cautious.</li>
            <li> When I first received this comb I thought it was beautiful, and the jewelry part of it is, but the very first time I put it in my hair, as soon as I pushed it down into my hair, the jewelry part (the flowers), that makes its so pretty, came off. I was VERY disappointed!  I cannot reattach it myself because it is made out of some kind of metal, regular glue, super glue or wood glue clearly just won&#x27;t work! I can tell by looking at the areas where the jewelry piece (the flowers) was attached to the comb, that whoever put it together did not use enough melted metal to securely attach the two pieces together.  I would order another but do not want the same thing to happen.</li>
            <li> Looks nice, stays in my hair.  Great price.</li>
            <li> My daughter-in-law loved these clips. Good value for money.</li>
            <li> They took my money and did not deliver.  A to Z guarantee only gives you a 90-day grace period to file a claim.  Seller has you wait 10 to 12 weeks for product.  If you miss that ONE week and completely forget THREE months later that you placed this order - you know, while you hold a job and take care of your daily life, they will say, &amp;#34;sorry, too bad, it&#x27;s been 90-days and your grace period is up.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;m up to take it up with my credit card company now... I&#x27;m so annoyed about this entire situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TERRIBLE!!</li>
            <li> Arrived broken.  I didn&#x27;t attempt to contact or return because it&#x27;s not worth the hassle.  Had it not been broken, it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> came broken. cheap quality stuff... Its better to ask more and provide customer with a better quality stuff... would not recommend this product</li>
            <li> The clip is very pretty but I don&#x27;t have enough hair to wear it.  I will keep it and may my hair will grow a little longer so I can use it one day.</li>
            <li> I did not receive the jewerly flower&lt;br /&gt;Hair pins yet. All others on my&lt;br /&gt;Order I got. What&#x27; up with that?</li>
            <li> This is exactly as described and is strong enough to hold my long thick hair all day without falling out.</li>
            <li> i buy this beautiful jewelry  but t didn&#x27;t get it .i like amazon i still wiht for you . i bought more thing from amazom i&#x27;ll hope get my shoping</li>
            <li> Great hair piece to accent your hair or what ever you are wearing. Gives your hair a great look with it in your hair. Thanks</li>
            <li> I really liked this comb but it was too heavy for my hair. The teeth are too far apart for my tiny bun or up-dos, so I gave it away to someone who could appreciate its purple crystals and keep it in their thicker hair. You can&#x27;t beat it for the price!</li>
            <li> This clip it light, pretty and gets a lot of attention. Its a little bit different then the picture. In the picture it seems to just be silver gems but mine came with silver, pink and purple gems. Over all worth it.</li>
            <li> I received mine intact and ready to wear. The jewelry is very pretty and I can&#x27;t wait to try it on. Will look great at weddings or formal parties.</li>
            <li> pennies per what they cost, and it arrived and was pink and purple...the picture shows a darker color, but was perfect for my niece.</li>
            <li> Everywhere I go people who see the  hair clip always ask me where I  got it? If its a family piece.? They say it looks like something my great grandma would wear. I love it thank you Amazon 😊</li>
            <li> I loved the sparkle of this but when I put it in my hair I had a really hard time getting it out because the ends of some of the comb were rough and turned backward so they clutched my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this clip because it is really nice.  I should have ordered two.  Can&#x27;t wait to wear with my hair pinned up.</li>
            <li> I love these clips.  I will be ordering more they are comfortable, lightweight and hold hair very well.  These are beautiful enough for a wedding!</li>
            <li> I did not realize this was a hair comb not clip.  Would be perfect for a wedding or formal event.  Very sturdy and again beautiful</li>
            <li> This hair accessary was much nicer than I expected.  It is really Beautiful and has a nice weight to it.  Presently surprised!!</li>
            <li> Pretty but not sturdy</li>
            <li> This clip arrived in good condition. It is very pretty. I bought it for a costume but have decided to wear it regularly. It would be beautiful in a childs hair. Keep in mind it is exactly as the picture shows and fits nicley tucked ina ponytail or bun.</li>
            <li> It broke really fast.  the second time I wore it.  While I have a solder iron that I could have used to fix it... the material is something weird.  I have it in the pile of things to glue.  so maybe after I glue it, I might glue on some reinforcing things and it will be better than new.  However it is beautiful.  Much prettier than the picture.  so once I fix it... it is going to be great.</li>
            <li> I love this clip, but the flowers are too heavy for the base and it broke after I work it only one time :( I tried gluing it but it just broke again. Would like to glue the flowers to a barrette or something, but don&#x27;t think it would stick.</li>
            <li> Pretty, but broke as soon as I took it out of plastic sleeve, bummer after waiting quite awhile, had to go thru customs,</li>
            <li> Perfect and well made.  Beautiful hair comb.  It stays in place well for thick hair and adds that little bling to dress up any outfit.</li>
            <li> i bought this because it looked pretty and it was cheap, delivery was kind of long i guess since its coming from far away. I wore it for like a couple of hours and then it broke, the flower part came from the other part so that was disappointing but its pretty  and it looks good on(for the couple of hours that i was able to) lol now im gonna see if i can glue it back together or something</li>
            <li> Last one I had took awhile to break. Thought I would try again. Broke in my hand while putting in my hair. I can prob glue it back together but I shouldnt have to. Irritated with quality</li>
            <li> looks kinda cheep but stays in well</li>
            <li> It looked pretty enough, but you could tell the metal was cheap.  It broke the first time I put it in my hair.  I do have curly thick hair, but not enough to snap the piece in half when putting it in for the first time.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I think this clip is beautiful and it seems to be sturdy.  So far I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.  It arrived in a timely manner as well.</li>
            <li> It was beautiful when I received it, but no sooner than I had opened it, the teeth fell out of the comb. I didn&#x27;t even get a chance to wear it.</li>
            <li> This was definitely worth the wait from China. It is a nice quality, very sparkly, perfect size. This was a gift for a friend and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Pretty, actually metal, and definitely impressive for the price.  I only had to bend it a little to straighten the tines.  If you can wait a month or 2 for delivery, you should definitely order this item.</li>
            <li> Missing several stones and I have only worn it twice.</li>
            <li> I like the look, but it is a bit too heavy for me. Still very nice.</li>
            <li> was very nice looking but fell apart and didn&#x27;t even get to use it.</li>
            <li> This hair accessory is really pretty and looks exactly like the picture :) I also have had no problems getting it to stay in my hair</li>
            <li> I have bought 3 of these so far! my co workers get me to get them for them. Very high quality but of course since it&#x27;s in china and free shipping it does take a while.</li>
            <li> Looks nothing like picture, hard to stay in my hair:( Can&#x27;t wear it, yanks at my hair !!!! Not trying to lose hair</li>
            <li> The pin is pretty, and not too heavy this time, but the prongs are rather thick and rounded so that they slip out of finer hair too easily.  I find I have to put a few bobby pins into the collection of my gathered hair so there are some wires to &#x27;grab&#x27; at the prongs in order for it to stay in for more than a few minutes before slipping out!</li>
            <li> Seems to be of good quality.  I have finer hair, I think it would work best with thicker, courser hair.  Would be very pretty as a decorative item at the base of a side bun.</li>
            <li> The comb arrived as scheduled and seemed well made, however, the weight of the comb&lt;br /&gt;limits its use to only the thickest of hair, not appropriate for children or people with thinner hair.</li>
            <li> It is the cheapest accessoryI&#x27;ve ever bought in my entire life... Well, I acutally bought it so I can round up purchase to get free shipping. It took forever to receive it and well in the pack the stones were falling off and it looks extremely cheap! If you are buy this hair peice for its style... U&#x27;d be only disappointed!</li>
            <li> This hair pin is beautiful! I am African American with natural hair and it is nice and heavy and stays well in my buns and puffs!</li>
            <li> This hairclip is so cheap yet makes beautiful and elegant the most ugly hairstyle. I don;t know why the product is only on purple color i would like to find it in other colors</li>
            <li> The teeth on this comb are HUGE, jagged and the ends are pointed. So if you have thick hair this will snag and tear your hair and that&#x27;s if you can even get it in your hair with the teeth being so thick. Only recommend for people with VERY fine hair.</li>
            <li> This will look very pretty when I braid my hair along the sides &amp; twist the two braided into a rose&lt;br /&gt; I sill add this comb &amp; I will have a very pretty hair style.</li>
            <li> It broke on the first wear and looks very cheap but I guess the price i paid for it explains it why it broke so fast and easy</li>
            <li> It looks better in person and I would tell everyone where I order it from. It is very pretty and it is made strong.</li>
            <li> This comb is beautiful.  As others have stated, it is quite heavy.  I do have thick, long hair, so it works well for me as a decorative hair jewel when I have my hair fashioned in an updo, which is why I purchased it.  The color of the stones, though, do seem a bit muted as compared to the picture, but I am still very, very pleased with the purchase.  As well, the seller had the item to me close to 2 weeks sooner than the earliest estimated delivery date, so that is another plus!</li>
            <li> This is really pretty.  I bought it months ago and have worn it several times.  It still looks great.  You can&#x27;t beat it for the price.  Just don&#x27;t forget it will take a while to get from China!</li>
            <li> flimsy and the teeth fell off the hair clip right away.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, and heavy! I may not want to use it, it&#x27;s so pretty!  I need more hair to hold it up-lol!</li>
            <li> Beautifut but too heavy</li>
            <li> Beautiful piece of jewelry. Love the look but one of the prongs came bent. Does work though. Worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is too heavy for my thin hair.</li>
            <li> Very pretty comb.  I haven&#x27;t used it yet..not sure if it&#x27;s too heavy for my hair.  I guess I will need to secure it with some bobby pins.  It ships from China, pretty quick considering.</li>
            <li> Super cute! Well-made and sturdy, not made of flimsy, bendable metal. Definitely looking forward to wearing this for a party!</li>
            <li> This product arrived in perfect condition.  It&#x27;s a present for a friend, but I am really excited about giving it to her because it is absolutely beautiful!.</li>
            <li> it was broken when I recieved it, was promised another never came</li>
            <li> I ordered quite a few new hair accessories and of all of them, this was my favorite. The gems seemed to be done well in this where some of the others the gems were coming off. I totally recommend this one.</li>
            <li> This comb is pretty and it&#x27;s sized to securely hold my hair in a bun, provided I add some bobby pins because the prongs are not quite long enough to keep it tight. Neither the length of the prongs nor the width of the comb are adequate to hold a french twist if you have long, thick hair. I wanted something for a french twist and this is the largest comb I could find with purple jewels, but it did not work for that. I used it to hold a bun for another occasion. It was lovely and I tried to wear it again the same way, but the decorated piece snapped clean off at the solder points when I tried to wiggle it into place. The metal comb actually holds my hair more securely without the adornments, so I might try to find another way to decorate it.</li>
            <li> I love this clip.  They dress up any updo! I bought 2 and you can use 1 at a time or 2 for each side of your bun.  The color in the picture is a little miss leading.  I thought it was white and blue but it was actually pink and white.  I was disappointed that it wasn&#x27;t blue but I still do like the clips.</li>
            <li> This hair accessory is so cute :D and very easy to wear. Although, if you have very silky hair the hair clip can slip out, but it&#x27;s not really a big deal. Would recommend :)</li>
            <li> Came in a timely manner. Just what I expected they would be. My daughter loves them.</li>
            <li> I liked the clip a lot. but feel it could have been sold at a lesser cost. the stones r good and i am happy with it. definitely recommend buying it.</li>
            <li> Great hair accessory. Very sturdy, very easy to use. Looks fantastic with any hair style. I definitely reccomend to everyone</li>
            <li> its so heavy and the teeth are so thick and wide it  won&#x27;t stay in my hair ....&lt;br /&gt;so cheap</li>
            <li> Never received the proper item.  They sent me a stupid and crappy looking necklace with a cheesy camera charm on it.  I wanted the hair clip.  The other went right in the trash.  Good thing I didn&#x27;t spend much, but what a waste!!!</li>
            <li> this is such a beautiful hair piece. I absolutely love the colors and size and will probably by more in different colors if they&#x27;re available.</li>
            <li> Excellent hair clip, looks great on simple updos. Great quality, colors are very nice and combine with everything. Easy to wear on hair.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality. item fall apart at arrived, I have to use glue to stick them back together. Of course it will not last long with glue</li>
            <li> I like this product. quality at a high level, this seller quickly sent the goods, the idea is very original position</li>
            <li> This product is so unbelievable. The photo doesn&#x27;t get it the justice it deserves. This is such a beautiful piece and it is very well made. I haven&#x27;t seen this type of hair comb before, but I LOVE IT. I would recommend this product for everyone.</li>
            <li> Sadly, as beautiful as this product is it fell apart before i could even wear it.  Despite it being really cheap, unless you plan on buying something that you have to fix then i wouldn&#x27;t make this purchase.</li>
            <li> Wonderful hair comb, which is accurately made and what made me fall in love with it is that is the first hairclip for bun which is curved, not straight, as most manufacturers make, asking bigger money for a piece of cheap plastic. This is the only hair clip which embraces your head and part of your bun, so that the teeth of the comb are totally hidden! The crystals are carefully attached to the metal petals, package is good. So I am giving 5 stars!!! Thank you and please make more designs with the same perfect quality and a shape of womens&#x27; head in mind!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve used hair decorations like this, but for this price, it was easy to leap back into it. I bought 3 different items like this. The shipping wasn&#x27;t the fastest, but that was exactly what I expected with products from overseas - so I can&#x27;t/won&#x27;t complain about that at all. The quality is exactly what I expect it to be for the price. Well, probably a little better actually!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this for a little fun and sparkle!</li>
            <li> I did like this one.  looks a little cheap but it was big enough to show on my hair. especially with a bun.</li>
            <li> This is lovely. It has beautiful color and a good weight to it. i slide it in over top a bun or ponytail or braid and it adds a touch of fun and beauty to my hair. I have enjoyed using this very much. It&#x27;s well made and won&#x27;t just fall apart like so many things do.</li>
            <li> It Was Brocken&lt;br /&gt;And I was feeling very sad:( because I like this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s means I have to Oder a new one</li>
            <li> It was a gift, haven&#x27;t heard.gift</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty comb, although it was just a little heavy for my hair. It would work the best if you have thicker hair.</li>
            <li> cheaply made! fell apart after 3rd time wearing it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pretty and sparkly. All my friends loved it too; It&#x27;s worth the wait. I wish you have it in pink.</li>
            <li> This is very pretty, not such good quality.</li>
            <li> It was a bit too heavy but overall beautiful.</li>
            <li> Got this hair clip for my auntie in law for her birthday/mother&#x27;s day and she loves it.  She put it right into her hair yesterday and wore it all day.  She got compliments from guests and she really likes it, would be perfect for a wedding as appeared in the picture as well.</li>
            <li> I bought several different hair clips , combs , etc  from this seller...Loved this one so much , bought a second one.&lt;br /&gt; My hair is thick and super heavy , middle back range , 6-8 inches from waist..It looks super in the hair , but as stated , if you have long , thick and heavy hair maybe would be better to buy 2.. Very well made , not flimsy , pretty stones..Will keep looking for more ..~!~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I don&#x27;t have a problem keeping these in my hair , ladies with thinner hair , might have a problem keeping these in place, like with sliding or falling out , so what I did was a slight twist and turn to the comb , to add extra security..Hope that helps..~!~</li>
            <li> Just right - my daughter loves it and feels very dressed up with it.  It is a bit heavier than you expect but not a problem.</li>
            <li> This comb came as described, it was detailed and pretty to wear with any &amp;#34;up dos.&amp;#34;  It&#x27;s a little on the dressy side but does fine with a sundress and sandals too.  I would recommend, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> It is very pretty but it is NOT a hairclip, It is a pretty comb, but it is, in no way, a clip.</li>
            <li> While obviously costume jewelry, it is very pretty and large and sparkly!  Well worth the amount paid!  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Beautiful flowers for your hair.  My friend loved this as a gift.</li>
            <li> lovely will buy again</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful clip. It is very heavy and when I put in my hair the clip fell apart and broke all within five seconds. I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I would give this 0 stars if I could!  The jeweled piece was broken off the comb, it was missing jewels and an entire petal!  There is no reason this should have happened as I bought similar pieces and there was nothing wrong with them.  Ridiculous!</li>
            <li> Cute piece, but you get what you pay for. Broke as soon as I slid it into my hair. It&#x27;s pretty, but don&#x27;t expect more than that.</li>
            <li> i love the sparkles. it looks nice in your hair. However, it is very heavy and doesnt tend to want to stay in place. Would not be good for real fine hair.</li>
            <li> This is so much prettier in the hand. The comb is long and stays in the hair. The crystals are brilliant in color and shine. Would definitely buy from again. Great hair clip products.</li>
            <li> Many compliments and it keeps my hair in place fashionable.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product and would probably reorder</li>
            <li> Love this item simple but spruced my out fit up looked great and felt beautiful</li>
            <li> Was not sure what to expect, but was totally amazed when it arrived! Beautiful work of art for your hair. Top quality.</li>
            <li> it might be pretty but this piece of junk fell apart as soon as we opened the package.  And we had to wait 2 months to get it.  A load of crap don&#x27;t bother</li>
            <li> When I first saw this product on Amazon I thought it looked really cute and I had to have it so, I bought it and it arrived in a decent amount of time and it is a nice accessory to add to any hair type.</li>
            <li> This is so lovely, but I have short hair and it is too heavy to work for me. If you have long locks, buy this.</li>
            <li> I love it.!!!i thought this item was very beautiful. It came just as i wanted and looks very cute for buns and nice ponytails</li>
            <li> nice item made of sturdy materials. a queenly accessories to have. luv it. colors stays the same thru the seasons, never fade.</li>
            <li> My daughter is a young dancer whoLoves this item.  Just keep in mind that it&#x27;s very heavy so can be difficult to keep in place unless you have very thick hair</li>
            <li> Very nice, but over a month to receive it</li>
            <li> I bought this because I wanted a metal comb that would not break like the plastic ones.  I waas not too fondof the design but Once it was in my hair I liked it.</li>
            <li> Looks beautiful in the picture but in reality not much. I received this item broken in two pieces and the stones falling out. I tried gluing them but they do not shine anymore.  A real disappointment...Do not buy.</li>
            <li> I like this comb. In real life it looks exactly as it does on the web site and looks pretty good with different hairstyles.</li>
            <li> Very nice, too heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li> The piece is very pretty but was broken when I got it. Not happy with the product</li>
            <li> It was good but I gave 4stars instead of 5 stars because it was heavy.</li>
            <li> cute but glue isnt durable flowers came off.</li>
            <li> I do love this. It is more colorful than the picture, and it is really nice :) It will play up a bun and give it some bling. Shipped pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I have purchased a lot of hairpins lately and this one has been the biggest HAPPY surprise in a while... it is classy and delicate looking while still have the bling factor...thanks</li>
            <li> this a heavy peice of head wear, I would gradually slip down.  I had to back it with a hidden bobbypin. I am african american and  I have very thick and long hair.</li>
            <li> Once again, the recipient and I love it but again, travel time is unusually long and made the gift late.</li>
            <li> I received this item broken in two pieces and the stones falling out.  A real disappointment.  Would have been pretty.</li>
            <li> Loved this! You could wear for dress or casual. It is not too heavy and stayed in my hair just fine (I do have thick curly hair) Loved the pink and white crystals</li>
            <li> I choose this rating because I really love it! Its glimmering and I love it so much. So thank you very much for my&lt;br /&gt;beautiful hair clip!</li>
            <li> These combs are very pretty and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll enjoy wearing them for a long time. They are good quality too!</li>
            <li> This hair clip here has all the colors I love to wear.  It has the purple and pink.  I can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
            <li> Placed the order several months ago and this never arrives. Such a waste of money. Disappointed. Never going to purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Item arrived faster than I anticipated.  It&#x27;s very pretty but quality and size I would guess it was for a young lady.  I will save it for my nieces 10th bday.</li>
            <li> I chose to give this five stars because I did not expect to get such a great quality product for such an amazing deal.&lt;br /&gt;I like that it can go with almost any outfit and I get a lot of compliments when I wear it out. The picture doesn&#x27;t do its justice when I received mine it has purple gems as the outter petals and pink towards the middle and a white gem for the center of each flower. I would recommend this item to anyone who loves shinie things in their hair. :)</li>
            <li> My bf bought me this as a gift. It&#x27;s very pretty and well made. I seem to only use it when I have my hair in a bun, ponytail, I even tease my hair a little if I want it in a particular spot when wearing my hair down,as it is a little heavy on my thin-ish hair. True to color and style. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> This is a good quality hairpiece. But for some reason, in my hands, it appears more juvenile than I had envisioned while looking online. It&#x27;s a pretty piece, but may be more age appropriate for a pre-teen or teenage girl.</li>
            <li> I ordered 7 only 1 was sent, they say they will resend the missing ones never did! The product it self is ok a little too heavy for thin hair.</li>
            <li> This item is so beautiful but I over looked one thing.... This does not work well with curly hair. It hurts when I put it on!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful item.  The comb is strong and holds well.  I can wear this I&#x27;m the office or to a party</li>
            <li> Bad quality, it just fall apart the first time I used it, it is not worthy, don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Its very cute.I wear very often it looks just like picture above.I love the sparkles as well.And when I put it in it doesnt hurt my scout</li>
            <li> It fits excellent and I totally love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the excellent service too, very convenient and efficient!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;love it</li>
            <li> This hair clip is sturdy and well made.  The color is beautiful and is as it appears in the pictures.</li>
            <li> The hair piece looks very unique and elegant in the hair. Very different from other combs. Only thing is, it&#x27;s a little heavy.</li>
            <li> Nice combs but they are heavy</li>
            <li> The hair clip looks exactly as pictured. However the quality of this is exactly what you paid. I did not even get to at least wear it once. The comb part of the hair clip broke off.</li>
            <li> I purchased the clip for a friend because they looked good for dressing up and she has two weddings coming up soon.  However, I never got a chance to see them up close.  My mom liked them so well she kept them herself.  Next time I&#x27;ll make sure the shipment is to my house.</li>
            <li> Very good looking hair clip, for the only reason, I don&#x27;t give it  five stars is because is a little too heavy and I don&#x27;t know yet if it will&lt;br /&gt;stay put in my hair.</li>
            <li> Where is the hairclip?  All I see here is a really beautiful necklace with matching earrings.  Where can I find the necklace?  I don&#x27;t want the hairclip wherever it is....</li>
            <li> The product looks great when it reached but one of the petals on the flower was broken when I recieved it. Planning to return this</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I thought it was a cute hair clip that would be a great accessory for my hair. It turns out that the color is not white as the picture, and it is not a clip but slides into the hair. Not a big deal, but it is thick and heavy and it pulls on my hair... so I cannot wear it.</li>
            <li> heavy..  have thick hair and it was way to heavy.. also the gems fell out after wearing it once. cheap</li>
            <li> seriously, how can you go wrong at this price?&lt;br /&gt;takes a while to get but, again, how can you go wrong at this price?&lt;br /&gt;love it!</li>
            <li> I was weary to buy but figured it was cheap and little risk. Better than I expected! Very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> This was low in cost and came looking just like the picture.  It is beautiful and can dress up any outfit I choose to wear.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on the first of October, and got it yesterday. It is, as I expected for the low price ($1.99), not high quality. It is nicely flashy and appears well made. I ordered three different hair ornaments, and this is the second to arrive.</li>
            <li> This is a very Cheep Looking item. Heavy, thick, dull and just not what I would call pretty at all.</li>
            <li> I love the color and the quality is great.  It did take a whole month to get here but it&#x27;s awsome.</li>
            <li> The colors in this hair comb are a bit muddied, so I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars, but the pattern is nice and the comb teeth hold well tucked into the base of a bun or a french twist. My hair is very fine, straight, and slippery (and thin; less than 1\\&quot; ponytail diameter) but this comb still stuck in well as long as I don&#x27;t try to insert it into loose styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feels sturdy and durable, and all the crystals were firmly attached in the two I bought (one for me, one for a friend).</li>
            <li> I loved these. They are sturdy and look nice. They are kind of heavy but pretty. I want more. LOL</li>
            <li> This is very pretty. I was disappointed that 2 of the crystals easily fell out of the comb...glued them back in myself. Very pretty but i expect after a couple uses it will be missing a few gems.</li>
            <li> I love this hair clip. Adds a pop of color to my dark brown hair. very sturdy and no issues with the gems falling out after almost a year of owning and using.</li>
            <li> This ended up being extremely cute (WHICH IS SHOCKING) I love it and I wear it at least once a week or when my mom and  sister aren&#x27;t using it it a cheap but good buy!!!</li>
            <li> Very pretty, good girl style item. I have dark hair, so it&#x27;s a good decoration. I really like it well.</li>
            <li> Took several of weeks to arrived and when it did arrived it was broken. Looks like it is made from very cheap products and was very small and not like how the picture looks like. Figured it took forever to receive it so it&#x27;s not worth it to go through the trouble to try and get our money back. You should just go to your local store and buy nice guaranteed product&#x27;s that will at least last one night of wearing it out.</li>
            <li> I just got it and I was going to try it on that same day and it broke off the pin. :(</li>
            <li> Adorable but way too big.  Need really thick &amp;  long hair for this item.  But I do love it with my hair extention clip.  Then it doesn&#x27;t look so big.</li>
            <li> This clip would have been beautiful if it had arrived in one piece :( Now, I am disappointed.. As earlier customers have said, the flower part arrived separated from the comb..</li>
            <li> This is as lovely as the pictures show. It is palm size and a bit heavy, so not really easy to use for the side of a bun, but great for the top. A very nice addition to my hair accessories. (Note: my hair is past mid back, so there is plenty there to hold up the clip.)&lt;br /&gt;Great deal for the price!</li>
            <li> Simply gorgeous!! Its made of good sturdy material.  The picture does not do it justice.  In real life its sparkle adds glam to it.  Its stones are purple and pink and white like a cubic zirconia--the blingy look.  This makes a perfect gift that looks like it cost a lot when in reality it did not.  Love it!! It was a definitely a good buy!!!</li>
            <li> you get what you pay for with this clip. It is very cute but the metal is easily breakable because after the 2nd use of it, one of the teeth fell off.Again though, if you are going to pay for something this low in price, don&#x27;t expect too much.</li>
            <li> This hair clip is beautiful; the picture is a dimmed representation. I get compliments on this clip every time I wear it. I recommend this item if you are looking to make a boring hair day fabulous!</li>
            <li> It was just as the buyer described, price was good,  and looks real nice on, would recommend these product to anyone</li>
            <li> I plan to use this as an accent for a low bun.  I might wear it like that at a wedding.  It was exactly what I was looking for to add some bling to my hair.</li>
            <li> I picked this item because it was VERY beautiful. When i got the item in its package it was broken and no way for me to attach it back together.</li>
            <li> This was a cheap deal for an awesome hair comb-It&#x27;s sturdy and not at all cheap looking or made I was worried that would be the case for the price I paid. Usually when I buy items that are low price especially hair items the gems always come out by the time it gets here not the case here by any means. Will def actually by a few more soon as gifts for people that love accesories like these as much as I do!</li>
            <li> I love this comb. It is so pretty, and can be used to make any hair style look a little more elegant.</li>
            <li> It came sooner than expected which i really like that,  also its very pretty i always wear it when i wear donut hair style since its very hot in Arizona.</li>
            <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this hair clip as both useful and beautiful. I would recommend this to anyone with long hair that does&lt;br /&gt;not know what to do when they put it up to make it look beautiful.</li>
            <li> Really I love this product my doughther when I give it to her just she loved it always she uses</li>
            <li> ordered six but 2 of those six were infact broke i belive due to extreme weather the soldering on the clips were a bit shotty but otherwise beautiful and also the show purple and dark purple in the picture when i recieved light pink/light purple hair pins</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift. It is very, very pretty and shiny, not too heavy. I hope my daughter loves it!</li>
            <li> I am collecting hair items and this was just right.  Looks good and I am happy with the item.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> This looks very pretty, but it&#x27;s a piece of crap. It came in the mail broken. Super glue should fix it, but I didn&#x27;t expect to get it snapped in half.</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty comb. This is lovely. It has beautiful color and a good weight to it. Perfect and well made.</li>
            <li> This came broke. But it was subzero temps in the mail. I gorilla glued it and it works. I do not think it was anyone but the colds fault. It is beautiful. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I am usually hesitant buying something that has stones in it for fear that they will fall out.  This is well made and holds the hair securly without any other pins.</li>
            <li> I really like this hair clip its as beautiful as they show it and I got it sooner than expected even that is coming from far I would keep buying from this seller</li>
            <li> Pretty but cheaply made.  It is a quick grab for fixing hair but quality is not the best.  It is an okay product.</li>
            <li> This hair clip is so beautiful, and constructed well. Service also is super. I am very happy to buy it with this price. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought it few months ago, but I don&#x27;t receive it even now !!! What&#x27;s wrong with it, can I get money back?</li>
            <li> it came broken, could&#x27;nt use it at all, though it is very pretty, dissapointed i could&#x27;nt wear it at all</li>
            <li> I love it! It is super pretty, and even though it&#x27;s only a few dollars, it does not look or feel cheap to me at all. Super cute, and for sure a great thing to have for summer, or just to wear to town to spruce up your look a bit. I can&#x27;t wait to give to to my best friend!</li>
            <li> This piece is so beautiful. Looks wonderful, though it took a while to get here. It is totally worth the wait. My hair is really fine but it locks in well. It looks soooo pretty! I cant mention that enough.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the money, worth the wait and worth the price!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute and as pictured.  But the comb part is plastic and the first time I put it in my hair, one of the plastic teeth broke off.  The decorative part is much higher quality than the comb.  I don&#x27;t think it will last very long.  I would give it a one, except the decorative portion is very cute!</li>
            <li> Super cute hair accessory.  My 13 yr old loves it. It is a great price, just takes a while for shipping bc it comes from overseas.</li>
            <li> This hair comb is very pretty &amp;  sparkly.  Love the colors.  I got several compliments.</li>
            <li> As stated, this item is Beautiful and great quality. It is solidly made and stays in my hair nicely. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> this is really pretty and it sparkles extremely well the prongs are long and they can be used to hold up very long hair, this can be used to pretty up your hair for any up do. this will add the extra touch of  class and the right amount</li>
            <li> I have a few curly haired friends who love these!  they take a few weeks (4-7) to arrive and come from china but are gorgeous!</li>
            <li> I ordered your stuff and paid in full. The only thing I got was the hair piece. I want the rest of my stuff,I paid,I want it! I won&#x27;t buy from you anymore. That&#x27;s not good buisness practice.</li>
            <li> Beautiful!  The pictures don&#x27;t do it justice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I&#x27;m not sure about is that under the purple outer stones were pink ones.  I assume it is because they make the combs with whatever they have available.  I bought this for a bridesmaids dress that is plum and I thought about wearing lime green heels with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, it&#x27;s awesome</li>
            <li> very pretty hair clip, i was surprised with the good quality given the price.  it is a heavier clip than i thought it would be, and the rhinestones dont fall off, so it is durable.  i recommend it.</li>
            <li> sadly the item don&#x27;t doesn&#x27;t look anything like in the picture It looks like something that comes out of a gumball machine very cheaply made and gaudy.</li>
            <li> A piece of it came broken :(</li>
            <li> Really cute. Nice rhinestones. The light catches it perfectly in my hair.</li>
            <li> Very pretty but, on the heavy side luckily I have thick hair so it stays If your hair is thin I&#x27;d say this wouldn&#x27;t stay in your hair because it&#x27;s heavy.</li>
            <li> Very pretty! It has purple, pink &amp; clear rhinestones. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for.  Not only did this product take a long time to arrive, but quality is less than expected.</li>
            <li> For the price is worth the wait, very shiny and high end.</li>
            <li> Love this hair adornment!</li>
            <li> Broke in the first used</li>
            <li> to flimsy an always got tangled in my hair or always pulled my hair</li>
            <li> I bought this for a gift. It&#x27;s a little cheap looking, but it&#x27;s pretty and was at a low cost.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product, it adds just the right touch to the outfit I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
            <li> The comb is beautiful, but when the event day came to wear it we had to scramble for a replacement as the flowers fell off the comb while placing it in the bride&#x27;s hair!</li>
            <li> Very pretty hair clip. Is made better than i expected. Took a little long to get shipped to me, but was worth the wait for the price.</li>
            <li> This was beautiful and so well made. Wished I had ordered more than one. It was better than I had expected by far. A little heavy but if you get it in correctly, it holds.</li>
            <li> Pretty design, but it broke after wearing it twice.  Do not press on the decorative portion of the hair comb because it may break.</li>
            <li> It is beautiful.  I can&#x27;t wait to use this sometime.  I have a beautiful floral dress that it will look stunning with.</li>
            <li> My wife ordered based on the image what is shown in online.&lt;br /&gt;the one we received was 100% different.&lt;br /&gt;She was very upset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;double check before confirming the order</li>
            <li> Crap this fell apart as soon as i took it out of the package. It looked like it was broken before i got it and held together with wire. Crap.</li>
            <li> This hair jewelry was very beautiful and high quality.  I would recommend shopping with this company.  They had prices that are hard to beat.</li>
            <li> It is pretty cute and is made of metal so it will long pretty much I hope :-D&lt;br /&gt;The flowers are nice.</li>
            <li> Still it comes from China. The weight will make this thing stay on your hair. It is a blinking item, shine under the light. It cost a little bit money so don&#x27;t mind they&#x27;re not made of real jewelry.</li>
            <li> Very cute , as described</li>
            <li> GORGEOUS! Light weight! Arrived intact and quick! Super easy to place and stays put! I get compliments on this all the time! I love how soft the colors are and yet they catch the light! I would buy again!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really beautiful and well made! :)</li>
            <li> This is pretty, but it is kind of large and heavy so it falls out of my hair. Still totally worth the few bucks I paid. The shipping does take a while.</li>
            <li> Fantastic! Very nice construction with beautiful accents.  It is very sturdy and heavy material.  Feminine and elegant.  I plan to place a re-order in the near future. This time I&#x27;ll buy two or more at a time.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted. I am so happy that I made this purchase. Planning on trying some more of these combs.</li>
            <li> It came a little late. But once I open the package it was beautiful! Love the color and I can&#x27;t wait to wear it !</li>
            <li> very pretty and actually not flimsy at all. love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made of great quality. The stone is very shinny and well worth the price! I&#x27;d recommend purchase for anyone who could bear a month&#x27;s wait for shipment.</li>
            <li> It looked betifull after opening the packed but broked pretty much right after putting it on....:(((( it&#x27;s not worth the wait. Such a disappointment.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely pretty, it is so femenine and fine, it looks so expensive, this is definetely a great purchase, it arrive on the exact day it says on the delivery time, very well package. highly recomend this seller!</li>
            <li> Not made for thin hair, bulky and heavy. Cheap looking.</li>
            <li> I waited about a week before of use, before I gave this review. I recieved all 32 items claw clips I ordered. They were packaged with extreme care. I examined each clip and was amazed at how gorgeous they were. The photos do them absolutely no justice! I am mixed, with long curly hair, therefore I&#x27;m very particular about hair accessories. Plastic clips don&#x27;t last and don&#x27;t do a great job. I&#x27;ve been using metal hair clips for over 15 years. These clips are high quality, hands down. The pricing is extemely reasonable. I truly have gotten my monies worth and then some. I would recommend this product to anyone, before going to a mall paying the outrageous prices. If I could rate this product any higher, I would!!!</li>
            <li> This is okay - Shipping took forever!</li>
            <li> Great Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s metal purple flowers very pretty bought it for my daughter. recommend to anyone that like hair accessories I&#x27;m looking for more like this one.</li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfied with this hair comb.  It stays in place well.  I have had many admiring this lovely hair clip.  I am very satisfied with my purchase.  The seller has made every effort to assure that I get the additional comb I ordered.</li>
            <li> I really like this! It is perfect for my girls&#x27; hair. I wouldn&#x27;t wear it in my own though. My toddlers hair is really fine and thin so not much keeps it up, but this does. Holds the hair great. I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would get the purple or pink one though.....I ended up getting sent the purple one which is the one I wanted!</li>
            <li> I ordered three different hair clips and loved all of them they are made of strong material.&lt;br /&gt;I wear one of the five I have everyday and they have yet to break its really a steal for what you pay and what you get . I was expecting some cheap hair clip , but they are heavy and hold your heart great . I eventually want all of them. I get tons of compliments at work too :)</li>
            <li> It was missing one stone but nothing you can really notice. i love it. I&#x27;ve received many compliments for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been asked by several people at work where I purchased this hair clip. It is very classy looking and quality. Should last a while.</li>
            <li> I could not pass up this deal for about $1.00-$3.00.  It&#x27;s a very nice clip in hair piece and not over exaggerated in the &amp;#34;bling&amp;#34; category. (I&#x27;m not a &amp;#34;bling&amp;#34; type person. It&#x27;s nice to have something of quality which if I were to try and purchase this kind of hairpiece anywhere local, it would no doubt cost @ least $10.00 &amp; up.  Nice to wear on a special evening out or to a special event too.</li>
