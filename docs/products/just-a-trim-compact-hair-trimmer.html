            <li>This very resolution  is thus more than words of praise!  !</li>

            <li>Some gadgets just work and do precisely what  they promise.</li>
            <li>have been using just a trim for a long time  GREAT  </li>
            <li>super speedy service and on time!The product was just as described,</li>
            <li>It is perfect for trimming stray hairs and for some (including me) makes barbers and stylists unnecessary.</li>
            <li>this worked great for the back of my neck when I had short hair.</li>
            <li>EXACTLY</li>
            <li>Was exactly as advertised-super fast shipping-great product!</li>

            <li>Item arrived completely inoperable!!</li>
            <li>in fact it came early and made it intime for the birthday!</li>
            <li>I use it to give myself complete haircuts - not just trims between haircuts.  </li>
            <li>I must have saved hundreds of dollars, avoiding professional haircuts.  </li>
            <li>A few swipes with Just a Trim and the sides are smooth.</li>
            <li>Only tiny complaint is that the little built in adjuster slides back too easily, so that you cut more closely than you meant to, if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>

            <li> I had a just a trimonce before and it worked wonderfully  in fact I never have a problem with it but the one that I ordered from Amazon doesn&#x27;t even cut hair. it is so dull then when I put through my hair to thin it nothing even happens I&#x27;m glad I saw this email so I could say something about it, and asked what to do about it thank you jerome laliberte .</li>

            <li> I have enough hair left to care about it, not enough to pay ridiculous prices for a trim. This takes care of my needs  also my beard. I use AAA alkalines, which last for months. Only tiny complaint is that the little built in adjuster slides back too easily, so that you cut more closely than you meant to, if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> Recently I have purchased my second &amp;#34;Just a Trim Compact Hair Trimmer&amp;#34; and plan to give it in the future as a gift to all of my children and grandchildren. This very resolution  is thus more than words of praise!  !</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this to cut my hair, I use it to clean up the back of my neck. Its absolutely perfect for trimming the hair on the back of the neck and I have found no better tool then this.</li>
            <li> Item arrived completely inoperable!! Tried 4 different sets of batteries and it still didn&#x27;t work. Returns are not accepted. I&#x27;m  stuck with a defective item. I would suggest you refrain from purchasimg this item.</li>
            <li> Just a Trim Compact Hair Trimmer - Works as described but lengthy time in delivery.</li>
            <li> Good value on time delivery</li>
            <li> Was exactly as advertised-super fast shipping-great product!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut much off if you use the combs</li>
            <li> This was the second hair trimmer I purchased.... Pass it by  does not work  I had one years  ago and just loved it  So I was happy when I found it on line... omg... didn.t take even the fuzz off my neck  .. What a waste of money and the 1st on I purchased I paid for fast delivery.... I felt so ripped off ...and imagine I tried again  ... what a dummy I was... This product should not be allowed to be sold</li>
