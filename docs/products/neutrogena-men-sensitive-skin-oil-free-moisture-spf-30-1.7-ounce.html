            <li>I haven&#x27;t put this to the test yet, but plan to during our summer vacation on the lake and great outdoors.</li>
            <li>This product is great and works.</li>
            <li>This is just a great hydrating product for your skin.</li>
            <li>The best moisturizer for me, leaves skin nice throughout all day without excess oil.</li>
            <li>great product/gr8 price/overall purchase experience</li>
            <li>Have used this for years - great product</li>
            <li>Works great but contains sunblock, which I don&#x27;t need.</li>
            <li>But this is great because everything is in one.</li>
            <li>how Neutrogena deceptively markets this product as oil-free moisturizer as they make great products that are non-comedogenic</li>
            <li>I use this as after shave which works great and has sunscreen in it.</li>
            <li>This lotion works quite well and is very nice to use.</li>
            <li>I forget to use the good stuff in the AM</li>
            <li>I can protect my fair skin from skin cancer.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>good lotion</li>
            <li>i use that after shave feel great.very good price too.</li>
            <li>A good moisturizer should have some degree of SPF protection and this one doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li>This product works great, goes on very light and doesnt feel oily.</li>
            <li>Leaves a great sence on the skin, free of oily feel, seems to protect from the sun and comes at a nice price too!</li>
            <li>and Neutrogena has been working way more effectively for a fraction of the price!</li>
            <li>It works great and does not have a strong odor and is not oily.  </li>
            <li>Great SPF protection and my skin feels smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li>There is a just a hint of sunblock odor, but it&#x27;s not anything overwhelming, and definitely a fair exchange for an spf 30.  </li>
            <li>Convenience of an add-on product is a nice idea.</li>
            <li>I use this product after a nice, warm shower to seal in the moisture (and soothe my skin after a shave.)  </li>
            <li>This is so nice</li>
            <li>Smelled nice though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked Neutrogena products and this is no exception.</li>
            <li>Nice scent, compact packaging for carrying in purse or gym bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very nice and has a clean touch.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a man with very sensitive combination skin, so this sounded perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>is ma favorite suncream ever.</li>
            <li>Love Nuetorgena&#x27;s face washes but</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to finish the product as the cream and the oil based somehow has separated.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s been using my &amp;#34;Three Step Program&amp;#34; for two weeks now and is pleased.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>but, many sunscreens that are unscented smell like plastic.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love Neutrogena and I did not blame them for my issue withi this one product.</li>
            <li>It is an okay product</li>
            <li>awsome :) just what i need</li>
            <li>, it met met my expectations :-)</li>
            <li>works great and really helps my skin.</li>
            <li>no nasty smell that some moisturizers have too</li>
            <li>Best sunscreen for daily use.  </li>
            <li>I love it and use it all the time.</li>
            <li>and this doesn&#x27;t make my oily skin oilier, &amp; leaves it soft &amp; smooth, &amp; best of all is the sun protection.</li>
            <li>Not greasy at all (as most moisturizers tend to feel) and doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts or anything.</li>
            <li>Care face moisturizers with SPF 15 and like both of them more than the Neutrogena.</li>
            <li>sure why it&#x27;s &amp;</li>
            <li>When I came across this one, I was able to stop searching.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smooth and doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, very very light scent</li>
            <li>but i seem to be able to use this with the nivea sensitive skin after shave and neither seem to break out my face or make it burn so great product love it.</li>
            <li>It has pretty good texture and smell too.</li>
            <li>BUT I am happy with the results so far!  </li>
            <li>This is an incredible product that I use daily.</li>
            <li>Been using this lotion on my face before bed for a good time now and haven&#x27;t seen much difference.</li>
            <li>Rubs in easily and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>would recommend this product to people that doesn&#x27;t like strong smell, non-sticky sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It seems like a fine product</li>
            <li>but it dissolves pretty fast, smells great.</li>
            <li>This seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m pretty sure he won&#x27;t like if I suggest to use many products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been using Neutrogena Oil Free Moisture for a while and decided to try try this out.</li>
            <li>It just leaves your face feeling ridiculously smooth.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin smooth and keeps me moisturized all day.</li>
            <li>It is non-greasy, and lightly scented, but neutral.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy to have finally found this product after years of searching.</li>
            <li>Thought that oil free was synonymous with \\&quot;non-comedogenic\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Great way to get some extra skin protection.</li>
            <li>The bottom line is, this is great for any man who think using several skin care products is feminine.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly without any issues whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>you are light or darker skin.  </li>
            <li>I priced the very popular kits for acne, and decided I would try to create a similar skin regimen just for him.</li>
            <li>This product can be very useful.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and absorbs rather quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li>With a price tag of a little more than $5 on Amazon, this is a great value.</li>
            <li>This product is great at keeping the face calm after shaving while having just enough SPF to prevent sun damage but not feeling like you&#x27;re wearing a beach SPF.</li>
            <li>Really nice and effective ... and works as expected</li>
            <li>Good moisturizer for me daily.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen, keeps my face moist but not oily, and does a good job of preventing sunburn for daily wear.</li>
            <li>but I go through it quickly.</li>
            <li>but it oxidizes quickly.</li>
            <li>Not greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>It has a very strong chemical taste so keep it far away from your lips...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a number of high end products but this beats most of them.</li>
            <li>Pretty much fragrance free, absorbs very well, leaves skin looking and feeling nice, etc...</li>
            <li>Definitely this is one the most amazing moisturizer, I been using this product one month a go and really works and worth it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, for some reason, it started leaking and the oil became clear.</li>
            <li>and it is so well absorbed by the skin that is does not effect me when I sweat.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t the cheapest of lotions either, at around 6 bucks it might not be worth</li>
            <li>Overall this product is mainly popular because of the name brand.</li>
            <li>but yes my skin is sensitive and it suites me :)</li>
            <li>I have my own collection of all kinds of different brands specifically targeted towards women and out of curiosity I wanted to see what his lotion would feel like.</li>
            <li>A lovely lotion with an unnoticeable fragrance and a completely non-greasy feel.</li>
            <li>It is wonderful product, no skin irritation, takes care of any dry skin and I feel refreshed all day long.  </li>
            <li>I use it right after a shower and shave.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t wear it for athletic events, as it sweats right off.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right:</li>
            <li>This is the last step, and he reports it is feels light and pleasant, and the SPF factor of 30 is a big plus.</li>
            <li>A bit pricey, but far better than anything else I am aware of.</li>
            <li>and i can see this product disappear into my skin, afterwards i have a healthy looking face/chin with no discoloration and no dry flakes for 48hrs.</li>
            <li>Since I used this one, my skin loves it very much.</li>
            <li>I do not know why it says Oil Free when theres clearly oil in it.</li>
            <li>He always choose this brand and this is not the first time he uses it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t have that sunscreen consistency that many lotions have- especially with SPF protection.</li>
            <li>I have a feeling that I will be using most of it and buying this again for myself especially for summer time.</li>
            <li>It is more than double the price of this men&#x27;s product, but apart from the fact that the packaging is cuter, I can&#x27;t see why.</li>
            <li>Kinda masculine but still clean smelling.</li>
            <li>still, I will definitely buy this product again, and definitely recommend it to any man looking for a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It does make your skin more moist and has spf 30, but 1.7 ounces is quite a small size that will run out very quickly.</li>
            <li>It is great and all but be carefull to leave it in the heat because when you go to open it a clear OIL leeks out and then the white &amp;#34;moisturizer&amp;#34; comes after it.</li>
            <li>and he pretty much hates any type of moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Those ad guys are so clever!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re applying this after wash without putting on some kind of moisturizer first, you&#x27;re gonna rub your skin raw.</li>
            <li>It claims to be oil free, and it could be, but it left my skin very oily.</li>
            <li>Going to finish the whole thing, but not expecting any results.</li>
            <li>I really think problem skin can affect you at just about any time in your life.</li>
            <li>I much prefer the Neutrogena Moisturizer with SPF 20.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>This stuff is absolutely vile.  </li>
            <li>He is very picky about having lotion on his face.</li>
            <li>But he said he actually doesn&#x27;t mind this product because it is light and doesn&#x27;t make his skin break out.</li>
            <li>BUT LEAVES YOUR FACE WITH A VERY GREASY FEELING</li>
            <li>Just because it doesn&#x27;t have any ingredients with word &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t really make it oil-free.</li>
            <li>thanks Neutrogena</li>
            <li>I used the product for a few weeks as a post shave moisturizer because I liked the idea of it giving my face and neck SPF 30 coverage.</li>
            <li>My main surprise is the consistency; unlike typical moisturizers that spread very easily on the skin, this product is a thicker cream that doesn&#x27;t spread as evenly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of most lotions due to their greasiness, but this one has the rest beat.</li>
            <li>Not a bad smell, just too much, especially when this is applied to your face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this as my daily post shave/facial moisturizer and still love it, must have in my personal regiment.</li>
            <li>I gave 5 stars for this product mainly because of the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s also outside a lot so making sure he has daily sunscreen on his face was a bonus for me!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>, I would imagine that it works for some people who aren&#x27;t as acne prone/sensitive to oil, hence the high review score.</li>
            <li>It feels super heavy and greasy, and also balls when rubbing it in, ending up with a gritty texture on top of the greasiness.  </li>
            <li>Immediately after applying on my shaved neck it would irritate/burn for a little, but nothing more than a nuisance.</li>
            <li>Not thick and oily feeling as Sun block.</li>
            <li>I have started to see a difference when I use this on a normal basis.</li>
            <li>and it is just your normal skin.</li>
            <li>i normally cant put any lotion on my face</li>
            <li>He only uses a little dab here and there on dry spots but this is a great cream for the whole face and neck.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been giving him this for several months, and I actually see some improvements - probably easy because he hasn&#x27;t used any skin care product.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for last 5 months, I apply it right after I shave with my electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>It also has SPF which is beneficial in the climate that I live in.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m 31 years old, have freckles and looks clearer but a lot!</li>
            <li>My skin is quite sensitive and with normal shaving cream, it always leaves some cuts.</li>
            <li>Lotion goes on pretty thick and my face feels and looks pretty greasy right after, contrary to the description.</li>
            <li>I usually do not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am a bit obsessed about moisturizing and figured my husband would benefit from a nice lotion for his face to keep wrinkles down and to keep his skin healthy.</li>
            <li>What I like about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes, it rubs in clear, and it&#x27;s got Helioplex which give you longer protection against UVA.</li>
            <li>He works around a lot of dust and dirt and this has helped his skin stay clear.</li>
            <li>Please consider this if you have exceptionally sensitive skin like myself.</li>
            <li>I put it on at night after washing my face, and the next morning the skin on my face is peeling so much</li>
            <li>What I don&#x27;t like about Neutrogena&#x27;s Men Sensitive sunscreen is the scent.</li>
            <li>So I tried the sensitive skin version here</li>
            <li>and all I can say is that I wonder why I ever went with the non sensitive version.</li>
            <li>Also this doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling chalky or greasy has a natural balance in leaving you feeling like there&#x27;s nothing on at all</li>
            <li>its REALLY sensitive</li>
            <li>You can get similar quality products from no name brands for a much cheaper price.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for the last few years, and I love iT!!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Also, I bought this as a moisturizer with spf as a nice secondary feature but all markings on the tube indicate that it&#x27;s sunscreen with a moisturizing feature, i.e. It says &amp;#34;Product purpose: Sunscreen&amp;#34; on the back.</li>
            <li>In reality it seemed much more like a sunscreen with moisturizers added: went on thick, required rubbing in, and smelled like sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Not sure how to judge that since some spf 15 creams protect better than other 50 factor, but this still leaves me a bit exposed on normal day use.</li>
            <li>This is an $8 product that compares very favorably to a Clinique dry moisturizer selling for $30.</li>
            <li>Now when i shave, my face is patted dry of excess water then i apply this product which don&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li>but I prefer a product that I can quickly pump a few squirts into my hand, slap it on, and go.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy, and unlike other moisturizers with SPF this product doesn&#x27;t leave me with a grey-ghost tint in certain lighting.  </li>
            <li>I use this product for daily protection on both completely tattooed arms.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s like i barely use any skin protection product at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you use it once a day, you could barely manage 2 months with this.</li>
            <li>There is a claim on the Visibly Even product that &#x27;essential soy helps reduce blotchiness &amp; the look of dark spots&#x27;, but I have been wearing this daily for many months, and my freckles are just the same as ever (I wear a hat and sunblock religiously, and generally avoid the sun whenever possible).</li>
            <li>I live in a sunny and dry environment and have been trying a number of different products with SPF protection.  </li>
            <li>My dry skin has almost completely vanished.</li>
            <li>it seems to be working and making my face seem more wholesome, some dark lines under my eyes are disappearing slowly.  </li>

            <li> Great SPF protection and my skin feels smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li> There is a just a hint of sunblock odor, but it&#x27;s not anything overwhelming, and definitely a fair exchange for an spf 30.  </li>
            <li> Convenience of an add-on product is a nice idea.</li>
            <li> I use this product after a nice, warm shower to seal in the moisture (and soothe my skin after a shave.)  </li>
            <li> This is so nice</li>
            <li> Smelled nice though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Neutrogena products and this is no exception.</li>
            <li> Nice scent, compact packaging for carrying in purse or gym bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very nice and has a clean touch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man with very sensitive combination skin, so this sounded perfect for me.  </li>
            <li> is ma favorite suncream ever.</li>
            <li> Love Nuetorgena&#x27;s face washes but</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to finish the product as the cream and the oil based somehow has separated.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been using my &amp;#34;Three Step Program&amp;#34; for two weeks now and is pleased.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> but, many sunscreens that are unscented smell like plastic.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love Neutrogena and I did not blame them for my issue withi this one product.</li>
            <li> It is an okay product</li>
            <li> awsome :) just what i need</li>
            <li> , it met met my expectations :-)</li>
            <li> works great and really helps my skin.</li>
            <li> no nasty smell that some moisturizers have too</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen for daily use.  </li>
            <li> I love it and use it all the time.</li>
            <li> and this doesn&#x27;t make my oily skin oilier, &amp; leaves it soft &amp; smooth, &amp; best of all is the sun protection.</li>
            <li> Not greasy at all (as most moisturizers tend to feel) and doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts or anything.</li>
            <li> Care face moisturizers with SPF 15 and like both of them more than the Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> sure why it&#x27;s &amp;</li>
            <li> When I came across this one, I was able to stop searching.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smooth and doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, very very light scent</li>
            <li> but i seem to be able to use this with the nivea sensitive skin after shave and neither seem to break out my face or make it burn so great product love it.</li>
            <li> It has pretty good texture and smell too.</li>
            <li> BUT I am happy with the results so far!  </li>
            <li> This is an incredible product that I use daily.</li>
            <li> Been using this lotion on my face before bed for a good time now and haven&#x27;t seen much difference.</li>
            <li> Rubs in easily and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> would recommend this product to people that doesn&#x27;t like strong smell, non-sticky sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It seems like a fine product</li>
            <li> but it dissolves pretty fast, smells great.</li>
            <li> This seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m pretty sure he won&#x27;t like if I suggest to use many products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using Neutrogena Oil Free Moisture for a while and decided to try try this out.</li>
            <li> It just leaves your face feeling ridiculously smooth.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin smooth and keeps me moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> It is non-greasy, and lightly scented, but neutral.  </li>
            <li> I am so happy to have finally found this product after years of searching.</li>
            <li> Thought that oil free was synonymous with \\&quot;non-comedogenic\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Great way to get some extra skin protection.</li>
            <li> The bottom line is, this is great for any man who think using several skin care products is feminine.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly without any issues whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> you are light or darker skin.  </li>
            <li> I priced the very popular kits for acne, and decided I would try to create a similar skin regimen just for him.</li>
            <li> This product can be very useful.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and absorbs rather quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li> With a price tag of a little more than $5 on Amazon, this is a great value.</li>
            <li> This product is great at keeping the face calm after shaving while having just enough SPF to prevent sun damage but not feeling like you&#x27;re wearing a beach SPF.</li>
            <li> Really nice and effective ... and works as expected</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer for me daily.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen, keeps my face moist but not oily, and does a good job of preventing sunburn for daily wear.</li>
            <li> but I go through it quickly.</li>
            <li> but it oxidizes quickly.</li>
            <li> Not greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> It has a very strong chemical taste so keep it far away from your lips...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of high end products but this beats most of them.</li>
            <li> Pretty much fragrance free, absorbs very well, leaves skin looking and feeling nice, etc...</li>
            <li> Definitely this is one the most amazing moisturizer, I been using this product one month a go and really works and worth it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, for some reason, it started leaking and the oil became clear.</li>
            <li> and it is so well absorbed by the skin that is does not effect me when I sweat.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the cheapest of lotions either, at around 6 bucks it might not be worth</li>
            <li> Overall this product is mainly popular because of the name brand.</li>
            <li> but yes my skin is sensitive and it suites me :)</li>
            <li> I have my own collection of all kinds of different brands specifically targeted towards women and out of curiosity I wanted to see what his lotion would feel like.</li>
            <li> A lovely lotion with an unnoticeable fragrance and a completely non-greasy feel.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful product, no skin irritation, takes care of any dry skin and I feel refreshed all day long.  </li>
            <li> I use it right after a shower and shave.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t wear it for athletic events, as it sweats right off.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right:</li>
            <li> This is the last step, and he reports it is feels light and pleasant, and the SPF factor of 30 is a big plus.</li>
            <li> A bit pricey, but far better than anything else I am aware of.</li>
            <li> and i can see this product disappear into my skin, afterwards i have a healthy looking face/chin with no discoloration and no dry flakes for 48hrs.</li>
            <li> Since I used this one, my skin loves it very much.</li>
            <li> I do not know why it says Oil Free when theres clearly oil in it.</li>
            <li> He always choose this brand and this is not the first time he uses it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t have that sunscreen consistency that many lotions have- especially with SPF protection.</li>
            <li> I have a feeling that I will be using most of it and buying this again for myself especially for summer time.</li>
            <li> It is more than double the price of this men&#x27;s product, but apart from the fact that the packaging is cuter, I can&#x27;t see why.</li>
            <li> Kinda masculine but still clean smelling.</li>
            <li> still, I will definitely buy this product again, and definitely recommend it to any man looking for a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It does make your skin more moist and has spf 30, but 1.7 ounces is quite a small size that will run out very quickly.</li>
            <li> It is great and all but be carefull to leave it in the heat because when you go to open it a clear OIL leeks out and then the white &amp;#34;moisturizer&amp;#34; comes after it.</li>
            <li> and he pretty much hates any type of moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Those ad guys are so clever!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re applying this after wash without putting on some kind of moisturizer first, you&#x27;re gonna rub your skin raw.</li>
            <li> It claims to be oil free, and it could be, but it left my skin very oily.</li>
            <li> Going to finish the whole thing, but not expecting any results.</li>
            <li> I really think problem skin can affect you at just about any time in your life.</li>
            <li> I much prefer the Neutrogena Moisturizer with SPF 20.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely vile.  </li>
            <li> He is very picky about having lotion on his face.</li>
            <li> But he said he actually doesn&#x27;t mind this product because it is light and doesn&#x27;t make his skin break out.</li>
            <li> BUT LEAVES YOUR FACE WITH A VERY GREASY FEELING</li>
            <li> Just because it doesn&#x27;t have any ingredients with word &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t really make it oil-free.</li>
            <li> thanks Neutrogena</li>
            <li> I used the product for a few weeks as a post shave moisturizer because I liked the idea of it giving my face and neck SPF 30 coverage.</li>
            <li> My main surprise is the consistency; unlike typical moisturizers that spread very easily on the skin, this product is a thicker cream that doesn&#x27;t spread as evenly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of most lotions due to their greasiness, but this one has the rest beat.</li>
            <li> Not a bad smell, just too much, especially when this is applied to your face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as my daily post shave/facial moisturizer and still love it, must have in my personal regiment.</li>
            <li> I gave 5 stars for this product mainly because of the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s also outside a lot so making sure he has daily sunscreen on his face was a bonus for me!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> , I would imagine that it works for some people who aren&#x27;t as acne prone/sensitive to oil, hence the high review score.</li>
            <li> It feels super heavy and greasy, and also balls when rubbing it in, ending up with a gritty texture on top of the greasiness.  </li>
            <li> Immediately after applying on my shaved neck it would irritate/burn for a little, but nothing more than a nuisance.</li>
            <li> Not thick and oily feeling as Sun block.</li>
            <li> I have started to see a difference when I use this on a normal basis.</li>
            <li> and it is just your normal skin.</li>
            <li> i normally cant put any lotion on my face</li>
            <li> He only uses a little dab here and there on dry spots but this is a great cream for the whole face and neck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been giving him this for several months, and I actually see some improvements - probably easy because he hasn&#x27;t used any skin care product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for last 5 months, I apply it right after I shave with my electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> It also has SPF which is beneficial in the climate that I live in.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m 31 years old, have freckles and looks clearer but a lot!</li>
            <li> My skin is quite sensitive and with normal shaving cream, it always leaves some cuts.</li>
            <li> Lotion goes on pretty thick and my face feels and looks pretty greasy right after, contrary to the description.</li>
            <li> I usually do not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am a bit obsessed about moisturizing and figured my husband would benefit from a nice lotion for his face to keep wrinkles down and to keep his skin healthy.</li>
            <li> What I like about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes, it rubs in clear, and it&#x27;s got Helioplex which give you longer protection against UVA.</li>
            <li> He works around a lot of dust and dirt and this has helped his skin stay clear.</li>
            <li> Please consider this if you have exceptionally sensitive skin like myself.</li>
            <li> I put it on at night after washing my face, and the next morning the skin on my face is peeling so much</li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like about Neutrogena&#x27;s Men Sensitive sunscreen is the scent.</li>
            <li> So I tried the sensitive skin version here</li>
            <li> and all I can say is that I wonder why I ever went with the non sensitive version.</li>
            <li> Also this doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling chalky or greasy has a natural balance in leaving you feeling like there&#x27;s nothing on at all</li>
            <li> its REALLY sensitive</li>
            <li> You can get similar quality products from no name brands for a much cheaper price.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the last few years, and I love iT!!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Also, I bought this as a moisturizer with spf as a nice secondary feature but all markings on the tube indicate that it&#x27;s sunscreen with a moisturizing feature, i.e. It says &amp;#34;Product purpose: Sunscreen&amp;#34; on the back.</li>
            <li> In reality it seemed much more like a sunscreen with moisturizers added: went on thick, required rubbing in, and smelled like sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Not sure how to judge that since some spf 15 creams protect better than other 50 factor, but this still leaves me a bit exposed on normal day use.</li>
            <li> This is an $8 product that compares very favorably to a Clinique dry moisturizer selling for $30.</li>
            <li> Now when i shave, my face is patted dry of excess water then i apply this product which don&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li> but I prefer a product that I can quickly pump a few squirts into my hand, slap it on, and go.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy, and unlike other moisturizers with SPF this product doesn&#x27;t leave me with a grey-ghost tint in certain lighting.  </li>
            <li> I use this product for daily protection on both completely tattooed arms.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s like i barely use any skin protection product at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you use it once a day, you could barely manage 2 months with this.</li>
            <li> There is a claim on the Visibly Even product that &#x27;essential soy helps reduce blotchiness &amp; the look of dark spots&#x27;, but I have been wearing this daily for many months, and my freckles are just the same as ever (I wear a hat and sunblock religiously, and generally avoid the sun whenever possible).</li>
            <li> I live in a sunny and dry environment and have been trying a number of different products with SPF protection.  </li>
            <li> My dry skin has almost completely vanished.</li>
            <li> it seems to be working and making my face seem more wholesome, some dark lines under my eyes are disappearing slowly.  </li>
            <li> However, I can already tell that due to its thickness it won&#x27;t last anywhere near as long as the Triple Protect.  </li>
            <li> I carry one for short trips and one for long trips when driving, bicycling, or working in the sun.</li>
            <li> I have a problem, my skin turns red and dry the skin in flakey patches after shaving.</li>
            <li> people usually look for oil-free cosmetic products, they are looking for non-comedogenic, free of substances (usually oil) that clogs your pores, products.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer works well and lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> I like that it is oil-free, because I have a strange combination of skin on my face that is oily and dry in parts.</li>
            <li> When i use moisturizing lotions, my skin looks greasy and after the day the dry flakes still appear.</li>
            <li> Helps reduce my dry skin and keeps me from getting a sunburn.</li>
            <li> The active ingredients are the same.</li>
            <li> This lasts longer than I expected, but you may want to order a couple at a time to save on shipping costs in the long run.</li>
            <li> No more than a nickel-sized amount is necessary to properly cover and prepare the face for going out in the sun.</li>
            <li> No more, no less.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> This product, with SPF 30, it too thick and more difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> When i mean i have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> 4/5 stars due to the &amp;#34;oil free&amp;#34; statement.</li>
            <li> But on the other hand, if it doesn&#x27;t work as a moisturizer</li>
            <li> Says it isn&#x27;t so oily/greasy like other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist told me to wear spf30 every day due to having a couple of skin cancers removed.</li>
            <li> At the time, I don&#x27;t know if they still do it now, but they were selling their sunscreen base to luxury cosmetic companies who would repackage it and sell it for a lot more money.</li>
            <li> Slight odor, but not that noticeable for me.</li>
            <li> but I feel it still lacks a bit (one less star).</li>
            <li> Compared to the neutrogena lotion I got for me, this formula is much less greasy and blends in well.</li>
            <li> Works well but is a little greasy and adds a slight shine.</li>
            <li> La Roche Posay has had that for some time in Europe and it was approved by the FDA a few years ago.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note about Neutrogena, the company was bought by J&amp;J a few years ago.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few products I could find for men needing a sun screen after shave.  </li>
            <li> product consists almost no strong smell, therefore consumer can be at ease when use the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it made me break out pretty bad.  </li>
            <li> I usually forget to put it on.</li>
            <li> I got this because I was looking for a moisturizer that wouldn&#x27;t cause breakouts, and it at least worked in that respect.</li>
            <li> I work outside in cold weather, and this helps to keep my face from drying out.</li>
            <li> I mean &amp;#34;non-comedogenic&amp;#34;, this isn&#x27;t it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I like the subtle men&#x27;s scent</li>
            <li> kinda dumb for a product with sunscreen to not work in the sun</li>
            <li> This product utterly fails as a moisturizer for me.</li>
            <li> It smells awful; I suppose it&#x27;s supposed to be a &amp;#34;masculine&amp;#34; scent, but to me, it&#x27;s just gross.  </li>
            <li> It sounds weird</li>
            <li> Also is expensive for what you get</li>
            <li> it gets into your eyes and burns like crazy.  </li>
            <li> It also dispensed from a pinhole-sized opening which I find annoying.</li>
            <li> Does not leave a nasty smell or nasty feeling on your face.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Rubs in easily and lasts all day. Not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> This is my second tube I purchased.  I carry one for short trips and one for long trips when driving, bicycling, or working in the sun.</li>
            <li> This is an $8 product that compares very favorably to a Clinique dry moisturizer selling for $30.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the last few years, and I love iT!!&lt;br /&gt;This is ma favorite suncream ever.</li>
            <li> pocket sized in case I forget to use the good stuff in the AM</li>

My main surprise is the consistency; unlike typical moisturizers that spread very easily on the skin, this product is a thicker cream that doesn&#x27;t spread as evenly.

            <li> Love Nuetorgena&#x27;s face washes but this was a miss for me. Lotion goes on pretty thick and my face feels and looks pretty greasy right after, contrary to the description. Been using this lotion on my face before bed for a good time now and haven&#x27;t seen much difference. Going to finish the whole thing, but not expecting any results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, for some reason, it started leaking and the oil became clear.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer works well and lasts all day long. I like that it is oil-free, because I have a strange combination of skin on my face that is oily and dry in parts. I also like that it has SPF30, so I can protect my fair skin from skin cancer. This lasts longer than I expected, but you may want to order a couple at a time to save on shipping costs in the long run.</li>
            <li> It has a very strong chemical taste so keep it far away from your lips...</li>
            <li> Non-greasy moisturizer</li>
            <li> great location and it does seem to leave your face shiny but it dissolves pretty fast, smells great. Kinda masculine but still clean smelling.</li>
            <li> Definitely this is one the most amazing moisturizer, I been using this product one month a go and really works and worth it, I&#x27;m 31 years old, have freckles and looks clearer but a lot! I have a perfect skin tone. I will buy it again</li>
            <li> It claims to be oil free, and it could be, but it left my skin very oily. Also you&#x27;ll smell like sun tan lotion all day.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to finish the product as the cream and the oil based somehow has separated.  I end up throwing it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man with very sensitive combination skin, so this sounded perfect for me.  Unfortunately it left my face completely red and made my eyes water.  Please consider this if you have exceptionally sensitive skin like myself.</li>
            <li> Great SPF protection and my skin feels smooth afterwards. Wish it came in a bigger bottle, but a lot does go along way. Face isn&#x27;t shiny after application, which I like.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  The Neutrogena Triple Protect would irritate my face along the edges of my nose, it also left just a bit of a greasy feeling.  This stuff didn&#x27;t give me any of those problems.  I&#x27;m running my hand over my face as I write this.  It just leaves your face feeling ridiculously smooth.  There is a just a hint of sunblock odor, but it&#x27;s not anything overwhelming, and definitely a fair exchange for an spf 30.  I can&#x27;t comment on the value, as I&#x27;ve just started using this stuff.  However, I can already tell that due to its thickness it won&#x27;t last anywhere near as long as the Triple Protect.  So, I suppose it is a bit pricey... still, I will definitely buy this product again, and definitely recommend it to any man looking for a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Not thick and oily feeling as Sun block. Good moisturizer for me daily. Slight odor, but not that noticeable for me.</li>
            <li> Been using it for 2 weeks now daily applying morning n night after face washing. it seems to be working and making my face seem more wholesome, some dark lines under my eyes are disappearing slowly.  4/5 stars due to the &amp;#34;oil free&amp;#34; statement. It has made my face look SEMI-oily after applying BUT I am happy with the results so far!  Beats buying the Men&#x27;s Clinique face Moisturizer ($30) and Neutrogena has been working way more effectively for a fraction of the price!</li>
            <li> I use this product for daily protection on both completely tattooed arms. It is execellent quality but I go through it quickly.</li>
            <li> My husband has begun to have oily skin and breakouts and he is retirement age! I really think problem skin can affect you at just about any time in your life. I priced the very popular kits for acne, and decided I would try to create a similar skin regimen just for him. He&#x27;s been using my &amp;#34;Three Step Program&amp;#34; for two weeks now and is pleased. I can see the difference, too. This is the last step, and he reports it is feels light and pleasant, and the SPF factor of 30 is a big plus. Good product.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years and like it quite a bit. Pretty much fragrance free, absorbs very well, leaves skin looking and feeling nice, etc...</li>
            <li> This product utterly fails as a moisturizer for me. I put it on at night after washing my face, and the next morning the skin on my face is peeling so much it looks like I&#x27;m trying to shed my skin! I got this because I was looking for a moisturizer that wouldn&#x27;t cause breakouts, and it at least worked in that respect. But on the other hand, if it doesn&#x27;t work as a moisturizer then I might as well just not be using anything!</li>
            <li> I much prefer the Neutrogena Moisturizer with SPF 20.  This product, with SPF 30, it too thick and more difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> Convenience of an add-on product is a nice idea.</li>
            <li> I have a problem, my skin turns red and dry the skin in flakey patches after shaving. When i use moisturizing lotions, my skin looks greasy and after the day the dry flakes still appear. Now when i shave, my face is patted dry of excess water then i apply this product which don&#x27;t take much. After it is applied i get a tingling feeling and i can see this product disappear into my skin, afterwards i have a healthy looking face/chin with no discoloration and no dry flakes for 48hrs.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I use it right after a shower and shave. No problems with blocking of pores or sunburn. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for last 5 months, I apply it right after I shave with my electric shaver.  It is wonderful product, no skin irritation, takes care of any dry skin and I feel refreshed all day long.  I can&#x27;t do without this product.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I actually got this moisturizer (female) for me and I love it. It goes on very smooth and doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, very very light scent and it doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen. Non oily when on my face. I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Works well but is a little greasy and adds a slight shine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried about every sunscreen under the sun (pun intended). What I like about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes, it rubs in clear, and it&#x27;s got Helioplex which give you longer protection against UVA. Helioplex is Neutrogena&#x27;s brand name for stabilized Avenobenzone, a chemical that blocks UVA but it oxidizes quickly. La Roche Posay has had that for some time in Europe and it was approved by the FDA a few years ago. I prefer the La Roche Posay products but they are two to three times more expensive. What I don&#x27;t like about Neutrogena&#x27;s Men Sensitive sunscreen is the scent. I&#x27;d prefer no scent at all but, many sunscreens that are unscented smell like plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note about Neutrogena, the company was bought by J&amp;J a few years ago. I worked on J&amp;J sunscreen for a bit and know that they make excellent products and their SPF ratings are stringent. At the time, I don&#x27;t know if they still do it now, but they were selling their sunscreen base to luxury cosmetic companies who would repackage it and sell it for a lot more money.</li>
            <li> I am not the type of guy to wear moisturizers all the time. I usually forget to put it on. This product is great! I have started to see a difference when I use this on a normal basis. Makes my skin smooth and keeps me moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t put this to the test yet, but plan to during our summer vacation on the lake and great outdoors.</li>
            <li> I use this product after a nice, warm shower to seal in the moisture (and soothe my skin after a shave.)  It goes on smoothly and absorbs rather quickly and easily.  It&#x27;s not heavy, and unlike other moisturizers with SPF this product doesn&#x27;t leave me with a grey-ghost tint in certain lighting.  Since it goes on lightly it&#x27;s perfect for use year-round.  Though it&#x27;s &amp;#34;only&amp;#34; 1.7 ounces it should last you several months of daily use.  No more than a nickel-sized amount is necessary to properly cover and prepare the face for going out in the sun.</li>
            <li> I usually do not have sensitive skin. However the regular version of this product made me break out. Since I do not have regualr skin issues I do not know what made the breakouts happen. I love Neutrogena and I did not blame them for my issue withi this one product. So I tried the sensitive skin version here and all I can say is that I wonder why I ever went with the non sensitive version. This product is great and works. Also included in this product is SPF-30 protection. This is just a great hydrating product for your skin. Also I exercise in the afternoon fter using this and it is so well absorbed by the skin that is does not effect me when I sweat.</li>
            <li> The best moisturizer for me, leaves skin nice throughout all day without excess oil. The SPF is 30 but I feel it still lacks a bit (one less star). Not sure how to judge that since some spf 15 creams protect better than other 50 factor, but this still leaves me a bit exposed on normal day use. I am just basing on how I feel it works (Moisturizer Cream 5 stars, sunblock 3).</li>
            <li> This should just say sunscreen. It is great and all but be carefull to leave it in the heat because when you go to open it a clear OIL leeks out and then the white &amp;#34;moisturizer&amp;#34; comes after it. So this means you have to be carefull before you open it and shake it up before you put it on. I do not know why it says Oil Free when theres clearly oil in it. It is an okay product but you might as just but lotion or sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday. Excellent product. Not greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re applying this after wash without putting on some kind of moisturizer first, you&#x27;re gonna rub your skin raw. It does not apply very well, and probably the worst I&#x27;ve experienced both from a moisturizer or sunscreen point of view.</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely vile.  I bought it for my husband, but ended up using it because he didn&#x27;t.  It smells awful; I suppose it&#x27;s supposed to be a &amp;#34;masculine&amp;#34; scent, but to me, it&#x27;s just gross.  It feels super heavy and greasy, and also balls when rubbing it in, ending up with a gritty texture on top of the greasiness.  Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> good lotion i use that after shave feel great.very good price too.</li>
            <li> Very nice and has a clean touch. It&#x27;s easier to spread than the regular product (non oil-free). Using it after shave.</li>
            <li> awsome :) just what i need</li>
            <li> This is one of the few products I could find for men needing a sun screen after shave.  It is non-greasy, and lightly scented, but neutral.  You can use a cologne with this product, as opposed to the SPF 20 version.  For moderate sun exposure, I like this.  For extended sun exposure I use the Sport Face 70 sun block by Neutrogena..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as my daily post shave/facial moisturizer and still love it, must have in my personal regiment. This product is great at keeping the face calm after shaving while having just enough SPF to prevent sun damage but not feeling like you&#x27;re wearing a beach SPF. Also this doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling chalky or greasy has a natural balance in leaving you feeling like there&#x27;s nothing on at all and it is just your normal skin.</li>
            <li> great product/gr8 price/overall purchase experience, it met met my expectations :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this regularly for a couple years.  I like the sun protection and non greesy formula.  I use it daily after shaving.</li>
            <li> works great and really helps my skin. When i mean i have really sensitive skin its REALLY sensitive i normally cant put any lotion on my face what so ever but i seem to be able to use this with the nivea sensitive skin after shave and neither seem to break out my face or make it burn so great product love it.</li>
            <li> I gave 5 stars for this product mainly because of the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product consists almost no strong smell, therefore consumer can be at ease when use the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky when i apply on it, it&#x27;s like i barely use any skin protection product at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to people that doesn&#x27;t like strong smell, non-sticky sunscreen. Plus, it&#x27;s almost summer ! This product can be very useful.</li>
            <li> i searched and searched for affordable moisturizer with 30SPF that wasn&#x27;t greasy. This is so nice i&#x27;ll even use it for my night moisturizer, and the bottle is shaped well for travelling. I am so happy to have finally found this product after years of searching. no nasty smell that some moisturizers have too</li>
            <li> A bit pricey, but far better than anything else I am aware of.</li>
            <li> This product is great! It doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen, keeps my face moist but not oily, and does a good job of preventing sunburn for daily wear. I wouldn&#x27;t wear it for athletic events, as it sweats right off.</li>
            <li> I live in a sunny and dry environment and have been trying a number of different products with SPF protection.  This seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years - great product</li>
            <li> Thought that oil free was synonymous with \\&quot;non-comedogenic\\&quot; so I didn&#x27;t check the label before buying.  Used it once and it made me break out pretty bad.  Those ad guys are so clever! Smelled nice though.</li>
            <li> Finally! My boyfriend HATES wearing sunscreen but I insisted that since he works outside, he should be wearing it! He is very picky about having lotion on his face. But he said he actually doesn&#x27;t mind this product because it is light and doesn&#x27;t make his skin break out. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I like this product because it provides moisture but is not oily.  It also has SPF which is beneficial in the climate that I live in. I have used it for years and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product  providing good sunscreen without making your face oily.</li>
            <li> This is for my ex-boyfriend. He always choose this brand and this is not the first time he uses it.&lt;br /&gt;I like the smell as well. I am a lady.</li>
            <li> Works great but contains sunblock, which I don&#x27;t need.</li>
            <li> On the picture and illustration both says that this is only a &#x27;moisturizer&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SOMEHOW I GOT A SUNSCREEN.... WHAT THE HELL??</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend when he started complaining that his pores were getting clogged. He works around a lot of dust and dirt and this has helped his skin stay clear. He&#x27;s also outside a lot so making sure he has daily sunscreen on his face was a bonus for me!</li>
            <li> This lotion works quite well and is very nice to use. It does make your skin more moist and has spf 30, but 1.7 ounces is quite a small size that will run out very quickly. If you use it once a day, you could barely manage 2 months with this. This isn&#x27;t the cheapest of lotions either, at around 6 bucks it might not be worth it&#x27;s value. You can get similar quality products from no name brands for a much cheaper price. Overall this product is mainly popular because of the name brand.</li>
            <li> Really nice and effective ... and works as expected&lt;br /&gt;Again I would not say anyone can buy it ... but yes my skin is sensitive and it suites me :)</li>
            <li> Leaves a great sence on the skin, free of oily feel, seems to protect from the sun and comes at a nice price too!</li>
            <li> This product was suggested to me by a nurse in a dermatologist office.  It works great and does not have a strong odor and is not oily.  Great way to get some extra skin protection.</li>
            <li> I GUESS IT WORKS BUT LEAVES YOUR FACE WITH A VERY GREASY FEELING</li>
            <li> My husband loves it...and he pretty much hates any type of moisturizer. Says it isn&#x27;t so oily/greasy like other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of most lotions due to their greasiness, but this one has the rest beat. There&#x27;s no greasy residue after application, and the scent is not overpowering. I work outside in cold weather, and this helps to keep my face from drying out.</li>
            <li> He never used a moisturizer - I think he though that only women use moisturizers. And I&#x27;m pretty sure he won&#x27;t like if I suggest to use many products. But this is great because everything is in one. It has pretty good texture and smell too. I&#x27;ve been giving him this for several months, and I actually see some improvements - probably easy because he hasn&#x27;t used any skin care product. The bottom line is, this is great for any man who think using several skin care products is feminine.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen for daily use.  Does not leave a nasty smell or nasty feeling on your face.  Goes on smoothly without any issues whatsoever.  This is an incredible product that I use daily.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for oil-free, when I say oil-free I mean &amp;#34;non-comedogenic&amp;#34;, this isn&#x27;t it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When people usually look for oil-free cosmetic products, they are looking for non-comedogenic, free of substances (usually oil) that clogs your pores, products. Just because it doesn&#x27;t have any ingredients with word &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t really make it oil-free. It&#x27;s a shame how Neutrogena deceptively markets this product as oil-free moisturizer as they make great products that are non-comedogenic already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look, I would imagine that it works for some people who aren&#x27;t as acne prone/sensitive to oil, hence the high review score. I find that it is helpful to clarify some of the marketing jargons companies use to mislead people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use non-comedogenic moisturizer, and separate light/oil-free sunscreen, if you want to be cautious.</li>
            <li> This is my go to moisturizer. You wouldnt think guys need a MENS lotion. I love it and use it all the time. the SPF 30 makes it prefect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of high end products but this beats most of them. Non greasy, non perfumed, it simply does it&#x27;s job. No more, no less.</li>
            <li> Men&#x27;s products are cheaper than women&#x27;s......and this doesn&#x27;t make my oily skin oilier, &amp; leaves it soft &amp; smooth, &amp; best of all is the sun protection.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist told me to wear spf30 every day due to having a couple of skin cancers removed. This is the best I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t feel like you have sun screen on all the time.</li>
            <li> Works as expected. Not greasy at all (as most moisturizers tend to feel) and doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts or anything. I&#x27;ve yet to get sunburn either!</li>
            <li> I am a bit obsessed about moisturizing and figured my husband would benefit from a nice lotion for his face to keep wrinkles down and to keep his skin healthy. I have my own collection of all kinds of different brands specifically targeted towards women and out of curiosity I wanted to see what his lotion would feel like. Compared to the neutrogena lotion I got for me, this formula is much less greasy and blends in well. It also doesn&#x27;t have that sunscreen consistency that many lotions have- especially with SPF protection. He only uses a little dab here and there on dry spots but this is a great cream for the whole face and neck. I have a feeling that I will be using most of it and buying this again for myself especially for summer time.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous moisturizers, with no luck, until now. This product works great, goes on very light and doesnt feel oily. My dry skin has almost completely vanished. I put it on in the morning and when i get home from work. This stuff is a life saver, thanks Neutrogena</li>
            <li> I used the product for a few weeks as a post shave moisturizer because I liked the idea of it giving my face and neck SPF 30 coverage. In reality it seemed much more like a sunscreen with moisturizers added: went on thick, required rubbing in, and smelled like sunscreen. Immediately after applying on my shaved neck it would irritate/burn for a little, but nothing more than a nuisance. I switched to Nivea and Dove Men+ Care face moisturizers with SPF 15 and like both of them more than the Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> Even though this is not advertised as an after shave balm, I use it as such. Knowing I have the added benefit of having SPF 30 protection on my face is simply a bonus. I&#x27;ve always liked Neutrogena products and this is no exception.</li>
            <li> Helps reduce my dry skin and keeps me from getting a sunburn.</li>
            <li> if you sweat, don&#x27;t get.  it gets into your eyes and burns like crazy.  kinda dumb for a product with sunscreen to not work in the sun</li>
            <li> It sounds weird but I use this product as a shaving cream. My skin is quite sensitive and with normal shaving cream, it always leaves some cuts. Since I used this one, my skin loves it very much.</li>
            <li> Nice scent, compact packaging for carrying in purse or gym bag.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure why it&#x27;s &amp;#34;for men&amp;#34;.  Scent is just sporty.&lt;br /&gt;Wish it were sweatproof - must reapply often if you work outdoors.</li>
            <li> Not a bad smell, just too much, especially when this is applied to your face.</li>
            <li> The package is smaller than I thought it would be and it&#x27;s kinda oily. Will not reorder and seek out a different product. Also is expensive for what you get</li>
            <li> A lovely lotion with an unnoticeable fragrance and a completely non-greasy feel. I bought this for my husband. Guess who&#x27;s been using it? That&#x27;s right: me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been buying the Neutrogena Visibly Even daily moisturizer, SPF 30. It is more than double the price of this men&#x27;s product, but apart from the fact that the packaging is cuter, I can&#x27;t see why. The active ingredients are the same. There is a claim on the Visibly Even product that &#x27;essential soy helps reduce blotchiness &amp; the look of dark spots&#x27;, but I have been wearing this daily for many months, and my freckles are just the same as ever (I wear a hat and sunblock religiously, and generally avoid the sun whenever possible). Whatever the &#x27;soy&#x27; component is must be minuscule, as it&#x27;s not even listed as an ingredient. So I won&#x27;t be buying the much more expensive &#x27;women&#x27;s&#x27; version -- I&#x27;m buying this!</li>
            <li> A while back I went through the process of trying to find a moisturizer that works for me. When I came across this one, I was able to stop searching. It prevents my face from drying out, without causing it to become oily. A good moisturizer should have some degree of SPF protection and this one doesn&#x27;t disappoint. With a price tag of a little more than $5 on Amazon, this is a great value.</li>
            <li> I use this as after shave which works great and has sunscreen in it.</li>
            <li> This is my go to face lotion.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue and absorbs quickly.  Weather you are light or darker skin.  No one should go any lower than 30 SPF for you face.  FACT!</li>
