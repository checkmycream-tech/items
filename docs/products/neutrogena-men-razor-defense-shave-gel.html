            <li>but it&#x27;s size is perfect for travel.</li>
            <li>Great smell too!</li>
            <li>This product always feels great after shaving.</li>
            <li>Feels great.</li>
            <li>It works great on my skin to take the edge off of the shave.  </li>
            <li>Very nice change from what I have been using.</li>
            <li>Price is good, product is great</li>
            <li>a good product that keeps my skin happy.</li>
            <li>This was fine - not the best value.  </li>
            <li>I do not think it&#x27;s a good as the Nivea after shave lotion</li>
            <li>Good Stuff.</li>
            <li>Anyway, anytime you have metal on skin there is a chance for irritation and this product takes the edge off of the shave plus it smells good.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s every bit as good as anything on the market.</li>
            <li>This is a really good product with a nice smell.</li>
            <li>It has a nice man smell to it, and coats my face after a shave quite well.  </li>
            <li>While there are lower cost products, none I&#x27;ve tried are as effective or efficient</li>
            <li>best aftershave ever with a very masculine scent that cools and invigorates after shaving</li>
            <li>I would always break out after a shave and this balm has been the best for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Nice and refreshing.</li>
            <li>OK, this is a nice product.</li>
            <li>Goes on well, is absorbed well by the skin and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>just okay.</li>
            <li>When I rub my face, maybe an hour or more afterward, my face gets flaky.</li>
            <li>ok.  </li>
            <li>Most irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>So what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>I have been using this after shave balm for a couple of years and think it is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>Goes on great and really soothes irritated skin.</li>
            <li>the reason i give it 3 stars is because after the itchy feeling goes away, my face feels better.</li>
            <li>great product for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Another fine Neutrogena product.</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin that gets easily irritated even with a good shave with no nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li>Love this product and reminds me of more high end after shave balms like Hugo Boss,</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t need much to make your face feel much better than when you don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s my new favorite.</li>
            <li>For your typical razor burn, however, this is my aftershave of choice, leaving my skin feeling great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not requesting a refund or exchange as it isn&#x27;t worth the time.</li>
            <li>and I am glad they developed it.  </li>
            <li>Does not dry out your skin like most alcohol based after shaves.  </li>
            <li>what&#x27;s there is pleasant, and just plain works very well for me!  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ever had this reaction from a face cream or lotion.</li>
            <li>My experience with Neutrogena products goes back many years.  </li>
            <li>I have tried other pre/post shave solutions in the past and I can honestly say, that this is the best topical solution I have ever used period.</li>
            <li>I also use this on my entire face  and find it to be great for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Smooth, slight and refreshing scent</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure everyone&#x27;s face is different, but this works very well for me.</li>
            <li>and when I am done shaving this balm really does the rest.  </li>
            <li>It never stings but really soothes and softens my face.</li>
            <li>Provides much appreciated comfort after shaving.</li>
            <li>It does make me laugh that this is labeled Sensitive Skin...</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>smooth, smell is minimal and</li>
            <li>As a long-time user of post shave balm, I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a new variety - and Neutrogena rises to the challenge.  </li>
            <li>I have probably used every after shave product out there and generally try to get the sensitive type higher end lotions that are on sale or have coupons.</li>
            <li>I have been using this more soothing alternative for roughly 10 years now (off and on) and have seen the packaging change numerous times in that period.</li>
            <li>I have no complaints, and my skin is very sensitive (coupled with an ultra-tough beard shaving</li>
            <li>i have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>goes in your skin quickly,non greasy,light smell,and feels good!Just what I needed for my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s also good on small scrapes and bug bites, no really, I&#x27;m not kidding..</li>
            <li>I used to have to worry about what shaving creams or pre shave lotions I had to use on my face, but now all I need is a little water some cheap shaving cream</li>
            <li>and I guarantee it&#x27;ll clear up..</li>
            <li>I do prefer the Nivea Sensitive Skin after shave balm.</li>
            <li>I bought this one direct from Neutrogena on an end of season sale.</li>
            <li>I have rather sensitive skin</li>
            <li>In fact I&#x27;ll probably avoid other Neutrogena products as it isn&#x27;t worth the risk.</li>
            <li>Now the BONUS for you guys is that 1Liter (1000ml) can be found here for only $15; think about that, if you&#x27;re paying almost $6 for Neutrogena or Dove Mens Shaving Balm or similar products, to get 1000ml of it (10X the normal amount), you&#x27;d be spending almost $60!!</li>
            <li>Almost all of those experiences have been very positive and their Sensitive Skin Post Shave Balm lives up previous experiences and to their high standard.  </li>
            <li>sure enough after only a few days it totally went away!</li>
            <li>Generally, I like the product.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased Neutrogena Men Sensitive Skin Post Shave Balm, and it caused the skin on my face to bubble up where it was applied.</li>
            <li>The 3.4 ounce size is apparently the TSA limit for carry-on liquids, so that may also explain the change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>Although I had grown accustomed to the old hard plastic white bottle they used, this new squeeze bottle means no more having to completely remove the top to get to it.</li>
            <li>I use it pretty much everyday as a moisturizer.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have what you would call combination skin meaning it is oily and dry at the same time. I also have sensitive skin that gets easily irritated even with a good shave with no nicks or cuts. Lastly I get a lot of in grown hairs which I know how to fix myself. So my face runs the gamut when it comes to shaving on a daily basis.  I have tried other pre/post shave solutions in the past and I can honestly say, that this is the best topical solution I have ever used period. I used to have to worry about what shaving creams or pre shave lotions I had to use on my face, but now all I need is a little water some cheap shaving cream and when I am done shaving this balm really does the rest.  The irritation and burning goes away after 10 to 15 minutes and I only need to apply this after a shave. Lastly, is that it does not leave a greasy lotion feel to your skin. It dries up while keeping your skin moisturized. Highly recommended. I found my answer!</li>
            <li> No burning the skin with this product. No splashing. Very nice change from what I have been using.</li>
            <li> I shave with a double edge safety razor. This product always feels great after shaving. It never stings but really soothes and softens my face. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased Neutrogena Men Sensitive Skin Post Shave Balm, and it caused the skin on my face to bubble up where it was applied. This is the first time I have ever had this reaction from a face cream or lotion. I&#x27;m not sure if there was a problem with the batch I was using, or if it just has to do with chemicals included in it.    I&#x27;m not requesting a refund or exchange as it isn&#x27;t worth the time. In fact I&#x27;ll probably avoid other Neutrogena products as it isn&#x27;t worth the risk.</li>
            <li> Not bad. I do not think it&#x27;s a good as the Nivea after shave lotion but it&#x27;s size is perfect for travel. It works but in my opinion it just okay. I do prefer the Nivea Sensitive Skin after shave balm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered the 3 pack, went through it and reordered.  I like this quite a bit.  It has a nice man smell to it, and coats my face after a shave quite well.  There is no stinging.</li>
            <li> This is one of the only products I have had experience with that leaves my skin un-irritated. I&#x27;m sure everyone&#x27;s face is different, but this works very well for me.</li>
            <li> My experience with Neutrogena products goes back many years.  Almost all of those experiences have been very positive and their Sensitive Skin Post Shave Balm lives up previous experiences and to their high standard.  Goes on smooth, smell is minimal and what&#x27;s there is pleasant, and just plain works very well for me!  Price is good, product is great and I am glad they developed it.  Provides much appreciated comfort after shaving.</li>
            <li> I have probably used every after shave product out there and generally try to get the sensitive type higher end lotions that are on sale or have coupons. I bought this one direct from Neutrogena on an end of season sale. I have tried it 3 different times and each time got the same unbelievable reaction - on application it wouldn&#x27;t really burn or feel bad but within about 30 seconds my skin would start itching, I would get mild inflamation, and everywhere I applied would turn flush pink like I had been stung by bees. I have never had a product cause a reaction like this in all my years shaving. My next stop is Neutorgena to see if I can get a refund.</li>
            <li> Feels great. non greasy. soothing tingle when 1st applied. Cures razor rash. Have used Neutrogena for a long time.  Good Stuff.</li>
            <li> Soothing, no obnoxious scent. I would always break out after a shave and this balm has been the best for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Generally, I like the product. Nice and refreshing. The only issue I have is that it leaves a weird residue on my face. When I rub my face, maybe an hour or more afterward, my face gets flaky. Haven&#x27;t had this happen with other aftershave products.</li>
            <li> One of the few products in the \\&quot;affordable\\&quot; category that really takes care of skin irritation after shaving. I have no complaints, and my skin is very sensitive (coupled with an ultra-tough beard shaving is a daily chore...).</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot, and it took me a few years of trial and error to stumble on this Neutrogena Post Shave Balm.  It does make me laugh that this is labeled Sensitive Skin... no one makes the opposite of this - for tough leathery skin, with extra fiberglass and rocks, but anyway... I digress... a good product that keeps my skin happy.</li>
            <li> This was fine - not the best value.  But my husband likes the product ok.  I will probably purchase elsewhere because they turned out to be a little pricey and it was not offered on Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> I have never been a big fan of alcohol-based aftershave, since those products only seem to make my razor burn feel worse. I have been using this more soothing alternative for roughly 10 years now (off and on) and have seen the packaging change numerous times in that period. Although I had grown accustomed to the old hard plastic white bottle they used, this new squeeze bottle means no more having to completely remove the top to get to it. The 3.4 ounce size is apparently the TSA limit for carry-on liquids, so that may also explain the change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may want to hold off on applying it if you&#x27;ve managed to nick yourself shaving, since balm doesn&#x27;t help stop the bleeding. For your typical razor burn, however, this is my aftershave of choice, leaving my skin feeling great.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints.  This is a really good product with a nice smell.I use it pretty much everyday as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> great product for sensitive skin! goes in your skin quickly,non greasy,light smell,and feels good!Just what I needed for my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Only after shave I like. Most irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough for this product!  It works great on my skin to take the edge off of the shave.  I shave like a man.  That is, I use a safety razor.  Anyway, anytime you have metal on skin there is a chance for irritation and this product takes the edge off of the shave plus it smells good.  Sometimes, I&#x27;ll use this product as a supplement to a liquid aftershave as the smell is even enough not to clash.</li>
            <li> best aftershave ever with a very masculine scent that cools and invigorates after shaving</li>
            <li> OK, this is a nice product. Goes on well, is absorbed well by the skin and has a pleasant scent. So what more could you ask for? Well it&#x27;s only 3.4 ounces or 100ml and you&#x27;re paying over $5 for that tiny amount. Now about 15+ years ago (when I was in my late 30s) I asked my hair stylist, who also just happened to be my sister-in-law, what products I should be using for my baby-fine hair. She immediately recommend the Nioxin line of products; so I started using them. On one visit during the winter she noticed that I had some psoriasis starting in my mustache, it was red, inflamed&#x27; flaking and it burned. She then told me the secret &amp;#34;Try some Nioxin Scalp Therapy Conditioner on it and I guarantee it&#x27;ll clear up..&amp;#34; So I took my Nioxin Scalp Therapy Conditioner (#2) and started rubbing it into my mustache every morning and sure enough after only a few days it totally went away! So the next time I saw her I said &amp;#34;Cheryl how in the world did you come up with that solution?&amp;#34; she then said &amp;#34;A lot of my customers, especially men, use Scalp Therapy as a daily face balm, it&#x27;s also good on small scrapes and bug bites, no really, I&#x27;m not kidding..&amp;#34; So thus I began using Scalp Therapy as my facial moisturizer and it&#x27;s every bit as good as anything on the market. Now the BONUS for you guys is that 1Liter (1000ml) can be found here for only $15; think about that, if you&#x27;re paying almost $6 for Neutrogena or Dove Mens Shaving Balm or similar products, to get 1000ml of it (10X the normal amount), you&#x27;d be spending almost $60!! Get a liter bottle of Nioxin Scalp Therapy (#1 or #2) for $15 and save yourself $45! Yes, I know, you can thank me later.. I have no affiliation with Nioxin or any of their products, I&#x27;m just here to help you from getting fleeced for only 3.4 ounces of anything!</li>
            <li> I have rather sensitive skin and this is the only product I&#x27;ve found to address the irritation as well as this product.  I also use this on my entire face  and find it to be great for dry skin.  While there are lower cost products, none I&#x27;ve tried are as effective or efficient you don&#x27;t need much to make your face feel much better than when you don&#x27;t use it. There is no strong sent or oily residue after a few moments.&lt;br /&gt; Another fine Neutrogena product.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive way to soothe your skin after morning shave.</li>
            <li> I have been using this after shave balm for a couple of years and think it is outstanding.  Does not dry out your skin like most alcohol based after shaves.  Great smell too!</li>
            <li> Love this product and reminds me of more high end after shave balms like Hugo Boss, Hanae Mori etc. Goes on great and really soothes irritated skin. Try It</li>
            <li> i have very sensitive skin and i used this after shaving and at first it feels really good but for about 10 minutes, i get this horrible itchy feeling. the reason i give it 3 stars is because after the itchy feeling goes away, my face feels better. but i need something that won&#x27;t make me feel so itchy afterword...</li>
            <li> As a long-time user of post shave balm, I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a new variety - and Neutrogena rises to the challenge.  Smooth, slight and refreshing scent, it&#x27;s my new favorite.</li>
