            <li>nice.  </li>
            <li>I liked the set I received.</li>
            <li>and I love that they are thinner than the ones you find in the drugstores.</li>
            <li>these are very nice and hold hair great my grand daughter is hard to please when it comes to hair clips and she loves them</li>
            <li>chips off easily and is Matte looking.  </li>
            <li>they work just fine.</li>
            <li>However, there is no non-slip coating as on some clips, so if you have especially fine or slick hair these won&#x27;t work for you.</li>
            <li>Decent quality, cheap, and</li>
            <li>Exactly what you&#x27;d expect them to be.</li>

            <li>And I love that they are black</li>
            <li>The edges are smooth, and the finish is even, covering over potential rough seams in the metal.</li>
            <li>They have kept their shape so far.</li>
            <li>I was surprised when I received my package that they were shipped directly from China.</li>
            <li>These are super duperty light weight, more than I thought possible for a hairclip, they only hold a very thin strand of hair and unfortunately, they are kinda rough on the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> They won&#x27;t work well on especially coarse or thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;However, because the metal has a matte black finish, the clips are inconspicuous in dark hair while still looking more &amp;#34;finished&amp;#34; than bobby pins.</li>
            <li> Because of this, and the size, these clips are not good for anything more than holding back small locks or stray wisps of hair.</li>
            <li> These barrettes are made of a thin metal, and are not strong or large enough to hold much hair at all.  </li>
            <li> Also, these clips are different from other clips of this style that have a simple, gapless bend at the inside of the clip where strands of hair can get caught and pulled or snapped off.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have complained about the size, although it is exactly as stated in the title and description -- under two inches.</li>
            <li> I like what I got, but will ones a little larger ..</li>
            <li> rough unpolished edges grab and rip at my hair kinda like what happens if I use a rubberband to put my hair into a ponytail, youch!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> they are sharp, unfinished metal.</li>
            <li> but when opened the opening is so tight near the back end of the barrette that it&#x27;s difficult to get it in your hair.  </li>
            <li> The hair clips felt like they were spray painted black and shipped out.&lt;br /&gt;color</li>
            <li> They took a little while to arrive, but I wasn&#x27;t in a hurry</li>
            <li> so I have lucked out &amp; found a few that will go in my hair &amp; stay.  </li>
            <li> I bought them hoping to decorate them, but they are too lightweight to hold the heavy gems I wanted to attach.  </li>
            <li> They are small though, so if you have a lot of hair or thick hair</li>
            <li> Also note that other reviewers have complained that these clips are poor quality, so at the very least the quality is inconsistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not good</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am so disappointed, the last two sets of bendy hair clips I&#x27;ve bought have been hair rippers too.  </li>
            <li> , consider that they are made of thin, lightweight metal that bends.</li>
            <li> They are poor quality and hurt when taking off.</li>
            <li> Horrible finish on the metal and they barely open.  </li>
            <li> Horrible they rip out your hair when you try and take them out please don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Bad quality.</li>
            <li> the quality on these is just horrible.</li>

            <li> Horrible they rip out your hair when you try and take them out please don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> the quality on these is just horrible. they are sharp, unfinished metal. can&#x27;t even wear them.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Good quality.</li>
            <li> Exactly what you&#x27;d expect them to be. Decent quality, cheap, and they work just fine. No problems. They took a little while to arrive, but I wasn&#x27;t in a hurry and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> These are great for my fine hair. Hold the hair in place perfectly. They are small though, so if you have a lot of hair or thick hair I don&#x27;t think they will work for you.</li>
            <li> Prompt. They stay in and the paint which sometimes chips hasn&#x27;t yet.</li>
            <li> These work great and I love that they are thinner than the ones you find in the drugstores. They have kept their shape so far.</li>
            <li> I like what I got, but will ones a little larger .. what is there to say regarding these .. they work for the purpose they are</li>
            <li> Horrible finish on the metal and they barely open.  Good ones at Target at 20 cents more.</li>
            <li> nice.  just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> These are super duperty light weight, more than I thought possible for a hairclip, they only hold a very thin strand of hair and unfortunately, they are kinda rough on the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rough unpolished edges grab and rip at my hair kinda like what happens if I use a rubberband to put my hair into a ponytail, youch!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so disappointed, the last two sets of bendy hair clips I&#x27;ve bought have been hair rippers too.  My search for hair clips continues.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the deal...these work to hold hair but when opened the opening is so tight near the back end of the barrette that it&#x27;s difficult to get it in your hair.  If u try to open it up a bit then it doesn&#x27;t hold the hair as it&#x27;s should!  Kind of a catch 22!!!  Some are tighter than others so I have lucked out &amp; found a few that will go in my hair &amp; stay.  But can&#x27;t say I&#x27;d recommend them if you have another alternative!  I think if you&#x27;re buying 12 barrettes, you want 12 barrettes that work, not just 3 or 4!!!</li>
            <li> These barrettes are made of a thin metal, and are not strong or large enough to hold much hair at all.  I bought them hoping to decorate them, but they are too lightweight to hold the heavy gems I wanted to attach.  If you want these for a child or for very fine/light hair, then it&#x27;s a bargain.</li>
            <li> These hair clips work great. And I love that they are black so they aren&#x27;t as noticeable. Keeps stray hairs out of my face and cleans up your hair look! Bought these for a great price and I am very happy with them. I would buy them again!</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t beat these for the price</li>
            <li> Not good it grabs the hear with it</li>
            <li> The hair clips felt like they were spray painted black and shipped out.&lt;br /&gt;color chips off easily and is Matte looking.  Bad quality.</li>
            <li> but the backs of the clips get stuck to my hair and pulls it out.</li>
            <li> Before you buy these clips, please consider some things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, note the size. Other reviewers have complained about the size, although it is exactly as stated in the title and description -- under two inches. This is smaller than the similar-shaped Goody clips and so they might be smaller than you are expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, consider that they are made of thin, lightweight metal that bends. Because of this, and the size, these clips are not good for anything more than holding back small locks or stray wisps of hair. They won&#x27;t work well on especially coarse or thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;However, because the metal has a matte black finish, the clips are inconspicuous in dark hair while still looking more &amp;#34;finished&amp;#34; than bobby pins. So I have found them to be especially good clipping back the last few stray strands of my updos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, consider the quality. I liked the set I received. The edges are smooth, and the finish is even, covering over potential rough seams in the metal. Also, these clips are different from other clips of this style that have a simple, gapless bend at the inside of the clip where strands of hair can get caught and pulled or snapped off. These clips are designed with a curve in the bend that leaves a gap of an eighth of an inch (~3mm), so your hair won&#x27;t get damaged by these clips. However, there is no non-slip coating as on some clips, so if you have especially fine or slick hair these won&#x27;t work for you. Also note that other reviewers have complained that these clips are poor quality, so at the very least the quality is inconsistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, consider the origin. I was surprised when I received my package that they were shipped directly from China.</li>
            <li> these are very nice and hold hair great my grand daughter is hard to please when it comes to hair clips and she loves them</li>
            <li> good product &#x3D; using it for crafting</li>
            <li> these pulled at my daughter hair and the color chipped off. They are poor quality and hurt when taking off.</li>
