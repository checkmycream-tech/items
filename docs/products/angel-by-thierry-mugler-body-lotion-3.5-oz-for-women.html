            <li> didn&#x27;t last long..</li>
            <li> If you want a long lasting fragrance, purchase the body cream/lotion vs. the hand product.</li>
            <li> lotion is super thin and runny.</li>
            <li> I got the lotion because as I&#x27;ve found with other scents, the spray bottles very often overpower you with scent whereas the lotion you can control and a little drop goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Try something fresher &amp; lighter that reveals your personality rather than acting as an olfactory bullhorn forewarning your arrival a half mile in advance.</li>
            <li> Oriental, spicy, woodsy mixtures grab attention to their subtle tones and frequent queries about its identity.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Glad I BOUGHT it :-(</li>
            <li> Not real happy with the scent for me</li>
            <li> Hard to use.</li>
            <li> Angel is elderly &amp; invasive w/its powders &amp; patchouli driving caustic sugary mud.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is way too thin.  </li>
            <li> Could be fake</li>
            <li> A paper that had been stuck on it was dirty looking.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed - see for yourself.</li>
            <li> I have purchased Angel products before and they never smelt awful before as this product did very very disappointed in the product</li>

            <li> The gf liked it second bottle I bought the smell didn&#x27;t last long.. Could be fake</li>
            <li> Love love love!! I can compliment all the time</li>
            <li> Best deal I found for this!</li>
            <li> lotion is super thin and runny. not moisturizing at all but smells yummy. I suppose I should look for body cr&amp;egrave;me rather than lotion.</li>
            <li> ANGEL by Thierry Mugler BODY LOTION 3.5 OZ  It is a heavenly scent I love it.  Thank You.</li>
            <li> I loved the smell of this lotion! This lotion is exactly what I was hoping it would be; great deal.</li>
            <li> Not real happy with the scent for me</li>
            <li> I use the perfume. Well the lotion is just like the perfume and you could wear it without the perfume. Wonderful product to go along with perfume. Awesome price.</li>
            <li> My signature scent and I love the glitter that&#x27;s in this lotion. Excellent price!!</li>
            <li> This product came unsealed. It is watery and the scent goes away literally 1 minute after application. Very dissatisfied and will never get any perfume/ scented lotion on the internet again.</li>
            <li> I have been loving this fragrance for years.&lt;br /&gt;Still a Fan</li>
            <li> The smell is very soft and stays with you all day.  It is a very soft, sensual smell.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is the best me and my Mamma Love this Frangrance........... This is are Favorite sent we Love it....... love it</li>
            <li> This is my favorite body lotion. Waiting on my package to arrived now for Christmas.  My favorite is the Angel by Thierry Mugler.</li>
            <li> And Amazon made it possible! A gal I used to work with wore Angel and I loved it but the cost was beyond my reach so when I saw Amazon had this for a good price, I purchased it. I got the lotion because as I&#x27;ve found with other scents, the spray bottles very often overpower you with scent whereas the lotion you can control and a little drop goes a long way. I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Great scent.........buy it. I get so many compliments every time I wear this perfume. It&#x27;s not over bearing or loud</li>
            <li> Wife uses this product all the time.  We travel  frequently, and this tube size is great for travel.  The regular round jar with silver lid is fine, but too large for most travelers</li>
            <li> I am so pleased that I got a great deal with the Angel lotion :). I am glad to have received this bargain :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased the actual body lotion from Macy&#x27;s. They both smell somewhat the same but the body lotion is much stronger and last all day. The hand cream fades away within 10 minutes but it&#x27;s hand cream so I wouldn&#x27;t complain. It keeps the hand soft majority of the day. If you want a long lasting fragrance, purchase the body cream/lotion vs. the hand product.</li>
            <li> Love it! A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Love the smell but it&#x27;s not enough</li>
            <li> Love it!! Great product!</li>
            <li> Good, fresh smell, makes skin feel so soft!  I will always buy this and the cologne!  Love, love love it!</li>
            <li> Love this! Good price</li>
            <li> Best fragrance on the planet.  I&#x27;ve always wanted a perfume that has a hint of petruli oil (?spelling).</li>
            <li> Said &amp;#34;NOT FOR RESALE &amp;#34; on product. Who knows what or where this came from.  Glad I BOUGHT it :-(</li>
            <li> Smells like an old lady to me. Very watery but lasts long. I usually mix with a floral smell so it will smell more age appropriate.</li>
            <li> Best compliments on this.</li>
            <li> beautiful it came in on time for my birthday</li>
            <li> It smells the best ever. I love wearing it.</li>
            <li> I have purchased Angel products before and they never smelt awful before as this product did very very disappointed in the product</li>
            <li> Angel is elderly &amp; invasive w/its powders &amp; patchouli driving caustic sugary mud.  Try something fresher &amp; lighter that reveals your personality rather than acting as an olfactory bullhorn forewarning your arrival a half mile in advance.</li>
            <li> Love it---lasts long, but not over-powering</li>
            <li> it smells like the perfume. great for layering. great for letting the smell linger in your sheets....or his (i don&#x27;t write for cosmo, i swear)</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS FRAGRANCE IN MY SKIN!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice combination of lotion and perfume. A pinch of lotion on the body feels goods and smells so great!</li>
            <li> I love it sooooo much!!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this scent!!!  I&#x27;ve also since purchased the perfume and loving it too!</li>
            <li> Love it!  Great with perfume!  Been using it for several years now. Absolutely love it! I would recommend it to anyone. You won&#x27;t be disappointed - see for yourself.</li>
            <li> I got a perfuming lotion instead of body lotion. I just have used instead. I&#x27;m okay with the perfuming I would just like body lotion</li>
            <li> A paper that had been stuck on it was dirty looking.  The tube had not been opened, but it was not in a box.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;Angel&#x27; body lotion is a perfect complement to Mugler&#x27;s perfume or this cream can be worn alone as a perfect after-bath moisturizer.  Oriental, spicy, woodsy mixtures grab attention to their subtle tones and frequent queries about its identity.  This fragrance purchase is a special &#x27;must-have.&#x27;</li>
            <li> Good product and very fast free shipping.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, great price</li>
            <li> I love this lotion I have had many compliments on the smell, I won&#x27;t be with out this lotion</li>
            <li> I was recently at Dillards and was given a sample of this lotion.  When I tried it I knew I had to have it. It has the most pleasant fragrance and now I want it in everything.  Product arrived quickly and I am so pleased to be able to purchase it this way.  thanks!!</li>
            <li> This lotion is way too thin.  Hard to use. Will not purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> very nice, smooth and fragrant as expected</li>
            <li> Smelled too strong i dont use it it gives me a headache</li>
            <li> it was a great experience, keep it up! Thanks.</li>
