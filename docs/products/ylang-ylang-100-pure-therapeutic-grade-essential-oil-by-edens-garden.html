            <li>Best in quality, benefit, and cost.</li>
            <li>But for everyone else, this oil matches up well with the best of them.</li>
            <li>A very nice quality!</li>
            <li>the Moms loved it!</li>
            <li>I find the quality to be exceptional and the price perfect.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff</li>
            <li>The product is great for what it&#x27;s for.  </li>
            <li>My favorite is the rose,it&#x27;s the bomb!!</li>
            <li>Try it at your own risk !</li>
            <li>great smell good price.</li>
            <li>If you are one of the 1 - 5% making great money with an MLM, more power to you!</li>
            <li>did not smell good.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>But I think this is my favorite!</li>
            <li>great, fantastic, high quality, wonderful packaging.  </li>
            <li>Use this for high blood pressure and it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>I love making my own sprays with them.</li>
            <li>I love my friends for their honesty and when one scrunched their nose after smelling my wrist</li>
            <li>I love the smell of them all.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of Ylang Ylang mixed with agarwood oil (aloeswood oil) , Its so perfect combine together.</li>
            <li>I love this oil.  </li>
            <li>My favorite, to my surprise, was to blend it with lemon oil and use it in bath salts.  </li>
            <li>I love all the oils from this company.</li>
            <li>This oils has such a nice smell and is great to mix with the more &#x27;citrusy&#x27; oils.</li>
            <li>Calming and sweet floral scent!  </li>
            <li>this order came very quickly.  </li>
            <li>We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>The essential oil from Edens Garden are great</li>
            <li>The 100% therapeutic grades as well as the Synergy Blends are fabulous.</li>
            <li>Fantastic for anxiety and panic attacks.</li>
            <li>I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM.</li>
            <li>All of my Eden&#x27;s Garden Essential Oils have performed perfectly for me and I intend to keep this company in mind when ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, very relaxing.</li>
            <li>I have bought so many oils from this company, I cannot remember always which wa s the most recent!!</li>
            <li>That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden.</li>
            <li>For the price you pay is well worth every penny in beneficial results.</li>
            <li>Other reviewers loved this smell.  </li>
            <li>the oils that i purchased are so clean and can tell they are very high quality.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find the scent pleasant to me, but will try again using less.</li>
            <li>Seems very pure and therapeutic.</li>
            <li>Thanks for having such a great product at a cost I can actually handle.</li>
            <li>quality product for a good price- would definitely recommend to others seeking quality essential oils&lt;br /</li>
            <li>This product met all my needs, thank you so much.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with the floral scent of Ylang Ylang(produced by another manufacture) in a local health food store but the price was nearly $20 an ounce.</li>
            <li>I use it mainly for cosmetic purposes, like hair and body oils.</li>
            <li>Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers.</li>
            <li>i am very picky with essential oils and am weary of buying from the internet without smelling first.  </li>
            <li>I love Ylang Ylang for my dry skin mixed with almond oil.  </li>
            <li>the scent is very strong and not as floral as I was expecting be cautious a few drops go a long way.</li>
            <li>,DOES NOT HAVE THE SOFT FLORAL SMELL</li>
            <li>IT SMELLS SICKLY SWEET WITH AN ODD ODOR.</li>
            <li>stinks but seems to be good oils</li>
    </ol>

            <li> great, fantastic, high quality, wonderful packaging.  this order came very quickly.  i am very picky with essential oils and am weary of buying from the internet without smelling first.  i was so impressed from the beginning to end with this company.  the oils that i purchased are so clean and can tell they are very high quality.  great job!</li>
            <li> I fell in love with the floral scent of Ylang Ylang(produced by another manufacture) in a local health food store but the price was nearly $20 an ounce. I came home immediately and ordered this product, it arrived as promised in 3 days that is the ONLY reason for 1 star. I smelled it and all I could think of was pine sol with floral scent. I figured it was just my sense of smell and decided to wear it one day...EPIC FAIL !!! I love my friends for their honesty and when one scrunched their nose after smelling my wrist , I knew then it wasn&#x27;t my sense of smell that was mistaken.</li>
            <li> I have bought so many oils from this company, I cannot remember always which wa s the most recent!! I love the smell of them all. they are always ahead of the sugested arrival time, packed well, and are long lasting. My favorite is the rose,it&#x27;s the bomb!!</li>
            <li> The scent is supposed to help place you the mood....did not smell good. I don&#x27;t know how that&#x27;s supposed to work???</li>
            <li> stinks but seems to be good oils</li>
            <li> I like the aroma of this Ylang ylang and use this variety in my hair shampoo and facial cream. It is known to be helpful with acne and hair growth and has a calming influence. A very nice quality!</li>
            <li> This oils has such a nice smell and is great to mix with the more &#x27;citrusy&#x27; oils.</li>
            <li> I love Ylang Ylang for my dry skin mixed with almond oil.  This product met all my needs, thank you so much.</li>
            <li> Calming and sweet floral scent!  Great stuff</li>
            <li> I love the smell, very relaxing. Will be a repeat buyer. I use it mainly for cosmetic purposes, like hair and body oils.</li>
            <li> quality product for a good price- would definitely recommend to others seeking quality essential oils&lt;br /&gt; our Girl Scout Troop used this for a bath scrub gift project- the Moms loved it!</li>
            <li> Good product. Was as advertised.</li>
            <li> Seems very pure and therapeutic.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Ylang Ylang mixed with agarwood oil (aloeswood oil) , Its so perfect combine together. The essential oil from Edens Garden are great</li>
            <li> Best in quality, benefit, and cost. The 100% therapeutic grades as well as the Synergy Blends are fabulous. For the price you pay is well worth every penny in beneficial results.</li>

            <li> These oils by Eden&#x27;s Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living. I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM. Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers. We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price. The reason it is a fraction of the price is because it does not have about 3 to 5 levels of compensations for its representatives built into the margins, which drastically reduces the overhead. That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden. From my experience, and countless other essential oil enthusiasts who have also used doTerra, YL, and Melaleuca, there is no difference in quality, purity or smell with Eden’s Garden. If you are one of the 1 - 5% making great money with an MLM, more power to you! But for everyone else, this oil matches up well with the best of them.</li>
            <li> the scent is very strong and not as floral as I was expecting be cautious a few drops go a long way.</li>
            <li> WOULD NOT BUY THIA AGAIN!!!!&lt;br /&gt;The oil really STINKS,DOES NOT HAVE THE SOFT FLORAL SMELL AT ALL . IT SMELLS SICKLY SWEET WITH AN ODD ODOR.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  I use it in a lot of blends.  My favorite, to my surprise, was to blend it with lemon oil and use it in bath salts.  I find the quality to be exceptional and the price perfect.  I will always order my oils from Edens Garden!</li>
            <li> I love all the oils from this company. But I think this is my favorite! I love making my own sprays with them.</li>
            <li> Use this for high blood pressure and it works wonderfully. Have not had to take prescription medication for over a year.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find the scent pleasant to me, but will try again using less.</li>
            <li> I did not like the smell of this oil. Other reviewers loved this smell.  I guess it might be me but I think it stinks ! Smells like those white toilet bowl cakes that hang inside your toilet bowl - I don&#x27;t think I can give this away. Try it at your own risk !</li>
            <li> All of my Eden&#x27;s Garden Essential Oils have performed perfectly for me and I intend to keep this company in mind when ordering more in the future. Thanks for having such a great product at a cost I can actually handle.</li>
            <li> And by this I mean the smell.  The product is great for what it&#x27;s for.  The smell just wasn&#x27;t what everyone was making it out to be to me.  Wish the internet had a scratch and sniff button.</li>
            <li> ylang ylang will excite your senses</li>
            <li> great smell good price.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, bottle is very tiny.</li>
