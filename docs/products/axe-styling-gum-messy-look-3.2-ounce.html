            <li>Or if you don&#x27;t reflexively run your fingers through your hair all the time, this product would be perfect for you.</li>

            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>Smells great, but just doesn&#x27;t quite get the job done.</li>
            <li>It smells great too.</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>it looks good and works great.</li>
            <li>its all ok, perfect service</li>
            <li>&#x27;s got a pleasant smell and</li>
            <li>good products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got this thinking it would be good for the men in my life.  </li>
            <li>This Axe product did a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For my hair and style I find that its best to apply by first smearing the wax all over my palms and then running my hands through my hair.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>This is a great product I am currently using to mask as best</li>
            <li>I really liked this styling gum.</li>
            <li>It made the hair feel kind of yucky to</li>
            <li>Been using this every day for about 4 years now, to be honest.</li>
            <li>A good choice for when control matters more to you than softness.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s rather nice...</li>
            <li>This one has a very strong hold, for your outdoor windy situations.</li>
            <li>The Gum has much better holding power and it leaves a nice matte finish.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In case you are worried, it doesn&#x27;t have a strong Axe smell!</li>
            <li>I love it, and so does my husband who also uses it since I started buying it for my son :-)</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I like the Gum much better.  </li>
            <li>Love axe products for the smell and the quality.</li>
            <li>Of all the styling products on the market, I wouldn&#x27;t have imagined in a million years that Axe products would top the list as my favorite.</li>
            <li>product is probably going to be ok for you people who are used to getting this styling gum.  </li>
            <li>This product keeps it in place without looking like anything more than just that :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;It gives ok spiky look but doesn&#x27;t hold all day.</li>
            <li>me a a thinner formula hair gel works better.</li>
            <li>many times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the Axe styling cream better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no hair expert, but my hair looks better with some sort of styling product in it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will have to say for my son using this product is in itself a huge testimony to how easy it is to use and how nice it is to work with.  </li>
            <li>Also, I find that it works best on dry hair.</li>
            <li>unlike most Axe products, this does not have a really strong smell (which is a plus to me, but my son likes the smells.)  </li>
            <li>This stuff requires no skill to use, holds really well, looks good, lasts, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp as some do.</li>
            <li>I have other products that I prefer, but this is the best in the Axe line.</li>
            <li>Washes out easily in the shower.</li>
            <li>It just holds in strongly in place without looking dorky.</li>
            <li>I love love love love this hair gum by AXE!!!I tried many different Gels on my six-year-old son&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>I also have the Gel, which I am less impressed with.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried this product with both short hair and longer hair and it worked great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a great product for this price range, and definitely gives higher-end products a run for their money.</li>
            <li>Lastly he was able to wash it out VERY EASILY.</li>
            <li>The packaging is trendy and effective and the scent of the product is quite mild compared to other Axe products.</li>
            <li>scent is clean and fresh too.</li>
            <li>I find that it adequately holds my hair up all day.</li>
            <li>This white and easy-to-apply product holds your hair in place for many, many hours.</li>
            <li>well, just more \\&quot;finished\\&quot; than his normal appearance.</li>
            <li>You get a good messy look that stays, but the smell is SO sweet and strong.</li>
            <li>It is thicker than regular gel, which I liked.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve compared this product against the messy look line paste and gravity defying dust from Axe and this is by far the best</li>
            <li>The performance seems to be really nice too and holds well over an entire day.  </li>
            <li>Gum Messy Look is one of the best Axe hair styling products in their current line.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>This Messy does create kind of a cool hair look.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used hair spray, mousse, gel, wax, and such in my hair through the years, and Axe Spiking Gum (and their Glues) ranks up there with my favorite of these products.</li>
            <li>not as good as the messy paste, it makes your hair crispy</li>
            <li>Gives my hair a messy look that is really popular right now.</li>
            <li>My wife also tried it, and liked the amount of hold, but also thought the texture was odd.  </li>
            <li>This was a plus as he was concerned about getting it out, as he can&#x27;t wear certain hairstyles at his school.</li>
            <li>The hold is great for people with short to medium length fine to average thickness hair, and will provide a lasting hold throughout the day and well into the humid night.</li>
            <li>Texture is more gooey, but that&#x27;s expected coming out of a squeeze</li>
            <li>Very efficient as well.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t really run your fingers through your hair</li>
            <li>This \\&quot;gum\\&quot; is much easier to apply too as it comes out in a toothpaste-like consistency that is easier to lather before applying.</li>
            <li>This styling gum really holds well, but stays pliable.</li>
            <li>Straight out of the tube it looks like a lotion or cream, but once worked into my hair</li>
            <li>Although he prefers the Dirt since it&#x27;s what he&#x27;s used to, he has also been using this a lot, and really likes</li>
            <li>he didn&#x27;t have to use much to get the style he wanted.  </li>
            <li>but it leaves a nice \\&quot;messy look\\&quot; after you brush it out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the strongest hold I&#x27;ve ever used, but it makes a nice compromise between stiff and hold.</li>
            <li>That said, this cream is still better than the other brand and doesn&#x27;t cause itchiness to the scalp or too much dirt feeling to the hair.</li>
            <li>so the texture changes pretty drastically from the time I start using it to the time I throw it away (usually not fully done).</li>
            <li>I normally make sure my hands are wet and then rub it between my hands,  the gel alone would be very sticky.</li>
            <li>It also washes off your fingers really easily, with no messy residue left behind.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i think you could easily use too much if you aren&#x27;t careful.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply as long as you rub it extensive on your fingers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really liking these new styling products by Axe.</li>
            <li>Scent is decent, non-irritating, washes out easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a couple other Axe Spiking products (Glues), and this one&#x27;s as strong</li>
            <li>Once dried, the product&#x27;s scent all but vanishes, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it clashing with your favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>but he more often uses it for the \\&quot;messy look\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>When it comes to a hair styling products that I&#x27;d recommend Messy Look Styling Gum by Axe is one that is at the top of my list.</li>
            <li>I even use this on my 5-year-old&#x27;s hair and it does a great job with a casual look for kids too, as in,</li>
            <li>Washing out is easy and very little is needed to give the nice results you want for a messy look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Axe Messy Look styling gum is perfect if you like the dry messy look that isnt greasy.</li>
            <li>With my old paste, I could apply it on dry out-of-the shower hair for a clean hold that didn&#x27;t make my hair look or feel like there was anything in it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have that typical AXE smell of strong teenage-boy scent....</li>
            <li>Now the final product doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; different per se, but with more hold it definitely prevents your hair from looking/feeling product-free (which I prefer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t keep my hair in place for more than a couple of hours, but after applying just a small amount of water it reactivated the Gum and continued to hold.</li>
            <li>At $7 this Axe \\&quot;Messy Look\\&quot; hair product is a good value (compared to the price of other hair products I purchase).  </li>
            <li>It holds as firmly as a hair spray while being easy to apply with your hands like hair gel.</li>
            <li>He normally keeps his hair short but did use this before he got his hair cut and said it worked very well.</li>
            <li>small also dissipates pretty quickly, and, after about five minutes</li>
            <li>It holds strong all day without that stiff plastered look.</li>
            <li>Unlike other products he uses, I didn&#x27;t notice a strong smell and preferred this product, simply because of that.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t visibly stiff, so aesthetically it looks fine</li>
            <li>I think this is a great product, especially for being an Axe product, which are known for over-the-top commercials rather than</li>
            <li>I can the fact that I am gradually turning into an old geezer.  </li>
            <li>Beware if you have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It goes on white at first but quickly dissolves into a firm holding substance.</li>
            <li>He said it was easy to apply (he doesn&#x27;t use any hair products on a daily basis), that he only had to use a little amount and it made his hair have a little more body without having a noticeable smell or appearance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice look (and I&#x27;ve found that it kind of helps my thinning hair look a little less thin than the Glues).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First off, this product is similar, but it NOT the same.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a typical axe smell</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways, I&#x27;ll be sticking to the old Messy Look Paste, but this might still be a good product for people looking for something with serious hold.</li>
            <li>though a guy my age should, I suppose, be super well groomed appearing, I like this styling my hair to be messy sometimes.  </li>
            <li>look that you sometimes can&#x27;t even get out without a major wash session.</li>
            <li>but short.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t use other hair products because as with blond hair, most make my hair look greasy, crunchy, or just plain try-hard.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes, it&#x27;ll leave a white residue which is clearly visible in my hair when the product dries.</li>
            <li>but I really wanted to give it a minus 10.</li>
            <li>Not firm hold, only medium hold.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>It feels kind of like industrial glue coming out of the tube and smells faintly of coconut.  </li>
            <li>Fun to make messy styles with this styling \\&quot;gum\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>It holds up to humidity very well, is strong enough to tame waves, and doesn&#x27;t flake off if you mess with it.</li>
            <li>As my hair gets longer it really clumps up into spikes, unless you really work hard at it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the fragrance, but for this large tube and the results I can overlook it!</li>
            <li>Good hold with a very separated look; annoying scent.</li>
            <li>morning application, hair was a little &#x27;crispy&#x27; when first applied.</li>
            <li>The styling product applies really easy, and like all the other Axe products I&#x27;ve tried, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>If you do use a little too much there might be some whit residue.</li>
            <li>It dries a little to fast for me.  </li>
            <li>Something that clearly shows I put effort into my intentional messy look, but nothing wild or attention grabbing.  </li>

            <li> This \\&quot;gum\\&quot; is much easier to apply too as it comes out in a toothpaste-like consistency that is easier to lather before applying.</li>
            <li> This styling gum really holds well, but stays pliable.</li>
            <li> Straight out of the tube it looks like a lotion or cream, but once worked into my hair</li>
            <li> Although he prefers the Dirt since it&#x27;s what he&#x27;s used to, he has also been using this a lot, and really likes</li>
            <li> he didn&#x27;t have to use much to get the style he wanted.  </li>
            <li> but it leaves a nice \\&quot;messy look\\&quot; after you brush it out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the strongest hold I&#x27;ve ever used, but it makes a nice compromise between stiff and hold.</li>
            <li> That said, this cream is still better than the other brand and doesn&#x27;t cause itchiness to the scalp or too much dirt feeling to the hair.</li>
            <li> so the texture changes pretty drastically from the time I start using it to the time I throw it away (usually not fully done).</li>
            <li> I normally make sure my hands are wet and then rub it between my hands,  the gel alone would be very sticky.</li>
            <li> It also washes off your fingers really easily, with no messy residue left behind.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i think you could easily use too much if you aren&#x27;t careful.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply as long as you rub it extensive on your fingers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really liking these new styling products by Axe.</li>
            <li> Scent is decent, non-irritating, washes out easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple other Axe Spiking products (Glues), and this one&#x27;s as strong</li>
            <li> Once dried, the product&#x27;s scent all but vanishes, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it clashing with your favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> but he more often uses it for the \\&quot;messy look\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> When it comes to a hair styling products that I&#x27;d recommend Messy Look Styling Gum by Axe is one that is at the top of my list.</li>
            <li> I even use this on my 5-year-old&#x27;s hair and it does a great job with a casual look for kids too, as in,</li>
            <li> Washing out is easy and very little is needed to give the nice results you want for a messy look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Axe Messy Look styling gum is perfect if you like the dry messy look that isnt greasy.</li>
            <li> With my old paste, I could apply it on dry out-of-the shower hair for a clean hold that didn&#x27;t make my hair look or feel like there was anything in it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have that typical AXE smell of strong teenage-boy scent....</li>
            <li> Now the final product doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; different per se, but with more hold it definitely prevents your hair from looking/feeling product-free (which I prefer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t keep my hair in place for more than a couple of hours, but after applying just a small amount of water it reactivated the Gum and continued to hold.</li>
            <li> At $7 this Axe \\&quot;Messy Look\\&quot; hair product is a good value (compared to the price of other hair products I purchase).  </li>
            <li> It holds as firmly as a hair spray while being easy to apply with your hands like hair gel.</li>
            <li> He normally keeps his hair short but did use this before he got his hair cut and said it worked very well.</li>
            <li> small also dissipates pretty quickly, and, after about five minutes</li>
            <li> It holds strong all day without that stiff plastered look.</li>
            <li> Unlike other products he uses, I didn&#x27;t notice a strong smell and preferred this product, simply because of that.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t visibly stiff, so aesthetically it looks fine</li>
            <li> I think this is a great product, especially for being an Axe product, which are known for over-the-top commercials rather than</li>
            <li> I can the fact that I am gradually turning into an old geezer.  </li>
            <li> Beware if you have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It goes on white at first but quickly dissolves into a firm holding substance.</li>
            <li> He said it was easy to apply (he doesn&#x27;t use any hair products on a daily basis), that he only had to use a little amount and it made his hair have a little more body without having a noticeable smell or appearance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice look (and I&#x27;ve found that it kind of helps my thinning hair look a little less thin than the Glues).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First off, this product is similar, but it NOT the same.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a typical axe smell</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways, I&#x27;ll be sticking to the old Messy Look Paste, but this might still be a good product for people looking for something with serious hold.</li>
            <li> though a guy my age should, I suppose, be super well groomed appearing, I like this styling my hair to be messy sometimes.  </li>
            <li> look that you sometimes can&#x27;t even get out without a major wash session.</li>
            <li> but short.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t use other hair products because as with blond hair, most make my hair look greasy, crunchy, or just plain try-hard.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes, it&#x27;ll leave a white residue which is clearly visible in my hair when the product dries.</li>
            <li> but I really wanted to give it a minus 10.</li>
            <li> Not firm hold, only medium hold.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> It feels kind of like industrial glue coming out of the tube and smells faintly of coconut.  </li>
            <li> Fun to make messy styles with this styling \\&quot;gum\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> It holds up to humidity very well, is strong enough to tame waves, and doesn&#x27;t flake off if you mess with it.</li>
            <li> As my hair gets longer it really clumps up into spikes, unless you really work hard at it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the fragrance, but for this large tube and the results I can overlook it!</li>
            <li> Good hold with a very separated look; annoying scent.</li>
            <li> morning application, hair was a little &#x27;crispy&#x27; when first applied.</li>
            <li> The styling product applies really easy, and like all the other Axe products I&#x27;ve tried, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> If you do use a little too much there might be some whit residue.</li>
            <li> It dries a little to fast for me.  </li>
            <li> Something that clearly shows I put effort into my intentional messy look, but nothing wild or attention grabbing.  </li>
            <li> This Gum on the other hand has much more of a gluey attribute to it.</li>
            <li> The bottle will last him a long time, but he told me it was definitely something he would like me to purchase again and will use.</li>
            <li> I found this Axe product a but too thick, but it did a pretty gppd job keeping my hair slicked back, the way I prefer to wear it.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> This has been my new go-to hair wax for the last few years ever since Schwartzkopf discontinued their Osis Marsh-Mellow Molding paste.</li>
            <li> I had used the paste in the past, but the product packaging took up too much space in my carry-on.</li>
            <li> lay flat hairgel.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times myself just to change up my look a bit from my normal</li>
            <li> Hair is firm but not hard</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> This styling gum has less exact hold than the spiking glue, so if you want a little flexibility then this is your product.</li>
            <li> Easier to use than the crude clay &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34; kind of stuff I used to use, too.</li>
            <li> a litte goes a long way-just a dab will do it....</li>
            <li> Only use on dryish hair if you don&#x27;t want your hair to look wet all day.</li>
            <li> There is a strange odor to it, but I guess you will get used to it.</li>
            <li> Consequently, one tube of the stuff lasts me a long time.</li>
            <li> From a guy&#x27;s point of view: I had been using hair gel for the past many years with poor results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used other hair wax/paste products, so I don&#x27;t know whether they function the same as this.</li>
            <li> like to use this to piece out my bangs a little---they were trimmed a little too short last time</li>
            <li> If you need to revive it you can work damp hands through your hair and it will continue to hold when dry.</li>
            <li> It can be uncrunched once the hair is dry</li>
            <li> Wild, crazy and fun.  </li>
            <li> I find myself having to wet my hands to style my hair if I wait to long after my shower.</li>
            <li> I have thin/fine blond hair, so it&#x27;s naturally very fluffy or wild at the slightest gust of wind at any length</li>
            <li> I know this is marketed towards men, but it&#x27;s actually VERY similar to Garnier&#x27;s styling gum sold for women, and about half the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also seem to get varying results depending on just how wet my hair is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of AXE products, and had been using the messy look paste.  </li>
            <li> Be careful -</li>
            <li> but that was not really the</li>
            <li> it on men&#x27;s thick, slightly longer, straight dark</li>
            <li> As an added benefit, it is stiff enough that when I wake up I don&#x27;t have that squashed hair</li>
            <li> Not much to say other than it works for my hairstyle.  </li>
            <li> It is easier to apply, doesn&#x27;t dry out over time, and you can use a lot less of it.</li>
            <li> Messy Look Paste&amp;#34; (not to be confused with this &amp;#34;Gum&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way with product.</li>
            <li> You really really only need a small amount of product.</li>
            <li> I hope it doesn&#x27;t bother other people.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unlike any other gel-type product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> small dab of this is all you need if you have shorter hair, and it holds until your next shampoo.  </li>
            <li> product does make the hair look messy, but it does stay in place all day long.  </li>
            <li> I can use a little dab to create a messy-but-styled look, or I can wet my hair and use a lot to create a hardcore spike look.</li>
            <li> it is hard enough, but to have him put product in it?  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes as a thick, white paste.</li>
            <li> Without styling, my hair will just settle down and look like a bowl</li>
            <li> But this product, it lets me have an organized chaotic look and stays the same way for the duration of the day (at least twelve hours), and say I have to change my t-shirt, I can mess with the hair again and restyle it.</li>
            <li> hold on this product is much stronger however, and is a little over-the-top for me.</li>
            <li> Smell is inconsequential since it&#x27;s not very strong.</li>
            <li> We went to a black tie event where he used it to part his hair</li>
            <li> I found that it held well, but it has an odd, sticky sort of texture.  </li>
            <li> one complaint with the paste however is that it tends to dry out by the time I&#x27;m half-way through using it</li>
            <li> Product does seem a little pricey</li>
            <li> My husband used it on the front of his hair when it was still a little damp, and it dried into a piecy yet not punk look.</li>
            <li> I found the Messy Look Gum.</li>
            <li> Gels either make his hair flaky or limp in a few hours but not with this.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and regular gels don&#x27;t stop it from blowing around.  </li>
            <li> Gum Messy Look is no exception to that discovery.</li>
            <li> My son also likes it (since is hair is messy anyway).  </li>
            <li> Axe Styling Gum messy look is stickier than the Axe styling cream and makes hair stick together in streaks.  </li>
            <li> The Axe Styling Gum does give a messy look</li>
            <li> As an FYI for those who have used the Axe whatever messy look paste and are wondering, this product is not like it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just way to stiff and not at all what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li> The hair was too stiff or would \\&quot;melt\\&quot; by the end of the day, and once you touch it, it was all ruined.</li>
            <li> This usually pools within the paste itself.</li>
            <li> Put a small two-pea size amount on your fingertips, rub it together, then run through your hair while it&#x27;s somewhat damp.</li>
            <li> so let&#x27;s not go overboard here\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> anyway, my son used this a few times and says he likes it although it is a bit thick.  </li>
            <li> Product leaves hair hard and spiked up.</li>
            <li> , it was just hard to get used to the texture.  </li>
            <li> Hard to work with.</li>
            <li> fragrance is slight, but not overwhelming like I was afraid it would be from previous comments I have seen about Axe</li>
            <li> so it loses one star</li>
            <li> I thought it would be like thick gel</li>
            <li> asked him if he would try to use this Messy Look Gum and he was not happy with me.  </li>
            <li> and when you try to get it not crispy after, it looks like you just got out of a tornado full of horrible barbers who have it out for you and tried clipping your hair as they flew by</li>
            <li> It is not too difficult to comb out, but still holds the look you want without trouble.  </li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s a little disappointing...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also works as a gel if you thin it on your hands with a couple of drops of water.</li>
            <li> My husband has hated the various Axe styling gums for this reason, and he doesn&#x27;t plan on using them again.</li>
            <li> I was afraid this stylig \\&quot;gum\\&quot; would leave a tacky, sticky residue</li>
            <li> This styling gum is a bit sticky which some may find it unpleasant to work with.  </li>
            <li> feeling &#x27;disgusting&#x27; as some products</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Not much to say other than it works for my hairstyle.  I like that it has a matte finish and doesn&#x27;t take a lot of time or effort to achieve my style.  It also lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Awesome hair product. I use it every day and my hair looks great. I&#x27;ll never go back to anything else.</li>
            <li> So I personally like the &amp;#34;Axe Messy Look Paste&amp;#34; (not to be confused with this &amp;#34;Gum&amp;#34;). I think this is a great product, especially for being an Axe product, which are known for over-the-top commercials rather than good products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint with the paste however is that it tends to dry out by the time I&#x27;m half-way through using it so the texture changes pretty drastically from the time I start using it to the time I throw it away (usually not fully done). Additionally, the product doesn&#x27;t seal air-tight (probably why it dries out) so I&#x27;ll actually get moisture in the container from the shower condensation. This usually pools within the paste itself. Ironically I actually use this moisture to prevent the paste from drying out like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To deal with this, I thought I&#x27;d check if Axe made the same product in a different container, and viola! I found the Messy Look Gum. However, it&#x27;s a little disappointing... First off, this product is similar, but it NOT the same. The texture, color, smell, and hold are all different. Color doesn&#x27;t matter since it fades when worked into the hair. Smell is inconsequential since it&#x27;s not very strong. Texture is more gooey, but that&#x27;s expected coming out of a squeeze tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hold on this product is much stronger however, and is a little over-the-top for me. With my old paste, I could apply it on dry out-of-the shower hair for a clean hold that didn&#x27;t make my hair look or feel like there was anything in it. You could run your hands through my hair without knowing I had anything in my hair (besides my hair holding). This Gum on the other hand has much more of a gluey attribute to it. Running your hand through your hair, you&#x27;ll feel a lot of your hairs stuck together (though it won&#x27;t come off on your hands). Now the final product doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; different per se, but with more hold it definitely prevents your hair from looking/feeling product-free (which I prefer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I&#x27;ll be sticking to the old Messy Look Paste, but this might still be a good product for people looking for something with serious hold.</li>
            <li> This is a great product I am currently using to mask as best I can the fact that I am gradually turning into an old geezer.  As an added benefit, it is stiff enough that when I wake up I don&#x27;t have that squashed hair look that you sometimes can&#x27;t even get out without a major wash session. Great stuff. Easier to use than the crude clay &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34; kind of stuff I used to use, too.</li>
            <li> I love love love love this hair gum by AXE!!!I tried many different Gels on my six-year-old son&#x27;s hair. And none of them work as well as this does. Gels either make his hair flaky or limp in a few hours but not with this. I love it, and so does my husband who also uses it since I started buying it for my son :-)</li>
            <li> This has been my new go-to hair wax for the last few years ever since Schwartzkopf discontinued their Osis Marsh-Mellow Molding paste. I tried the Schwartzkopf Osis Flex Wax but it left my hair looking too greasy and just did not feel the same. The Axe Messy Look styling gum is perfect if you like the dry messy look that isnt greasy. I find that it adequately holds my hair up all day. For my hair and style I find that its best to apply by first smearing the wax all over my palms and then running my hands through my hair. This has been the best method for evenly applying it to my hair. Also, I find that it works best on dry hair.</li>
            <li> Works well why my hair is on the shorter side. As my hair gets longer it really clumps up into spikes, unless you really work hard at it. You really really only need a small amount of product. Think pea-sized or smaller. I also seem to get varying results depending on just how wet my hair is.</li>
            <li> I love it. Very easy to apply as long as you rub it extensive on your fingers. After styling with the product, use hair blower to give additional volume to your hair without losing any holding power.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of AXE products, and had been using the messy look paste.  I like the Gum much better.  It is easier to apply, doesn&#x27;t dry out over time, and you can use a lot less of it.</li>
            <li> it looks good and works great.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Very efficient as well.</li>
            <li> not as good as the messy paste, it makes your hair crispy and when you try to get it not crispy after, it looks like you just got out of a tornado full of horrible barbers who have it out for you and tried clipping your hair as they flew by</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and regular gels don&#x27;t stop it from blowing around.  This gel keeps hair in place.  I normally make sure my hands are wet and then rub it between my hands,  the gel alone would be very sticky.</li>
            <li> a litte goes a long way-just a dab will do it....</li>
            <li> Great product!  I will be purchasing axe styling gum for eternity.</li>
            <li> its all ok, perfect service</li>
            <li> Three stars says \\&quot;It&#x27;s OK\\&quot; - I&#x27;m not that fond of this because it does leave a gummy feel in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for something which has a TON of hold, this is it.  It will hold any look in your hair.  It feels kind of like industrial glue coming out of the tube and smells faintly of coconut.  Be careful - just a pea sized drop is all you need.  Rub on fingertips and have at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also works as a gel if you thin it on your hands with a couple of drops of water.</li>
            <li> I really liked this styling gum. It is thicker than regular gel, which I liked. Gives my hair a messy look that is really popular right now.</li>
            <li> Love axe products for the smell and the quality. This one has a very strong hold, for your outdoor windy situations. Recommended.</li>
            <li> After years, or rather decades, from teen years on I&#x27;ve battled having a tousled look.  Now, it&#x27;s the thing, and though a guy my age should, I suppose, be super well groomed appearing, I like this styling my hair to be messy sometimes.  That said, of the Axe products, this is the one which helps me achieve my desired effect the easiest.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Of all the styling products on the market, I wouldn&#x27;t have imagined in a million years that Axe products would top the list as my favorite. Axe Styling Gum Messy Look is no exception to that discovery. The styling product applies really easy, and like all the other Axe products I&#x27;ve tried, a little bit goes a long way. The hold is great for people with short to medium length fine to average thickness hair, and will provide a lasting hold throughout the day and well into the humid night. Once dried, the product&#x27;s scent all but vanishes, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it clashing with your favorite cologne. It holds up to humidity very well, is strong enough to tame waves, and doesn&#x27;t flake off if you mess with it.</li>
            <li> This white and easy-to-apply product holds your hair in place for many, many hours. It almost lasts up to 18 hours. Unlike you may assume, this is not a gel, but a white lotion-like product that you have to take the time to rub into your hair. I would not call this a \\&quot;dab and dash\\&quot; product. You will need time to work it into your hair and then achieve the desired look. The packaging is trendy and effective and the scent of the product is quite mild compared to other Axe products.</li>
            <li> Fun to make messy styles with this styling \\&quot;gum\\&quot;.  Wild, crazy and fun.  Ok, as wild and crazy as a man can get with short hair.  As always, the terrific scent of Axe!</li>
            <li> The Axe Styling Gum does give you extra hold in order to get whatever look you are going for. I have curly hair and it doesn&#x27;t kink it up or straighten it out. It just holds in strongly in place without looking dorky.</li>
            <li> I gave this gel to my brother and he has used it often. We went to a black tie event where he used it to part his hair but he more often uses it for the \\&quot;messy look\\&quot;. Both work great.&lt;br /&gt;In case you are worried, it doesn&#x27;t have a strong Axe smell!</li>
            <li> When it comes to a hair styling products that I&#x27;d recommend Messy Look Styling Gum by Axe is one that is at the top of my list. I&#x27;ve tried this product with both short hair and longer hair and it worked great. I can use a little dab to create a messy-but-styled look, or I can wet my hair and use a lot to create a hardcore spike look. I&#x27;ve compared this product against the messy look line paste and gravity defying dust from Axe and this is by far the best product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t matter if you are looking to create that perfect party-in-the-front flair to your fashion mullet or duplicate that unwavering court room part of Harvey Specter, this is the product for you. ;)</li>
            <li> This product works great and does an excellent job oh holding up spiked hair. Put this on in the morning and it was still working at the end of the day. Product leaves hair hard and spiked up. If you do use a little too much there might be some whit residue. A little bit goes a long way with product. Will definitely use again. Product does seem a little pricey so it loses one star but it does work unlike son cheaper products though. Will use again.</li>
            <li> I got this thinking it would be good for the men in my life.  But it was not to be.  I thought it would be like thick gel but that was not really the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is probably going to be ok for you people who are used to getting this styling gum.  But not for people who have never used it and are just \\&quot;trying it out\\&quot; to see.  It&#x27;s just way to stiff and not at all what I was expecting.  It made the hair feel kind of yucky to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This should be left to the pros and not novices I guess!  Oh well!</li>
            <li> Beware if you have sensitive skin.  It caused me an allergice reaction.  I had to give&lt;br /&gt;it one star but I really wanted to give it a minus 10.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  The only gel my husband will use.  Only use on dryish hair if you don&#x27;t want your hair to look wet all day.</li>
            <li> I have thin/fine blond hair, so it&#x27;s naturally very fluffy or wild at the slightest gust of wind at any length but short.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t use other hair products because as with blond hair, most make my hair look greasy, crunchy, or just plain try-hard.  I wanted something that allowed me to keep my hair in an intended look.  Something that clearly shows I put effort into my intentional messy look, but nothing wild or attention grabbing.  This product keeps it in place without looking like anything more than just that :) No complaints.  Been using this every day for about 4 years now, to be honest. Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product is as described: gummy. It makes my hair stick together and look like there is a glue holding it together with the added bonus of a greasy look. While, I like the look of separation as my hair is a bit curly, I don&#x27;t like the greasy glue look. Smells great, but just doesn&#x27;t quite get the job done. Back to the drawing board.</li>
            <li> Axe styling gum has a very different texture than the gel I am used to using.  I found that it held well, but it has an odd, sticky sort of texture.  You can&#x27;t really run your fingers through your hair w/out doing a double-take.  It isn&#x27;t visibly stiff, so aesthetically it looks fine, it was just hard to get used to the texture.  My wife also tried it, and liked the amount of hold, but also thought the texture was odd.  It worked for my short hair and her chin length hair.  A good choice for when control matters more to you than softness.  Or if you don&#x27;t reflexively run your fingers through your hair all the time, this product would be perfect for you.</li>
            <li> I gave this product to my son to try out. He is 12 and came back to me with raving reviews! He said it was easy to apply (he doesn&#x27;t use any hair products on a daily basis), that he only had to use a little amount and it made his hair have a little more body without having a noticeable smell or appearance. I could tell that he had done something to his hair, but the hair didn&#x27;t appear matted or shiny, it just looked fuller and ... well, just more \\&quot;finished\\&quot; than his normal appearance. Unlike other products he uses, I didn&#x27;t notice a strong smell and preferred this product, simply because of that. Lastly he was able to wash it out VERY EASILY. This was a plus as he was concerned about getting it out, as he can&#x27;t wear certain hairstyles at his school. The bottle will last him a long time, but he told me it was definitely something he would like me to purchase again and will use. So this is a keeper for us!</li>
            <li> Best Hair product I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> It dries a little to fast for me.  I find myself having to wet my hands to style my hair if I wait to long after my shower.</li>
            <li> I like this hair gel. Makes my short hair stay put without getting it oily, and lasts all day. It&#x27;s not the strongest hold I&#x27;ve ever used, but it makes a nice compromise between stiff and hold. I had to buy it online because I cannot find it in brick-and-mortar stores anymore.</li>
            <li> From a guy&#x27;s point of view: I had been using hair gel for the past many years with poor results. The hair was too stiff or would \\&quot;melt\\&quot; by the end of the day, and once you touch it, it was all ruined. So I resorted to keeping short hair. Then came a day when I didn&#x27;t have the time to get a hair cut, and happened to discover this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is absolutely amazing. Without styling, my hair will just settle down and look like a bowl but. But this product, it lets me have an organized chaotic look and stays the same way for the duration of the day (at least twelve hours), and say I have to change my t-shirt, I can mess with the hair again and restyle it. Amazing! Definitely a keeper and a returning customer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes as a thick, white paste. Put a small two-pea size amount on your fingertips, rub it together, then run through your hair while it&#x27;s somewhat damp. It will be invisible in your hair and leave a non-shiny appearance. There is a strange odor to it, but I guess you will get used to it. I hope it doesn&#x27;t bother other people. It&#x27;s not a typical axe smell I&#x27;m used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used other hair wax/paste products, so I don&#x27;t know whether they function the same as this. But looking at the primary ingredients it looks like it forms a thin film around the hair and locks moisture in and out to maintain the \\&quot;fullness\\&quot; of the hair.</li>
            <li> At $7 this Axe \\&quot;Messy Look\\&quot; hair product is a good value (compared to the price of other hair products I purchase).  I&#x27;ve used it a few times myself just to change up my look a bit from my normal lay flat hairgel.  This Messy does create kind of a cool hair look.  My son also likes it (since is hair is messy anyway).  Scent is decent, non-irritating, washes out easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again, overall 5-stars from me for price/value.</li>
            <li> Not firm hold, only medium hold.&lt;br /&gt;For a daily hair gel user like me, this one is not suited for short hair.&lt;br /&gt;It gives ok spiky look but doesn&#x27;t hold all day.</li>
            <li> I found this Axe product a but too thick, but it did a pretty gppd job keeping my hair slicked back, the way I prefer to wear it.&lt;br /&gt;For me a a thinner formula hair gel works better.</li>
            <li> I was afraid this stylig \\&quot;gum\\&quot; would leave a tacky, sticky residue but it doesn&#x27;t.  Hair is firm but not hard and it&#x27;s not sticky.  There is definitely a texture too it but nothing unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is clean and fresh too.</li>
            <li> I bought this for air travel. I had used the paste in the past, but the product packaging took up too much space in my carry-on. This \\&quot;gum\\&quot; is much easier to apply too as it comes out in a toothpaste-like consistency that is easier to lather before applying.</li>
            <li> My son has used every product Axe makes and is looking forward to making this a part of his grooming routine. He normally keeps his hair short but did use this before he got his hair cut and said it worked very well.</li>
            <li> Axe Styling Gum Messy Look is one of the best Axe hair styling products in their current line. I also have the Gel, which I am less impressed with. The Gum has much better holding power and it leaves a nice matte finish. It goes on white at first but quickly dissolves into a firm holding substance. It didn&#x27;t keep my hair in place for more than a couple of hours, but after applying just a small amount of water it reactivated the Gum and continued to hold. I have other products that I prefer, but this is the best in the Axe line. I will use this with confidence when I run out of my preferred product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really liking these new styling products by Axe. This styling gum really holds well, but stays pliable. It&#x27;s unlike any other gel-type product I&#x27;ve used. Straight out of the tube it looks like a lotion or cream, but once worked into my hair it&#x27;s not sticky. It holds strong all day without that stiff plastered look. It smells great too. I even use this on my 5-year-old&#x27;s hair and it does a great job with a casual look for kids too, as in, \\&quot;I styled my hair but I&#x27;m still a kid so let&#x27;s not go overboard here\\&quot;. If you need to revive it you can work damp hands through your hair and it will continue to hold when dry. Washes out easily in the shower. This styling gum has less exact hold than the spiking glue, so if you want a little flexibility then this is your product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used hair spray, mousse, gel, wax, and such in my hair through the years, and Axe Spiking Gum (and their Glues) ranks up there with my favorite of these products. It holds as firmly as a hair spray while being easy to apply with your hands like hair gel. I&#x27;ve used a couple other Axe Spiking products (Glues), and this one&#x27;s as strong but it leaves a nice \\&quot;messy look\\&quot; after you brush it out. It&#x27;s a nice look (and I&#x27;ve found that it kind of helps my thinning hair look a little less thin than the Glues).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 3.2 oz size means that you can take in your carry-on baggage for a plane flight - it just slips under the TSA&#x27;s 3.4 oz limit for liquids and gels. That&#x27;s rather nice...though I&#x27;ve TSA agents check the size of the package many times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got a pleasant smell and just a bit - a drop - is needed to style my hair. Consequently, one tube of the stuff lasts me a long time.</li>
            <li> Axe Styling Gum messy look is stickier than the Axe styling cream and makes hair stick together in streaks.  I like the Axe styling cream better.  That said, this cream is still better than the other brand and doesn&#x27;t cause itchiness to the scalp or too much dirt feeling to the hair.</li>
            <li> I picked this up for my husband, whose go-to product for the last ten years has been Jonathan Dirt.  Although he prefers the Dirt since it&#x27;s what he&#x27;s used to, he has also been using this a lot, and really likes it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A small dab of this is all you need if you have shorter hair, and it holds until your next shampoo.  It also washes off your fingers really easily, with no messy residue left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small also dissipates pretty quickly, and, after about five minutes, I can&#x27;t even smell it on him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great product for this price range, and definitely gives higher-end products a run for their money.</li>
            <li> I have a son who hates to do his hair.  Getting him to comb it is hard enough, but to have him put product in it?  He just can not be bothered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked him if he would try to use this Messy Look Gum and he was not happy with me.  However, he has been using it ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does make the hair look messy, but it does stay in place all day long.  It is not too difficult to comb out, but still holds the look you want without trouble.  Washing out is easy and very little is needed to give the nice results you want for a messy look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is slight, but not overwhelming like I was afraid it would be from previous comments I have seen about Axe products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will have to say for my son using this product is in itself a huge testimony to how easy it is to use and how nice it is to work with.  The performance seems to be really nice too and holds well over an entire day.  It often holds the next day too if you work just a bit with it.</li>
            <li> This Axe product did a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used it on men&#x27;s thick, slightly longer, straight dark hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less sticky when applying and didn&#x27;t leave hair feeling &#x27;disgusting&#x27; as some products might.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon morning application, hair was a little &#x27;crispy&#x27; when first applied.</li>
            <li> You get a good messy look that stays, but the smell is SO sweet and strong. My husband has hated the various Axe styling gums for this reason, and he doesn&#x27;t plan on using them again. It&#x27;s to the point that they gave him headaches. Good hold with a very separated look; annoying scent.</li>
            <li> Please note that this is a styling gum not a gel.  My son also likes to spike his hair so we tried it out for that purpose too and it just did not provide the needed hold.  This styling gum is a bit sticky which some may find it unpleasant to work with.  The Axe Styling Gum does give a messy look so just consider what it is and what it is not.  The 3.2 ounce tube size seems ideal for travel.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for my hair type. Sometimes, it&#x27;ll leave a white residue which is clearly visible in my hair when the product dries. Hard to work with. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no hair expert, but my hair looks better with some sort of styling product in it. This stuff requires no skill to use, holds really well, looks good, lasts, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp as some do.</li>
            <li> I know this is marketed towards men, but it&#x27;s actually VERY similar to Garnier&#x27;s styling gum sold for women, and about half the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to use this to piece out my bangs a little---they were trimmed a little too short last time so now they want so stick out all over. I like how just a tiny amount of this styling paste gives them weight and cohesion and pieced-together look. My husband used it on the front of his hair when it was still a little damp, and it dried into a piecy yet not punk look. Don&#x27;t get too carried away with the product though, or you&#x27;ll get something akin to boogers in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have that typical AXE smell of strong teenage-boy scent....it doesn&#x27;t last very long but it&#x27;s there. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the fragrance, but for this large tube and the results I can overlook it! Plus both of us can use the same product.</li>
            <li> unlike most Axe products, this does not have a really strong smell (which is a plus to me, but my son likes the smells.)  anyway, my son used this a few times and says he likes it although it is a bit thick.  he just rubs it in his hands and fingers it through his hair.  he didn&#x27;t have to use much to get the style he wanted.  i think you could easily use too much if you aren&#x27;t careful.</li>
            <li> As an FYI for those who have used the Axe whatever messy look paste and are wondering, this product is not like it.  This product leaves hair crunchy.  It can be uncrunched once the hair is dry but I still prefer the paste that leaves the hair with no crunchiness.</li>
