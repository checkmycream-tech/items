            <li>My husband says it is the best nose/ear hair trimmer he&#x27;s ever used.</li>

            <li>Very good product and shipping time was great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Nose Hair trimmer is really very good.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>The casing is not metallic but plastic and although it looks very nice</li>
            <li>But from my experience with it, it is very good and very easy to be use.</li>
            <li>works on one battery, works great, very safe and takes care of both ear and nose hair.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used trimmers of this kind over the years and none of them have worked as well or with the ease of use as the Panasonic.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and has never nicked my skin.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s highly satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t have been more in error concerning this trimmer.</li>
            <li>I bought the  Panasonic ER421KC Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer for my boyfriend which I like better.</li>
            <li>IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A BETTER NOSE TRIMMER GET THE PANASONIC \\&quot;NOSE/EAR</li>
            <li>To be more specific it doesn&#x27;t look as fancy but it does look very good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easily disassembled (for cleaning purposes) and reassembled.</li>
            <li>but like they say, first impressions are very important and this unit has indeed given me a good first impression.</li>
            <li>It operates on a single AA battery, it&#x27;s the perfect size, it&#x27;s not too loud, it does not pull hair, it cuts amazingly well, and it&#x27;s $14.  </li>
            <li>It is just cheap plastic.  </li>
            <li>This product has worked fine, and the price was right.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll end up with a nose/ear full of hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s painless and quick.</li>
            <li>I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other nose hair trimmers and this one by far does the best job.</li>
            <li>My first Panasonic trimmer worked fairly well but only lasted a year before the blades wore out.  </li>
            <li>Great little product.</li>
            <li>I find my 2 year old Norelco beard trimmer better looking than this unit.</li>
            <li>Very nice design and do its work without pulling your little hairs, and like always very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>unit is attractive looking with a dark and light blue metallic-looking combination.</li>
            <li>It is my first time to buy one</li>
            <li>After looking at the various clippers available, I purchased this one and it works as good, if not better, than the first one.</li>
            <li>In all, with the complaints of so many trimmers here on Amazon, I&#x27;m glad I took a chance on this one that only had two previous reviews.</li>
            <li>Its a nice little utility tool that every man should have.</li>
            <li>It nose-trimmed very well and the process was both effortless and painless (have not tried using it for my ears</li>
            <li>The motor makes the blades spin quite fast (rotary blades) which is what makes the trimming painless and the blades themselves are surrounded by a plastic casing to prevent injuries, it works well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank You Much</li>
            <li>Has a firm grip and a nice touch too.</li>
            <li>I appreciated the customer reviews for this particular item.</li>
            <li>Much better than a more expensive one I had &lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>EVEN PUT A NEW BATTERY IN IT.</li>
            <li>is the first time I have actually bought a nose hair trimmer</li>
            <li>First, I will note that I have only used this trimmer for nose hair.  </li>
            <li>When it did work, it cut only adequately with occasional pulls.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know the model number of the first one I bought, but it was black and silver and although it wore out very quickly it did a better job of cutting hair than this new model.</li>
            <li>My only problem with it is that although it does trim the hair, its pretty useless when it comes to catching hair.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised after buying this product that it delivered exactly what had been promised in other reviews.</li>
            <li>The blade is to far recessed into the unit to trim hair short.  </li>
            <li>It has only pulled one hair so far.</li>
            <li>After reading many of the reviews for other brands and some other Panasonic trimmers I decided to take a chance with this one that had no reviews and really not much info on it whatsoever.</li>
            <li>This one is not constructed the same way as my last one and it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as the one it replaced.  </li>

            <li> I took the risk based on how poor the ratings and reviews were for most of the other similar products on the site</li>
            <li> only concernfor now will be how long it will last.</li>
            <li> this item does the job, cute and slim but it does pull the nose hairs when its cutting so its kinda hurts.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s used it several times and now he doesn&#x27;t whince before using it, no need to brace himself because this one doesn&#x27;t rip hair like the other ones he&#x27;s used before.</li>
            <li> But I am guessing a single battery will last plenty so those are really not drawbacks methinks!  </li>
            <li> My problem would be if the unit would die at any time before at least six months of normal use.</li>
            <li> This is the second Panasonic nose hair trimmer I&#x27;ve owned, and sadly I prefer the first.  </li>
            <li> The unit (the blades) as stated in the user&#x27;s manual is supposed to last for 2 years if used on a single 1 minute session each week, which I think by itself is aiming a little towards the disposable category but again for the price I have no problem with that.</li>
            <li> but as I stated in the title it does its job as expected.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for three months and found it to be everything I expected in this type of product.</li>
            <li> and so I can not compare it to other trimmers.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any other problems with it yet.</li>
            <li> unit is small at 5.5 inches long and a bit over 1 inch wide at its widest point.</li>
            <li> I started using it mid May, so I&#x27;ll update this report if it fails before mid November,</li>
            <li> If my motivation wouldn&#x27;t be misunderstood, I&#x27;d start giving this little tool for holiday gifts.</li>
            <li> It is by no means heavy.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time ith this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any problems with it, such as grabbing hairs, and it cuts hair well.</li>
            <li> the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I waited so long to make this purchase.</li>
            <li> It also either has to slow a motor, or dull blades cause it hurts like hell to use it.  </li>
            <li> After 3 months and approximately 10 uses, the motor in the Trimmer stopped working.  </li>
            <li> This makes it somewhat useless.  </li>
            <li> Terrible product.</li>

            <li> Its a nice little utility tool that every man should have. works on one battery, works great, very safe and takes care of both ear and nose hair. Has a firm grip and a nice touch too.</li>
            <li> After reading many of the reviews for other brands and some other Panasonic trimmers I decided to take a chance with this one that had no reviews and really not much info on it whatsoever. I took the risk based on how poor the ratings and reviews were for most of the other similar products on the site and I decided to go with this one based on brand recognition, price and appearance (marketing students take notice hehe..) &lt;br /&gt;This is the first time I have actually bought a nose hair trimmer so I have nothing else to compare it with but as I stated in the title it does its job as expected.  &lt;br /&gt;The unit is attractive looking with a dark and light blue metallic-looking combination. The casing is not metallic but plastic and although it looks very nice I find my 2 year old Norelco beard trimmer better looking than this unit. To be more specific it doesn&#x27;t look as fancy but it does look very good. &lt;br /&gt;The unit is small at 5.5 inches long and a bit over 1 inch wide at its widest point. It is by no means heavy. It is powered by a AA battery and has no recharging option and can&#x27;t be plugged in. But I am guessing a single battery will last plenty so those are really not drawbacks methinks!  &lt;br /&gt;Does it work? Why yes! Like I said before I have nothing to compare it to, but like they say, first impressions are very important and this unit has indeed given me a good first impression. It nose-trimmed very well and the process was both effortless and painless (have not tried using it for my ears and I don&#x27;t think I ever will as I don&#x27;t have that problem so I can&#x27;t report on that). The motor makes the blades spin quite fast (rotary blades) which is what makes the trimming painless and the blades themselves are surrounded by a plastic casing to prevent injuries, it works well. To store it you are provided a plastic cap to cover both the blades and the plastic casing around them. &lt;br /&gt;It is easily disassembled (for cleaning purposes) and reassembled. &lt;br /&gt;My only concernfor now will be how long it will last. I am not too fond of products made in China and this product is well... made in China. The unit (the blades) as stated in the user&#x27;s manual is supposed to last for 2 years if used on a single 1 minute session each week, which I think by itself is aiming a little towards the disposable category but again for the price I have no problem with that. My problem would be if the unit would die at any time before at least six months of normal use. I started using it mid May, so I&#x27;ll update this report if it fails before mid November, if I haven&#x27;t updated by then, that means it is still going and it can keep its 5 star rating. &lt;br /&gt;So should you get it? I would say: go for it!! &lt;br /&gt;Hope this helped.</li>
            <li> Very nice design and do its work without pulling your little hairs, and like always very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised after buying this product that it delivered exactly what had been promised in other reviews. I&#x27;ve used trimmers of this kind over the years and none of them have worked as well or with the ease of use as the Panasonic. If you&#x27;re looking for a trimmer, I&#x27;d say your search should begin and end here.</li>
            <li> Take my advice on this folks, dont go cheep on a nose hair trimmer.  The blade is to far recessed into the unit to trim hair short.  You can&#x27;t trim closer then maby 2-3 mm.  This makes it somewhat useless.  It also either has to slow a motor, or dull blades cause it hurts like hell to use it.  Go with the sharper immage trimmer.  I had mine for years, till the kids broke it, but I will be buying another soon.</li>
            <li> This is the second Panasonic nose hair trimmer I&#x27;ve owned, and sadly I prefer the first.  Don&#x27;t know the model number of the first one I bought, but it was black and silver and although it wore out very quickly it did a better job of cutting hair than this new model.</li>
            <li> This item did not work once.  It is just cheap plastic.  Don&#x27;t waste your time ith this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Much better than a more expensive one I had &lt;br /&gt;in the past.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband, to replace the one he had. So, I thought I&#x27;d do some research here on amazon. I appreciated the customer reviews for this particular item. My husband says it is the best nose/ear hair trimmer he&#x27;s ever used. It has only pulled one hair so far. He&#x27;s used it several times and now he doesn&#x27;t whince before using it, no need to brace himself because this one doesn&#x27;t rip hair like the other ones he&#x27;s used before. He&#x27;s highly satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been procrastinating for years in fear of buying a piece of junk. I couldn&#x27;t have been more in error concerning this trimmer. It works perfectly and removes any hair in and around your nose and ears. It&#x27;s painless and quick. If my motivation wouldn&#x27;t be misunderstood, I&#x27;d start giving this little tool for holiday gifts. I&#x27;m sorry I waited so long to make this purchase.</li>
            <li> Very good product and shipping time was great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You Much</li>
            <li> I had another style of panasonic nose-hair clipper for years until the on-off switch simply wore out. After looking at the various clippers available, I purchased this one and it works as good, if not better, than the first one. I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My first Panasonic trimmer worked fairly well but only lasted a year before the blades wore out.  This one is not constructed the same way as my last one and it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as the one it replaced.  Terrible product.</li>
            <li> First, I will note that I have only used this trimmer for nose hair.  I don&#x27;t quite have the ear hair problem yet.  By no means am I a nose hair trimmer guru, but this one works, and it works well.  It operates on a single AA battery, it&#x27;s the perfect size, it&#x27;s not too loud, it does not pull hair, it cuts amazingly well, and it&#x27;s $14.  It also has no smell to it whatsoever.  In all, with the complaints of so many trimmers here on Amazon, I&#x27;m glad I took a chance on this one that only had two previous reviews.</li>
            <li> This Nose Hair trimmer is really very good. It is my first time to buy one and so I can not compare it to other trimmers. But from my experience with it, it is very good and very easy to be use.</li>
            <li> this item does the job, cute and slim but it does pull the nose hairs when its cutting so its kinda hurts. I bought the  Panasonic ER421KC Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer for my boyfriend which I like better.</li>
            <li> This product has worked fine, and the price was right. I have not experienced any problems with it, such as grabbing hairs, and it cuts hair well.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for three months and found it to be everything I expected in this type of product. It is very easy to use and has never nicked my skin. Great little product.</li>
            <li> After 3 months and approximately 10 uses, the motor in the Trimmer stopped working.  When it did work, it cut only adequately with occasional pulls.  Try another brand name.</li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to . Cuts hairs doesn&#x27;t rip them out . Great product.</li>
            <li> THIS TRIMMER LASTED ME 2 YEARS AND JUST STOPPED WORKING. NEVER EVEN DROPPED IT. TRIED TO SHAKE IT AND BANG IT ON THE WALL TO TRY TO GET THE PIECE OF JUNK TO RUN, AND NOTHING HAPPEN. EVEN PUT A NEW BATTERY IN IT. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A BETTER NOSE TRIMMER GET THE PANASONIC \\&quot;NOSE/EAR TRIMMER\\&quot;  AT AMAZON FOR $7.91. I HAD THIS ONE AND LASTED A LOT LONGER THE THE PANASONIC ER405AC PIECE OF JUNK.</li>
            <li> What else is there to say about it? It trims your nose and ear hair. My only problem with it is that although it does trim the hair, its pretty useless when it comes to catching hair. You&#x27;ll end up with a nose/ear full of hair. I haven&#x27;t had any other problems with it yet. Like the saying goes, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product. I&#x27;ve tried other nose hair trimmers and this one by far does the best job. Highly recommended.</li>
