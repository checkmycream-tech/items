            <li>Does not look as elegant in person</li>

            <li>I love doing my nails and getting this nail supply make it better both at home n in the nail salon.</li>
            <li>very nice made well but just a bit to large for my nails</li>
            <li>Just make sure they will fit for you.</li>
            <li>I love that they are bent to fit the nail.</li>
            <li>I loved them so much.</li>
            <li>I love them and also they look cool to.</li>
            <li>These bows are super cute.</li>
            <li>Theyre super cute</li>
            <li>The bows are slightly curved so they fit perfectly to my nails.</li>
            <li>There were huge and shouldn&#x27;t be sold for nails</li>
            <li>this is HUGE.</li>
            <li>Huge, seems like it&#x27;s made for a man&#x27;s toenail.</li>
            <li>u can take am off and reuse them and make your nails nice with out having to pay much at all</li>
            <li>They fit the arch of the nail well.</li>
            <li>but no way thyere gonna fit on your nails.</li>
            <li>the fit on my thumb was about the fit of the ring finger on the picture</li>
            <li>They arrived 3 weeks after purchase they look really nice,  but kind of big for nails in my opinion…</li>
            <li>They fit my nails just right!</li>
            <li>the size love the PRICE ;)</li>
            <li>they only fit on the thumbs and are more suitable for the toes.</li>
            <li>Wat I expected work great</li>
            <li>i will order some more really soon...</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price, some of the silver was scratched off on some of the bows</li>
            <li>Quick delivery</li>
            <li>Extremely cute and decent quality.</li>
            <li>Well yes they are very pretty</li>
            <li>I think they are very pretty</li>
            <li>No lie, these look exactly like the picture!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>Pretty!</li>
            <li>The packaging wasn&#x27;t anything great, just another plastic bag with a few gems in it.</li>
            <li>They are way to big to use and not as nice as the picture.</li>
            <li>its really nice and a different design.</li>
            <li>so worth it</li>
            <li>They are fairly light to wear, but because of the size of the bow, I would suggest using nail glue to make it adhere to your nails because top coat is not enough to make it stay in place.</li>
            <li>I honestly didnt like how big these were.</li>
            <li>Bigger than I would have liked.</li>
            <li>but they are worth it .</li>
            <li>but they are well worth it.</li>
            <li>If u go to the right nail salon.</li>
            <li>they are Beautiful , but for smaller hands they are way to big..</li>
            <li>however they&#x27;re very large even placed on acrylic nails...</li>
            <li>They are just very large.  </li>
            <li>Would be nice to find some in smaller sizes for smaller hands like mine~ :)</li>
            <li>These are exactly when I expected, they look AMAZING</li>
            <li>exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>I wish they were smaller, would be much better</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>both my workers and customers agree that these are cute but waaaay too big.</li>
            <li>however they are way too big and cover more than just my finger nail.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m not even sure i can use it on my nail because it is that big.</li>
            <li>This bow is verry pretty</li>
            <li>They are pretty though.</li>
            <li>The only problem I had is that I wish I had ordered more.</li>
            <li>next time I will top coat them.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re a bit large for some nails so only able to use a couple~</li>
            <li>These are very shiny and pretty, but they are very large for my already large nails.</li>
            <li>These are beautiful, the only problem I found was that they are hard to keep clean.</li>
            <li>Looks super classy, I would order is any time again.</li>
            <li>They are large so to put on a nail</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend to anyone interested in 3d nail art.</li>
            <li>A little big,  but looks great on the nail</li>
            <li>, they look much nicer in the picture</li>
            <li>I really like the bows I am a nail person and like the bow trend</li>
            <li>That really hurts.</li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>very upset.</li>
            <li>I THOUGHT THAT YOU COULD PUT ONE YOUR REAL HAND</li>
            <li>They really on my nails.</li>
            <li>and it is very noticeable</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>It may fit my middle finger.</li>
            <li>Larger than expected, but gorgeous.</li>
            <li>other than that the bow looked cute in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Cutest bows and great quality, you wont be disappointed :)</li>
            <li>Their definately too huge for any other nails.</li>
            <li>I used them on my nails after doing a acrylic set and the bow looks so big and pretty on my nails.</li>
            <li>PRETTY BUT WAY TO BIG FOR MY TASTE.</li>
            <li>The rhinestones bow ties are a bit too big for my nails, but they are pretty.</li>
            <li>They look cute and small in the picture</li>
            <li>The first place I went to flat out told me no and threw it on the table.</li>
            <li>If you like extra large these are for you.</li>
            <li>They did come in a little late but they are great</li>
            <li>These are a little big for most people&#x27;s nails but that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m using them for</li>
            <li>Love it there a little bigger than my finger</li>
            <li>They were a little to big for my nails but really cute</li>
            <li>They were a little bit bigger than I thought they would be, but they&#x27;re cute and my clients like them.</li>
            <li>this was okay, a little big.</li>
            <li>These are so cute they are a little big but</li>
            <li>they are ok a little to big for my tast</li>
            <li>These are scroll design bows a little big for my nails looks better on my thumbs very pretty will try to find other uses for these bows.</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>The reason I didn&#x27;t include my whole hand is because I lost a rhinestone on my middle finger.</li>
            <li>Way to big for short nails unless the thumb nail but other than that cute .</li>
            <li>the actual product applies well, but fell off pretty easily due to the large size of them.</li>
            <li>it has little windows to allow glue to dry before I seal them w a top coat.</li>
            <li>the bow tie is small enough to fit on your natural nails</li>
            <li>it was a little big for some nails but very pretty once i figured out hoe to get it to stay</li>
            <li>received pretty fast 2 and a half weeks after order!!!</li>
            <li>The actual intricate design and fake jewel is done nicely.</li>
            <li>expected it to be a bit smaller than it was but great for artificial nails need to sell these</li>

            <li> Theyre super cute</li>
            <li> The bows are slightly curved so they fit perfectly to my nails.</li>
            <li> There were huge and shouldn&#x27;t be sold for nails</li>
            <li> this is HUGE.</li>
            <li> Huge, seems like it&#x27;s made for a man&#x27;s toenail.</li>
            <li> u can take am off and reuse them and make your nails nice with out having to pay much at all</li>
            <li> They fit the arch of the nail well.</li>
            <li> but no way thyere gonna fit on your nails.</li>
            <li> the fit on my thumb was about the fit of the ring finger on the picture</li>
            <li> They arrived 3 weeks after purchase they look really nice,  but kind of big for nails in my opinion…</li>
            <li> They fit my nails just right!</li>
            <li> the size love the PRICE ;)</li>
            <li> they only fit on the thumbs and are more suitable for the toes.</li>
            <li> Wat I expected work great</li>
            <li> i will order some more really soon...</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price, some of the silver was scratched off on some of the bows</li>
            <li> Quick delivery</li>
            <li> Extremely cute and decent quality.</li>
            <li> Well yes they are very pretty</li>
            <li> I think they are very pretty</li>
            <li> No lie, these look exactly like the picture!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Pretty!</li>
            <li> The packaging wasn&#x27;t anything great, just another plastic bag with a few gems in it.</li>
            <li> They are way to big to use and not as nice as the picture.</li>
            <li> its really nice and a different design.</li>
            <li> so worth it</li>
            <li> They are fairly light to wear, but because of the size of the bow, I would suggest using nail glue to make it adhere to your nails because top coat is not enough to make it stay in place.</li>
            <li> I honestly didnt like how big these were.</li>
            <li> Bigger than I would have liked.</li>
            <li> but they are worth it .</li>
            <li> but they are well worth it.</li>
            <li> If u go to the right nail salon.</li>
            <li> they are Beautiful , but for smaller hands they are way to big..</li>
            <li> however they&#x27;re very large even placed on acrylic nails...</li>
            <li> They are just very large.  </li>
            <li> Would be nice to find some in smaller sizes for smaller hands like mine~ :)</li>
            <li> These are exactly when I expected, they look AMAZING</li>
            <li> exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> I wish they were smaller, would be much better</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!  </li>
            <li> both my workers and customers agree that these are cute but waaaay too big.</li>
            <li> however they are way too big and cover more than just my finger nail.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m not even sure i can use it on my nail because it is that big.</li>
            <li> This bow is verry pretty</li>
            <li> They are pretty though.</li>
            <li> The only problem I had is that I wish I had ordered more.</li>
            <li> next time I will top coat them.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re a bit large for some nails so only able to use a couple~</li>
            <li> These are very shiny and pretty, but they are very large for my already large nails.</li>
            <li> These are beautiful, the only problem I found was that they are hard to keep clean.</li>
            <li> Looks super classy, I would order is any time again.</li>
            <li> They are large so to put on a nail</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend to anyone interested in 3d nail art.</li>
            <li> A little big,  but looks great on the nail</li>
            <li> , they look much nicer in the picture</li>
            <li> I really like the bows I am a nail person and like the bow trend</li>
            <li> That really hurts.</li>
            <li> Very well made.</li>
            <li> very upset.</li>
            <li> I THOUGHT THAT YOU COULD PUT ONE YOUR REAL HAND</li>
            <li> They really on my nails.</li>
            <li> and it is very noticeable</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> It may fit my middle finger.</li>
            <li> Larger than expected, but gorgeous.</li>
            <li> other than that the bow looked cute in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Cutest bows and great quality, you wont be disappointed :)</li>
            <li> Their definately too huge for any other nails.</li>
            <li> I used them on my nails after doing a acrylic set and the bow looks so big and pretty on my nails.</li>
            <li> PRETTY BUT WAY TO BIG FOR MY TASTE.</li>
            <li> The rhinestones bow ties are a bit too big for my nails, but they are pretty.</li>
            <li> They look cute and small in the picture</li>
            <li> The first place I went to flat out told me no and threw it on the table.</li>
            <li> If you like extra large these are for you.</li>
            <li> They did come in a little late but they are great</li>
            <li> These are a little big for most people&#x27;s nails but that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m using them for</li>
            <li> Love it there a little bigger than my finger</li>
            <li> They were a little to big for my nails but really cute</li>
            <li> They were a little bit bigger than I thought they would be, but they&#x27;re cute and my clients like them.</li>
            <li> this was okay, a little big.</li>
            <li> These are so cute they are a little big but</li>
            <li> they are ok a little to big for my tast</li>
            <li> These are scroll design bows a little big for my nails looks better on my thumbs very pretty will try to find other uses for these bows.</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> The reason I didn&#x27;t include my whole hand is because I lost a rhinestone on my middle finger.</li>
            <li> Way to big for short nails unless the thumb nail but other than that cute .</li>
            <li> the actual product applies well, but fell off pretty easily due to the large size of them.</li>
            <li> it has little windows to allow glue to dry before I seal them w a top coat.</li>
            <li> the bow tie is small enough to fit on your natural nails</li>
            <li> it was a little big for some nails but very pretty once i figured out hoe to get it to stay</li>
            <li> received pretty fast 2 and a half weeks after order!!!</li>
            <li> The actual intricate design and fake jewel is done nicely.</li>
            <li> expected it to be a bit smaller than it was but great for artificial nails need to sell these</li>
            <li> With care, they will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I would never buy from you guys again because you&#x27;re not very clear !</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I could have these on my nails (or even 1 nail per hand) while working, (where I type all day long).</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> Came earlier than expected but not quite what is shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> They have almost a flat back to them, which makes them hard to glue onto nails that are naturally curved.</li>
            <li> bought other bows at same time pic shows size comparison</li>
            <li> These are bigger than other bows</li>
            <li> With past similar products they have been weeks late for most products, and one product is turning into months late...</li>
            <li> but I can only use these for my clients thumb nail because they are too big :/</li>
            <li> But they are a little bit big.</li>
            <li> Everything what I expected</li>
            <li> then expected rhinestones are intact.</li>
            <li> just wish there were more than 10 :(</li>
            <li> but I can always use them in other craft projects.</li>
            <li> Be careful with the sizing, my nails were too small for these bows.  </li>
            <li> instead I got little crystals and dotting tools.</li>
            <li> It takes a little longer to come in  </li>
            <li> These Rhinestones feel really heavy, but I will make them work.</li>
            <li> But I gave it four stars because they did start to tornish after a few days so</li>
            <li> They were bigger than expected which can b awkward for me.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed on so little for so much ..</li>
            <li> Usually you buy something online</li>
            <li> and it is too small but not these.</li>
            <li> this is also not as small as what the picture claims.</li>
            <li> My finger nails are too small</li>
            <li> I bought these and as usual I was skeptical that maybe they were not good quality but low and behold</li>
            <li> I put the bow on my ring finger and it looks crazy big!</li>
            <li> but shipping was so slow.</li>
            <li> but my nail bed is very small.</li>
            <li> Um this item was very confusing its title says</li>
            <li> I think anyone serious about nail art should invest in these!</li>
            <li> but the size is not ideal.</li>
            <li> Would recommend for ANY event, casual or fancy.</li>
            <li> yet so mabye ill change my mind:[</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Horrible experience ever!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Just very big. Fits on thumb nail best. Beautiful.</li>
            <li> I loved them they are just as shown</li>
            <li> Gorgeous bows with crystals~ they&#x27;re a bit large for some nails so only able to use a couple~ But these are gorgeous~ Would be nice to find some in smaller sizes for smaller hands like mine~ :)</li>
            <li> exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> Like the product. Everything came in order. But the only thing is, is that the bows don&#x27;t stick on too well. Even with glue. But They did stay on about a good week before they fell off. The look of them are really nice on your nail though.</li>
            <li> These are beautiful, the only problem I found was that they are hard to keep clean. They have hole in them and food and lotion gets stuck in them.</li>
            <li> Much bigger and cheaper quality than you would expect, they look much nicer in the picture</li>
            <li> I bought them and when I got the package nothing was in it so I will never buy these again. They do look very cute though</li>
            <li> like them just to big for my nails</li>
            <li> I used them on my nails after doing a acrylic set and the bow looks so big and pretty on my nails. I&#x27;m so glad I ordered 2 packs. Will be ordering again for sure. I attached a picture so you can see what they look like on nails.</li>
            <li> They came way before the estimated delivery date, and they are absolutely beautiful.</li>
            <li> just wish there were more than 10 :(</li>
            <li> Very cute bows, I absolutely love them! I wish they were a tiny bit smaller since I&#x27;ve been using them for the acrylics I do. But they are still veryyy cute!</li>
            <li> The bows are larger then nails. I don&#x27;t see how they can be used and hold on the nails.</li>
            <li> These were the best gift ever for my friend. She just loved them.</li>
            <li> They are adorable.  They are large so to put on a nail it would be a one night thing and hopefully catching them on things can be avoided but they are cute!</li>
            <li> Um this item was very confusing its title says 300buy then say 10x so when I got my \\&quot;10\\&quot; bow I was extremely disappointed on so little for so much .. I would never buy from you guys again because you&#x27;re not very clear !</li>

            <li> They were bigger than expected which can b awkward for me. They looked nicer in the pic. I can still work with them though.</li>
            <li> Recommend to deal with it</li>
            <li> The product arrived as advertised. I love the item and it was at a very great price. Great to add character&lt;br /&gt;to your nails</li>
            <li> These are a little big for most people&#x27;s nails but that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m using them for so I&#x27;m presently surprises that they are so big. Great quality and excellent price but shipping was so slow.</li>
            <li> I love these. I do ALOT of nail art and these fit into my collection perfectly! I think anyone serious about nail art should invest in these!</li>
            <li> Received it in no time and was impressed with the look and quality. Looks super classy, I would order is any time again.</li>
            <li> I really like the bows I am a nail person and like the bow trend so I finally got my order I was more than satisfied. Good quality and good price can&#x27;t beat that</li>
            <li> I loved these bows they are so cute and perfect for when i go get my nails done. I can use one or two for each hand. I would definetly buy again.</li>
            <li> I was to receive 10 and only got 8.</li>
            <li> All my experiments failed to get these to stick for more than two days...</li>
            <li> Love it there a little bigger than my finger that&#x27;s what i was looking for</li>
            <li> There were huge and shouldn&#x27;t be sold for nails</li>
            <li> The bows arrived weeks before the estimated arrival. They are curved and fit very nicely on my nails. They are very beautiful. I would definitely recommend them to a friend.</li>
            <li> I did not get the bows instead I got little crystals and dotting tools.</li>
            <li> These are very shiny and pretty, but they are very large for my already large nails. They have almost a flat back to them, which makes them hard to glue onto nails that are naturally curved. I don&#x27;t think I could have these on my nails (or even 1 nail per hand) while working, (where I type all day long). The actual intricate design and fake jewel is done nicely. If they were smaller with a curved back, I would give this product 5/5 stars. 350buy finally shipped a product on time too! With past similar products they have been weeks late for most products, and one product is turning into months late...</li>
            <li> Soooo cute I love them</li>
            <li> These bows were just another ok product. The packaging wasn&#x27;t anything great, just another plastic bag with a few gems in it. the actual product applies well, but fell off pretty easily due to the large size of them.</li>
            <li> both my workers and customers agree that these are cute but waaaay too big. they only fit on the thumbs and are more suitable for the toes.</li>

            <li> They were a little to big for my nails but really cute</li>
            <li> expected it to be a bit smaller than it was but great for artificial nails need to sell these</li>
            <li> I bought these and as usual I was skeptical that maybe they were not good quality but low and behold these are the BEST&lt;br /&gt;nail d&amp;eacute;cor I have ever purchased, I love that the stone never ever falls out! Perfect!! Thanks!! Customer for life!</li>

            <li> love these so  many nice complements</li>
            <li> Beautiful, good quality, and came early! I will buy again!</li>
            <li> this was okay, a little big.</li>
            <li> These are so cute they are a little big but so worth it,I just can&#x27;t wait to use them.</li>
            <li> they are Beautiful , but for smaller hands they are way to big..</li>
            <li> They are beautiful and I would love to wear them on my nails however they are way too big and cover more than just my finger nail. I have had them for a couple months and not used them.</li>
            <li> Cutest bows and great quality, you wont be disappointed :)&lt;br /&gt;I used them for my homecoming dance and they were a huge hit!</li>
            <li> They arrived 3 weeks after purchase they look really nice,  but kind of big for nails in my opinion…</li>
            <li> they are ok a little to big for my tast but they are cute</li>
            <li> Well yes they are very pretty however they&#x27;re very large even placed on acrylic nails...like literally thet both fell off the 1st night i wore them because they snagged on everything including hair....bought other bows at same time pic shows size comparison</li>
            <li> A little big,  but looks great on the nail</li>
            <li> i was told i was getting 10 bows. i only got 9 &amp; some of the rhinestones were not even on the bow. also the picture on the description is literally nothing like what i got. this is also not as small as what the picture claims. this is HUGE. and i&#x27;m not even sure i can use it on my nail because it is that big. very upset.</li>
            <li> Cute ones came time before it said loved it ❤️</li>
            <li> THE PART I THOUGHT THAT YOU COULD PUT ONE YOUR REAL HAND BUT ACTUALLY YOU NEED AN ACRYLIC NAILS WOW</li>
            <li> I love these bows. They&#x27;re perfect for the thumb nail!</li>
            <li> This bow is verry pretty I love the way it look&#x27;s I do recomend my custumers love it will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Beautiful,  and they were great will  order again</li>
            <li> I ordered these bows before. I loved them so much. I ordered more!</li>
            <li> They are very pretty and of good quailty. With care, they will last a very long time. They are a larger size, best for me on Thunb nail. I recommend these.</li>
            <li> Be careful with the sizing, my nails were too small for these bows.  They are pretty though. Just make sure they will fit for you.</li>
            <li> They did come in a little late but they are great and I would recommend them they also are very great.</li>
            <li> Lovely,just arrived cannot wait to apply ...just lovely</li>
            <li> Thank you loved it. Amazon better than Ebay!</li>
            <li> it was a little big for some nails but very pretty once i figured out hoe to get it to stay</li>
            <li> They look just like the picture.! I love them and plus they got here sooner then expected rhinestones are intact. Will order again when i run out if them.! Thank you.!</li>
            <li> The rhinestones bow ties are a bit too big for my nails, but they are pretty. The product arrived on time in good condition, though.</li>
            <li> These bows are super cute. My clients love bows. I especially like these because I can use glue n it has little windows to allow glue to dry before I seal them w a top coat.</li>
            <li> These are bigger than other bows I&#x27;m used to. I think they are very pretty but the size is not ideal. They take up the entire nail unless you put them on the thumb.</li>
            <li> This bows r wonderful play with. They really on my nails. They stayed on with no problems. I will order much more.</li>
            <li> Wat I expected work great my nails look great n and it is very noticeable gonna order again soon thanks</li>
            <li> They are exactly what i was wanting for some beautiful bling bow nails. These Rhinestones feel really heavy, but I will make them work.</li>
            <li> When the rhinestone bows arrived I was in love. The only problem I had is that I wish I had ordered more. They are fairly light to wear, but because of the size of the bow, I would suggest using nail glue to make it adhere to your nails because top coat is not enough to make it stay in place. Love!</li>
            <li> Gorgeous. Really huge but, Definitely beautiful.</li>
            <li> These are scroll design bows a little big for my nails looks better on my thumbs very pretty will try to find other uses for these bows.</li>
            <li> Way to big for short nails unless the thumb nail but other than that cute . Took along time to come as well but I guess price makes sense !</li>
            <li> very nice product, I would buy it again</li>
            <li> I love these cute litte bows! Theyre pretty sturdy and I love that they were all in perfect condition:) will def. be purchasing more soon!</li>
            <li> These are cute no doubt. They are just very large.  It&#x27;s almost to big for my thumb, which is a size 0. It may fit my middle finger. Their definately too huge for any other nails. They may be good for the toes. If you like extra large these are for you.</li>
            <li> Cute and nice....shipping was on time.</li>
            <li> These are exactly when I expected, they look AMAZING</li>
            <li> They are nice. I love that they are bent to fit the nail. They are big but I like the over sized look especially in my point. I put s for of acrylic where I want the bow and press it in. Stays put till I take it off</li>
            <li> I honestly didnt like how big these were. My finger nails are too small and i dont get them done. I do it myself so i wasnt tooo happy with the size.</li>
            <li> Pretty! Recommend them.. If u go to the right nail salon. The first place I went to flat out told me no and threw it on the table. Horrible experience ever!😔 other than that the bow looked cute in my opinion. The reason I didn&#x27;t include my whole hand is because I lost a rhinestone on my middle finger.😒</li>
            <li> theyre enormous! Theyre super cute but no way thyere gonna fit on your nails. On your big toe.... maybe</li>
            <li> These are perfect for over the top nail bling. But I gave it four stars because they did start to tornish after a few days so next time I will top coat them.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. They almost look like lace bows with studs on them.  So nice!</li>
            <li> The bows are quite nice. But they are a little bit big. Bigger than I would have liked.</li>
            <li> I like it, big pieces for the acrylic nail.</li>
            <li> Huge, seems like it&#x27;s made for a man&#x27;s toenail.</li>
            <li> TOO BIG for my nails. They look cute and small in the picture but they are giant. I&#x27;ll never but it again.</li>
            <li> Took 2 weeks to get here but they are worth it .</li>
            <li> They Look great but I can only use these for my clients thumb nail because they are too big :/</li>
            <li> this is the most beautiful 3d bow ties ever.Would highly recommend to anyone interested in 3d nail art.Great quality and a perfect size.</li>
            <li> The bow is larger than the picture. the fit on my thumb was about the fit of the ring finger on the picture</li>
            <li> Came earlier than expected but not quite what is shown in the picture. The rhinestone sticks out instead of being set in the bow like the picture and the ones I received don&#x27;t look like they have the swirls like the picture</li>
            <li> Turned gold after a month! ...?</li>
            <li> I loved them they look very nice and they keep shining</li>
            <li> Does not look as elegant in person but, I love them for my manicures. They don&#x27;t fit perfectly on my nails but my nail bed is very small. I recommend these to anyone they are pretty and they will look great with any manicure.</li>
            <li> Great for the price! A salon would charge $5+ for each nail! Looks great on just one nail or all 10.</li>
            <li> These are perfect. If you are looking for something in the next day or two this isn&#x27;t it. It takes a little longer to come in  but they are well worth it.</li>
            <li> I love doing my nails and getting this nail supply make it better both at home n in the nail salon. I love them and also they look cool to.</li>
