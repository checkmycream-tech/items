            <li>They need to do better research before telling people it&#x27;ll fit them when in fact, it will not.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product works or not because itched me so bad, I couldn&#x27;t keep it on.</li>
            <li> this belt is not very wide  it will not cover my abdomen and hasnt helped slim at all.</li>
            <li> Sorry it didnt work for me at all !!!</li>
            <li> Used only 3 time but happy with the results</li>
            <li> wish it wasn&#x27;t so long, have trouble getting it tight enough by myself and have to have someone help me.</li>
            <li> Bad decision purchasing this item</li>
            <li> it does not work.Is rolling up when you sit. Does not sweat at all. Please do not buy!!!!</li>
            <li> Love it!!!!!! Works great and has been slimming my tummy!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. It makes your stomach sweat more but it also turns it red and can give you a rash. Do not leave on for more than a hour because you WILL get a rash. No inches lost.</li>
            <li> Yes is stretch but the inside is foamy. does not make you sweat</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t that big as it is in the picture. Its smaller.</li>
            <li> I love this thing so much. It makes me sweat a lot. I just swear I feel it working.</li>
            <li> I have had this wrap for three weeks now and all it does is makes me sweat. Once I start sweating it shifts and moves all over everywhere. I don&#x27;t recommend this product for someone looking for it to shrink your concerned area, it would be great for someone looking to sweat A LOT!!! It was so not worth the money, even if it is cheap! I recommend the It Works Wraps.</li>
            <li> I wear it at work and when I take it off not only is it drenched but you can see and feel the difference, which makes it much easier to maintain your results.  I also clean it daily with antibacterial soap and let it air dry to maintain it&#x27;s elasticity.</li>
            <li> This is NOT a one size fits all. I wear a size 15/16 pants and others are getting a response to it&#x27;ll fit them. It didn&#x27;t fit me. I even laid down flat and it still didn&#x27;t fit. They need to do better research before telling people it&#x27;ll fit them when in fact, it will not. Wasn&#x27;t impressed at all!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different sauna wraps and these by far are my favorite. The material is just the right thickness and it sticks to your skin well. I didn&#x27;t measure before using but I did notice that the wrap tighten my skin and helped my stretch marks and cellulite some!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the results from these sauna belts. They do not irritate my skin. They are easy to use and after using for a couple of weeks, I am already down a couple inches. I can&#x27;t wait to see more results with these.</li>
            <li> Works wonders! Totally sweat like a freaking pig when wearing it;)</li>
            <li> Works great! But I&#x27;m noticing the stitching from the Velcro is falling apart.. Other than that is great!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife to replace her old beat up one; she says pretty much works the same as the other, so I guess she likes it...</li>
            <li> Does not stay in place. too short.</li>
            <li> Your workouts can be more effective while wearing sauna belt. This belt can reduce water weight safely and easily. It can help you shed those bulges and rolls. This belt can give you a healthier and leaner look by promoting proper posture.</li>
            <li> Belt material is thin and has terrible chemical odor but company gave me no trouble about returning.</li>
            <li> I just recently received this product and im not very pleased by it. It is cheaper compared to the other waist trainers for sale but now I can see why. It is very rough and itchy feel to it, its not comfortable. It does make you sweat and fits most sizes. It has sort of an awkward fit but not too bad to deal with. It was a quick delivery. I recommend this product to people  who look for cheaply priced items, and who are desperate to lose some weight.</li>
            <li> I used this for about a week.&lt;br /&gt;After a week of use i got a big zit on my side.&lt;br /&gt;It hurt so bad and was about the aide of a nickel.&lt;br /&gt;I had a burn like line across my stomach and side. I would not recommend it to anyone! !&lt;br /&gt;It didnt even do what was asked.</li>
            <li> Great product, does not lose its shape easily – giving you the perfect fit ideal for a variety of workouts. I use this wrap on my waist because I wanted a slimmer midsection. The neoprene lining makes me sweat more &amp; has helped reduce that bloated look I get too often. With continued use, I noticed that far reduction around the waist. I also love how I can discreetly I can wear this under my clothes when I go running outdoors. Or when I am just lounging around at home. It’s a good size which does not limit your movement and I think it will fit most body types. I am also going to order the Forever Summer Belly Fat Reduction kit… can’t wait to try that.</li>
            <li> This band is comfortable but not for an apple shaped person like myself. If helps to burn the fat but rolls up after rigorous movement. Its OK but I think I was looking something more heavy duty.</li>
            <li> This belt is a total waste of money. Mine lost its shape after just one wear. Won&#x27;t recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> Nice I should have gotten two</li>
            <li> Yes you&#x27;ll definitely sweat but inches arent going anywhere</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these and I love them! I wear them at work ( I have a desk job) And or while working out on my elliptical. It&#x27;s making my belly fat and luv handles disappear faster!!!</li>
            <li> Great product! Works well with my 5 day work out</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not for me. I had boils on my side. I would never recommend this product to anyone and I let everyone on Facebook know also.</li>
