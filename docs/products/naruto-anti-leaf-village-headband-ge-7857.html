            <li>The headband itself was totally awesome when i opened it, looked exactly like the pic!</li>
            <li>Awesome worth the money</li>
            <li>in the end, if you have bent it right, its awesome.</li>
            <li>i got this headband 2 days ago and the quality is pretty good!!!</li>
            <li>Good quality piece, but the drawback is that the metal plate (an integral part of the &#x27;look&#x27;) is HUGE!</li>
            <li>Excellent fast service, I would trust them for any order I would place for my child.</li>
            <li>quality product real full size plate</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s very comfortable to wear on your head or around your neck.</li>
            <li>But overall is an excellent Naruto headband.  </li>
            <li>What more can you say about a headband?</li>
            <li>I personally love this headband.</li>
            <li>the product was great and it was shipped fast 3 days to be in fact.</li>
            <li>:) I Love it.</li>
            <li>and i love it and wil never get rid of it</li>
            <li>the headband is very nice and very high quality and its metal.</li>
            <li>Loved how real it looks and feels</li>
            <li>but other then that great product!</li>
            <li>and it doesnt scratch easy</li>
            <li>you have to bend it to fit your head</li>
            <li>, it is also light</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend and super happy with this purchase, worth the price.</li>
            <li>Such good quality, it looks like it came from the real Leaf Village!!</li>
            <li>It got here so quickly.</li>
            <li>The product was exactly what I wanted and it wasn&#x27;t that really cheap looking one.  </li>
            <li>Oh, when you get it the metal plate will need to be bent to fit your head, but its not hard to do at all!!</li>
            <li>This headband DOES indeed fit his massive melon though and he&#x27;s quite pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really understand the appeal, but he&#x27;s pleased with it and wants to collect them all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s part of the fun.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the buy</li>
            <li>Just doesn&#x27;t look right.</li>
            <li>Only downside is that for smaller/younger people this headband might look kind of funny.</li>
            <li>Sad, because it is a nice piece, if it had been crafted smaller, it would have been perfect!</li>
            <li>Just bend it slowly so that you get a nice smooth curved bend!</li>
            <li>If your a real naruto fan, then u will buy this!</li>
            <li>this was one of my first purchases</li>
            <li>Exactly as I wanted, this item is THE headband to get.</li>
            <li>this thing is amazing and has no flaws i wear it everyday to school and work</li>
            <li>Headband is really nice but the only defect is that the metal plate is crooked.</li>
            <li>Arrived early, and exactly as described.</li>
            <li>but if you are looking for a realistic Itachi Uchiha headband</li>
            <li>It arrived fairly quickly for coming from a different country!</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s a pretty big kid for 12 and has a large head -</li>
            <li>This is the Official Metal Head band it will need some careful bending to fit</li>
            <li>Too broad for any child OR adult; so it didn&#x27;t look right when worn.</li>
            <li>I expected the headband to be longer so that I could be able to make a proper knot</li>
            <li>My 12 year old requested this for his birthday.</li>
            <li>This is the actual real headband.</li>
            <li>the metal band wouldn&#x27;t bend enough to fit a smaller/younger person&#x27;s head properly and would make them look like they had a flat head</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the size of an actual head band and completely covers the forehead, the metal also bends to shape to your head if you choose to wear it that way</li>
            <li>the only thing that made me give it a four star was the fact that the metal is almost flat when you get it, but even thats not much of a problem if you carefully bend the metal to fit your head like i did.</li>
            <li>the colour is barely blue and in the picture, almost anyone would see it as black at first sight.</li>

            <li> Other than the fact it was a little crooked (not extremely)</li>
            <li> And the gash across the Hidden Leaf symbol looks like it was actually carved with a Kunia knife!!!</li>
            <li> The metal plate is a little to big</li>
            <li> Sounds weird as it is mounted on a piece of material, but the metal plate spans too much across the front of the forehead and is too big.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I finally found Itachi&#x27;s Head band that IS NOT a bootleg crap copy!!!!</li>
            <li> We did mold the metal plate a bit to get it to round his forehead.</li>
            <li> I think it lasted a few wears before the metal plate popped off the fabric on one side</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because I was really looking forward to wearing the item as a headband like Sakura does.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve been looking for the real headband and not the bootleg, then stop thinking about it and order this already!!!!</li>

            <li> It is a great item. Headband is really nice but the only defect is that the metal plate is crooked. But overall is an excellent Naruto headband.  I do recommend it.</li>
            <li> Got this for my almost adult son cuz the dog ate his other one.  He likes it and there are no issues with it.  What more can you say about a headband?</li>
            <li> i got this headband 2 days ago and the quality is pretty good!!! i think it is made of aluminum and not plastic, great quality!!!!&lt;br /&gt;if you are doing itachi&#x27;s cosplay, i would recommend to buy this headband.</li>
            <li> I was always a fan of naruto, so when I saw this, I had to get it. It shipped and arrived within 2 days or so. The headband itself was totally awesome when i opened it, looked exactly like the pic! If your a real naruto fan, then u will buy this!</li>
            <li> I personally love this headband. well made, great price. Only downside is that for smaller/younger people this headband might look kind of funny. the metal band wouldn&#x27;t bend enough to fit a smaller/younger person&#x27;s head properly and would make them look like they had a flat head lol. but other then that great product!</li>
            <li> Good quality piece, but the drawback is that the metal plate (an integral part of the &#x27;look&#x27;) is HUGE! Too broad for any child OR adult; so it didn&#x27;t look right when worn. We tried it on several adults and it was way too big. Sad, because it is a nice piece, if it had been crafted smaller, it would have been perfect! Sounds weird as it is mounted on a piece of material, but the metal plate spans too much across the front of the forehead and is too big. Just doesn&#x27;t look right.</li>
            <li> the product was great and it was shipped fast 3 days to be in fact. The metal plate is a little to big but it looks great. you have to bend it to fit your head</li>
            <li> My 12 year old requested this for his birthday. He&#x27;s a pretty big kid for 12 and has a large head - it&#x27;s bigger than both mom &amp; dad&#x27;s heads!  This headband DOES indeed fit his massive melon though and he&#x27;s quite pleased with it. We did mold the metal plate a bit to get it to round his forehead. I don&#x27;t really understand the appeal, but he&#x27;s pleased with it and wants to collect them all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 12/27/2012 - This actually didn&#x27;t hold up very long at all. I think it lasted a few wears before the metal plate popped off the fabric on one side and I couldn&#x27;t quite figure out how to fix it.</li>
            <li> This is the Official Metal Head band it will need some careful bending to fit but that&#x27;s part of the fun. :) I Love it. Not for Kids.</li>
            <li> It took about a month for me to receive this item. Then when I finally opened the item I came to find out that you can&#x27;t wear this item as a headband or on your forehead or arm. It is just for decorating purposes I guess.  I was disappointed because I was really looking forward to wearing the item as a headband like Sakura does.</li>
            <li> I know someone already said this but if you are looking for a realistic Itachi Uchiha headband this is what you want. It&#x27;s the size of an actual head band and completely covers the forehead, the metal also bends to shape to your head if you choose to wear it that way, it is also light so it&#x27;s very comfortable to wear on your head or around your neck. Definitely recommend and super happy with this purchase, worth the price.</li>
            <li> I expected the headband to be longer so that I could be able to make a proper knot but it wasn&#x27;t .. Idk maybe I just have a big head</li>
            <li> this thing is amazing and has no flaws i wear it everyday to school and work and it doesnt scratch easy but im not telling you to rub it on the ground this was one of my first purchases and i love it and wil never get rid of it</li>
            <li> Arrived early, and exactly as described.</li>
            <li> the headband is very nice and very high quality and its metal. the colour is barely blue and in the picture, almost anyone would see it as black at first sight. the only thing that made me give it a four star was the fact that the metal is almost flat when you get it, but even thats not much of a problem if you carefully bend the metal to fit your head like i did. in the end, if you have bent it right, its awesome.</li>
            <li> Awesome worth the money and it came in  about a week.</li>
            <li> Other than the fact it was a little crooked (not extremely) It works perfectly.  The product was exactly what I wanted and it wasn&#x27;t that really cheap looking one.  It is definitely worth the buy and I&#x27;ll be using it for halloween.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I finally found Itachi&#x27;s Head band that IS NOT a bootleg crap copy!!!! It arrived fairly quickly for coming from a different country! And it looks absolutely amazing!!!!! Such good quality, it looks like it came from the real Leaf Village!! And the gash across the Hidden Leaf symbol looks like it was actually carved with a Kunia knife!!! If you&#x27;ve been looking for the real headband and not the bootleg, then stop thinking about it and order this already!!!! Oh, when you get it the metal plate will need to be bent to fit your head, but its not hard to do at all!! Just bend it slowly so that you get a nice smooth curved bend!</li>
            <li> Excellent fast service, I would trust them for any order I would place for my child. He loves it and wears it all the time. It got here so quickly. It was in mint condition. Very impressive.</li>
            <li> Exactly as I wanted, this item is THE headband to get. It isn&#x27;t one of the cheap bootleg ones. This is the actual real headband.</li>
            <li> quality product real full size plate</li>
            <li> Loved how real it looks and feels</li>
