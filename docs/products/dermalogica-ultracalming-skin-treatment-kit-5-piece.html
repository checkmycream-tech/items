            <li>you have rosacea or irritated skin, this set is worth a try!!</li>
            <li>I feel as though the cleanser and serum are the most important parts of this regimen</li>
            <li>My skin became more smooth.</li>
            <li>I am a huge Dermalogica fan, but this product did not get along with my skin.</li>
            <li>In the two months since using them my skin has been transformed to smooth, radiant, break out free</li>
            <li>I felt soothing and my skin began to clean up.</li>
            <li>I went on to buy full size versions of all the products on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Good chance to try all the items you will need later on.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products for my oily, acne prone sensitive skin with rosacea and this works!!</li>
            <li>This is the first regimen I&#x27;ve every used that I made a noticeable difference in my skin!  </li>
            <li>I do not use the barrier repair every day, since it seems just like a silicon primer and also since the serum is moisturizing enough for me on its own.  </li>
            <li>I love the way this products leave my face feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>The mask for some reason, does make my skin red for about an hour other than that everything is wonderful.</li>

            <li>The seller has been reliable and is reasonably priced as well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t expect to ever waste my money on other facial products, since these are the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I have normal skin that is not so oily now that I&#x27;m in my forties.  </li>
            <li>I have incredibly sensitive skin that will break out in hives, simply from entering a room with certain air freshners.</li>
            <li>but she said that I have adult Acne.  </li>
            <li>I am thinking of trying the regiment For Adult Acne</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin now that I use retin A for my acne.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to all you sensitive skin folks.</li>
            <li>For being a sensitive skin products company, there is a lot that irritated.</li>
            <li>Big enough to give you a fair trial to see if it helps your skin but small enough to avoid spending a lot of $.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am left with clear skin, no oily areas or dry spots.</li>

            <li> Best facial products ever</li>
            <li> I love this line.  I have tried so many products for my oily, acne prone sensitive skin with rosacea and this works!!</li>
            <li> I am a huge Dermalogica fan, but this product did not get along with my skin. After two weeks of using this product, I had to stop using it because it was making my skin worse. I would not recommend this product to people who have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I just love this product. Before I used this product my face was drying out and my redness of my face was burning.  The ultra calming regiment has been so good for my face. I told my doctor and she looked at my face and I thought I had rosacea but she said that I have adult Acne.  I am thinking of trying the regiment For Adult Acne Also In The Travel Kit Size to see if It could be Good For Me.</li>
            <li> This is a great set.  Big enough to give you a fair trial to see if it helps your skin but small enough to avoid spending a lot of $.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was about to make a dermatologist appt for my rosacea but tried this first.  It calmed my rosacea down so I never felt the need to see the M.D.  (I have used metronidazole gel in the past.)  This is the first regimen I&#x27;ve every used that I made a noticeable difference in my skin!  I have normal skin that is not so oily now that I&#x27;m in my forties.  I am prone to acne sometimes.  I no longer use retinoids or any other acne treatment since I started using this.  I went on to buy full size versions of all the products on Amazon. I kept the cleanser bottle and refill it to use in the shower.  I use it (and the small spray bottle) for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the evening I use Neutrogena foaming cleanser to remove makeup and then I use this cleanser and massage in for a couple of minutes.  I also wash my face with this cleaser in the a.m. when I take a shower and leave it sit on my face while I finish washing my hair, etc. to give it maximum contact time with my skin.  I do not use the barrier repair every day, since it seems just like a silicon primer and also since the serum is moisturizing enough for me on its own.  I feel as though the cleanser and serum are the most important parts of this regimen but I&#x27;m  afraid to stop using the spray since my results have been so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have rosacea or irritated skin, this set is worth a try!!</li>
            <li> While I like Dermalogica skin care products, the merchandise is not as advertised. The mask is missing completely and a small sample packet of eye serum was included. Not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> It was for my wife who really is enjoying the product. We will most likely order again. Thanks again mike</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. My skin looks better and healthier. This product line was suggested to me by my aesthetician after my facial. I am happy I decided to purchase it. It will definitely be part of my beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> I really loved this kit. I have very dry irritated skin. Not sure if it&#x27;s that way because of the acne or if I have acne because of the dryness and irritation. I felt soothing and my skin began to clean up. I was able to make the cleanser last 2 weeks and the lotions 3 weeks. I gave it only 4 stars because it was so expensive to replace these with the full size. Overall great product!</li>
            <li> Best facial cleaning product ever! I am left with clear skin, no oily areas or dry spots. Just healthy and clean!</li>
            <li> This has been by far the best skin care kit I have EVER purchased! I have incredibly sensitive skin that will break out in hives, simply from entering a room with certain air freshners. I also will have dry patches that just appear suddenly and larger pores. My face would also flush and become blotchy, for no obvious reason.  From the moment I applied this product I could tell it was going to work for me. My skin truly felt comforted by the cleanser and the creams. I absolutely love this product, and have been using it for 2 months now. I don&#x27;t expect to ever waste my money on other facial products, since these are the best I&#x27;ve ever used. In the two months since using them my skin has been transformed to smooth, radiant, break out free skin.&lt;br /&gt;I was getting to the point I was making excuses for the way my skin appeared. Since using these products my skin literally glows. Thank you, Dermalogica for the products my skin needed!</li>
            <li> WISH IT HAD MORE PRODUCT IN BOTTLES , NEED TO ADD SUNSCREEN TO THIS PRODUCT LINE AND NIGHT CREAM. iT DOES WORK TAKES A COUPLE DAYS</li>
            <li> Perfect selection of products in sample sizes that fit in my travel bag very well.  I no longer have to tranfer products to small plastic bottles in order to save space in my suitcase.</li>
            <li> I crashed into menopause and my hair stylist suggested this product.  After two days 80% of my acne was fading away.  Great product and I will buy it again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and this line has taken away the itching I experience. Even though these are small bottles and tubes it will last a long time. It only takes a little bit.</li>
            <li> Love all the Dermalogica products!  The mask for some reason, does make my skin red for about an hour other than that everything is wonderful. My skin feels a lot smoother.</li>
            <li> I love Dermalogica products!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin now that I use retin A for my acne. These products have been wonderful. They calm and make my skin feel great. I would recommend to all you sensitive skin folks. They also do not cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> I love the way this products leave my face feeling soft and moisturized. Really helps on the calming effect.</li>
            <li> This product is incredible. I have terrible redness and when I use this system I can see the redness disappear instantly. I will never use anything else. The seller has been reliable and is reasonably priced as well.</li>
            <li> This kit was not actually a five piece kit, as shown in the picture- it was a four piece kit with two small sample envelopes of the hydrating mask. Will not be buying from this company again.</li>
            <li> Very happy with it. My skin became more smooth. Good chance to try all the items you will need later on.</li>
            <li> For being a sensitive skin products company, there is a lot that irritated. The only items I found useable in this were the cleanser and the calming spray.</li>
            <li> I have oily sensitive skin so have to use their oily cleaner unless I&#x27;ve spent a long time in south sun (beach), this is perfect size to try product and for traveling.</li>
            <li> Nice gift for someone that swears by it</li>
            <li> Perfect starter kit if you&#x27;re looking to try the ultracalming skin care product line!</li>
            <li> Best skincare line I&#x27;ve ever used...Hands down.</li>
