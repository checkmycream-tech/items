            <li>Beautiful Color!!</li>
            <li>the color is gorgeous!</li>
            <li>Beautiful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gorgeous and does that awesome glowing-from-within that some polishes do :)</li>
            <li>Loved this color and my nail salon didn&#x27;t have it</li>
            <li>This is an absolutely GORGEOUS color.  </li>
            <li>A very welcome unique addition to the Gelish line.</li>
            <li>The color also looks great with Izzy Wizzy on top.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this color!</li>
            <li>I love the color and know I don&#x27;t have to fuss with my nails for weeks!  </li>
            <li>Shimmer looks really nice in the sunlight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more gelish polish.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT :)</li>
            <li>It reminds me of &amp;#34;Jewel of India&amp;#34; by OPI or better yet Essie&#x27;s &amp;#34;The</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>nice and rich and not thin!</li>
            <li>Although the color was not a purple as I expected, it is a beautiful purple/fuschia color.</li>
            <li>As usual, Gelish provided a wonderful quality product that lasts 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li>Color seems true to the picture.</li>
            <li>It is a bright yet deep, rich,  jewel toned color with a pretty shimmer.</li>
            <li>I work in a professional office environment, and felt very comfortable wearing it.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty but more red than I thought</li>
            <li>Really pretty color.</li>
            <li>I really like the quality of this gel polish.</li>
            <li>Lace is On&amp;#34;- which is what I use when clients want regular polish on their toes but still want to match &amp;#34;Berry Buttoned Up.&amp;#34; I like this color MUCH better than &amp;#34;Starburst&amp;#34; and even though the colors may be similar- my clients always choose &amp;#34;Berry Buttoned Up&amp;#34; over &amp;#34;Starburst.&amp;#34; It is a MUST have.</li>
            <li>This is a very pretty purple with a frosty shimmer with some slightly larger, lighter colored flecks interspersed.  </li>
            <li>It has a subtle sparkle to it that gives it a nice depth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also an exact dupe of the regular nail polish &amp;#34;the</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really need the 2nd coat.</li>
            <li>For reference, I first saw this color on Chickettes, and I would say the sample shown there appears slightly lighter than in real life.</li>
            <li>Meh..I have other colors very similar..nice berry color though.</li>

            <li> Although it is a little on the sparkly side, it still manages to be rather subtle for a purple.  </li>

            <li> A very welcome unique addition to the Gelish line. It&#x27;s also an exact dupe of the regular nail polish &amp;#34;the lace is on&amp;#34; from Essie, if you&#x27;re looking for something along those lines. It&#x27;s gorgeous and does that awesome glowing-from-within that some polishes do :)</li>
            <li> Meh..I have other colors very similar..nice berry color though.</li>
            <li> Loved this color and my nail salon didn&#x27;t have it so I bought my own!&lt;br /&gt;Different than any other pink or purple!</li>
            <li> Beautiful Color!!! I love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my sister and she LOVES the color. She prefers the Gelish brand nail polish to others. She raves that the color work no matter what season!</li>

            <li> This is an absolutely GORGEOUS color.  (Think Starburst with glitter).  Goes on well, lasts long.  LOVE IT :)</li>
            <li> I love this color! It goes with my olive complexion.  I&#x27;d recommend to any who likes purple.</li>
