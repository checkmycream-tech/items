            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for 2 years and still love it!!!!</li>
            <li>That being said, this is the best moisturizer I have used.  </li>
            <li>Great job Mentholtuam and Rohto, the Hado Labo skin care line is the best.</li>
            <li>Good job, Amazon!</li>
            <li>Great as a night cream, or for some skin hydration before getting on an airplane.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t win them all, I guess.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because it is very popular in japan and korea for the skin hydration.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the milky drops, but Hada Labo still makes a great product.</li>
            <li>Works best when you spritz water on top of it (I like the Evian sprays)</li>
            <li>Good moisturizer .</li>
            <li>Thought it was a fair price for someone with combination skin.</li>
            <li>have been working on my fair skin, keeping it porceline even in the summer.  </li>
            <li>(that&#x27;s a good thing, if you don&#x27;t know what mochi is</li>
            <li>this is one of the best products I have ever used I am on my second jar and about to order another AWESOME!</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the customer service,  even though the product did not worked out to my skin.</li>
            <li>I really love this product!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love it Rohto Hadalabo Gokujyun cream!</li>
            <li>This seemed to have the best combination if positive reviews, highest hyaluric acid content, &amp; seller confidence ratings.</li>
            <li>AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>Thank goodness for Amazon&#x27;s amazing customer service.</li>
            <li>My skin is amazingly supple and would not hesitate to recommend it.</li>
            <li>This stuff is AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>very nice cream, you can feel it turns so smooth</li>
            <li>This cream is by far the best moisturiser I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>Moisturizes well and feels very light.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m loving all Hada Labo products!!</li>
            <li>also it feels like jelly which is cute.</li>
            <li>i really love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It works better than La Mer with affordable price.</li>
            <li>I was amazed how well this product was able to keep moisture yet did not feel greasy at all.</li>
            <li>I love how moisturizing this cream is.  </li>
            <li>The difference is that the lovely comfortable moist feeling lasts all day without making me greasy!  </li>
            <li>I settled on using a nickel sized amount for daytime and a bit more at bedtime.</li>
            <li>Its nothing special,just an okay moisturizer,i may try their lotion next,thats supposed to be good,but this i would not repurchase.</li>
            <li>My face just feels more moist when I use this.</li>
            <li>I had a time that it was finished and thought i would be ok just skipping this cream.</li>
            <li>Perfect for sealing in moisture even in a dry climate.</li>
            <li>Best use when your skins still damp after clean with facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>Since I ran out of the first bottle, I have been begging my friends and family visiting from Japan to bring one for me, so I was very pleased to find this product on Amazon.</li>
            <li>There are other wonderful paraben-free products out there.</li>
            <li>Make sure to apply correctly as it is a unique humectant.</li>
            <li>Do keep in mind this gets used up very quickly.</li>
            <li>Easily clogged pores and dehydrated.</li>
            <li>It does not clog your pores and it made fine lines diminished &amp; your complexion lighter &amp; glowy.</li>
            <li>the Philly winter.the texture is light and easy to apply on face.</li>
            <li>When I put it on my skin I immediately get that lovely feeling of soothing comfort that you get when you first apply good moisturizer to thirsty skin (and I use this after the hadolabo toner and 2 drops of pure camellia oil on my face which are already  moisturizing).  </li>
            <li>I do not see it has any huge impact or change on my skin after use</li>
            <li>My face and neck feel so smooth.  </li>
            <li>Goes on light, then your skin stays hydrated for ages.  </li>
            <li>I have normal skin type and am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it&#x27;s really a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>I apply my aloe vera gel &amp; baby lotion right over the top of it.</li>
            <li>comment, just confirmed that the difference was indeed more positive than I thought.</li>
            <li>use it day and night, and some may use only at night because it does leave sort of a nice glow/radiance on your face, this is noticable, I love it</li>
            <li>Great for dry skin to put on before Bb cream</li>
            <li>This is my first time using a japanese skin care product and Im quite happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>All the hyaluronic acid products from Rohto are phenomenal but this cream in particular delivers extraordinary effects immediately.  </li>
            <li>Short term effects are amazing, and the cream&#x27;s structure applies so smooth and penetrates well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have super oily, acne-prone skin</li>
            <li>I love trying new skin products and techniques on my dry&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>This Hada Labo skin care line is unprecedented and delivers noticable results better than any high end French product lines I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>Good to use in dry weather/winter!</li>
            <li>my skin turned very moist and smooth.</li>
            <li>This makes my skin feel really soft, I love it.</li>
            <li>I use it at night and when I wash my face in the morning, I am washing a layer of film that this cream forms, which tells me that it is not being absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li>However, customer service was very quick and professional!!  </li>
            <li>I love Japanese face creams, I have had great success with their high collagen level creams and other ones, I tried this after trying the Sana whitening cream.  </li>
            <li>Amazing product, one of a kind, excels above other hyaluroic acid products.  </li>
            <li>but something to be aware of in case you may not like that.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>But as this is the only thing that keeps my dermatitis at bay I&#x27;ve made an exception : ) Below I have listed the ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This came very well packaged with peanuts and everything!</li>
            <li>Basically, the only way I get great skin is by treating it as very dry skin, and avoiding &amp;#34;oil control&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;anti-acne&amp;#34;, or any product advertised for oily skin like the plague.  </li>
            <li>The Sana left some gross slime all over my face, but this leaves a soft dewy moisture, then absorbs beautifully.  </li>
            <li>It is good for Asian skin, especially in winter !!</li>
            <li>It does hydrate very well.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t really hydrate and the product was sticky and non-absorbant.  </li>
            <li>This Hyaluronic Acid&lt;br /&gt;Cream is VERY moisturizinging.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t do much at all.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t add any real additional moisture.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I know I&#x27;ve used too much.</li>
            <li>Very creamy.</li>
            <li>If its really hot where you live and you tend to sweat a lot, why use this during the day time?</li>
            <li>This is fine for young women who just want to add moisture,  but it&#x27;s not good for older women who need more help.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because I&#x27;m doing the 5 step Japanese quick skin care routine.</li>
            <li>any who... this left my face soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I saw on the Dr. Oz show that the main ingredient in this cream was 1 of 3 (hyaluric acid)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not asian, I&#x27;m a mutt of many ethnicities, mostly white and hispanic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried using more and then less to achieve a nice balance between moisturising and not feeling overly thick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s getting in the skin fast and your skin feels so moist and soft with out being shiny.</li>
            <li>Just got this product ..used twice and is really wonderful...leaves skin soft and radience..</li>
            <li>I cannot comment on very long term effects because I have only used it for about 45 days, but nothing makes my eyes look better or skin look/feel softer than this Hada Labo cream.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll start by saying I have rather oily skin, but I am obsessive about moisturizing because my skin only breaks out or becomes a total oil slick when I don&#x27;t use a great moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Very nice hyaluronic acid moisturizer, I just really really wish they can make the jar packaging into a tube or bottle, for both sanitary reason and preservation purposes, but this is clearly very basic and meant for younger skin, if you are already in your mature ages(or anywhere after 25), using this alone won&#x27;t fix any of your skin concerns, and should only use this as an extra protection layer(or extra hydration) for your other serums and essence, but if you are still young like in your teens or early 20s, then using this would be just fine.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin so soft and moisturizing!</li>
            <li>I use it as the last step of my skincare routine and it really is like a tall glass of water for your skin!  </li>
            <li>do not recommend for sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li>I now use very little of it during the day, so far it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>i make my foundation stay longer and natural</li>
            <li>if you have sensitive skin, you should buy it</li>
            <li>So, the product is not as natural as i wish.</li>
            <li>I am 56 years old and an aesthetic nurse.</li>
            <li>After 10 days of use, I was surprised when my revenged daughter complimented my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin feels incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It leaves my face so soft.  </li>
            <li>I gave this product a shot since other reviewers seemed to rave about the properties, but I really felt like I was just putting straight glycerin on my face-</li>
            <li>It is a little bit smaller then what i expected but it does give my skin a nice feeling.</li>
            <li>But my face started to get dry and had more dead skin to exfoliate after a month</li>
            <li>I go back to my normal use products.</li>
            <li>Its a heavy cream in terms of it containing Hyaluronic Acid but at the same time also a light, whipped cream because of the texture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick but it sinks nicely once you put on your skins.</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews for products and only do so unless I can highly recommend a product or if I don&#x27;t want others to waste their money.</li>
            <li>I apply a thin layer of anti-shine powder and it is just fine!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the temporary soft I&#x27;ve felt from using products with dimethicone, but an actual softness I can feel after showering with completely bare skin.</li>
            <li>The cream is so rich you only need to apply small amount, once on AM and once PM.</li>
            <li>This cream contains a paraben and for someone like myself who is trying to live a more natural lifestyle (cutting out chemicals in deodorants and anything else I apply to my skin and hair)</li>
            <li>Mochi Mochi as it says on the box, haha, meaning soft and firm like mochi.  </li>
            <li>I have combination type skin, Olay Regenerist Microscrulpting cream does not feel heavy to me, but this cream does not seem to get obsorbed and my skin feels very very sticky with it on.</li>
            <li>So please don&#x27;t be discouraged because you may not have sensitive or dry skin.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be deceived by how thin this cream is, it is SO hydrating, no other moisturizer has been able to penetrate my rough skin.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not asian, I&#x27;m a mutt of many ethnicities, mostly white and hispanic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried using more and then less to achieve a nice balance between moisturising and not feeling overly thick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting in the skin fast and your skin feels so moist and soft with out being shiny.</li>
            <li> Just got this product ..used twice and is really wonderful...leaves skin soft and radience..</li>
            <li> I cannot comment on very long term effects because I have only used it for about 45 days, but nothing makes my eyes look better or skin look/feel softer than this Hada Labo cream.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying I have rather oily skin, but I am obsessive about moisturizing because my skin only breaks out or becomes a total oil slick when I don&#x27;t use a great moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Very nice hyaluronic acid moisturizer, I just really really wish they can make the jar packaging into a tube or bottle, for both sanitary reason and preservation purposes, but this is clearly very basic and meant for younger skin, if you are already in your mature ages(or anywhere after 25), using this alone won&#x27;t fix any of your skin concerns, and should only use this as an extra protection layer(or extra hydration) for your other serums and essence, but if you are still young like in your teens or early 20s, then using this would be just fine.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin so soft and moisturizing!</li>
            <li> I use it as the last step of my skincare routine and it really is like a tall glass of water for your skin!  </li>
            <li> do not recommend for sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li> I now use very little of it during the day, so far it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> i make my foundation stay longer and natural</li>
            <li> if you have sensitive skin, you should buy it</li>
            <li> So, the product is not as natural as i wish.</li>
            <li> I am 56 years old and an aesthetic nurse.</li>
            <li> After 10 days of use, I was surprised when my revenged daughter complimented my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin feels incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It leaves my face so soft.  </li>
            <li> I gave this product a shot since other reviewers seemed to rave about the properties, but I really felt like I was just putting straight glycerin on my face-</li>
            <li> It is a little bit smaller then what i expected but it does give my skin a nice feeling.</li>
            <li> But my face started to get dry and had more dead skin to exfoliate after a month</li>
            <li> I go back to my normal use products.</li>
            <li> Its a heavy cream in terms of it containing Hyaluronic Acid but at the same time also a light, whipped cream because of the texture.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick but it sinks nicely once you put on your skins.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews for products and only do so unless I can highly recommend a product or if I don&#x27;t want others to waste their money.</li>
            <li> I apply a thin layer of anti-shine powder and it is just fine!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the temporary soft I&#x27;ve felt from using products with dimethicone, but an actual softness I can feel after showering with completely bare skin.</li>
            <li> The cream is so rich you only need to apply small amount, once on AM and once PM.</li>
            <li> This cream contains a paraben and for someone like myself who is trying to live a more natural lifestyle (cutting out chemicals in deodorants and anything else I apply to my skin and hair)</li>
            <li> Mochi Mochi as it says on the box, haha, meaning soft and firm like mochi.  </li>
            <li> I have combination type skin, Olay Regenerist Microscrulpting cream does not feel heavy to me, but this cream does not seem to get obsorbed and my skin feels very very sticky with it on.</li>
            <li> So please don&#x27;t be discouraged because you may not have sensitive or dry skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be deceived by how thin this cream is, it is SO hydrating, no other moisturizer has been able to penetrate my rough skin.</li>
            <li> A lot of the reviews on here are about using this for sensitive or dry skin, but I believe that as long as you know how you can ease this into your skin regime all skin types can benefit from this.</li>
            <li> Before this my skin was dry and oily at the same time but with this cream all the flakes go away probably because my skin was over compensating by making my flaky skin oily.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes without being too heavy and does not irritate my extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> also suffer from seborrheic dermatitis around my hair line (basically really dry flaky skin thats a pain in the neck to get rid of.</li>
            <li> so it isn&#x27;t patchy and dry.</li>
            <li> My skin was very dry skin but after started using this&lt;br /&gt;Gyokujyn Hyaluronic Acid Cream</li>
            <li> I expected a lot from this product since the Lotion</li>
            <li> And a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I bought it to use as a night cream, but I can&#x27;t due to the stickiness since I am a side sleeper and even the thought of putting a sticky cheek to my pillow will keep me awake.</li>
            <li> A bit too pricey tho for such a SMALL container.</li>
            <li> like that a little bit of the Rohto Cream goes along way</li>
            <li> Have been using it for few years now.</li>
            <li> I use it under makeup in addition to another product just so it won&#x27;t be wasted.</li>
            <li> My sister, who lives in Japan, introduced me to this product a few years ago.</li>
            <li> I had noticed a slight difference in appearance in just 10 days but having my teenager (who I thought noticed little!)</li>
            <li> I live in Minnesota and it gets so cold here that your skin can get so dried out,</li>
            <li> Lately I have been focusing on Japanese/Asian skin care products.</li>
            <li> Not a good line of skin care if you ask me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say, but this was a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> The combination of Arbutin and Hyaluronic Acid can be irritating, but if your skin can help it, it is amazing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product itself did not worked with my skin type</li>
            <li> I can do without it, unfortunately.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> this is one of the best products I have ever used I am on my second jar and about to order another AWESOME!</li>
            <li> I have combination type skin, Olay Regenerist Microscrulpting cream does not feel heavy to me, but this cream does not seem to get obsorbed and my skin feels very very sticky with it on. I bought it to use as a night cream, but I can&#x27;t due to the stickiness since I am a side sleeper and even the thought of putting a sticky cheek to my pillow will keep me awake. I now use very little of it during the day, so far it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> I really love this product! It keeps my skin so soft and moisturizing! will recommend this to everyone around me!!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice hyaluronic acid moisturizer, I just really really wish they can make the jar packaging into a tube or bottle, for both sanitary reason and preservation purposes, but this is clearly very basic and meant for younger skin, if you are already in your mature ages(or anywhere after 25), using this alone won&#x27;t fix any of your skin concerns, and should only use this as an extra protection layer(or extra hydration) for your other serums and essence, but if you are still young like in your teens or early 20s, then using this would be just fine. Do keep in mind this gets used up very quickly.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer . It&#x27;s getting in the skin fast and your skin feels so moist and soft with out being shiny.</li>
            <li> This cream is the best I have used.  It moisturizes without being too heavy and does not irritate my extremely sensitive skin. Just need to dip the tip of your finger in and it does your entire face and neck.</li>
            <li> its so moisturised and not greasy at all. also it feels like jelly which is cute. i make my foundation stay longer and natural</li>
            <li> Muy buena opción para hidratar la piel sin ponerla grasosa. Personalmente me ha ido muy bien y complementándola con la loción funciona aún mejor, además rinde montones.</li>
            <li> Just got this product ..used twice and is really wonderful...leaves skin soft and radience..</li>
            <li> this product has no smell, no additive. i really love it. if you have sensitive skin, you should buy it</li>
            <li> It is a little bit smaller then what i expected but it does give my skin a nice feeling. I do not see it has any huge impact or change on my skin after use but i think it does what it says so i will give it a four stars.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin feel really soft, I love it. &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I use after every facial regiment. My face and neck feel so smooth.  I will definitely repurchase in the future</li>
            <li> It is good for Asian skin, especially in winter !! I&#x27;ve used it for 2 years and still love it!!!!</li>
            <li> This is my go-to moisturizer. Have been using it for few years now. Love it! I use thicker later in Winter, and just a bit in Summer because my skin gets oily.</li>
            <li> This is fine for young women who just want to add moisture,  but it&#x27;s not good for older women who need more help.  I use it under makeup in addition to another product just so it won&#x27;t be wasted.</li>
            <li> This Hada Labo skin care line is unprecedented and delivers noticable results better than any high end French product lines I have ever tried.  All the hyaluronic acid products from Rohto are phenomenal but this cream in particular delivers extraordinary effects immediately.  Short term effects are amazing, and the cream&#x27;s structure applies so smooth and penetrates well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it day and night, and some may use only at night because it does leave sort of a nice glow/radiance on your face, this is noticable, I love it but something to be aware of in case you may not like that.  I cannot comment on very long term effects because I have only used it for about 45 days, but nothing makes my eyes look better or skin look/feel softer than this Hada Labo cream.  Amazing product, one of a kind, excels above other hyaluroic acid products.  Great job Mentholtuam and Rohto, the Hado Labo skin care line is the best.</li>
            <li> I have been using Hadarabo products for about one year. My skin was very dry skin but after started using this&lt;br /&gt;Gyokujyn Hyaluronic Acid Cream my skin turned very moist and smooth. I love this product.</li>
            <li> AMAZING.  I&#x27;ve bought so many expensive eye/face creams at Sephora and this beats them all.  This is the ONLY thing that helps with eczema around my eyes.  Goes on light, then your skin stays hydrated for ages.  Great as a night cream, or for some skin hydration before getting on an airplane.</li>
            <li> It does hydrate very well. I use it at night and wake up with my skin looking refreshed. Why 3 starts? It has parabens ( a preservative which were find in a breast cancer tissues) So, the product is not as natural as i wish. I will use it but wont buy it again. There are other wonderful paraben-free products out there.</li>
            <li> I have tried almost everything under the sun. I have acne prone skins. Easily clogged pores and dehydrated. This cream is by far the best moisturiser I have ever tried. It&#x27;s thick but it sinks nicely once you put on your skins. It does not clog your pores and it made fine lines diminished &amp; your complexion lighter &amp; glowy. Every morning I wake up with smoother skins after using this cream overnight. It works better than La Mer with affordable price. Would never leavr this cream even a day. Best use when your skins still damp after clean with facial cleanser. The cream is so rich you only need to apply small amount, once on AM and once PM. So far I&#x27;m loving all Hada Labo products!!</li>
            <li> I live in Minnesota and it gets so cold here that your skin can get so dried out, even people with oily skin can&#x27;t find relief. Don&#x27;t be deceived by how thin this cream is, it is SO hydrating, no other moisturizer has been able to penetrate my rough skin. It is not greasy and somehow balances my oils. Before this my skin was dry and oily at the same time but with this cream all the flakes go away probably because my skin was over compensating by making my flaky skin oily. This stuff is hg.</li>
            <li> very nice cream, you can feel it turns so smooth and the wrinkles dissapear...</li>
            <li> I gave this product a shot since other reviewers seemed to rave about the properties, but I really felt like I was just putting straight glycerin on my face- it didn&#x27;t really hydrate and the product was sticky and non-absorbant.  I even woke up with sticky face the next day.  I bought the matching hyaluronic acid lotions with it and same thing.  Not a good line of skin care if you ask me.  I returned all three products promptly.  Thank goodness for Amazon&#x27;s amazing customer service.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it is very popular in japan and korea for the skin hydration. Unfortunately, this product itself did not worked with my skin type so i had to retun it. However, customer service was very quick and professional!!  I was very pleased with the customer service,  even though the product did not worked out to my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleaseed with the results</li>
            <li> I love it Rohto Hadalabo Gokujyun cream!</li>
            <li> My sister, who lives in Japan, introduced me to this product a few years ago. I was amazed how well this product was able to keep moisture yet did not feel greasy at all. Since I ran out of the first bottle, I have been begging my friends and family visiting from Japan to bring one for me, so I was very pleased to find this product on Amazon. Good job, Amazon!</li>
            <li> I use it at night and when I wash my face in the morning, I am washing a layer of film that this cream forms, which tells me that it is not being absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li> I love how moisturizing this cream is.  I use it as the last step of my skincare routine and it really is like a tall glass of water for your skin!  I&#x27;ll start by saying I have rather oily skin, but I am obsessive about moisturizing because my skin only breaks out or becomes a total oil slick when I don&#x27;t use a great moisturizer.  Basically, the only way I get great skin is by treating it as very dry skin, and avoiding &amp;#34;oil control&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;anti-acne&amp;#34;, or any product advertised for oily skin like the plague.  That being said, this is the best moisturizer I have used.  When I put it on my skin I immediately get that lovely feeling of soothing comfort that you get when you first apply good moisturizer to thirsty skin (and I use this after the hadolabo toner and 2 drops of pure camellia oil on my face which are already  moisturizing).  The difference is that the lovely comfortable moist feeling lasts all day without making me greasy!  Perfect for sealing in moisture even in a dry climate.</li>
            <li> I am 56 years old and an aesthetic nurse. I love trying new skin products and techniques on my dry&lt;br /&gt;and aging skin. Lately I have been focusing on Japanese/Asian skin care products. This Hyaluronic Acid&lt;br /&gt;Cream is VERY moisturizinging. Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t do much at all. I expected a lot from this product since the Lotion Moist works so well, but this...I&#x27;m sorry to say, but this was a big disappointment. It didn&#x27;t add any real additional moisture. I can do without it, unfortunately. Can&#x27;t win them all, I guess.</li>
            <li> Good to use in dry weather/winter! Help me ease the Philly winter.the texture is light and easy to apply on face.</li>
            <li> Lightweight cream, I use it over entire face, reapply to deeper creases throughout the day. Thought it was a fair price for someone with combination skin. I apply my aloe vera gel &amp; baby lotion right over the top of it. I don&#x27;t use foundation, so&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how that would work.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I have super oily, acne-prone skin and I use this as a night cream. A lot of the reviews on here are about using this for sensitive or dry skin, but I believe that as long as you know how you can ease this into your skin regime all skin types can benefit from this. So please don&#x27;t be discouraged because you may not have sensitive or dry skin. If its really hot where you live and you tend to sweat a lot, why use this during the day time? Things like that you should take into consideration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that a little bit of the Rohto Cream goes along way Its a heavy cream in terms of it containing Hyaluronic Acid but at the same time also a light, whipped cream because of the texture. I take a dap/fingertip amount from the lid (because there is some cream on the lid. I don&#x27;t even use the jar yet!) and thats enough for my face and neck. If I can feel the &amp;#34;heaviness&amp;#34; of the cream on me I know I&#x27;ve used too much. So I can definitely see this jar lasting for about 7-8 months or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also suffer from seborrheic dermatitis around my hair line (basically really dry flaky skin thats a pain in the neck to get rid of. Its not dandruff, not contagious and even after washing, the spots affected by dermatitis still lingers) and I started to notice my flakes disappearing after using this cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con would be the ingredients. This cream contains a paraben and for someone like myself who is trying to live a more natural lifestyle (cutting out chemicals in deodorants and anything else I apply to my skin and hair) this may not be for you. But as this is the only thing that keeps my dermatitis at bay I&#x27;ve made an exception : ) Below I have listed the ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water, Glycerin, Diglycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Squalane, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behenyl Alcohol, Carbomer, Dimethicone, Disodium EDTA, Glyceryl Stearate, Methylparaben, PEG-20 Sorbitan Isostearate, Phytosteryl/Octyldocecyl Lauroyl Glutamate, Propylparaben, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Stearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall after about 2 weeks of use my skin is softer (even if I forget to apply this at night) and *knock on wood* I haven&#x27;t seen a pimple yet. If you&#x27;re not one to be bothered with ingredient labels then I definitely recommend it. This is my first time using a japanese skin care product and Im quite happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This came very well packaged with peanuts and everything! I bought this because I&#x27;m doing the 5 step Japanese quick skin care routine. After washing my face before bed I put some of this on (haven&#x27;t received my Japanese toner yet the 2nd step) any who... this left my face soft and smooth. It isn&#x27;t sticky either. Very creamy. No smell. And a little goes a long way. A bit too pricey tho for such a SMALL container. Didn&#x27;t break my face out either. Great for dry skin to put on before Bb cream so it isn&#x27;t patchy and dry. Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Moisturizes well and feels very light. Make sure to apply correctly as it is a unique humectant.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the milky drops, but Hada Labo still makes a great product.</li>
            <li> My skin reacts to almost everything but this has been a miracle cream. Works best when you spritz water on top of it (I like the Evian sprays)</li>
            <li> I saw on the Dr. Oz show that the main ingredient in this cream was 1 of 3 (hyaluric acid) that he said were the ONLY proven ingredients to actually help to reverse the signs of aging. I researched several items containing hyaluric acid. This seemed to have the best combination if positive reviews, highest hyaluric acid content, &amp; seller confidence ratings. I also purchased a different brand of toner (lotion) and use this cream after the toner. I use it both day and night. I have used la prairie, Chanel, and Lancome, as well as brands from drugstores. I have normal skin type and am very pleased with this product. I tried using more and then less to achieve a nice balance between moisturising and not feeling overly thick. I settled on using a nickel sized amount for daytime and a bit more at bedtime. After 10 days of use, I was surprised when my revenged daughter complimented my skin. I had noticed a slight difference in appearance in just 10 days but having my teenager (who I thought noticed little!) comment, just confirmed that the difference was indeed more positive than I thought. My skin feels incredibly soft. It&#x27;s not the temporary soft I&#x27;ve felt from using products with dimethicone, but an actual softness I can feel after showering with completely bare skin. I am beginning to see a softness in wrinkles around my eyes (20 days use). My skin is amazingly supple and would not hesitate to recommend it. I will continue to use this product and hope it is never discontinued. I rarely write reviews for products and only do so unless I can highly recommend a product or if I don&#x27;t want others to waste their money. This I can definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Its nothing special,just an okay moisturizer,i may try their lotion next,thats supposed to be good,but this i would not repurchase.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd order. My face just feels more moist when I use this. I had a time that it was finished and thought i would be ok just skipping this cream. But my face started to get dry and had more dead skin to exfoliate after a month or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This face feels sticky after applying and tends to give shine. I apply a thin layer of anti-shine powder and it is just fine!</li>
            <li> I am an Asian women but it does not help me, my face had red dots after using it a couple of days. I go back to my normal use products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not asian, I&#x27;m a mutt of many ethnicities, mostly white and hispanic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been working on my fair skin, keeping it porceline even in the summer.  This stuff is AMAZING.  I love Japanese face creams, I have had great success with their high collagen level creams and other ones, I tried this after trying the Sana whitening cream.  The Sana left some gross slime all over my face, but this leaves a soft dewy moisture, then absorbs beautifully.  I see results quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend for sensitive skin!  The combination of Arbutin and Hyaluronic Acid can be irritating, but if your skin can help it, it is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my face so soft.  Mochi Mochi as it says on the box, haha, meaning soft and firm like mochi.  (that&#x27;s a good thing, if you don&#x27;t know what mochi is lol)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s really a fantastic product.  I recommend it over the Sana any day.</li>
