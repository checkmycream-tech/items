    <ol>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t to happy with this product!!!!</li>
            <li>I am very impressed and very happy!  </li>
            <li>Great concept and</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m still happy with what I got</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love the way it cleans!</li>
            <li>Makes brush cleaning so easy and a fraction of the price of the spa glove!</li>
            <li>So glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li>I got this, and I love it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use my naked hand anymore to clean them and hope for the best.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE:  This does NOT do an excellent job deep cleaning large brushes...</li>
            <li>So easy to clean my makeup brushes.  </li>
            <li>it DID get my makeup brushes clean, but it doesn&#x27;t fit on my fingers.</li>
            <li>Added soap &amp; water, rubbed the brush over the brushegg, rinsed &amp; repeat until brush was clean.</li>
            <li>Gets all the makeup out of them quickly</li>
            <li>If you want to wash your brushes quickly and you don&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money on the Sigma glove, this is what you need.</li>
            <li>Package came in quick.</li>
            <li>used under very hot water.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a mit that fit over the hands but the Sigma mit cost too much.</li>
            <li>It absolutely cuts the times it takes to clean a brush (thoroughly and deeply) in half...or more!  </li>
            <li>The ridges help get all that liquid foundation and cream eyeshadows right off.</li>
            <li>Clean my brushes very well and doesn&#x27;t ruin the shape</li>
            <li>it does much, much better with the smaller brushes.  </li>
            <li>and it keeps your finger out of hot water and the brushes do lather up rubbing against it.  </li>
            <li>OK but not a necessary item.</li>
            <li>My brushes were pristine when I used this, much better than the traditional method of cleaning.</li>
            <li>I used to just wash them over and over and over until the water ran clean, but you can see that the round knobbies and straight lines across this item gets between the brush hairs and clean them in no time!  </li>
            <li>It is much cheaper and the textures on this do well at cleaning your make-up brushes.</li>
            <li>Cleans so much easier than using your hands.</li>
            <li>If nothing else it will surely cut down on your cleaning time.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On the other hand, it does well cleaning the tips of large brushes and then I deep clean the large brushes as always.</li>
            <li>I chose to clean a brush that I find very difficult to clean.</li>

            <li> Small... yes, but it works. it cut my brush cleaning time in about half. I don&#x27;t have to use my naked hand anymore to clean them and hope for the best. The ridges help get all that liquid foundation and cream eyeshadows right off.</li>
            <li> So easy to clean my makeup brushes.  Gets all the makeup out of them quickly</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t to happy with this product!!!!</li>
            <li> I had NO idea that there was an invention to help wash makeup brushes until I received one of these with a makeup brush that I ordered!  NOW I wonder how I ever lived without it.  It absolutely cuts the times it takes to clean a brush (thoroughly and deeply) in half...or more!  I used to just wash them over and over and over until the water ran clean, but you can see that the round knobbies and straight lines across this item gets between the brush hairs and clean them in no time!  I am very impressed and very happy!  I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  This does NOT do an excellent job deep cleaning large brushes...it does much, much better with the smaller brushes.  On the other hand, it does well cleaning the tips of large brushes and then I deep clean the large brushes as always.</li>
            <li> I wanted a mit that fit over the hands but the Sigma mit cost too much. This fits on a finger and it keeps your finger out of hot water and the brushes do lather up rubbing against it.  So, it&#x27;s a nifty tool for cleaning cushion puffs and makeup brushes. It looks like the photo and fits on a finger  and that has ridges. It&#x27;s thick enough that it doesn&#x27;t get hot on you used under very hot water.  Big enough to rug a brush head against. Sits well on the hand. Does the job well.</li>
            <li> I love it! Clean my brushes very well and doesn&#x27;t ruin the shape</li>
            <li> Great concept and it DID get my makeup brushes clean, but it doesn&#x27;t fit on my fingers. So it kept sliding off, which is annoying.</li>
            <li> I purchased both this and the Sigma Spa Cleaning Glove and I would recommend that you get this instead. It is much cheaper and the textures on this do well at cleaning your make-up brushes. This is a bit pricey again for an item that is functional as a mini washboard. If you want to save money though just do the trick of making glue gun designs on a plastic clipboard - you can find tutorials for this on YouTube.</li>
            <li> This works but is not necessary.  You can use the palm of your hand for cleaning your makeup brushes.  I will use it because I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize how small it was gonna be.</li>
            <li> Just got this in the mail &amp; had to try it out immediately. I chose to clean a brush that I find very difficult to clean. Added soap &amp; water, rubbed the brush over the brushegg, rinsed &amp; repeat until brush was clean. It cleaned this difficult brush in no time. So glad I made this purchase. I plan on getting one for my mom &amp; telling all my friends about it.</li>
            <li> i loooove my bursh egg it seriously cut my time of cleaning all my brushes (about 45 of them) in half. i look forward to washing them now!</li>
            <li> Makes brush cleaning so easy and a fraction of the price of the spa glove!</li>
            <li> OK but not a necessary item.</li>
            <li> Cleans so much easier than using your hands.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I couldn&#x27;t deal with the thought of buying the Sigma glove. It just feels way too expensive. I got this, and I love it. If nothing else it will surely cut down on your cleaning time. My brushes were pristine when I used this, much better than the traditional method of cleaning. If you want to wash your brushes quickly and you don&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money on the Sigma glove, this is what you need.</li>
            <li> Package came in quick. Wish it was a lighter shade of purple. It&#x27;s a bit darker than shown in pic. But I&#x27;m still happy with what I got</li>
            <li> Love the way it cleans!</li>
