            <li>I love Shaper!  </li>
            <li>My daughter &amp; granddaughters love Sebastian Shaper Hairspray!</li>
            <li>Great for fine hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and this spray allows me to spray it on and then style it.  </li>
            <li>It brushes out easily &amp; doesn&#x27;t clog their hair!</li>
            <li>Its very light weight</li>
            <li>It is a very light hair spray.  </li>
            <li>This hairspray is very light but holds well.</li>
            <li>Very lightly scented but not obnoxiously so like many salon products.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this hair spray for many years and would not change it for anything else.</li>
            <li>I always love this hairspray, but one of the three cans will not spray---what do do?</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hairspray.</li>
            <li>Shaper has been my favorite hair spray for decades.</li>
            <li>Love this hairspray and have been using it for awhile.  </li>
            <li>Love the shaper spray..</li>
            <li>I love this hairspray.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been able to finish a can without breakage.  </li>
            <li>But my wife likes it better.</li>
            <li>and I just love them.</li>
            <li>But even though it brushes out easily and doesn&#x27;t build up, it does hold well.</li>
            <li>the smell isn&#x27;t strong</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong hold.  </li>
            <li>It shampoos out beautifully even after 2-3 days of daily use.</li>
            <li>Hairspray works fine.</li>
            <li>i love sebastian products and especially shaper, this is a great hair spray because it holds well and smells nice but is not hard or sticky</li>
            <li>It is a light and touchable hold that lasts my hair all day.  </li>
            <li>As with any aerosol hair spray, rinse the nozzle in hot water and wipe dry after each use to ensure the best spray density.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with everything, thanks!</li>
            <li>I have tried other professional products and I find that Sebastian works best for me.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite.</li>
            <li>I love that it goes on &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; and that I can brush through it easily and restyle my hair if necessary.</li>
            <li>I suggested it to a friend who has the same kind of hair.</li>
            <li>Item is exactly as described, and arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the regular Sebastian Shaper Hairspray, it&#x27;s a good value.</li>
            <li>Goog price and received very fast.</li>
            <li>Excellent, light spray for fine or thin hair; does not weigh down the hair.  </li>
            <li>first time my hairdresser put it on my hair, 4 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s really not as expensive as you might think.</li>
            <li>Exactly what my wife wanted at a competitive price.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many others and always go back to this</li>
            <li>this is a terrific hairspray that I have used for a long time and will continue to use because it is great at holding the hair and just brushes out.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The hold is good, but not sticky and the smell is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>It really does not hold.  </li>
            <li>This hairspray really holds my curls, no matter what the weather.</li>
            <li>It is far better than I expected</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Because I have long hair, I don&#x27;t shampoo it daily, so I also love that there is no hairspray build-up with Shaper.</li>
            <li>love the small diameter cans</li>
            <li>I found this seller, because the price with free shipping is significantly less than I would pay anywhere else.  </li>
            <li>Used once in the morning, this spray doesn&#x27;t get sticky, isn&#x27;t too stiff, just gives the hair some hold and combs out easily, but helps the hair maintain its shape.  </li>
            <li>Not stiff or sticky but holds.</li>
            <li>It just keeps your hair in shape in a soft and natural way.</li>
            <li>It leaves the hair looking natural, softer and lasts without stiffness.</li>
            <li>It is not heavy nor sticky.</li>
            <li>I have fine but thick hair, and live in south Florida with a lot of humidity.  </li>
            <li>This hair spray and the extra hold (which is too heavy for fine hair) are packaged almost identically, so check the description or label carefully.  </li>

            <li> and I expected a lot.</li>
            <li> I have tried to switch away from this hairspray in the past, thinking I could get away with paying less money, BUT neither cheaper nor more expensive hair sprays compare to this one.  </li>
            <li> Lost pressure in can and can not use half if the product.</li>
            <li> prefer the regular \\&quot;Shaper\\&quot; spray, as opposed to the heavy duty \\&quot;Shaper\\&quot; spray, as the heavy duty one is too sticky and hard to brush&lt;br /&gt;out</li>
            <li> leave my hair a mess.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine/thin hair and yet keeps the style without getting sticky and stiff.  </li>
            <li> , it makes your hair too stiff.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff.</li>
            <li> Holds your hair in place but does not look or feel stiff.</li>
            <li> It holds your curls in and also it does not have that hard crunchie feeling after you use it.</li>
            <li> There is never any sticky or hard feeling using this spray.</li>
            <li> I have used Sebastian products since the late 80&#x27;s</li>
            <li> While I absolutely adore this hairspray, hate the defective nozzles.  </li>
            <li> No hold, not happy at all with this product.</li>
            <li> Spray can is horrible.</li>

            <li> It is far better than I expected and I expected a lot. It leaves the hair looking natural, softer and lasts without stiffness. A really great product m</li>
            <li> This is the best hair spray ever.  It holds your curls in and also it does not have that hard crunchie feeling after you use it. Its very light weight and it smells good to.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair spray I ever tried. I&#x27;d try hundreds before but they don&#x27;t work...leave my hair a mess.</li>
            <li> Yes I like it.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine/thin hair and yet keeps the style without getting sticky and stiff.  I suggested it to a friend who has the same kind of hair.</li>
            <li> I love Sebastian Shaper! The regular - not the Shaper Plus. I&#x27;ve been using this for over 20 years and it&#x27;s the one hairspray that I cannot be without. I love that it goes on &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; and that I can brush through it easily and restyle my hair if necessary. Because I have long hair, I don&#x27;t shampoo it daily, so I also love that there is no hairspray build-up with Shaper. It shampoos out beautifully even after 2-3 days of daily use. But even though it brushes out easily and doesn&#x27;t build up, it does hold well. Best. Hairspray. Ever.</li>
            <li> I always love this hairspray, but one of the three cans will not spray---what do do? Return?</li>
            <li> Goog price and received very fast. This is my favorite hairspray. It is not sticky and holds my hairstyle well</li>
            <li> Shaper has been my favorite hair spray for decades. You can work with it. It is not heavy nor sticky.</li>
            <li> perfect and quick and easy--thank you</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended it.  It really does not hold.  It could be that I am not using enough.  On a 5-star rating, it is not sticky.</li>
            <li> Excellent, light spray for fine or thin hair; does not weigh down the hair.  Very lightly scented but not obnoxiously so like many salon products.

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and like it a great deal.  Before deciding to look online, I bought this from the beauty/barber shops; but they are much more expensive there.  My hair is very fine and this spray allows me to spray it on and then style it.  It doesn&#x27;t have a strong hold.  It just allows you to spray and style.  You would need the Shaper Plus for a stronger hold.</li>
            <li> Product is great. Spray can is horrible. Lost pressure in can and can not use half if the product. Contacted seller and have not heard back yet.</li>
            <li> While I absolutely adore this hairspray, hate the defective nozzles.  Haven&#x27;t been able to finish a can without breakage.  Sebastian needs to fix this so I can quit wasting my money on half-empty cans.  Using L&#x27;Oreal Elnet until that happens.</li>
            <li> Love this holding spray! It doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff.</li>
            <li> But my wife likes it better.</li>
            <li> It is a very light hair spray.  Holds your hair in place but does not look or feel stiff. Great for fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have used Sebastian products since the late 80&#x27;s and I just love them. I have tried other professional products and I find that Sebastian works best for me.</li>
            <li> i love sebastian products and especially shaper, this is a great hair spray because it holds well and smells nice but is not hard or sticky</li>
            <li> I have been using this hair spray for years and like it. Thank you for good service</li>
            <li> love the small diameter cans</li>
            <li> I love Shaper!  It&#x27;s the best hairspray ever!!</li>
            <li> Item is exactly as described, and arrived quickly.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> met every expectation</li>
            <li> This hairspray is very light but holds well. I cant stand the smell though</li>
            <li> Superb product!&lt;br /&gt;Sebastian is wonderful.  I also use Sebastian&#x27;s Laminates Conditioner which is the best conditioner on the planet.&lt;br /&gt;I can spray my hair and it doesn&#x27;t take the shine out of my hair and has no residue.&lt;br /&gt;It was recommended to me by someone at work.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great product! Doesn&#x27;t leave over any residue like some haisprays do.</li>
            <li> No hold, not happy at all with this product.</li>
            <li> My daughter &amp; granddaughters love Sebastian Shaper Hairspray! It brushes out easily &amp; doesn&#x27;t clog their hair! Have a wonderfully blessed 2015!</li>
