            <li>One of the best parts about this tanning towels is the smell and the solution</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best sunless tanning product I have found.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s about time to wise up!</li>
            <li>But the shipping was excellent and the product arrived in good shape.</li>
            <li>This looked so good on T.V.that</li>
            <li>I am really fair skinned, and have tried just about every self-tan product out there.</li>

            <li>This is a really good product</li>
            <li>I read a good tip here, when doing backs of hands, hold towel with a cloth or tissue over it to avoid the palms.</li>
            <li>I have just tried this product, and I have to say I am very satisfied.</li>

            <li>Easy to use and great tan in no time.  </li>
            <li>By dinner time I had a BEAUTIFUL golden brown tan!</li>
            <li>Good product, delivery ok</li>
            <li>The wipes are kind of flimsy and tended to roll if fully opened.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked them and the color</li>
            <li>No streaking, no orange, no terrible smell, etc..  Love them!</li>
            <li>I had used L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s towlettes before and liked them, but everyone seemed to think these Comodynes were better.</li>
            <li>I think that this is by far the best self-tanner I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I have very fair skin, and this product gave me a nice, natural looking tan and it is SO EASY to use!</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use and gives a nice even tan, just remember to wash your hands thouroughly afterwards</li>
            <li>It also requires more than one towel for your body.</li>
            <li>I exfoliated in the shower and put on Cetaphil moisturizer over my entire body (the BEST lotion I&#x27;ve used to date).  </li>
            <li>maybe you&#x27;ll have better luck.  </li>
            <li>Comodynes really does work, It worked in 2-3 hours, and I had a great looking tan, and some advice wear like a plastic glove when you put it on, or else your hand will turn all brown</li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>They leave you streaky and most of them turn you orange.  </li>
            <li>way it is safe for your body and inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>Not my favorite at all.</li>
            <li>Skin cancer runs in our family, so these is a safe way for me to tan.</li>
            <li>This is a bummer, having to apply it more then once a week.</li>
            <li>but I wanted to make sure I did every area as evenly as poss.</li>
            <li>- this towel give me more of a reddish toned  tan -</li>
            <li>Takes more towlettes than they say.</li>
            <li>it looks real and doesn&#x27;t look orange on me, at all - I&#x27;m pleased and hooked for the summer!!</li>
            <li>I love this towlette and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>While the resultant color was good, it took more than one towel to cover the whole body.  </li>
            <li>I tried these the other night, and am very impressed.</li>
            <li>and it is so easy to apply and</li>
            <li>they go anywhere easily.</li>
            <li>It is easier than the self-tanning creams but not the fantastic product I anticipated.</li>
            <li>I was suprised how easy to use they were, and I was able to do my whole body with just one towel!</li>
            <li>, I think this product is very good, other</li>
            <li>takes more than one towel to do your whole body EVENLY -</li>
            <li>One towlette for each leg and two more if you are going to cover your whole body.</li>
            <li>Dries fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>every four days is pretty cheap</li>
            <li>So I went over just my arms and legs again, last night and am VERY pleased, this morning.  </li>
            <li>Very un-happy with the results and the number of towletts I had to use just to acheive a light tan.</li>
            <li>They were fabulous but could get very pricey ($20 a session which lasted for a week).  </li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ve used other GOOD brands and have been literally sickened and overwhelemed by the smell.</li>
            <li>couple things I didn&#x27;t like right off the bat.  </li>
            <li>It dries almost right away</li>
            <li>You have much more control over it, it doesn&#x27;t roll up at all, and it is faster to apply it so it won&#x27;t dry up so quickly.  </li>
            <li>no streaking ever, and they travel beautifully, since they are individually packaged, and take up absolutely no space.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect to add some color in the winter without looking streaky or fake tan.</li>
            <li>First, how to use the product: it says to take a shower and to moisturize, I&#x27;m a guy and don&#x27;t do the moisturizing thing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty small/thin - and it took 3 towels, the first time -</li>
            <li>You have to have someone else put it on your back to make sure you don&#x27;t end up with streaks.</li>
            <li>The Comodynes tanning towelettes were very quick to use and quick to dry.</li>
            <li>Those things aren&#x27;t safe and will make me look like a leather sofa, before too long.</li>
            <li>Another thing that helps is to start on a large body part (stomach, chest, legs, do NOT start on you face) and work you way out.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t have much of a smell either.</li>
            <li>Mine really didn&#x27;t show up at all.  </li>
            <li>nothing remotely resembling the spray on tans I had come to love from the salon.</li>
            <li>If you are already dark-skinned you won&#x27;t notice much difference.</li>
            <li>, you can imagine how much money and time</li>
            <li>I would have given this 5 stars but it did not darken as much as I wanted.</li>
            <li>This does work really well</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, they are very thing and roll when trying to use them.</li>
            <li>I have used L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Sublime Bronze and they are much thicker and easier to use.</li>
            <li>You still have to use 2 or 3 to cover your whole body</li>
            <li>Within hours, a nice color began to form, went to bed and woke up with a very nice base tan for Mem.</li>
            <li>(Comodynes) tan isn&#x27;t the exact tan you&#x27;d get at the beach - I usually tan diff.in the sun - nice deep, golden olive</li>
            <li>Not messy at all, and far superior to those messy bottled lotions.</li>
            <li>But much to my dismay most of them turn me an uneven orangy-brown color...</li>
            <li>I would keep coming back to the starting area and pick up some of the moister to spread it out more.</li>
            <li>And you have to move quickly so the towelette doesn&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li>These towelettes provide &#x27;natural and uniform color&#x27;, just as they are labeled!  </li>
            <li>Now, on my olive w/ yellow undertones skin - first application was med./dark and noticeably TANNER.</li>
            <li>I first bought the towelettes I used one a day for the first 5 days to get my tan DARK.  </li>
            <li>I just purchased these towlettes based on multiple positive reviews.</li>
            <li>These towelettes are a quick tan remedy and are not as drying as other tan towels I have tried.</li>
            <li>This is no fuss - clear towels  - can do it and get dressed 10 min.</li>
            <li>B000GG2HOU L&#x27;Oreal Sublime Bronze Self-Tanning Towelettes . - Medium Natural Tan]]</li>
            <li>It actually took 4 applications and still did not get that much of a tan.  </li>
            <li>I know that sometimes you have to use a couple before you really see results, so I gave it a second chance.  </li>
            <li>Even went as far as using two in one day (one in the morning and again in the evening).  </li>
            <li>the tan looks really natural and it has no streaks at all</li>
            <li>but you definitely need two towels for the whole body.</li>
            <li>Looks natural.  </li>
            <li>and there is no mess to it at all like lotions and foams.</li>
            <li>That averages out to a little over $20 a month which is about the price of two tans if you are lucky.  </li>
            <li>I would recommends these little towelettes to anyone just looking for a quick tan.  </li>
            <li>My only complaints are it took longer than 3 hours for the color to show up on my skin and one towel isn&#x27;t enough to cover the whole body.</li>
            <li>The color was very natural, but it was definitely gradual.</li>
            <li>For the ease of use and the natural color I would definitely recommend buying it.</li>
            <li>The smell is ok but not strong at all; it&#x27;s gone in a few minuets.</li>
            <li>But the only real problem is if you are looking for a really dark tan.</li>
            <li>The even better part is there is absolutely no oily feel, I&#x27;m the type of person that can&#x27;t go to sleep feeling dirty or greasy, so I was planning on taking another shower after it dried but didn&#x27;t have to I felt fine.</li>
            <li>and it dried up very fast because it took so long to apply because I kept having to unroll it.  </li>

            <li> This caused my foot to be very dark and the solution flowed down my foot making a funny looking cloud affect.</li>
            <li> I am very pale and the steps up in color work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That gave me minor color ...</li>
            <li> Oh and that minor tint disappeared in 2 days (not the four days they said I&#x27;d get out of it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> It saves me from frying in a tanning bed or spending long hours burning in the sun.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I definitely recommend it to anyone who doesn&#x27;t like to tan the old-fashioned way!</li>
            <li> I ordered these single use tan towels.</li>
            <li> and I will use it for special ocassions - just so expensive.   </li>
            <li> Not nearly as good as the Intense Comodynes wipes.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t smell bad, are easy to use, BUT they don&#x27;t make you tanner!  </li>
            <li> I have used one other brand of tanning towelettes as well as several other self tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> But I actually like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t change you black at one time</li>
            <li> However I wouldn&#x27;t expect to get very dark unless you do several applications.</li>
            <li> About an hour later after I was fully dried</li>
            <li> You have to be careful with lotions when applying over the knees and the elbows or else</li>
            <li> You have to be careful putting it on.</li>
            <li> The smell, compared to other self tanners, is minimal and tolerable and comes when the tan starts to develop, I did cover it up w/scented lotion when I went out</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, so I bought a three pak.</li>
            <li> I would recommend using gloves or washing your hands extremely well after usage because it will turn your palms brown.  </li>
            <li> I just used it yesterday, but other people say 3 to 5 days.</li>
            <li> I go very slow and try to cover every part of the skin evenly and the tan is very natural looking.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use &amp; doesn&#x27;t come off as bad as others in the shower.</li>
            <li> is the Neutrogena instant bronzer, which isn&#x27;t salon quality but at least gets me somewhat tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it will come out too dark and won&#x27;t look natural.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> I would not recommend it for those with naturally dark tan skin, as the color may not show up well.</li>
            <li> Like someone else mentioned I would use a plastic glove so you don&#x27;t get black hands.</li>
            <li> A little dark and make spot ...</li>
            <li> I use those little throw away rubber gloves to apply.</li>
            <li> Then I got the idea of keeping it folded, and then unfold it a little at a time while applying it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a few things that are a little bothersome.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lotions are way too messy and hard to apply.  </li>
            <li> find that I need two towelettes to cover my whole body, but at usually around $1.50 a towel, that isn&#x27;t bad compared to tanning beds.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money again on this!</li>
            <li> Not sure why I decided to try these.</li>
            <li> key with these towels, while they do roll up on you and can be difficult - is PATIENCE.</li>
            <li> They are a little pricey for how thin</li>
            <li> at least I can wear jeans until the stuff wears off.</li>
            <li> You CAN use them on your face, just use common sense and don&#x27;t put it on your eyes.  </li>
            <li> Awful.......the wipe bunches up, the color streaks and is very uneven, and it makes your skin orange!</li>
            <li> I did notice some streaking, but it was very faint, and only because I was not as thorough as I&#x27;d thought.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s subtle</li>
            <li> There was also a weird smell from them, nothing that I couldn&#x27;t tolerate.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t do this the fist time and started at my foot.</li>
            <li> It was very frustrating how it rolled up almost immediately</li>
            <li> This product is a mess - streaking and bad color!  </li>
            <li> then that there&#x27;s nothing bad about it, just it kinda smells.</li>
            <li> and they dont make you smell bad</li>
            <li> The towel bunches up a bit while applying which can be annoying</li>
            <li> Hate this product!</li>
            <li> me streaky, orange, and it smelt awful!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I just purchased these towlettes based on multiple positive reviews. I had used L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s towlettes before and liked them, but everyone seemed to think these Comodynes were better. THEY ARE NOT. They don&#x27;t smell bad, are easy to use, BUT they don&#x27;t make you tanner!  I have a dance competition coming up and now have to run out and try to find the L&#x27;Oreal product locally.  Bottom line? Don&#x27;t waste your money. Use L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s towlettes instead.[[ASIN:B000GG2HOU L&#x27;Oreal Sublime Bronze Self-Tanning Towelettes . - Medium Natural Tan]]</li>
            <li> Hate this product! Don&#x27;t waste your time or money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Left me streaky, orange, and it smelt awful! I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money again on this!</li>
            <li> This looked so good on T.V.that I ordered these single use tan towels.While the resultant color was good, it took more than one towel to cover the whole body.  Additionally, the towels roll up as you use them so several times during the application you have to stop and unroll it before you can continue. It is easier than the self-tanning creams but not the fantastic product I anticipated. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Good product, delivery ok</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product and well-priced.  You will have a perfectly even tan....no streaking ever, and they travel beautifully, since they are individually packaged, and take up absolutely no space.  Not messy at all, and far superior to those messy bottled lotions.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and great tan in no time.  Definitely use again.</li>
            <li> The Comodynes tanning towelettes were very quick to use and quick to dry. They don&#x27;t have much of a smell either. The towel bunches up a bit while applying which can be annoying but overall it was managable.&lt;BR&gt;     The color was very natural, but it was definitely gradual. It took longer than the 2-3 hours it said on the package for me.It also requires more than one towel for your body. &lt;BR&gt;     For the ease of use and the natural color I would definitely recommend buying it. However I wouldn&#x27;t expect to get very dark unless you do several applications. For someone who is very fair it very subtly takes the edge off of the &amp;quot;white glow&amp;quot; with one application,without looking fake and streaky.</li>
            <li> It actually took 4 applications and still did not get that much of a tan.  When they advertised this product on tv they said it will not stain your palms.  That is a lie.  Plus it leaves streaks and some spots orange looking.  This product is not at all as South Beach had advertised.  I do not think I will use it again.  Very un-happy with the results and the number of towletts I had to use just to acheive a light tan.</li>
            <li> I want to purchase five sets of these goods.&lt;BR&gt;Comodynes Self-Tanning Towelettes</li>
            <li> I am really fair skinned, and have tried just about every self-tan product out there. But much to my dismay most of them turn me an uneven orangy-brown color...and ALL of them left me with streaks! That is, until my friend introduced me to the Comodynes Tan Towels. I was skeptical at first, so I bought a three pak. I was suprised how easy to use they were, and I was able to do my whole body with just one towel! By dinner time I had a BEAUTIFUL golden brown tan! I couldn&#x27;t believe it! Streak free, and I did it myself!! I will never be without this product, it&#x27;s a beauty miracle for fair skinned girls everywhere.</li>
            <li> It does not matter how evenly you attempt to apply this product, you will end up with streaks. Thank goodness I decided to start with my legs...at least I can wear jeans until the stuff wears off.</li>
            <li> These towelettes are a quick tan remedy and are not as drying as other tan towels I have tried. I recommend Comodynes products and will continue to use the Self-Tanning Towelettes.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as good as the Intense Comodynes wipes. These gave me zero color. Boo.</li>
            <li> After reading several rave reviews about this product I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot.  Prior to using this I got the Mystic tans at the tanning salons.  They were fabulous but could get very pricey ($20 a session which lasted for a week).  I used those as a basis of comparison for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did follow the guidelines for getting one of these temporary tans.  I exfoliated in the shower and put on Cetaphil moisturizer over my entire body (the BEST lotion I&#x27;ve used to date).  About an hour later after I was fully dried I used these wipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple things I didn&#x27;t like right off the bat.  The wipes are kind of flimsy and tended to roll if fully opened.  There was also a weird smell from them, nothing that I couldn&#x27;t tolerate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wipes advertise that your tan will show up in 4 hours.  Mine really didn&#x27;t show up at all.  I know that sometimes you have to use a couple before you really see results, so I gave it a second chance.  Even went as far as using two in one day (one in the morning and again in the evening).  That gave me minor color ...nothing remotely resembling the spray on tans I had come to love from the salon. Oh and that minor tint disappeared in 2 days (not the four days they said I&#x27;d get out of it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well what else to expect from a product that is only $8?  The only at home tanning stuff I&#x27;ve had any luck with is the Neutrogena instant bronzer, which isn&#x27;t salon quality but at least gets me somewhat tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t believe me then try it for yourself ...maybe you&#x27;ll have better luck.  Everyone is different.</li>
            <li> Comodynes is the only tanning product I like to use. It&#x27;s easy to use &amp; doesn&#x27;t come off as bad as others in the shower. I use those little throw away rubber gloves to apply. That way no tanning product all over my hands.</li>
            <li> Comodynes really does work, It worked in 2-3 hours, and I had a great looking tan, and some advice wear like a plastic glove when you put it on, or else your hand will turn all brown, I think this product is very good, other then that there&#x27;s nothing bad about it, just it kinda smells. I recommend you get it.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use and gives a nice even tan, just remember to wash your hands thouroughly afterwards</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for years and I love them. If you are already dark-skinned you won&#x27;t notice much difference. The tan lasts 2-3 days. It&#x27;s perfect to add some color in the winter without looking streaky or fake tan.</li>
            <li> I think that this is by far the best self-tanner I have ever used.  Lotions are way too messy and hard to apply.  They leave you streaky and most of them turn you orange.  You have to be careful with lotions when applying over the knees and the elbows or else it will come out too dark and won&#x27;t look natural.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t have to worry about ANY of that with these tanning towelettes.  They are simple to use - just rub over your entire body or any place that you want tan.  You CAN use them on your face, just use common sense and don&#x27;t put it on your eyes.  &lt;br /&gt;I find that I need two towelettes to cover my whole body, but at usually around $1.50 a towel, that isn&#x27;t bad compared to tanning beds.  One tanning session these days will run you $10-$15 plus you have to drive to the tanning salon.  Plus the tanning lotions that you apply when using tanning beds that run you $20 and up per bottle.&lt;br /&gt;When I first bought the towelettes I used one a day for the first 5 days to get my tan DARK.  After that I would use two towelettes (to cover all of my body) every FOUR DAYS.  $3.00 every four days is pretty cheap I think.  That averages out to a little over $20 a month which is about the price of two tans if you are lucky.  I don&#x27;t know about you but I used to go tanning 3 times a week, you can imagine how much money and time you will save.&lt;br /&gt;This way it is safe for your body and inexpensive.  I would recommend using gloves or washing your hands extremely well after usage because it will turn your palms brown.  That would be my only complaint.&lt;br /&gt;I give it 5 stars and two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I would have given this 5 stars but it did not darken as much as I wanted. This does work really well the tan looks really natural and it has no streaks at all and they dont make you smell bad and it is so easy to apply and they go anywhere easily.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite at all.</li>
            <li> I have used one other brand of tanning towelettes as well as several other self tanning lotions. These do have the best color out of all those that I have tried. The color also goes on evenly. I am very pale and the steps up in color work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, they are very thing and roll when trying to use them. I have used L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Sublime Bronze and they are much thicker and easier to use. I also have to use two towelettes. One for my upper body and one for my legs. They are a little pricey for how thin they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked them and the color I had when I used them, but will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I would recommends these little towelettes to anyone just looking for a quick tan.  It seems to not only add a glow to your skin, but tightens as well.  Skin cancer runs in our family, so these is a safe way for me to tan.</li>
            <li> I am fair-skinned and look like a ghost, especially in the winter.  These towelettes provide &#x27;natural and uniform color&#x27;, just as they are labeled!  No streaking, no orange, no terrible smell, etc..  Love them!</li>
            <li> I love this towlette and it is easy to use. I go very slow and try to cover every part of the skin evenly and the tan is very natural looking.</li>
            <li> Awful.......the wipe bunches up, the color streaks and is very uneven, and it makes your skin orange! I wont buy this product again. Now im waiting for the streaks to go away. I will be going back to using Mary Kays sunless tanning lotion. Not sure why I decided to try these.</li>
            <li> There was no streaking with these towelettes.  Started to see a difference after 3 hrs. and I even used the towelett and reused it on my face and neck and arms.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin, and this product gave me a nice, natural looking tan and it is SO EASY to use! I would not recommend it for those with naturally dark tan skin, as the color may not show up well. It dries almost right away and there is no mess to it at all like lotions and foams. The color is even too, it does not appear darker on elbows and knees. My only complaints are it took longer than 3 hours for the color to show up on my skin and one towel isn&#x27;t enough to cover the whole body. Other than that, I definitely recommend it to anyone who doesn&#x27;t like to tan the old-fashioned way!</li>
            <li> I have just tried this product, and I have to say I am very satisfied. &lt;BR&gt;First, how to use the product: it says to take a shower and to moisturize, I&#x27;m a guy and don&#x27;t do the moisturizing thing so I didn&#x27;t and it doesn&#x27;t seem to affect anything. Like someone else mentioned I would use a plastic glove so you don&#x27;t get black hands. Another thing that helps is to start on a large body part (stomach, chest, legs, do NOT start on you face) and work you way out. I would keep coming back to the starting area and pick up some of the moister to spread it out more. Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t do this the fist time and started at my foot. This caused my foot to be very dark and the solution flowed down my foot making a funny looking cloud affect. &lt;BR&gt;How the product works: it worked well but you definitely need two towels for the whole body. Also I don&#x27;t know how long the tan will last I just used it yesterday, but other people say 3 to 5 days. This is a bummer, having to apply it more then once a week. But the only real problem is if you are looking for a really dark tan. You would have to apply about 6 to 8 towels. But I actually like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t change you black at one time, it&#x27;s subtle so no one knows you used some tanning product. One of the best parts about this tanning towels is the smell and the solution it self. The smell is ok but not strong at all; it&#x27;s gone in a few minuets. The even better part is there is absolutely no oily feel, I&#x27;m the type of person that can&#x27;t go to sleep feeling dirty or greasy, so I was planning on taking another shower after it dried but didn&#x27;t have to I felt fine. &lt;BR&gt;This is a really good product just watch how you apply it.</li>
            <li> Gone are the days of the tanning salon - as well as spending countless hours baking in the sun - for me. I&#x27;m 30 and it&#x27;s about time to wise up! I tried these the other night, and am very impressed. Although it def. takes more than one towel to do your whole body EVENLY - that doesn&#x27;t bother me. I&#x27;m pretty small/thin - and it took 3 towels, the first time - but I wanted to make sure I did every area as evenly as poss. Within hours, a nice color began to form, went to bed and woke up with a very nice base tan for Mem. Day weekend. Now, on my olive w/ yellow undertones skin - first application was med./dark and noticeably TANNER. I did notice some streaking, but it was very faint, and only because I was not as thorough as I&#x27;d thought. So I went over just my arms and legs again, last night and am VERY pleased, this morning.  The smell, compared to other self tanners, is minimal and tolerable and comes when the tan starts to develop, I did cover it up w/scented lotion when I went out - I&#x27;ve used other GOOD brands and have been literally sickened and overwhelemed by the smell. And couldn&#x27;t mask the stench to save my life! Won&#x27;t ever use them again! This is no fuss - clear towels  - can do it and get dressed 10 min. later and go to bed.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The key with these towels, while they do roll up on you and can be difficult - is PATIENCE. Take your time -cover each area as thoroughly as poss.  I read a good tip here, when doing backs of hands, hold towel with a cloth or tissue over it to avoid the palms. And if I have to use more than one towel - so be it! It saves me from frying in a tanning bed or spending long hours burning in the sun. Those things aren&#x27;t safe and will make me look like a leather sofa, before too long. And that&#x27;s no exaggeration. Air-brush tanning at a salon is a luxury and I will use it for special ocassions - just so expensive.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So maybe this (Comodynes) tan isn&#x27;t the exact tan you&#x27;d get at the beach - I usually tan diff.in the sun - nice deep, golden olive - this towel give me more of a reddish toned  tan - I don&#x27;t care - it looks real and doesn&#x27;t look orange on me, at all - I&#x27;m pleased and hooked for the summer!!</li>
            <li> When I first started using these I couldn&#x27;t believe how hard it was to use.  It was very frustrating how it rolled up almost immediately and it dried up very fast because it took so long to apply because I kept having to unroll it.  Then I got the idea of keeping it folded, and then unfold it a little at a time while applying it.  You have much more control over it, it doesn&#x27;t roll up at all, and it is faster to apply it so it won&#x27;t dry up so quickly.  You still have to use 2 or 3 to cover your whole body but it is definately easier this way!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best sunless tanning product I have found. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1. Does not come off on your clothes if you follow the directions. Dries fairly quickly. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2. Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or sticky like some others. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;3. Looks natural.  I have gotten lots of compliments. They think I have been to the tanning beds. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There are a few things that are a little bothersome. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1. You have to be careful putting it on. It can leave streaks. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2.  Takes more towlettes than they say. One towlette for each leg and two more if you are going to cover your whole body. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;3.  You have to have someone else put it on your back to make sure you don&#x27;t end up with streaks. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;4.  And you have to move quickly so the towelette doesn&#x27;t dry out. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But overall it does what you want a sunless tanning product to do.</li>
            <li> This product is a mess - streaking and bad color!  I would never buy this stuff again!  Yuck....But the shipping was excellent and the product arrived in good shape.</li>
            <li> A little dark and make spot ...</li>
