            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel cheap and doesn&#x27;t smell weird.</li>
            <li> Cute but very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Did not fit properly and some of the stones weren&#x27;t glued on the way they were suposed to be..  Would not reorder this.</li>
            <li> Arrived weeks sooner than expected!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, one of the little white petals fell off during transit, but that didn&#x27;t bother me because its golden base looked just fine without it.</li>
            <li> It is a clip-on earring and not very comfortable, but for the price you can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> pretty, but disappointing</li>
            <li> Not very pleased.</li>
            <li> To Harsh</li>
            <li> it was painful to wear for long, wish it wasnt a left ear piece, they should state what side it goes on.</li>
            <li> Nostalgic piece of jewelry that is only wearable on one side.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty but very unhappy that it kept falling off.</li>
            <li> but I must say I&#x27;m very disappointed it&#x27;s big for my ear</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look like fake material or anything.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Arrived weeks sooner than expected! This is an absolutely gorgeous earpiece (matches the picture). Friends and family ogled it incessantly and asked whether I&#x27;d gotten my ears pierced (they&#x27;ve never been pierced), so the clasps stay well out of the way. It is not bulky, does not hang or tug, and I frequently forgot I was even wearing it. Unfortunately, one of the little white petals fell off during transit, but that didn&#x27;t bother me because its golden base looked just fine without it. It doesn&#x27;t feel cheap and doesn&#x27;t smell weird. The low price-tag makes this purchase even sweeter. Five stars all around!</li>
            <li> it was painful to wear for long, wish it wasnt a left ear piece, they should state what side it goes on. pretty, but disappointing</li>

            <li> Looks like the picture, but it really hurts if you luleave it on for more than a minute.</li>
            <li> (Gold flower ear cuff) Exactly like the picture. Has a &amp;#34;clip on&amp;#34;  ear piece for your ear lobe and a piece that hugs the upper part of your ear. Worn it and thrown it around a bit and its still lookin good. Doesn&#x27;t slide off. So cute!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so cute and fun to wear you should buy it.</li>
            <li> Beautiful. I&#x27;ve received many compliments! Thanks</li>

            <li> Very cute earring! I got many compliments when I wore it! It does not hurt my ear either!</li>
            <li> I think the closing part of the ear where u have to press doesn&#x27;t stay in the ear and is about to break</li>
            <li> Beautiful no problems</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing, wearing my prom, everyone comments how beautiful. Excellent quality, quick delivery time. I highly recommend this product.</li>

            <li> I received this item and every one of the pearl leafs were off. Not very pleased.</li>
            <li> Cute Product, But Clutch Pinches Ear Quite A Bit  To Harsh</li>
            <li> Very pretty. Nostalgic piece of jewelry that is only wearable on one side.</li>

            <li> Very good service &amp; products!</li>
            <li> Loved this ear cuff. Fits perfectly on my ear. Looks exactly as pictured.Was very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It came as shown in the pic, but the clip on the</li>
            <li> This would not stay on the ear! It&#x27;s pretty but very unhappy that it kept falling off. It doesn&#x27;t have a post its a clip at the bottom. I think that&#x27;s why it kept falling and I lose it!😞</li>
            <li> I got this about a month later and it came broken and doesn&#x27;t fit properly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great looking ear accessory but I must say I&#x27;m very disappointed it&#x27;s big for my ear &amp; it does not hold when you clap it to your ear. Mine fell off the whole night. I wasn&#x27;t pleased.</li>
