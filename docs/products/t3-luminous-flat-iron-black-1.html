            <li>very impressed!!!</li>
            <li>I was very impressed.  </li>
            <li>but I have no doubt it will work wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>I have to say when I received it, I was quite impressed.</li>
            <li>Works great.  </li>
            <li>great</li>
            <li>of the negatives I&#x27;ve experienced with every straightening iron I&#x27;ve used, including this one, is that if your hair passes through cockeyed, it gets caught in the seams at the edge of the plates and pulls out.</li>
            <li>The look is great if that is of interest to you, it comes in a nice package and would be a great gift.</li>
            <li>The iron is lightweight, so that&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li>loved it..</li>
            <li>It comes in a nice box, lined with royal colored velvet, which would make a great gift.</li>
            <li>Works great, easy to handle, great temp control.  </li>
            <li>It is very light weight!</li>
            <li>They were okay -- did the job but never that great.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon and their awesome deals I got it for a steal.</li>
            <li>The plates are just one inch; it&#x27;s a micro iron and won&#x27;t be effective on some types of hair.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product - the price is reasonable and it works great.</li>
            <li>It works way better than the $20 something priced irons, in fact it works just as good as the salon over $100 irons.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I chose this one, per reviews.</li>
            <li>Works so much better than anything I have used.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never understand why the \\&quot;better\\&quot; straighteners cost so much more than the \\&quot;average\\&quot; ones.</li>
            <li>so I took the next best thing</li>
            <li>My hair looks shiny after using it and I&#x27;m always satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>In my opinion this would be one of the best flat irons you could buy at Walmart.</li>
            <li>This flat iron worked perfectly for me.</li>
            <li>It comes with a nice, long cord, but what I love about it the most is that it swivels with great smoothness.</li>
            <li>It was so quick and so effective.</li>
            <li>(Ok I wanted a free camcorder I clicked on it</li>
            <li>(Yeah, untouchable hot isn&#x27;t very healthy, but I put stuff in my hair to help with that</li>
            <li>It also heats up VERY quickly.  </li>
            <li>It tips over really easily--</li>
            <li>I love the outside sparkle and the turn nob and light on the inside are great features.</li>
            <li>It heats very quickly and even has a blinking light to tell you when it is up to heat.</li>
            <li>The iron itself is smooth and light weight.</li>
            <li>* Free heat resistant mat</li>
            <li>T3 did a great job with this flat iron.</li>
            <li>All in all, I am EXTREMELY happy with my T3 flat iron!!!!</li>
            <li>This straightens it quick and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Its  quick and leaves my hair smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>the top of my hair was doing its own thing--sticking out sideways and flat and in no shape.  </li>
            <li>This iron is really cool looking.</li>
            <li>Overall, it does the job and well, but design wise, it could stand some improvement.</li>
            <li>The temperature is adjustable, and iron is heated to full temperature in about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>straightener heats quickly, glides through my hair evenly and does not pull.  </li>
            <li>Love the high heat setting.</li>
            <li>Love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>After trying out the T3 model, I have to say that it definitely works a lot better and does a great job of not only smoothing out the flyaway hairs but also of shaping my ends in the direction they&#x27;re meant to go.  </li>
            <li>The light shows you when it&#x27;s hot</li>
            <li>this is by far my favorite straightening iron ever.</li>
            <li>It heats up pretty quickly so you don&#x27;t have to wait forever to get</li>
            <li>but I had to compare the two right off</li>
            <li>You really have to straighten your hair first, THEN use this to simply smooth it out.</li>
            <li>I just bought a professional flat iron that works amazing!</li>
            <li>smooth and gives the appearance of a new shine.  </li>
            <li>All the pluses first.</li>
            <li>I feel like I am lifting weights as I do my hair first with the blow dryer</li>
            <li>I only had it on a medium heat setting, so I would imagine it works that much better on curlier or thicker</li>
            <li>I had to set the heat setting much higher than with the cheaper ones to get the same pin-straight effect, which subjected my hair to a lot more damage than when using the cheaper ones.</li>
            <li>the hot iron would not touch any surface.  </li>
            <li>so I automatically use the highest heat setting...and even on that setting, it didn&#x27;t get my hair untouchable hot.</li>
            <li>that I couldn&#x27;t touch my hair immediately afterward because it was just too hot.)</li>
            <li>Also, most flat  irons come with a case</li>
            <li>Turns out that I absolutely LOVED the T3 curling irons and ended up keeping them at my house to use daily and took my regular irons to my mom&#x27;s house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After multiple repeated passes with this iron, it was warm, but far from being untouchable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the rubber feet on either side pretty much do nothing to keep it from sliding around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t get hot.</li>
            <li>Once my hair got longer, I started using a large barrel marcel curling iron to straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li>but it certainly did not.</li>
            <li>I expected it to do an exceptional job straightening my hair since it was more expensive than most of the irons I have used</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really looked into these since.  </li>
            <li>From a functionality standpoint, it works very well.  </li>
            <li>I try not to apply alot of heat to my hair, so I will use on very occasions, saves money going to a salon</li>
            <li>I have not tried it yet to make straight hair</li>
            <li>real hot!)and was a breeze to use just one stroke per section of my hair to straighten it.</li>
            <li>The end result was straight, silky looking</li>
            <li>The white plates (the part that gets hot) is a cool feature</li>
            <li>After using it, I thought it was a waste of money since my hair has a mind of its own and tends to bend into the shape it wants to, and not based on the cut that I have.  </li>
            <li>The price is right, works great, and hopefully will last a long time (as long as it does not get dropped)!</li>
            <li>I wear my hair naturally curly, I used this flatiron and it really straightened my hair looks like I have a perm!</li>
            <li>You can get a better product for much less money.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have particularly frizzy hair, but it seemed to be the thing for smoothing.  </li>
            <li>I am fortunate to have medium thick smooth textured hair.</li>
            <li>one is tourmaline, which is actually healthier for your hair than a ceramic straightener, and it is much more affordable because it is smaller.</li>
            <li>Since it is small, you have to straighten smaller pieces at a time, but I find that this allows for more precise styling.</li>
            <li>so if you don&#x27;t have stubborn hair, you don&#x27;t have to fry it at a high heat.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>To begin, I don&#x27;t understand why most flat irons are marketed as \\&quot;straighteners\\&quot; because they do NO such thing.</li>
            <li>It has layers in it, so I really needed to go back to a flat iron to be able to straighten it properly because of the length.  </li>
            <li>Lastly, although it comes with a heat mat, I think it would be better with a cradle, but that is likely as extra accessory.  </li>
            <li>I think the only positive I can add is that it is lightwieght.  </li>
            <li>This is my first flat iron</li>
            <li>First off, I don&#x27;t use flat irons.  </li>
            <li>then again, pretty much all flat irons are simple to use).  </li>
            <li>Though the temperature gage is in kind of an awkward place, a little hard to read, it&#x27;s a wonderful feature.</li>
            <li>It is definitely professional quality.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair super straight even when I&#x27;m being lazy with it.</li>
            <li>Using this flat iron, my hair is finally straight again; like it used to be in California.</li>
            <li>I found them on sale for cheaper than my usual brand, so I figured they would be okay to use occasionally.  </li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with flat irons, but the one I used most in the past both straightened AND flattened</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally straight but it does not like dry or humid air.</li>
            <li>Even though I have straight hair, I occasionally straighten my hair for special events or if I need to do a few touch ups when I let my hair air dry.</li>
            <li>I have used many other straighteners in the past and by far this exceeds all of them.  </li>
            <li>I do run the iron somewhat slowly down my hair so that it does straighten on the first pass.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super small compared to what I&#x27;m used to</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t had any hair get caught or snag in the flat iron.  </li>
            <li>Where I live there is a lot of dry or humid air.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair which is normally dry and wavy (time to look for a new wife?)</li>
            <li>This iron definitely gets hot too - but with the super thick rubber pads where your hands clamp down the irons, you would never know.</li>
            <li>I much prefer my other irons to this one!</li>

            <li> but I really do not know if there is something else on the market that could process bigger sections.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using straighteners since middle school, but I had never owned a ceramic straightener due to their prohibitive cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works great.  I have heavy, unruly hair.  This straightens it quick and smooth.  Love the high heat setting.</li>
            <li> All the pluses first. This iron is really cool looking. I love the outside sparkle and the turn nob and light on the inside are great features. The white plates (the part that gets hot) is a cool feature but I worry over time it will look really dirty. It heats very quickly and even has a blinking light to tell you when it is up to heat. It has a dial to turn up and down the heat. It is very light weight! I hate how heavy irons can get. I feel like I am lifting weights as I do my hair first with the blow dryer then the iron I am exhausted after I do all my daughters hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ahhh the negative:{ So It works well as long as you use small sections of hair and go slow. I just bought a professional flat iron that works amazing! If you want the name leave a comment below. I feel bad but I had to compare the two right off and this one just did not stand up to the test. In my opinion this would be one of the best flat irons you could buy at Walmart. But I don&#x27;t think a salon owner or a beautician would use it.</li>
            <li> I purchased a flat iron a long time ago, but it was a cheaper, no named model and I don&#x27;t have particularly frizzy hair, but it seemed to be the thing for smoothing.  After using it, I thought it was a waste of money since my hair has a mind of its own and tends to bend into the shape it wants to, and not based on the cut that I have.  I haven&#x27;t really looked into these since.  After trying out the T3 model, I have to say that it definitely works a lot better and does a great job of not only smoothing out the flyaway hairs but also of shaping my ends in the direction they&#x27;re meant to go.  From a functionality standpoint, it works very well.  I only had it on a medium heat setting, so I would imagine it works that much better on curlier or thicker hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for design, I guess they&#x27;ve gone with what&#x27;s been working in the past, so I was a little disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t have any innovative features.  The heat setting and power button are on the inside of the flat iron so there is a chance of burning one&#x27;s self if you&#x27;re adjusting it while on or even just to turn it off.  There&#x27;s a dial on the side you can use, but it&#x27;s not easy to tell what heat setting you have it on since it&#x27;s not clearly marked.  There&#x27;s also no automatic shutoff feature that I can detect since the iron has a definitive on off button.  Lastly, although it comes with a heat mat, I think it would be better with a cradle, but that is likely as extra accessory.  Overall, it does the job and well, but design wise, it could stand some improvement.</li>
            <li> Works great, easy to handle, great temp control.  This is my first flat iron and I&#x27;m glad I chose this one, per reviews.</li>
            <li> I had a similar one like this previously.  I have the CHI also.  The T3 has a tighter grip on my hair then the CHI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good for the $$</li>
            <li> T3 did a great job with this flat iron. It is definitely professional quality.  Leaves my hair super straight even when I&#x27;m being lazy with it. Thanks to Amazon and their awesome deals I got it for a steal.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used a flat iron in a few years.  Once my hair got longer, I started using a large barrel marcel curling iron to straighten my hair.  I did this because the flat irons I had would snag some hair and I was having problems with breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few years ago I had purchased two T3 marcel curling irons to keep at my mom&#x27;s house so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to pack mine every time I went to visit. I found them on sale for cheaper than my usual brand, so I figured they would be okay to use occasionally.  Turns out that I absolutely LOVED the T3 curling irons and ended up keeping them at my house to use daily and took my regular irons to my mom&#x27;s house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently got my hair cut to a little below my shoulders.  It has layers in it, so I really needed to go back to a flat iron to be able to straighten it properly because of the length.  I was very anxious to try the T3 flat iron.  It did not disappoint me!!!  It is simple to use (then again, pretty much all flat irons are simple to use).  It also heats up VERY quickly.  So far I haven&#x27;t had any hair get caught or snag in the flat iron.  I do run the iron somewhat slowly down my hair so that it does straighten on the first pass.  All in all, I am EXTREMELY happy with my T3 flat iron!!!!</li>
            <li> First off, I don&#x27;t use flat irons.  I&#x27;m a guy.  So I gave this to my daughter who is a hairdresser, to evaluate.  Here&#x27;s what she said:  Some people will not like this flat iron, especially if they have thick coarse hair.  The plates are just one inch; it&#x27;s a micro iron and won&#x27;t be effective on some types of hair.  You have to take very small sections and go very slowly.  The iron is lightweight, so that&#x27;s good.  Also, most flat  irons come with a case but this one didn&#x27;t.  This flat iron was made in China.  There are other, less expensive flat irons to consider that will work just as well or better than this one.  I received this product courtesy of Amazon Vine.</li>
            <li> very impressed!!! I wear my hair naturally curly, I used this flatiron and it really straightened my hair looks like I have a perm! loved it..I try not to apply alot of heat to my hair, so I will use on very occasions, saves money going to a salon</li>
            <li> Does not straighten well at all</li>
            <li> Up until this flat iron, I&#x27;ve bought 20 dollar flat irons. They were okay -- did the job but never that great. I never wanted to spend a lot of money for a flat iron but wondered what I was missing. Well, basically, a lot. Where I live there is a lot of dry or humid air. My hair is naturally straight but it does not like dry or humid air. My hair does all kinds of weird things in this weather. Using this flat iron, my hair is finally straight again; like it used to be in California. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. This iron definitely gets hot too - but with the super thick rubber pads where your hands clamp down the irons, you would never know. This is a great product - the price is reasonable and it works great.</li>
            <li> took a long time to receive my order, works well.  I can turn up the temperature dial to 450. great</li>
            <li> Provides high heat, less passes thru hair needed, seals in cuticle, and works against humidity!</li>
            <li> I would recommend it.  Works so much better than anything I have used. Its  quick and leaves my hair smooth and shiny.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I want to give this product sold by AMAZON 0 stars, but, as I do not have that option, I am giving 1 star. It is a big scam by AMAZON, they are not authorized seller of this product according to T3, which means you will not get T3 limited warranty, even if your product is defective. It is a big mistake of me, for not verifying if it is working immediately after I received it, as I was out of town traveling, it took me a while to realize that this is the case, lesson learnt, I will not be lured to buy products sold by AMAZON, though they provide Prime service.</li>
            <li> This iron is rather pricey.  I expected it to do an exceptional job straightening my hair since it was more expensive than most of the irons I have used but it certainly did not. Additionally, I had some concerns about having to reach into the inside of the wand to manipulate the temperature wheel and power switch; that is simply a burn waiting to happen. I much prefer my other irons to this one! I think the only positive I can add is that it is lightwieght.  I definitely recommend that you look elsewhere.  You can get a better product for much less money.</li>
            <li> I scored the sickest deal on this T3. It was one of the Gold Box deals I believe. This heats up in seconds, works beautifully, no frizz, no damage (so far). Love it and highly recommend it. Built to last.</li>
            <li> I tried this product the other morning.  I was in a rush and the top of my hair was doing its own thing--sticking out sideways and flat and in no shape.  I heated this up in about a minute, sectioned off my hair.  Clamped my WET hair on it and twirled it around, and POOF! I had instant curl and body.  I was very impressed.  It was so quick and so effective. I have not tried it yet to make straight hair but I have no doubt it will work wonderfully.  It has a dial to crank up the heat if you like.  The light shows you when it&#x27;s hot (it took maybe a minute).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW-The product is 9 1/2 inches long.  Add another 2 inches for the connection before the wire bends, so if you want to buy a case to carry/house the product, get one about 12 inches long.  It does not come with a case.</li>
            <li> I am fortunate to have medium thick smooth textured hair. This flat iron worked perfectly for me. It heated up quickly(got real hot!)and was a breeze to use just one stroke per section of my hair to straighten it. It works way better than the $20 something priced irons, in fact it works just as good as the salon over $100 irons. The price is right, works great, and hopefully will last a long time (as long as it does not get dropped)! I recommend this if you&#x27;re looking for a mid priced flat iron!</li>
            <li> Even though I have straight hair, I occasionally straighten my hair for special events or if I need to do a few touch ups when I let my hair air dry. I&#x27;ve been using straighteners since middle school, but I had never owned a ceramic straightener due to their prohibitive cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is tourmaline, which is actually healthier for your hair than a ceramic straightener, and it is much more affordable because it is smaller. Since it is small, you have to straighten smaller pieces at a time, but I find that this allows for more precise styling. It has a temperature dial so if you don&#x27;t have stubborn hair, you don&#x27;t have to fry it at a high heat. It heats up pretty quickly so you don&#x27;t have to wait forever to get started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the negatives I&#x27;ve experienced with every straightening iron I&#x27;ve used, including this one, is that if your hair passes through cockeyed, it gets caught in the seams at the edge of the plates and pulls out. This might just be user error on my part though.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone with thin and even thick hair. I have thick hair and this does the trick. I like the heat settings and the speed in which I can straighten a section of hair, I dislike that it only does small sections but I really do not know if there is something else on the market that could process bigger sections. The look is great if that is of interest to you, it comes in a nice package and would be a great gift. I do not feel like it dried out my hair while I used it which is another plus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never understand why the \\&quot;better\\&quot; straighteners cost so much more than the \\&quot;average\\&quot; ones. This expensive hair straightener did what was expected and nothing more. I actually found that I prefer using ones in the thirty to fifty range. I had to set the heat setting much higher than with the cheaper ones to get the same pin-straight effect, which subjected my hair to a lot more damage than when using the cheaper ones. My hair was straight in the end, but I fail to see the benefit of using something so expensive.</li>
            <li> (Ok I wanted a free camcorder I clicked on it and I must have just missed it, so I took the next best thing a bald guy can do - get a hair straightener and hand it off to his wife.  The words below are hers.  There would have been videos but didn&#x27;t get the camera!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The straightener heats quickly, glides through my hair evenly and does not pull.  It keeps my hair which is normally dry and wavy (time to look for a new wife?) smooth and gives the appearance of a new shine.  I have used many other straighteners in the past and by far this exceeds all of them.  I couldn&#x27;t give it five stars because I the manufacturers could have put a holder with so the hot iron would not touch any surface.  A fifth star could also be added if my husband didn&#x27;t force me to write this.</li>
            <li> my second straightening iron by T3. Would highly recommend to anyone. The straightening iron cuts my styling time in half. My hair looks shiny after using it and I&#x27;m always satisfied with the results. The temperature is adjustable, and iron is heated to full temperature in about 30 seconds. this is by far my favorite straightening iron ever.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when ordering the T3 Micro Luminous 1 inch Flat Iron, not sure it if was going to live up to its cost. I have to say when I received it, I was quite impressed. It comes in a nice box, lined with royal colored velvet, which would make a great gift. The iron itself is smooth and light weight. Though the temperature gage is in kind of an awkward place, a little hard to read, it&#x27;s a wonderful feature. The different temperature settings allow you to select the degree of heat you want to subject your hair too. The on and off switch is convenient. It comes with a nice, long cord, but what I love about it the most is that it swivels with great smoothness. Your hair will glide through the heating plates with ease. My hair, very thin, straightened effortlessly. The end result was straight, silky looking hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Features&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Max 450 degrees fahrenheit&lt;br /&gt;* 1 inch tourmaline plates&lt;br /&gt;* 9 feet Swivel cord&lt;br /&gt;* Free heat resistant mat</li>
            <li> To begin, I don&#x27;t understand why most flat irons are marketed as \\&quot;straighteners\\&quot; because they do NO such thing. If your hair is wavy, it simply flattens the curl that is there--it doesn&#x27;t remove it. You really have to straighten your hair first, THEN use this to simply smooth it out. So go into my review knowing that I already don&#x27;t think any of this type of product literally straightens hair. I also don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with flat irons, but the one I used most in the past both straightened AND flattened (the larger version of the [[ASIN:B001O6Y9CY Maxius Miniglide On The Go Flat Iron]] that has teeth to pull the curl out), so I&#x27;m a bit spoiled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This flat iron is meh at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s super small compared to what I&#x27;m used to--almost what I imagine what a travel iron would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It tips over really easily--the rubber feet on either side pretty much do nothing to keep it from sliding around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. It really doesn&#x27;t get hot. I have thick coarse hair so I automatically use the highest heat setting...and even on that setting, it didn&#x27;t get my hair untouchable hot. (Yeah, untouchable hot isn&#x27;t very healthy, but I put stuff in my hair to help with that AND I&#x27;ve had other irons (professional and not) that I couldn&#x27;t touch my hair immediately afterward because it was just too hot.) After multiple repeated passes with this iron, it was warm, but far from being untouchable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. It doesn&#x27;t straighten. After blow-drying, I noticed a small section of my hair that was still wavy, so even though I knew what WOULDN&#x27;T happen, just for giggles I ran the iron over that section about 10 times and big surprise--it was still wavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall it didn&#x27;t seem to do much of anything to my hair and seemed really small and tippy. I would be disappointed if I paid full price for this item.</li>
