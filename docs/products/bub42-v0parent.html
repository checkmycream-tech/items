            <li>Nice tan shade.</li>
            <li>Easy on, smear-free, nice neutral color!</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Love the color.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite lip balm .</li>
            <li>Also the darker the color, the more it shows up on the lips.  </li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees products are a favorite.</li>
            <li>The texture is very nice and the color blends in very well with my lips.</li>
            <li>Does rub off on cups easily</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and my lips aren&#x27;t dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The balm goes goes on smooth and creamy not sticky at all.</li>
            <li>I am a fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees original lip balm and was excited when they came out with the tinted lip balm.</li>
            <li>I have had problems keeping my lips soft for many, many years..</li>
            <li>Creamy, great for dry or peeling chapped lips!</li>
            <li>New favorite gloss.</li>
            <li>But they are a nice alternative to the regular lip balms.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I tried this brand and will never use another.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to fragrances and prefer fragrance free everything.</li>
            <li>The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because of the taste, while it&#x27;s not horrible, I would prefer if it had more of a minty taste like their regular lip balm, or even caramel or honey, something to go along with the color.</li>
            <li>Caramel Daisy definitely has more of a presence than some of the lighter balm colors.  </li>
            <li>color is a bit sheer, like the lip shimmer better.</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty neutral.</li>
            <li>It lends a subtle shine, just enough to make you look polished, perfect for the workday.</li>
            <li>They both give a sheer color that is great for when I use little makeup.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much color to the Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balms.  </li>
            <li>Not waxy, very moisturizing, with just a hint of color that goes with everything.</li>
            <li>Good product, but the color is very dull and neutral.</li>
            <li>May be a little more vibrant color will do.</li>
            <li>It makes my lips very soft and lasts a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li>Love the product, but how did the price go up 40 percent in the past couple of days?</li>
            <li>It is just the right color and keeps your lips from going dry</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s natural, inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>It works well to keep my lips soft and adds just a hint of color.</li>
            <li>Its a very mild color just like you wear any ordinary burts bee lip balm .</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not dark.</li>
            <li>so frequent application is necessary if you want to maintain the color level.  </li>
            <li>This is the first one that actually seems to improve my lips while adding a little tint.</li>
            <li>I have a few other colors with Pink Blossom being my favorite.</li>

            <li> but there is hardly any color at all to it, it is more like using plain lip balm.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and lips, so I constantly need some sort of lip balm.</li>
            <li> Any other tinted lip balm I have tried has made my lips feel no better if not more dry, and has just accentuated any dry skin even more.</li>

            <li> The slight glimmer it gives me is enough.</li>

            <li> Not very sweet</li>
            <li> Just a slight shade of color.</li>
            <li> so this is slightly noticeable and adds a feminine hue, but I don&#x27;t like to look like I&#x27;m wearing lipstick.</li>
            <li> I have pale skin</li>
            <li> Hardly any color to it.</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with the product.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with my purchase.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I have had problems keeping my lips soft for many, many years.. This is the first time I tried this brand and will never use another. My lips has never been softer nor this chap-free. I definitely recommend using Burt&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It does suit my skin color (not very fair , not very dark) . Its a very mild color just like you wear any ordinary burts bee lip balm . You don&#x27;t require tinted lip balm like this for performing a basic function of moisturizing your lips. Disappointed with my purchase.</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with the product. It just isn&#x27;t as &amp;#34;tinted&amp;#34; as I was hoping. Hardly any color to it.</li>
            <li> Great color.  I love it and it&#x27;s natural, inexpensive.  I buy to put in bathroom and purses so I don&#x27;t have to go looking for it. Nice tan shade.</li>
            <li> It is just the right color and keeps your lips from going dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely buy this again. Love the color.</li>
            <li> Great lip balm in a really great color. The Carmel Daisy and Honeysuckle are perfect colors for me. They both give a sheer color that is great for when I use little makeup. It makes my lips very soft and lasts a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! My lip balm came in the condition promised and is a very nice addition to my make up.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lip balm . It works well to keep my lips soft and adds just a hint of color.</li>
            <li> Easy on, smear-free, nice neutral color! Can be worn alone or with lipstick. Creamy, great for dry or peeling chapped lips!</li>
            <li> I am a fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees original lip balm and was excited when they came out with the tinted lip balm. I have a few other colors with Pink Blossom being my favorite. I do not care for lipstick and prefer the level of color that the tinted lip balm provides. It goes on smoothly and my lips aren&#x27;t dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not end up liking the Caramel Daisy color for myself, so I gave it to my daughter who likes it!</li>
            <li> Good product, but the color is very dull and neutral. Looks like a tan on the lips. May be a little more vibrant color will do.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to fragrances and prefer fragrance free everything. I can tolerate it, but wished it didn&#x27;t smell like rancid oil. Caramel Daisy&#x27;s color is like plum without any purple. Browner than I thought, but because it&#x27;s so translucent it&#x27;s not dark.</li>
            <li> New favorite gloss. Just a slight shade of color.</li>
            <li> It feels good on the lips but there is hardly any color at all to it, it is more like using plain lip balm.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and lips, so I constantly need some sort of lip balm. Any other tinted lip balm I have tried has made my lips feel no better if not more dry, and has just accentuated any dry skin even more. This is the first one that actually seems to improve my lips while adding a little tint. I have pale skin so this is slightly noticeable and adds a feminine hue, but I don&#x27;t like to look like I&#x27;m wearing lipstick. The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because of the taste, while it&#x27;s not horrible, I would prefer if it had more of a minty taste like their regular lip balm, or even caramel or honey, something to go along with the color.</li>
            <li> This color is the perfect neutral for my honey tan skin. The balm goes goes on smooth and creamy not sticky at all.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much color to the Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balms.  They provide just a hint of color.  But they are a nice alternative to the regular lip balms.  Also the darker the color, the more it shows up on the lips.  Caramel Daisy definitely has more of a presence than some of the lighter balm colors.  Moisturizes lips well.  Does rub off on cups easily so frequent application is necessary if you want to maintain the color level.  Works great as a base to the shines and glosses as well, especially with the caramel shimmer and the autumn haze gloss, both by Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> color is a bit sheer, like the lip shimmer better.</li>
            <li> Its perfect. Not waxy, very moisturizing, with just a hint of color that goes with everything. I never leave home without it</li>
            <li> Caramel Daisy ended up being almost exactly my natural lip color, so there&#x27;s not much difference in shade when I apply it, but you can&#x27;t beat this balm for texture. It lends a subtle shine, just enough to make you look polished, perfect for the workday.</li>
            <li> Love the product, but how did the price go up 40 percent in the past couple of days?</li>
            <li> I can only find Burt Bees products at a Walgreens a town away.Every time I pass through I like to stop and check them out and I have had my eye on this product for awhile.I finally broke down and bought it last week.I am so glad I did! The texture is very nice and the color blends in very well with my lips. The slight glimmer it gives me is enough.The smell is pretty neutral.Not very sweet but I prefer that.My lips feels great and not over moisturized or under moisturized.The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because of the price. $7 bucks is a bit steep. I payed it though.</li>
            <li> I love the colors! Burt&#x27;s Bees products are a favorite. I will definitely be ordering again soon.</li>
