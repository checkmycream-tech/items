            <li> the curl did not last long.</li>
            <li> Just stay with the Chi flat iron if you have that already...</li>
            <li> Therefore keeping it from going flat or frizzing.  </li>
            <li> The correct flat irons .</li>
            <li> And apparently, this straightener is supposed to also curl your hair - which I also saw with the royale straightener I used at the mall, but this straightener DID NOT curl my hair like the other one!</li>
            <li> B002SJ5X4E U9 1 Inch LCD Digital Wet to Dry 450F Ionic Tourmaline Ceramic Dual Voltage</li>
            <li> I had to question what other differences there were besides the iron looking totally different from the picture...</li>
            <li> Since I let my hair air dry over night, I wake up with kinks in my hair.</li>
            <li> , the color was way different then my real one, and to top it all off when I turned it on the straightener put off a terrible smell!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about it pulling oil to the outside of the hair.  </li>
            <li> Will create some curl, but I&#x27;m not satisfied with them because of the flat plate</li>
            <li> Very disappointed I thought this was a good brand.</li>
            <li> I spent less than half of what that &amp;#34;special deal&amp;#34; was in the mall</li>
            <li> I have thick and somewhat coarse hair</li>
            <li> instead of $250, I&#x27;ll mark it down to... $125..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about half; it works but not as well as they say.</li>
            <li> it was just not worth the money!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s past my shoulders with a slight wave.</li>
            <li> Was not the same, so sad.</li>
            <li> When the product arrives, it appears to be wrong because the box is different, it does not say tourmaline on it, and it gives the temperature in degrees</li>
            <li> the iron I received was a very pale green with a flat base and</li>
            <li> Ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> I say DON&#x27;T waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> Packaging was a little dirty...</li>
            <li> So if you wanted a temperature of 200degress, then it&#x27;s a guessing game!</li>
            <li> I may be doing it wrong.</li>
            <li> Wrong color</li>
            <li> I should of listen to the bad reviews.</li>
            <li> Then when it arrived I was very disappointed the box ripped as soon as I opened it</li>
            <li> It was awful, it didn&#x27;t heat up, it fryed my hair.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> By far the best straightener ever, I can&#x27;t stop running my hands through my hair when I&#x27;m done:)</li>
            <li> I was buying a brazilian keratin treatment product, and the website recommended that I needed a TOURMALINE hair iron with a 450degree heating plate. Saw this product and bought it, cos it said TOURMALINE HAIR IRON. When the product arrived, it said 100% ceramic plates on the packaging!! what the?! I felt duped because one of my reasons for buying this iron is the tourmaline plates. But I live in the Philippines and returning it would be a hassle, so what the heck, i tried it.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* straightened my hair after 1-2 passes. I just sold this to my friend (who has coarse hair), and it took only 15-20 passes to do her whole head (she was in a hurry). So she was impressed.&lt;br /&gt;* easy to use as curling iron&lt;br /&gt;* super cute color (yellow green)&lt;br /&gt;* straightened hair felt soft, not fried&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* the temperature control was only labeled in the minimum temp of 80degrees and max. temp of 232degrees. So if you wanted a temperature of 200degress, then it&#x27;s a guessing game! that&#x27;s why hair irons like [[ASIN:B000K7E2G6 Remington S2044 Damage Therapy Ceramic Hair Straightener with Teflon Fiber Plates]] are great because they have digital displays and you can set your iron to the exact temperature u need it to be.&lt;br /&gt;* the curl did not last long. stayed on for 2 hours max (i did not apply setting lotion or hairspray)&lt;br /&gt;* I compared this iron with [[ASIN:B002SJ5X4E U9 1 Inch LCD Digital Wet to Dry 450F Ionic Tourmaline Ceramic Dual Voltage Hair Straightener White Flat Iron]], and while ironing with the U9 iron, its floating plates allowed for smooth, pinch free ironing. This Royale iron pinched the hair, it was painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if I had a choice between Royale and U9, I choose U9.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a good product--just please change the product name from tourmaline to ceramic. it is misleading.</li>
            <li> I was using the Chi for several years until recently when I went to the mall and got drawn in to the Royale kiosk. I let the lady straighten my bangs and a section of my hair and she also curled a section. I was smart enough to go on Amazon later that evening and purchased one for less! I have thick and somewhat coarse hair and it&#x27;s past my shoulders with a slight wave. Since I let my hair air dry over night, I wake up with kinks in my hair. It took me less than 5 minutes to straighten my hair with this iron which is a huge time saver!</li>
            <li> Was the same iron we got at the Mall.  Packaging was a little dirty...but Irons works great...p.s. If you haven&#x27;t tried this brand strongly recommend it...I worked in the salon industry and had bought a &amp;#34;professional iron&amp;#34; and by far the Royale works better</li>
            <li> I should of listen to the bad reviews. It was awful, it didn&#x27;t heat up, it fryed my hair. I sent it back. So sad because I Reyes my friends royal from the mall and loved it. Was not the same, so sad.</li>
            <li> I have had to amend my review based on a clarification of the description.  When the product arrives, it appears to be wrong because the box is different, it does not say tourmaline on it, and it gives the temperature in degrees Celsius.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I did not open the box because I intended to send it back.  But I was contacted by Amazon for clarification of my return, and as I started to talk about the discrepancy, I realized that it was giving the temperature online in Fahrenheit.  So I opened the box, and the product in fact matched the picture.  The ceramic plates were coated with tourmaline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update the review once I determine how well it works :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Works well at straightening my hair.  Will create some curl, but I&#x27;m not satisfied with them because of the flat plate, I can&#x27;t get the curls to curve well at the end.  I may be doing it wrong.</li>
            <li> Just as it was described by the seller...works great!!</li>
            <li> The reviews that I read before purchasing seemed very mixed. Either- &amp;#34;perfect! Works great&amp;#34; sort of reviews or &amp;#34;what I received was NOT what I ordered&amp;#34; reviews. I took my chances anyway!&lt;br /&gt;We received an ENTIRELY different straightener than what we ordered from this company, plastic and cheap. Not even the same color. It was purple. (Which honestly, I would have been fine with, had it been the quality I was looking for!) I would NOT Recommend purchasing this.</li>
            <li> The.  Item that was delivered is not the same as the descriptive picture .  I had to question what other differences there were besides the iron looking totally different from the picture...the iron I received was a very pale green with a flat base and the one in description is dark real with a very high gloss....if I did not mind the bother or the wait I may have returned it however, it seems to head up fast and so far is working very good and for me that is most important .seems to her to very high temps ...</li>
            <li> I saw this straightener at a mall kiosk, but I wasn&#x27;t planning on paying $300 for it so I got this one instead. But after I had ordered it, it was NOT as effective as the one I used at the kiosk.&lt;br /&gt;In the title of this product the seller wrote that the straightener was 450 degrees F, however, I received one that was only 230 degrees F. The box appeared to be open before and used, when the seller had said it was new. The box and straightener have a weird/foul plastic odor, so that when I tested it on my hair, my hair smelled gross. (It seemed like the straightener had been old, so it was in the box for a fairly long time.) And apparently, this straightener is supposed to also curl your hair - which I also saw with the royale straightener I used at the mall, but this straightener DID NOT curl my hair like the other one! It doesn&#x27;t even work!!!!  I even looked up Royale official demonstrations on YouTube and it still did not work... I am very unsatisfied and will be contacting the seller soon for a refund because this is a joke. Just stay with the Chi flat iron if you have that already...</li>
            <li> I personally love the straightener, all of the information on the degrees are accurate and it leaves my hair soft and straight. I also picked the slowest shipping and it came two days later so I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Pretty cool flat iron lives up to most of it&#x27;s claims.  I&#x27;m not sure about it pulling oil to the outside of the hair.  The claim is that brings natural oil to the outside of the hair preserving curls, straightness, or what ever style you have created. Therefore keeping it from going flat or frizzing.  It&#x27;s about half; it works but not as well as they say.</li>
            <li> The 230 degrees you see on the straightener is 230 degrees Celsius, which converts closely to 450 degrees Farenheit.</li>
            <li> Broke the 3rd time I used it. Very disappointed I thought this was a good brand. The hot plates lifted and not catches and rips my hair. Think they would replace it. Nope guess again.</li>
            <li> Love this straighter!  It gets hot really fast and does a great job!  I bought my first one at a mall in Virginia for lots of money.  This was really reasonable!  Also, had a problem with switch and they sent me a new one--no questions asked.  Very easy to work with. Yes, will buy another and recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought an iron for me, two weeks ago and i after seen how works i love it, and i bought this one for my friend and she love it too.</li>
            <li> It seemed like it would be a really good hair straightener but it dosent even straighten my hair as good as a sallys hair straightener does. I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is exactly like the kiosks in the mall who try to tell you &amp;#34;Oh I&#x27;ll give you a special deal.. instead of $250, I&#x27;ll mark it down to... $125..$105....ok just for you I&#x27;ll give you my employee discount.. for you only it&#x27;s $90&amp;#34;  Ridiculous.  I have very curly, very frizzy hair and it used to take me two hours to straighten my hair.  I went to the mall and let them use this product on me. It worked so well that I considered purchasing it with their &amp;#34;special deal&amp;#34;. My boyfriend is an Amazon Prime freak and said, &amp;#34;wait..let&#x27;s just see..&amp;#34; and sure enough it&#x27;s here on Amazon!!!  I spent less than half of what that &amp;#34;special deal&amp;#34; was in the mall, it came a few days after ordering, and it&#x27;s the exact same product as the kiosks in the mall. I&#x27;m so happy :) Instead of 2 hr, it only takes me about 30 min..which is a great considering MY hair!</li>
            <li> I had bought a Royale straightener at the mall and wanted another one to keep at my boyfriends... I always have good luck on amazon so when I ordered this for more than half what i paid i was sooo excited! Then when it arrived I was very disappointed the box ripped as soon as I opened it, the color was way different then my real one, and to top it all off when I turned it on the straightener put off a terrible smell! I sent it back bc it was just not worth the money! I say DON&#x27;T waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> The correct flat irons . Wrong color</li>
