            <li>,  I give it 3-4 stars because I have found that I prefer a wax with the greatest holding</li>

            <li>Great citris scent and good hold.</li>
            <li>Works great holds well good product for your mustache.</li>
            <li>If this were 25% or so more tacky it would be perfect.</li>
            <li>It works great and it smells good like lemon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love the smell, like the styling ability, not so impressed by the hold duration.  </li>
            <li>Awesome hold, good smell, holds all day mostly</li>
            <li>and my wife finds it pleasant</li>
            <li>Has a pleasant lemon scent.</li>
            <li>It has a fairly pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>Pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, pleasant aroma, and the tin size makes it perfect for keeping in my pocket.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product comes in an easily portable tin, perfect for on the go application.  </li>
            <li>Best wax for a strong hold.</li>
            <li>It has a great scent, comes in a convenient carrying tin that fits in your pocket, a fairly nice consistency</li>
            <li>Good quality wax, I ordered it in the winter time...</li>
            <li>It took a good bit to soften it between your fingers and tended to clump up in my mustache.</li>
            <li>All in all a good buy. .</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>good quality but did not work well on my mustache and beard.  </li>
            <li>Good buy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also good for your mustache.</li>
            <li>Good Stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The wax was good but the quantity was not acceptable.</li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>It smells good and should work</li>
            <li>I never review products, but this one is too good not to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is good, and after you comb it in, it holds without being seen, no waxy film either.</li>
            <li>good product.  </li>
            <li>Good item does what it was bought for.</li>
            <li>It smells good and works like it should.</li>
            <li>but it helt it in place good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smells good too.  </li>
            <li>Smells good though.</li>
            <li>Got this for my grandpa for Christmas, it smells so good</li>
            <li>To start, it smells good.</li>
            <li>But the good news stops there...</li>
            <li>it holds for most of the day -- good stuff!</li>
            <li>It spreads easily by hand without the need of a comb, but the hold isn&#x27;t very good.  </li>
            <li>Now this is how mustache wax is made,works great and has a pleasant lemon smell,very easy to use and carry around.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it would be great for doing a handlebar based on how well it holds for me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very refreshing when you catch the scent throughout the day.</li>
            <li>This wax is very stylish.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>wife is happy, so I&#x27;m kissin again :)</li>
            <li>Fisticuffs is an excellent wax, it comes with a great presentation (they gave me a free sticker), and a convenient flat tin that fits perfectly in my pants pockets.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite waxes!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much perfect for that.</li>
            <li>But wait, there&#x27;s more!</li>
            <li>strong hold great fragrance...</li>
            <li>Best beard oils and bombs around hands down and the prices are awesome!</li>
            <li>Also, this wax has a great, but not overpowering, ginger scent that I, and more importantly my wife, find to be quite pleasant.</li>
            <li>Smells AMAZING, does what it&#x27;s supposed to but not for long.&lt;br</li>
            <li>perfect and fast shipping</li>
            <li>Like the smell of this too, has kind of a citrus auroma to it.</li>
            <li>Fits nicely in my pocket for on the go application.</li>
            <li>It smells nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried keeping it in my pocket to warm it up.</li>
            <li>Works great... and will be even better with a bit more growth</li>
            <li>It has a nice woodsy smell.</li>
            <li>It comes in a nice, slide-top tin, which tucks neatly into your pocket to carry around for touch-up applications.</li>
            <li>I used a hair dryer for about 3 minutes to warm it up</li>
            <li>I also found the honey lemon scent quite nice.</li>
            <li>Smells nice.</li>
            <li>Nice smell with a medium hold.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I use this as a nice starter &amp; I thicken the ends with something like the &amp;#34;Firehouse&amp;#34; wax...</li>
            <li>people mention it has a kind of lemony piney smell to it.</li>
            <li>Good hold for most of the day.</li>
            <li>Nice wax</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>Starts softer and ends stiffer, I like this stuff, smells nice too.</li>
            <li>absolutely the best!</li>
            <li>Box is pocked handy.</li>
            <li>Has a nice ginger fragrance the wife loves.</li>
            <li>Nice smell to it.  </li>
            <li>But the odour is nice.  </li>
            <li>Now, I was lead to believe this wax maintained a decent hold on the stache, but I found the hold to be medium at best.</li>
            <li>The tin is perfectly pocket-sized and surprisingly doesn&#x27;t open on its own.</li>
            <li>Great product ,strong hold ,great scent  Fast shipping !</li>
            <li>Smells good and easy to take around.</li>
            <li>The wax smells good and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>it has a very nice mild lemony smell with a hint of beeswax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still the best I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>Great product, medium hold and notes of citrus in its fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>I think this will be more effective as my mustache gets longer.</li>
            <li>but if it was clear so could not be seen that would make it perfect.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed the scent, too, which is kind of citrusy.</li>
            <li>Works great for what I need it for &amp; it&#x27;s perfect for travel &amp; everyday carry.</li>
            <li>This wax is perfect for simply keeping things tidy though.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a nice consistency, and is easily removed from the tin with a fingernail.  </li>
            <li>Nice wax, easy container</li>
            <li>But, nice container and easy access.  </li>
            <li>Its easy to use just take a fingernail sized amount out, rub it in between your fingers to warm it up, and then apply to your mustache.</li>
            <li>Fisticuffs has proven to be strong and his new favorite!!!</li>
            <li>This is ok..</li>
            <li>I know I will buy more of this product.</li>
            <li>I just like to keep hair out of my mouth, keep a nice split at the center and this wax works perfect for that.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy the scent as well!</li>
            <li>The aroma itself if probably my favorite aspect of this wax.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m reluctant to buy another wax so soon, for fear of not being able to find one with a scent as pleasing as this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just scrape the top of your fingernail across the wax to extract it.</li>
            <li>Once you have  the amount of wax you want, rub it between your index fingers or index and thumb to soften it a bit more.</li>
            <li>Smells ok....</li>
            <li>/&gt;Luckily it smells okay</li>
            <li>This has been one of the better solutions for the job.</li>
            <li>I used Clubman before, which was ok, but didn&#x27;t hold as well.  </li>
            <li>the more</li>
            <li>you apply the better</li>
            <li>you will be able to hold your mustache the way you want.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, and it has a nice smooth texture.</li>
            <li>I had hoped for a bit more hold though.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product and I will be a repeat customer once this tin finally runs out.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasent, lemon scent that isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li>The shaping is great, the hold not so much.</li>
            <li>love this wax, and I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if it could contain my copper wire stache, but it just doesn&#x27;t seem as if it can.</li>
            <li>I recommend Wacky Tacky for an all-day hold with any style (curled handlebar or a pulled-natural look).</li>
            <li>I love the tin it comes in</li>
            <li>but it does indeed give me more control than nothing.</li>
            <li>This product is nothing more than an example of creative re-packaging.</li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>What more is there to say?</li>
            <li>My husband loves it and our sons love the logo and keep the stickers. :)</li>
            <li>Not terrible but if your doing a mans job and sweat you will have to reapply serval times a day.</li>
            <li>The &#x27;hold&#x27; does fade over time, but the easy-to-use case means touching up your &#x27;stache is a snap!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I disagree with many of the reviews that state</li>
            <li>This wax is probably OK.</li>
            <li>I would compare it to more of a lemon wedge cake.</li>
            <li>for this look I put the fisticuffs in before bed and its perfect the next day for an unwaxed look but still keeps the curls at bay.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received more compliments while wearing this product than most colognes I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>This is probably the better of the two waxes I have tried out.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>This smells better than most waxes.</li>
            <li>This product didnt hold for me, but the smell is much better than brother&#x27;s love.</li>
            <li>Appealing tin</li>
            <li>it is on the mustache it keeps the shape perfectly for the entire day.</li>
            <li>I am really pleased with it.</li>
            <li>smells good and neutral color works great with my blonde &#x27;stach!</li>
            <li>Mostly a citrus smell.</li>
            <li>Love the ease it goes on and love how it smells.  </li>
            <li>love the way it fells on my mustache.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Gotta get more.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff</li>
            <li>It also smells lovely.</li>
            <li>Extremely satisfied with this product and would purchase again.</li>
            <li>Just acts more like a beard balm or something.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>Nothing better for my foo man chu.</li>
            <li>What more you want from your stach wax?</li>
            <li>They smell great and are good for your whiskers but the hold is honestly not that great</li>
            <li>more respect and deference headed my way in the workplace, from superiors and colleagues alike.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>we both really love the smell of it and he seems pleased with how it feels in his mustache and</li>
            <li>He had heard that Fisticuffs was pretty good</li>
            <li>Stuff holds good when you first put it on</li>
            <li>Pleasant smell, which is important for something that is right under your nose.</li>
            <li>Pleasant scent, easy to work with, not quite up to snuff for really hot weather.</li>
            <li>A must read for new or experienced recruiters or anyone for that matter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to wax, so I can&#x27;t give too much of a great review, but</li>
            <li>Perfect for very long mustache.</li>
            <li>Wish it rubbed onto my fingers more easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, lovely lemon scent that is not at all overpowering.</li>
            <li>Application is so easy, I will be buying more .</li>
            <li>so maybe better for fine haired peep</li>
            <li>Nothing special, smells fine, nice appearance to the tin as well.</li>
            <li>You can get it out of the tin w/o running hot water over it, but it&#x27;s more manageable if you warm it up.</li>
            <li>All-around a good product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit on the stiffer side of waxes, so it really does a superior job keeping your mustache in place.</li>
            <li>That being said, the scent is a light lemon, quite pleasant, and the hold is pretty good, though not entirely stiff.  </li>
            <li>The wax is easy to apply and get out of the tin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>Nothing seems to make it easy.</li>
            <li>it makes it easy to through in your pocket for maintenance on the go.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Convenient packaging allows you to easily carry this wax with you</li>
            <li>product is easy to  apply and has a pleasing scent, hold power is medium.</li>
            <li>It smells great and seems to last for most of the day.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply, smears well, and stays put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Scent is very mild and pleasurable.</li>
            <li>Nice smell and consistency overall a good product.</li>
            <li>Milder scent, strong hold.</li>
            <li>go strong wax but dont expect to sculpt your stach once its on</li>
            <li>good moderate hold, smells nice</li>
            <li>scent, not too strong &amp; doesn&#x27;t smell like a wax</li>
            <li>the hold isn&#x27;t freakishly strong, or</li>
            <li>First let me say, this wax smells amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;3 stars for excellent scent, low price and good quality, -2 for weaker than advertised hold on coarse hair and lack of staying power.</li>
            <li>I have a medium to fine mustache.</li>
            <li>and then it worked fine.</li>
            <li>I love this product, wax isnt super sticky like others I have tried.</li>
            <li>Scent is mild but refreshing lemon</li>
            <li>Good strong masculine scent.</li>
            <li>This is a good everyday medium hold wax with a light and pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Easier to warm than the large tins.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s important</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>out their website, the guy running the show has great style and backs a solid product.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;d say this is a great product.</li>
            <li>will say that it works great for keeping the hair above my lip rather than in my mouth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read reviews that suggest this wax is great for those who are looking for a medium hold and those who only want to shape the stache, and I will agree to that.</li>
            <li>Has a light lemon smell to it.</li>
            <li>The size of the tin is comfortable in my pocket.</li>
            <li>It is good at making the stache soft, but if you&#x27;re looking for something to hold a curl all day, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>With so many waxes on amazon and no experience with any I depended on reviews alone to make a choice and it was the right one.  </li>
            <li>Just a quick scrape in the tin with a finger nail, and a smear down each side is perfect!</li>
            <li>Very rarely do I need to reapply, and style in the afternoon, or evening.</li>
            <li>The wax is easy to carry and dispense in its convenient metal case, allowing me to use just the right amount to achieve the well-groomed villain look I desire, without becoming a poster child for the &#x27;plastic &#x27;stache&#x27;</li>
            <li>Doesnt have a super strong hold</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, smells good and terrific hold.</li>
            <li>The hold Fisticuffs gives far outlives the cardamom heaven that now exists beneath your nose, but don&#x27;t fret it easily can be removed with a hot shower and a good old-fashioned bar of soap if need be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As others have stated, it does have quite a pleasant smell - unlike many other brands of wax.</li>
            <li>best thing I have found so far is simply holding gel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried only 2 to 3 brands of wax and by far this is the best.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the nice application, especially when using a mustache comb.</li>
            <li>Its a clean smell.</li>
            <li>This stuff is workable right off the bat!</li>
            <li>Even with a pretty coarse mustache that I&#x27;m still training, I&#x27;m quite happy with how well the product lasts.  </li>
            <li>It arrived sooner than expected and was as described for a great price.</li>
            <li>I love this product thanks..</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s made from natural ingredients, smells nice, and is pliable.</li>
            <li>Came with a sweet sticker.</li>
            <li>I give it a 3 stars for presentation, color, smell, and cool factor (one of the coolest wax brands/logos I&#x27;ve seen).</li>
            <li>It came in the mail with a cool Fisticuffs sticker.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do a good job for my course upper lip.</li>
            <li>fisticuffs doesn&#x27;t quite hold my tips to the true rollie fingers</li>
            <li>Also, the art work and design is really cool if you&#x27;re into that sort of thing.</li>
            <li>If you add more wax it looks very greasy/clumpy even after being combed through well.</li>
            <li>But it does smell so good that I do like to keep using it on Oak Asian</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s never bad.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fisticuffs on the other hand, is great.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff easy to use cool container good price point and tames my wirey thick moustache</li>
            <li>But as I said before, the hold will weaken fairly quickly over time and you will have to reapply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>It seems to do better in the main part of my mustache, helping it keep</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll come back and re-review once I get some more length (and some more training) on my mustache.</li>
            <li>Works for a quick wax but didn&#x27;t have the holding power I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li>a ball/scrape between the fingers makes it workable quickly.</li>
            <li>Then, just comb the &amp;#34;part&amp;#34; center-point outward, just mildly, or you will remove wax and need to reapply.</li>
            <li>First, the pro&#x27;s: it&#x27;s fairly cheap.</li>
            <li>Whether i just use a little to keep the stache out of my mouth or go full on bareknuckle boxer, this stuff is great.  </li>
            <li>Not super happy with this.</li>
            <li>It holds really well and spreads easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to apply since it is very soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft enough that it wont cause you any real issues when applying it to your mustache, and has a very pleasant scent that will make it easier to make the decision to reapply.</li>
            <li>Great hold and convenient tin for keeping in my back pocket for touching up the stache throughout long work days.</li>
            <li>but if i apply and wait a few mins and do a dab more it will keep the curl on my mustache pretty good.</li>
            <li>After about 15-20 minutes my proud handles started drooping and became a lopsided mess.</li>
            <li>Been buying this brand for several months now, and have to say I love it!</li>
            <li>Great little tin for mustache march.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a fine line between using just enough to get the job done and using too much, where the wax forms a kind of unsightly crust that makes it look</li>
            <li>The price seems fair compared to what else is out there, it smells good, it comes in a neat little package, and that&#x27;s enough for me.</li>
            <li>It smells great, but won&#x27;t hold a curl longer than a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>It only holds For 5 minutes sculpts nicely</li>
            <li>Fun gift.</li>
            <li>It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and comes with some nice extra&#x27;s</li>
            <li>This is more natural hold</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how it will hold up in heat because it is a more natural.</li>
            <li>So far, this is my favorite mustache wax.</li>
            <li>Good product, exactly as I expected.  </li>
            <li>The wax does not hold in the center at all, and after a couple hours, my curls start to droop (and that&#x27;s on a good day).</li>
            <li>Smells lemony fresh.</li>
            <li>It is far more manageable throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Masculine ish smell, though it is not my favorite at all</li>
            <li>Hubby loves it and it&#x27;s smells like fresh ginger.</li>
            <li>Really nice smell medium hold definitely will buy again</li>
            <li>It has a fresh lemon scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li>Great wax, easy to use and mold, long lasting</li>
            <li>This product is simply the best, longest lasting wax for my classic handlebar look!&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>but that goes away pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Smells good, wish there were other options for smell.</li>
            <li>Fisticuffs holds better, I like the tin, it keeps in my pocket better and though water will affect it, it doesn&#x27;t dissolve as readily so it will hold if it is raining (as long as you don&#x27;t soak it).</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right..</li>
            <li>, right?  </li>
            <li>Made right here in California too, you can&#x27;t beat that.&lt;br /&gt;Check</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of hold.</li>
            <li>right you call me &amp;#34;sir&amp;#34;,</li>
            <li>But once it&#x27;s on your facial hair, it holds pretty nicely throughout the day.</li>
            <li>This wax is reasonably pliable with a nice, yellow color that applies clear, and I love the citrus smell.</li>
            <li>The tin is a great size to carry in pants pockets even though he usually waxes his &#x27;stache before he goes to bed</li>
            <li>Admittedly, this is my first mustache wax experience, so take this for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and doesn&#x27;t stay long</li>
            <li>This mustache wax smells very good but is a very modest hold so unless your beard or mustache is naturally tame this might not keep it in place.</li>
            <li>a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is much softer from the tin than Firehouse, which had me a little concerned, but it works great.</li>
            <li>all in a handy little tin you can fit effortlessly in your pocket</li>
            <li>The wax works perfectly for him and he only needs a little.</li>
            <li>I have very thick beard hair, but I was actually able to style it, which was surprising.</li>
            <li>Takes a little heating up to apply easily but it holds very strong, all day.</li>
            <li>Comes in a cool tin with a cool old timey sticker.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, holds well without making my stache hard.  </li>
            <li>I wish it had a little bit more hold, but overall, it is good for any mustache enthusiast looking to shape the lip hair.</li>
            <li>first try with moustache wax</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would recommend this to a first time wax user because of the price and the scent.</li>
            <li>gr8 hold at first but doesn&#x27;t last more than an hr for me.</li>
            <li>This is the first mustache wax I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This was my first mustache wax and it did not seem to hold well.</li>
            <li>Now my hubby is experimenting with all sorts of styles, his current favorite is the handlebar.</li>
            <li>This is the first wax I have ever</li>
            <li>It is exactly what you think it is.</li>
            <li>My first ever mustache wax.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using a mustache wax.</li>
            <li>As I said, this is my first time using the stuff</li>
            <li>I wear it during the hot summer days</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more when needed.</li>
            <li>First official mustache wax, I&#x27;ve been using hair gels and pomades.</li>
            <li>Even on hot days.</li>
            <li>This was my first experience with mustache wax</li>
            <li>Too light and soft for my needs.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and definitely recommend to anyone interested.</li>
            <li>This was my first mustache wax I ever tried.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>If a few hairs start going astray, it&#x27;s extremely easy to apply a tad more.  </li>
            <li>Clubman also seemed to dissolve more quickly if it became wet.  </li>
            <li>The hold doesn&#x27;t last as long as something like clubman, but it goes on more easily and can quickly be reapplied for touch ups.  </li>
            <li>Smells good but not terribly easy to work with.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, subtle citrus scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Just use a hair dryer for 30 secs to a minute directly on it to make malleable/ pliable on the hi hot setting, then after applying with fingers &amp; mustache/beard comb, put hairdryer on cool setting &amp; blow on hair to set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does not stand up very well to humidity, but is a solid product that i&#x27;m glad to have among my styling and waxing options.</li>
            <li>Wax is a little difficult to warm up to workable consistency, but holds mustache shape great once applied!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve experienced a noticeable uptick in female attention, especially from ladies of diverse cultural backgrounds.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product, but I&#x27;m not sure if wax is for me...</li>
            <li>The tin has a cool design and gives you an old school feel even if you don&#x27;t like or need the wax.</li>
            <li>I am able to restyle my mustache just enough to keep it out of my mouth and out of the way when I eat, but other than that I have to use more wax.</li>
            <li>..make sure you check out their other products and make sure to buy a Kent comb for your stache (makes a big difference)</li>
            <li>It works ok, but doesn&#x27;t hold for very long in the heat and humidity of FL.</li>
            <li>wax is easy enough to retrieve from the tin.</li>
            <li>Soft hold, quickly looses strength.</li>
            <li>I like that the tin easily fits in my back pocket.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and it has an instant hold.</li>
            <li>Its also compact so you can easily carry it with you, which may be necessary as you often have to reapply the wax to keep the hold.</li>
            <li>tin slides open... rather easily.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not messy, has a nice citrus smell, works all day long.</li>
            <li>But I will often go for a less tight tipped imperial, best not to attract so much attention from the ladies.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hold for very long, but overall good</li>
            <li>Wax is very hard to use, Holds great once you get some out of the tin, getting it out is the issue.</li>
            <li>While, their is likely even less hold than before, it no longer gives me booger-beard and leaves my mustache feeling nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>all it&#x27;s a decent first time wax for someone who has never used any before.</li>
            <li>Much easier to work in, and holds all day, no problem.</li>
            <li>helps keep my stache under control, just don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend didn&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li>The tin it comes in is very convenient, and it&#x27;s priced very reasonably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this wax.  </li>
            <li>On the thicker center of the mustache, it holds better and you can forget about it for some 3-4 hours.</li>
            <li>but I really could not use it.</li>
            <li>It arrived very soon after I ordered it</li>
            <li>That aside, I highly recommend fisticuffs wax!</li>
            <li>Fisticuffs wax holds like crazy while smelling great!</li>
            <li>I have a very wiry, very curly mustache, and it just doesn&#x27;t seem to have the holding power that I need.</li>
            <li>I now get why he doesn&#x27;t like to kiss as much when I wear lipstick</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>Doesnt hold my stache no matter how much i put in.</li>
            <li>He tried it and really likes it.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t like to spend that much time fussing with cosmetics.</li>
            <li>Absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li>I find the smell is very pleasing (smells citrus/lemon drop).</li>
            <li>Works fast no need to over apply.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t manage to do that very well.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have much experience with these things</li>
            <li>both the lavender and lemon scented, both are very nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not as much hold as Fireman&#x27;s Tacky.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much on the tip of your finger to get the job done.</li>
            <li>Good hold for the curl on the ends but couldn&#x27;t handle keeping the center from straightening back out over my lip.</li>
            <li>It worked well for a curl as well as a more natural or brushed look.</li>
            <li>on the road or walking around, keep in pocket so stays warm enough or hit it with the hair dryer in a public restroom to get it pliable again</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very affected by heat, so if you live in a hot, moist climate, it might not control your frolicking face</li>
            <li>Fairly easy to apply (especially if it&#x27;s been in your pocket a few minutes prior, body heat is sufficient to make it softer), and the smell is pleasant (though a bit too</li>
            <li>It has a nice hold without looking and feeling too stiff.</li>
            <li>First time growing an epic stache!</li>
            <li>After reading reviews for many other products I decided to buy the Fisticuffs wax.</li>
            <li>I think my facial hair is extra coarse, however--the wax doesn&#x27;t hold for more than a couple hours and seemingly isn&#x27;t able to tame the most unruly, wispy hairs.</li>
            <li>You can use just a little to keep yer stache in check from day to day or use a little more to get nice handlebars with pliable hold.</li>
            <li>tried treating it as a hot wax instead, using direct flame from a lighter.</li>
            <li>I think it works better on my goatee for the simple fact that my chin doesn&#x27;t see nearly as much movement as my upper lip.  </li>
            <li>However, this really isn&#x27;t unbearable, and it&#x27;s certainly better than what you&#x27;re likely to find in your local drugstore.</li>
            <li>Not sure what that&#x27;s about, honestly, but it is significant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways, say what you will, but ALL of the above is true.</li>
            <li>This is a good wax but is a little light for my stiff stash.  </li>
            <li>i was expecting to wax to keep my mustache down a bit better.  </li>
            <li>Hold for me about a half day or more.</li>
            <li>I was able to style my mustache and beard and have it stay for about half a day.</li>
            <li>First time buying moustache wax and if I had to purchase again I&#x27;d consider this product again only after trying others first.</li>
            <li>however I gave it four stars because I don&#x27;t use this wax as my main wax.</li>
            <li>Btw my main wax if you&#x27;re wondering is Clubs Man.</li>
            <li>It seems to work as a decent conditioner</li>
            <li>Clever packaging.</li>
            <li>It has a decent smell and it seems to do the job.</li>
            <li>Stuff smells decent, as others have said, it smells like lemon.</li>
            <li>Decent hold.</li>
            <li>It did a decent job of keeping my longer mustache out of my mouth and swept to the side.</li>
            <li>I keep it in my coat pocket for those times where I need a quick fix and don&#x27;t need it to last hours.  </li>
            <li>Hold&#x27;s decent but if your mustache is unruly you may want a stronger wax.</li>
            <li>maybe if it&#x27;s just a quick groom or fix up for a short time.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t much to compare it to except some captain fawcett but this stuff has a good hold that isn&#x27;t damaging to the stache, and the Tin is small enough to out in the coin slot of any pair of jeans for reapplication throughout the day.</li>
            <li>My mustache hair is pretty thick, pretty long, and pretty heavy, so maybe this was never the right product for me anyway, but it works great for maybe an hour, and</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for something they can apply and forget about.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>it would just fall right back down, and repeated combings would just make the top of my lip sore from all the hairs being pulled out.</li>
            <li>5 stars if it held a little bit better.</li>
            <li>Rub your thumbprint on the surface if you just want a little, or use the top of your fingernail to grab a heartier portion to apply.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of hard, wish it were softer, (That&#x27;s what she said)</li>
            <li>Also it was hard to warm up.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hold as strong as other waxes but will keep your &#x27;stash out of the way</li>
            <li>so one tin would last most users a long time...  </li>
            <li>an will be buying more, just not going to use it everyday.</li>
            <li>i just prefer the stiff hold of brother,s love</li>
            <li>Since my facial hairs are not coarse, but rather fine and manageable, I decided that I&#x27;d give this product a try.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be the talk of the town as you walk through mainstreet with your newly groomed mustache.</li>
            <li>It works wonders and helps keep my husband&#x27;s new growth under control.</li>
            <li>If you are new to this product please watch YouTube videos on how to use.</li>
            <li>You got to use a fair amount for it to hold the entire day, but I also like that it doesn&#x27;t turn your hair rock hard, and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li>Its decent as far as wax goes.</li>
            <li>It is ESSENTIAL if you have a large mustache and want to keep it looking fairly decent.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s a construction worker, so that&#x27;s really no small order.</li>
            <li>I have reasonably coarse mustache hair, and I am training my mustache to go into handlebars for the first time.  </li>
            <li>This is my first foray into facial hair products, so I don&#x27;t have any baseline for comparison, but this wax has seemed like a pretty mixed bag.</li>
            <li>Whether you jockey a desk, enjoy blasting down hills on a bike at 65 khm, or sweat your you-know-what off in the gym all day</li>
            <li>Looking for a clean sharp looking mustache?</li>
            <li>I had fun applying this wax but was quickly let down after my curl came undone hours later after being active.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The package is such that you will not want to put it in your pocket for use later in the day, you will find that your keys are full of wax.</li>
            <li>First of all, this is the only wax I have used so far.</li>
            <li>for the container, a round shape would be better for warming the wax up, and the container gets to looking pretty gross once it&#x27;s inevitably covered in waxy fingerprints.</li>
            <li>Before buying, I read the other reviews and many were saying that it wouldn&#x27;t hold for long.</li>
            <li>Applying a bunch more is not really an option because it will give your mustache a reflective sheen, which is particularly visible if you have a dark mustache like myself.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried a few different waxes and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>If you use a bit, you can get a soft hold without feeling like your mustache is caked in wax</li>
            <li>Rubbing back and forth really fast.</li>
            <li>I prefer tacky Firehouse brand wax by far.</li>
            <li>This goes on soft and has a medium hold.  </li>
            <li>Not a heavy hold though.</li>
            <li>He has had a mustache for nearly 30 years now.</li>
            <li>This is a fairly soft wax.  </li>
            <li>I am still in the early stages of waxing my stache so take my review for what you will.</li>
            <li>I have to reshape fairly frequently.</li>
            <li>The cover gets really easy/loose to open after a week of use.  </li>
            <li>There are similar products at Whole Foods that are cheaper.</li>
            <li>I use this product daily and really like it a lot.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a nice smell, but absolutely useless for stick straight hair like mine.</li>
            <li>My only criticism is that I wish the hold was a bit more firm.  </li>
            <li>After trying tons of gels and other products, this is the only thing I have found that can smooth them out.</li>
            <li>The tin is easy to keep in your pocket with a small Kent mustache comb without being intrusive.</li>
            <li>No good for holding but great for conditioning and a just little shaping.</li>
            <li>This is the first mustache wax I have used, and it was nice for the price but slightly disappointing.</li>
            <li>, I noticed a nice hint of lemon, This is not ideal for a beard, but my wild lip whiskers no longer tickle my nose....</li>
            <li>Admittedly, this is only the second wax I&#x27;ve tried, the first being Clubman.  </li>
            <li>As others have said, it doesn&#x27;t last all day, but that seems like a lot to ask, especially for those of us in hot, humid climes.</li>
            <li>Not to mention the cool little tin that it comes in.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a high price to pay for a tiny tin that doesn&#x27;t work and makes your face look like a wilted dandruff monkey.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m going back to High Life.</li>
            <li>I will say though that this is not the firmest wax I have used, and if you are looking for a wax that will have super tight curls</li>
            <li>took my a long time to knead into a substance i can use on my mustache, it was very dense</li>
            <li>Will not turn your mustache to concrete, but it held decently enough.</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic, a little woodsy mixed with lemon.  </li>
            <li>We live in Florida and his work takes him outside a lot-</li>
            <li>Love this product, it is tacky and holds well, the smell is so minimal that I do not even notice it after a few minutes</li>
            <li>I fell asleep with a curled mustache and i woke up with a only slightly less curled mustache which was easily fixed in a quick twist of the fingers.</li>
            <li>Works good but a little too greasy, an I only used a small amount.</li>
            <li>Some mentioned it could be considered a medium hold, while others indicated that their facial hairs were coarse and probably too strong to be held in place by anything but a firm hold wax.  </li>
            <li>A little pricey but worth it</li>
            <li>If you are a fine-mustachioed fella such as myself and have been plagued by other waxes pulling your hard-earned mustache hairs right out of the follicle before you can even complete your facial masterpiece....</li>
            <li>Too thick, very hard to apply/work with, which can lead more easily to clogged pores on the upper lip (if you&#x27;re at all prone to that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The wax itself is pretty stiff, I use a small fine comb to comb it in rather than scraping it with my finger as others have recommended.</li>
            <li>I have switched over to primary and secondary he</li>
            <li>I only have a 3 month old stache though, so I&#x27;ll return in about 6 months to a year to review again</li>
            <li>It keeps my moustache in place for approximately 30 minutes to an hour at the most, regardless of the application.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll determine how much better or worse this wax behaves with longer whiskers</li>
            <li>I like it well enough, but it is a little mild on the holding power.</li>
            <li>Ever since I grew out my moustache and began styling it in a slight, twisted handlebar, I&#x27;ve noticed great changes in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was hoping the handlebar stage wouldn&#x27;t last long due to not liking to get a face full of pomade like stuff when we kiss.</li>
            <li>will quickly learn how scrape a small amount from the surface of the container with your thumbnail, then place that wax between index finger and thumb and smush it together to melt and spread on just your fingertips.</li>
            <li>It certainly helped, but did not tame the hairs well, perhaps if I tried it for a few weeks it would have been trained</li>
            <li>This wax holds well, but I found it needed considerable warming before it became fluid enough to apply.</li>
            <li>Is a little sticky at first</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t discolor my beard, which the other one did, and seemed to have a decent hold.</li>
            <li>but, if you need a firm hold, it certainly does the trick.</li>
            <li>so it is a little hard to use as one might normally be able to...</li>
            <li>I was using Beardbrand wax before however the scent was a little too intense in my opinion for a mustache wax.</li>
            <li>but too bad the tin isn&#x27;t painted or a rugged sticker to allow for carry to always sport the logo as I think I have found a good wax.</li>

            <li> Good quality wax, I ordered it in the winter time...</li>
            <li> It took a good bit to soften it between your fingers and tended to clump up in my mustache.</li>
            <li> All in all a good buy. .</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> good quality but did not work well on my mustache and beard.  </li>
            <li> Good buy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also good for your mustache.</li>
            <li> Good Stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The wax was good but the quantity was not acceptable.</li>
            <li> Smells good.</li>
            <li> It smells good and should work</li>
            <li> I never review products, but this one is too good not to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is good, and after you comb it in, it holds without being seen, no waxy film either.</li>
            <li> good product.  </li>
            <li> Good item does what it was bought for.</li>
            <li> It smells good and works like it should.</li>
            <li> but it helt it in place good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smells good too.  </li>
            <li> Smells good though.</li>
            <li> Got this for my grandpa for Christmas, it smells so good</li>
            <li> To start, it smells good.</li>
            <li> But the good news stops there...</li>
            <li> it holds for most of the day -- good stuff!</li>
            <li> It spreads easily by hand without the need of a comb, but the hold isn&#x27;t very good.  </li>
            <li> Now this is how mustache wax is made,works great and has a pleasant lemon smell,very easy to use and carry around.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it would be great for doing a handlebar based on how well it holds for me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very refreshing when you catch the scent throughout the day.</li>
            <li> This wax is very stylish.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> wife is happy, so I&#x27;m kissin again :)</li>
            <li> Fisticuffs is an excellent wax, it comes with a great presentation (they gave me a free sticker), and a convenient flat tin that fits perfectly in my pants pockets.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite waxes!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much perfect for that.</li>
            <li> But wait, there&#x27;s more!</li>
            <li> strong hold great fragrance...</li>
            <li> Best beard oils and bombs around hands down and the prices are awesome!</li>
            <li> Also, this wax has a great, but not overpowering, ginger scent that I, and more importantly my wife, find to be quite pleasant.</li>
            <li> Smells AMAZING, does what it&#x27;s supposed to but not for long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> perfect and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Like the smell of this too, has kind of a citrus auroma to it.</li>
            <li> Fits nicely in my pocket for on the go application.</li>
            <li> It smells nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried keeping it in my pocket to warm it up.</li>
            <li> Works great... and will be even better with a bit more growth</li>
            <li> It has a nice woodsy smell.</li>
            <li> It comes in a nice, slide-top tin, which tucks neatly into your pocket to carry around for touch-up applications.</li>
            <li> I used a hair dryer for about 3 minutes to warm it up</li>
            <li> I also found the honey lemon scent quite nice.</li>
            <li> Smells nice.</li>
            <li> Nice smell with a medium hold.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I use this as a nice starter &amp; I thicken the ends with something like the &amp;#34;Firehouse&amp;#34; wax...</li>
            <li> people mention it has a kind of lemony piney smell to it.</li>
            <li> Good hold for most of the day.</li>
            <li> Nice wax</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> Starts softer and ends stiffer, I like this stuff, smells nice too.</li>
            <li> absolutely the best!</li>
            <li> Box is pocked handy.</li>
            <li> Has a nice ginger fragrance the wife loves.</li>
            <li> Nice smell to it.  </li>
            <li> But the odour is nice.  </li>
            <li> Now, I was lead to believe this wax maintained a decent hold on the stache, but I found the hold to be medium at best.</li>
            <li> The tin is perfectly pocket-sized and surprisingly doesn&#x27;t open on its own.</li>
            <li> Great product ,strong hold ,great scent  Fast shipping !</li>
            <li> Smells good and easy to take around.</li>
            <li> The wax smells good and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> it has a very nice mild lemony smell with a hint of beeswax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still the best I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> Great product, medium hold and notes of citrus in its fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> I think this will be more effective as my mustache gets longer.</li>
            <li> but if it was clear so could not be seen that would make it perfect.  </li>
            <li> I enjoyed the scent, too, which is kind of citrusy.</li>
            <li> Works great for what I need it for &amp; it&#x27;s perfect for travel &amp; everyday carry.</li>
            <li> This wax is perfect for simply keeping things tidy though.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a nice consistency, and is easily removed from the tin with a fingernail.  </li>
            <li> Nice wax, easy container</li>
            <li> But, nice container and easy access.  </li>
            <li> Its easy to use just take a fingernail sized amount out, rub it in between your fingers to warm it up, and then apply to your mustache.</li>
            <li> Fisticuffs has proven to be strong and his new favorite!!!</li>
            <li> This is ok..</li>
            <li> I know I will buy more of this product.</li>
            <li> I just like to keep hair out of my mouth, keep a nice split at the center and this wax works perfect for that.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy the scent as well!</li>
            <li> The aroma itself if probably my favorite aspect of this wax.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m reluctant to buy another wax so soon, for fear of not being able to find one with a scent as pleasing as this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just scrape the top of your fingernail across the wax to extract it.</li>
            <li> Once you have  the amount of wax you want, rub it between your index fingers or index and thumb to soften it a bit more.</li>
            <li> Smells ok....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Luckily it smells okay</li>
            <li> This has been one of the better solutions for the job.</li>
            <li> I used Clubman before, which was ok, but didn&#x27;t hold as well.  </li>
            <li> the more</li>
            <li> you apply the better</li>
            <li> you will be able to hold your mustache the way you want.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, and it has a nice smooth texture.</li>
            <li> I had hoped for a bit more hold though.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product and I will be a repeat customer once this tin finally runs out.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasent, lemon scent that isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li> The shaping is great, the hold not so much.</li>
            <li> love this wax, and I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if it could contain my copper wire stache, but it just doesn&#x27;t seem as if it can.</li>
            <li> I recommend Wacky Tacky for an all-day hold with any style (curled handlebar or a pulled-natural look).</li>
            <li> I love the tin it comes in</li>
            <li> but it does indeed give me more control than nothing.</li>
            <li> This product is nothing more than an example of creative re-packaging.</li>
            <li> Love this product</li>
            <li> What more is there to say?</li>
            <li> My husband loves it and our sons love the logo and keep the stickers. :)</li>
            <li> Not terrible but if your doing a mans job and sweat you will have to reapply serval times a day.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;hold&#x27; does fade over time, but the easy-to-use case means touching up your &#x27;stache is a snap!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I disagree with many of the reviews that state</li>
            <li> This wax is probably OK.</li>
            <li> I would compare it to more of a lemon wedge cake.</li>
            <li> for this look I put the fisticuffs in before bed and its perfect the next day for an unwaxed look but still keeps the curls at bay.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received more compliments while wearing this product than most colognes I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This is probably the better of the two waxes I have tried out.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love the smell.</li>
            <li> This smells better than most waxes.</li>
            <li> This product didnt hold for me, but the smell is much better than brother&#x27;s love.</li>
            <li> Appealing tin</li>
            <li> it is on the mustache it keeps the shape perfectly for the entire day.</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with it.</li>
            <li> smells good and neutral color works great with my blonde &#x27;stach!</li>
            <li> Mostly a citrus smell.</li>
            <li> Love the ease it goes on and love how it smells.  </li>
            <li> love the way it fells on my mustache.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Gotta get more.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff</li>
            <li> It also smells lovely.</li>
            <li> Extremely satisfied with this product and would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Just acts more like a beard balm or something.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Nothing better for my foo man chu.</li>
            <li> What more you want from your stach wax?</li>
            <li> They smell great and are good for your whiskers but the hold is honestly not that great</li>
            <li> more respect and deference headed my way in the workplace, from superiors and colleagues alike.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> we both really love the smell of it and he seems pleased with how it feels in his mustache and</li>
            <li> He had heard that Fisticuffs was pretty good</li>
            <li> Stuff holds good when you first put it on</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell, which is important for something that is right under your nose.</li>
            <li> Pleasant scent, easy to work with, not quite up to snuff for really hot weather.</li>
            <li> A must read for new or experienced recruiters or anyone for that matter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to wax, so I can&#x27;t give too much of a great review, but</li>
            <li> Perfect for very long mustache.</li>
            <li> Wish it rubbed onto my fingers more easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, lovely lemon scent that is not at all overpowering.</li>
            <li> Application is so easy, I will be buying more .</li>
            <li> so maybe better for fine haired peep</li>
            <li> Nothing special, smells fine, nice appearance to the tin as well.</li>
            <li> You can get it out of the tin w/o running hot water over it, but it&#x27;s more manageable if you warm it up.</li>
            <li> All-around a good product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit on the stiffer side of waxes, so it really does a superior job keeping your mustache in place.</li>
            <li> That being said, the scent is a light lemon, quite pleasant, and the hold is pretty good, though not entirely stiff.  </li>
            <li> The wax is easy to apply and get out of the tin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> Nothing seems to make it easy.</li>
            <li> it makes it easy to through in your pocket for maintenance on the go.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Convenient packaging allows you to easily carry this wax with you</li>
            <li> product is easy to  apply and has a pleasing scent, hold power is medium.</li>
            <li> It smells great and seems to last for most of the day.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply, smears well, and stays put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Scent is very mild and pleasurable.</li>
            <li> Nice smell and consistency overall a good product.</li>
            <li> Milder scent, strong hold.</li>
            <li> go strong wax but dont expect to sculpt your stach once its on</li>
            <li> good moderate hold, smells nice</li>
            <li> scent, not too strong &amp; doesn&#x27;t smell like a wax</li>
            <li> the hold isn&#x27;t freakishly strong, or</li>
            <li> First let me say, this wax smells amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;3 stars for excellent scent, low price and good quality, -2 for weaker than advertised hold on coarse hair and lack of staying power.</li>
            <li> I have a medium to fine mustache.</li>
            <li> and then it worked fine.</li>
            <li> I love this product, wax isnt super sticky like others I have tried.</li>
            <li> Scent is mild but refreshing lemon</li>
            <li> Good strong masculine scent.</li>
            <li> This is a good everyday medium hold wax with a light and pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Easier to warm than the large tins.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s important</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> out their website, the guy running the show has great style and backs a solid product.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;d say this is a great product.</li>
            <li> will say that it works great for keeping the hair above my lip rather than in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read reviews that suggest this wax is great for those who are looking for a medium hold and those who only want to shape the stache, and I will agree to that.</li>
            <li> Has a light lemon smell to it.</li>
            <li> The size of the tin is comfortable in my pocket.</li>
            <li> It is good at making the stache soft, but if you&#x27;re looking for something to hold a curl all day, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> With so many waxes on amazon and no experience with any I depended on reviews alone to make a choice and it was the right one.  </li>
            <li> Just a quick scrape in the tin with a finger nail, and a smear down each side is perfect!</li>
            <li> Very rarely do I need to reapply, and style in the afternoon, or evening.</li>
            <li> The wax is easy to carry and dispense in its convenient metal case, allowing me to use just the right amount to achieve the well-groomed villain look I desire, without becoming a poster child for the &#x27;plastic &#x27;stache&#x27;</li>
            <li> Doesnt have a super strong hold</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, smells good and terrific hold.</li>
            <li> The hold Fisticuffs gives far outlives the cardamom heaven that now exists beneath your nose, but don&#x27;t fret it easily can be removed with a hot shower and a good old-fashioned bar of soap if need be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As others have stated, it does have quite a pleasant smell - unlike many other brands of wax.</li>
            <li> best thing I have found so far is simply holding gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried only 2 to 3 brands of wax and by far this is the best.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the nice application, especially when using a mustache comb.</li>
            <li> Its a clean smell.</li>
            <li> This stuff is workable right off the bat!</li>
            <li> Even with a pretty coarse mustache that I&#x27;m still training, I&#x27;m quite happy with how well the product lasts.  </li>
            <li> It arrived sooner than expected and was as described for a great price.</li>
            <li> I love this product thanks..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s made from natural ingredients, smells nice, and is pliable.</li>
            <li> Came with a sweet sticker.</li>
            <li> I give it a 3 stars for presentation, color, smell, and cool factor (one of the coolest wax brands/logos I&#x27;ve seen).</li>
            <li> It came in the mail with a cool Fisticuffs sticker.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do a good job for my course upper lip.</li>
            <li> fisticuffs doesn&#x27;t quite hold my tips to the true rollie fingers</li>
            <li> Also, the art work and design is really cool if you&#x27;re into that sort of thing.</li>
            <li> If you add more wax it looks very greasy/clumpy even after being combed through well.</li>
            <li> But it does smell so good that I do like to keep using it on Oak Asian</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s never bad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fisticuffs on the other hand, is great.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff easy to use cool container good price point and tames my wirey thick moustache</li>
            <li> But as I said before, the hold will weaken fairly quickly over time and you will have to reapply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> It seems to do better in the main part of my mustache, helping it keep</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll come back and re-review once I get some more length (and some more training) on my mustache.</li>
            <li> Works for a quick wax but didn&#x27;t have the holding power I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li> a ball/scrape between the fingers makes it workable quickly.</li>
            <li> Then, just comb the &amp;#34;part&amp;#34; center-point outward, just mildly, or you will remove wax and need to reapply.</li>
            <li> First, the pro&#x27;s: it&#x27;s fairly cheap.</li>
            <li> Whether i just use a little to keep the stache out of my mouth or go full on bareknuckle boxer, this stuff is great.  </li>
            <li> Not super happy with this.</li>
            <li> It holds really well and spreads easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy to apply since it is very soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft enough that it wont cause you any real issues when applying it to your mustache, and has a very pleasant scent that will make it easier to make the decision to reapply.</li>
            <li> Great hold and convenient tin for keeping in my back pocket for touching up the stache throughout long work days.</li>
            <li> but if i apply and wait a few mins and do a dab more it will keep the curl on my mustache pretty good.</li>
            <li> After about 15-20 minutes my proud handles started drooping and became a lopsided mess.</li>
            <li> Been buying this brand for several months now, and have to say I love it!</li>
            <li> Great little tin for mustache march.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a fine line between using just enough to get the job done and using too much, where the wax forms a kind of unsightly crust that makes it look</li>
            <li> The price seems fair compared to what else is out there, it smells good, it comes in a neat little package, and that&#x27;s enough for me.</li>
            <li> It smells great, but won&#x27;t hold a curl longer than a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> It only holds For 5 minutes sculpts nicely</li>
            <li> Fun gift.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and comes with some nice extra&#x27;s</li>
            <li> This is more natural hold</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it will hold up in heat because it is a more natural.</li>
            <li> So far, this is my favorite mustache wax.</li>
            <li> Good product, exactly as I expected.  </li>
            <li> The wax does not hold in the center at all, and after a couple hours, my curls start to droop (and that&#x27;s on a good day).</li>
            <li> Smells lemony fresh.</li>
            <li> It is far more manageable throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Masculine ish smell, though it is not my favorite at all</li>
            <li> Hubby loves it and it&#x27;s smells like fresh ginger.</li>
            <li> Really nice smell medium hold definitely will buy again</li>
            <li> It has a fresh lemon scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li> Great wax, easy to use and mold, long lasting</li>
            <li> This product is simply the best, longest lasting wax for my classic handlebar look!&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> but that goes away pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Smells good, wish there were other options for smell.</li>
            <li> Fisticuffs holds better, I like the tin, it keeps in my pocket better and though water will affect it, it doesn&#x27;t dissolve as readily so it will hold if it is raining (as long as you don&#x27;t soak it).</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right..</li>
            <li> , right?  </li>
            <li> Made right here in California too, you can&#x27;t beat that.&lt;br /&gt;Check</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of hold.</li>
            <li> right you call me &amp;#34;sir&amp;#34;,</li>
            <li> But once it&#x27;s on your facial hair, it holds pretty nicely throughout the day.</li>
            <li> This wax is reasonably pliable with a nice, yellow color that applies clear, and I love the citrus smell.</li>
            <li> The tin is a great size to carry in pants pockets even though he usually waxes his &#x27;stache before he goes to bed</li>
            <li> Admittedly, this is my first mustache wax experience, so take this for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice and doesn&#x27;t stay long</li>
            <li> This mustache wax smells very good but is a very modest hold so unless your beard or mustache is naturally tame this might not keep it in place.</li>
            <li> a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is much softer from the tin than Firehouse, which had me a little concerned, but it works great.</li>
            <li> all in a handy little tin you can fit effortlessly in your pocket</li>
            <li> The wax works perfectly for him and he only needs a little.</li>
            <li> I have very thick beard hair, but I was actually able to style it, which was surprising.</li>
            <li> Takes a little heating up to apply easily but it holds very strong, all day.</li>
            <li> Comes in a cool tin with a cool old timey sticker.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, holds well without making my stache hard.  </li>
            <li> I wish it had a little bit more hold, but overall, it is good for any mustache enthusiast looking to shape the lip hair.</li>
            <li> first try with moustache wax</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would recommend this to a first time wax user because of the price and the scent.</li>
            <li> gr8 hold at first but doesn&#x27;t last more than an hr for me.</li>
            <li> This is the first mustache wax I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This was my first mustache wax and it did not seem to hold well.</li>
            <li> Now my hubby is experimenting with all sorts of styles, his current favorite is the handlebar.</li>
            <li> This is the first wax I have ever</li>
            <li> It is exactly what you think it is.</li>
            <li> My first ever mustache wax.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a mustache wax.</li>
            <li> As I said, this is my first time using the stuff</li>
            <li> I wear it during the hot summer days</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more when needed.</li>
            <li> First official mustache wax, I&#x27;ve been using hair gels and pomades.</li>
            <li> Even on hot days.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with mustache wax</li>
            <li> Too light and soft for my needs.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and definitely recommend to anyone interested.</li>
            <li> This was my first mustache wax I ever tried.</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> If a few hairs start going astray, it&#x27;s extremely easy to apply a tad more.  </li>
            <li> Clubman also seemed to dissolve more quickly if it became wet.  </li>
            <li> The hold doesn&#x27;t last as long as something like clubman, but it goes on more easily and can quickly be reapplied for touch ups.  </li>
            <li> Smells good but not terribly easy to work with.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, subtle citrus scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Just use a hair dryer for 30 secs to a minute directly on it to make malleable/ pliable on the hi hot setting, then after applying with fingers &amp; mustache/beard comb, put hairdryer on cool setting &amp; blow on hair to set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does not stand up very well to humidity, but is a solid product that i&#x27;m glad to have among my styling and waxing options.</li>
            <li> Wax is a little difficult to warm up to workable consistency, but holds mustache shape great once applied!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve experienced a noticeable uptick in female attention, especially from ladies of diverse cultural backgrounds.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product, but I&#x27;m not sure if wax is for me...</li>
            <li> The tin has a cool design and gives you an old school feel even if you don&#x27;t like or need the wax.</li>
            <li> I am able to restyle my mustache just enough to keep it out of my mouth and out of the way when I eat, but other than that I have to use more wax.</li>
            <li> ..make sure you check out their other products and make sure to buy a Kent comb for your stache (makes a big difference)</li>
            <li> It works ok, but doesn&#x27;t hold for very long in the heat and humidity of FL.</li>
            <li> wax is easy enough to retrieve from the tin.</li>
            <li> Soft hold, quickly looses strength.</li>
            <li> I like that the tin easily fits in my back pocket.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and it has an instant hold.</li>
            <li> Its also compact so you can easily carry it with you, which may be necessary as you often have to reapply the wax to keep the hold.</li>
            <li> tin slides open... rather easily.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not messy, has a nice citrus smell, works all day long.</li>
            <li> But I will often go for a less tight tipped imperial, best not to attract so much attention from the ladies.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold for very long, but overall good</li>
            <li> Wax is very hard to use, Holds great once you get some out of the tin, getting it out is the issue.</li>
            <li> While, their is likely even less hold than before, it no longer gives me booger-beard and leaves my mustache feeling nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> all it&#x27;s a decent first time wax for someone who has never used any before.</li>
            <li> Much easier to work in, and holds all day, no problem.</li>
            <li> helps keep my stache under control, just don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend didn&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li> The tin it comes in is very convenient, and it&#x27;s priced very reasonably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this wax.  </li>
            <li> On the thicker center of the mustache, it holds better and you can forget about it for some 3-4 hours.</li>
            <li> but I really could not use it.</li>
            <li> It arrived very soon after I ordered it</li>
            <li> That aside, I highly recommend fisticuffs wax!</li>
            <li> Fisticuffs wax holds like crazy while smelling great!</li>
            <li> I have a very wiry, very curly mustache, and it just doesn&#x27;t seem to have the holding power that I need.</li>
            <li> I now get why he doesn&#x27;t like to kiss as much when I wear lipstick</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> Doesnt hold my stache no matter how much i put in.</li>
            <li> He tried it and really likes it.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like to spend that much time fussing with cosmetics.</li>
            <li> Absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I find the smell is very pleasing (smells citrus/lemon drop).</li>
            <li> Works fast no need to over apply.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t manage to do that very well.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have much experience with these things</li>
            <li> both the lavender and lemon scented, both are very nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not as much hold as Fireman&#x27;s Tacky.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much on the tip of your finger to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Good hold for the curl on the ends but couldn&#x27;t handle keeping the center from straightening back out over my lip.</li>
            <li> It worked well for a curl as well as a more natural or brushed look.</li>
            <li> on the road or walking around, keep in pocket so stays warm enough or hit it with the hair dryer in a public restroom to get it pliable again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very affected by heat, so if you live in a hot, moist climate, it might not control your frolicking face</li>
            <li> Fairly easy to apply (especially if it&#x27;s been in your pocket a few minutes prior, body heat is sufficient to make it softer), and the smell is pleasant (though a bit too</li>
            <li> It has a nice hold without looking and feeling too stiff.</li>
            <li> First time growing an epic stache!</li>
            <li> After reading reviews for many other products I decided to buy the Fisticuffs wax.</li>
            <li> I think my facial hair is extra coarse, however--the wax doesn&#x27;t hold for more than a couple hours and seemingly isn&#x27;t able to tame the most unruly, wispy hairs.</li>
            <li> You can use just a little to keep yer stache in check from day to day or use a little more to get nice handlebars with pliable hold.</li>
            <li> tried treating it as a hot wax instead, using direct flame from a lighter.</li>
            <li> I think it works better on my goatee for the simple fact that my chin doesn&#x27;t see nearly as much movement as my upper lip.  </li>
            <li> However, this really isn&#x27;t unbearable, and it&#x27;s certainly better than what you&#x27;re likely to find in your local drugstore.</li>
            <li> Not sure what that&#x27;s about, honestly, but it is significant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways, say what you will, but ALL of the above is true.</li>
            <li> This is a good wax but is a little light for my stiff stash.  </li>
            <li> i was expecting to wax to keep my mustache down a bit better.  </li>
            <li> Hold for me about a half day or more.</li>
            <li> I was able to style my mustache and beard and have it stay for about half a day.</li>
            <li> First time buying moustache wax and if I had to purchase again I&#x27;d consider this product again only after trying others first.</li>
            <li> however I gave it four stars because I don&#x27;t use this wax as my main wax.</li>
            <li> Btw my main wax if you&#x27;re wondering is Clubs Man.</li>
            <li> It seems to work as a decent conditioner</li>
            <li> Clever packaging.</li>
            <li> It has a decent smell and it seems to do the job.</li>
            <li> Stuff smells decent, as others have said, it smells like lemon.</li>
            <li> Decent hold.</li>
            <li> It did a decent job of keeping my longer mustache out of my mouth and swept to the side.</li>
            <li> I keep it in my coat pocket for those times where I need a quick fix and don&#x27;t need it to last hours.  </li>
            <li> Hold&#x27;s decent but if your mustache is unruly you may want a stronger wax.</li>
            <li> maybe if it&#x27;s just a quick groom or fix up for a short time.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t much to compare it to except some captain fawcett but this stuff has a good hold that isn&#x27;t damaging to the stache, and the Tin is small enough to out in the coin slot of any pair of jeans for reapplication throughout the day.</li>
            <li> My mustache hair is pretty thick, pretty long, and pretty heavy, so maybe this was never the right product for me anyway, but it works great for maybe an hour, and</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for something they can apply and forget about.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> it would just fall right back down, and repeated combings would just make the top of my lip sore from all the hairs being pulled out.</li>
            <li> 5 stars if it held a little bit better.</li>
            <li> Rub your thumbprint on the surface if you just want a little, or use the top of your fingernail to grab a heartier portion to apply.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of hard, wish it were softer, (That&#x27;s what she said)</li>
            <li> Also it was hard to warm up.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold as strong as other waxes but will keep your &#x27;stash out of the way</li>
            <li> so one tin would last most users a long time...  </li>
            <li> an will be buying more, just not going to use it everyday.</li>
            <li> i just prefer the stiff hold of brother,s love</li>
            <li> Since my facial hairs are not coarse, but rather fine and manageable, I decided that I&#x27;d give this product a try.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be the talk of the town as you walk through mainstreet with your newly groomed mustache.</li>
            <li> It works wonders and helps keep my husband&#x27;s new growth under control.</li>
            <li> If you are new to this product please watch YouTube videos on how to use.</li>
            <li> You got to use a fair amount for it to hold the entire day, but I also like that it doesn&#x27;t turn your hair rock hard, and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> Its decent as far as wax goes.</li>
            <li> It is ESSENTIAL if you have a large mustache and want to keep it looking fairly decent.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s a construction worker, so that&#x27;s really no small order.</li>
            <li> I have reasonably coarse mustache hair, and I am training my mustache to go into handlebars for the first time.  </li>
            <li> This is my first foray into facial hair products, so I don&#x27;t have any baseline for comparison, but this wax has seemed like a pretty mixed bag.</li>
            <li> Whether you jockey a desk, enjoy blasting down hills on a bike at 65 khm, or sweat your you-know-what off in the gym all day</li>
            <li> Looking for a clean sharp looking mustache?</li>
            <li> I had fun applying this wax but was quickly let down after my curl came undone hours later after being active.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The package is such that you will not want to put it in your pocket for use later in the day, you will find that your keys are full of wax.</li>
            <li> First of all, this is the only wax I have used so far.</li>
            <li> for the container, a round shape would be better for warming the wax up, and the container gets to looking pretty gross once it&#x27;s inevitably covered in waxy fingerprints.</li>
            <li> Before buying, I read the other reviews and many were saying that it wouldn&#x27;t hold for long.</li>
            <li> Applying a bunch more is not really an option because it will give your mustache a reflective sheen, which is particularly visible if you have a dark mustache like myself.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different waxes and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> If you use a bit, you can get a soft hold without feeling like your mustache is caked in wax</li>
            <li> Rubbing back and forth really fast.</li>
            <li> I prefer tacky Firehouse brand wax by far.</li>
            <li> This goes on soft and has a medium hold.  </li>
            <li> Not a heavy hold though.</li>
            <li> He has had a mustache for nearly 30 years now.</li>
            <li> This is a fairly soft wax.  </li>
            <li> I am still in the early stages of waxing my stache so take my review for what you will.</li>
            <li> I have to reshape fairly frequently.</li>
            <li> The cover gets really easy/loose to open after a week of use.  </li>
            <li> There are similar products at Whole Foods that are cheaper.</li>
            <li> I use this product daily and really like it a lot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a nice smell, but absolutely useless for stick straight hair like mine.</li>
            <li> My only criticism is that I wish the hold was a bit more firm.  </li>
            <li> After trying tons of gels and other products, this is the only thing I have found that can smooth them out.</li>
            <li> The tin is easy to keep in your pocket with a small Kent mustache comb without being intrusive.</li>
            <li> No good for holding but great for conditioning and a just little shaping.</li>
            <li> This is the first mustache wax I have used, and it was nice for the price but slightly disappointing.</li>
            <li> , I noticed a nice hint of lemon, This is not ideal for a beard, but my wild lip whiskers no longer tickle my nose....</li>
            <li> Admittedly, this is only the second wax I&#x27;ve tried, the first being Clubman.  </li>
            <li> As others have said, it doesn&#x27;t last all day, but that seems like a lot to ask, especially for those of us in hot, humid climes.</li>
            <li> Not to mention the cool little tin that it comes in.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a high price to pay for a tiny tin that doesn&#x27;t work and makes your face look like a wilted dandruff monkey.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m going back to High Life.</li>
            <li> I will say though that this is not the firmest wax I have used, and if you are looking for a wax that will have super tight curls</li>
            <li> took my a long time to knead into a substance i can use on my mustache, it was very dense</li>
            <li> Will not turn your mustache to concrete, but it held decently enough.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic, a little woodsy mixed with lemon.  </li>
            <li> We live in Florida and his work takes him outside a lot-</li>
            <li> Love this product, it is tacky and holds well, the smell is so minimal that I do not even notice it after a few minutes</li>
            <li> I fell asleep with a curled mustache and i woke up with a only slightly less curled mustache which was easily fixed in a quick twist of the fingers.</li>
            <li> Works good but a little too greasy, an I only used a small amount.</li>
            <li> Some mentioned it could be considered a medium hold, while others indicated that their facial hairs were coarse and probably too strong to be held in place by anything but a firm hold wax.  </li>
            <li> A little pricey but worth it</li>
            <li> If you are a fine-mustachioed fella such as myself and have been plagued by other waxes pulling your hard-earned mustache hairs right out of the follicle before you can even complete your facial masterpiece....</li>
            <li> Too thick, very hard to apply/work with, which can lead more easily to clogged pores on the upper lip (if you&#x27;re at all prone to that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The wax itself is pretty stiff, I use a small fine comb to comb it in rather than scraping it with my finger as others have recommended.</li>
            <li> I have switched over to primary and secondary he</li>
            <li> I only have a 3 month old stache though, so I&#x27;ll return in about 6 months to a year to review again</li>
            <li> It keeps my moustache in place for approximately 30 minutes to an hour at the most, regardless of the application.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll determine how much better or worse this wax behaves with longer whiskers</li>
            <li> I like it well enough, but it is a little mild on the holding power.</li>
            <li> Ever since I grew out my moustache and began styling it in a slight, twisted handlebar, I&#x27;ve noticed great changes in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was hoping the handlebar stage wouldn&#x27;t last long due to not liking to get a face full of pomade like stuff when we kiss.</li>
            <li> will quickly learn how scrape a small amount from the surface of the container with your thumbnail, then place that wax between index finger and thumb and smush it together to melt and spread on just your fingertips.</li>
            <li> It certainly helped, but did not tame the hairs well, perhaps if I tried it for a few weeks it would have been trained</li>
            <li> This wax holds well, but I found it needed considerable warming before it became fluid enough to apply.</li>
            <li> Is a little sticky at first</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t discolor my beard, which the other one did, and seemed to have a decent hold.</li>
            <li> but, if you need a firm hold, it certainly does the trick.</li>
            <li> so it is a little hard to use as one might normally be able to...</li>
            <li> I was using Beardbrand wax before however the scent was a little too intense in my opinion for a mustache wax.</li>
            <li> but too bad the tin isn&#x27;t painted or a rugged sticker to allow for carry to always sport the logo as I think I have found a good wax.</li>
            <li> I sport what I call a Gunfighter Handlebar, which is like a regular handlebar that rides a little lower and doesn&#x27;t curl as high.</li>
            <li> The smell is close to neutral though, which is convenient unless you have a mustache in a place other than directly under your nose.</li>
            <li> I can get it to put my long whiskers up into a curly bare knuckled brawling mustache, but getting them to stay there for long is beyond this products capabilities.</li>
            <li> Check out High Life Heavy Pomade, I got this to have a change</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty hard and it takes getting used to heating it to make it softer for application.</li>
            <li> I have had a hard time getting a hold on a mustache wax that really does a solid job holding together throughout the day without having to apply enough</li>
            <li> I was looking for a gentle yet firm wax and this it!</li>
            <li> but it lacks in long lasting hold.</li>
            <li> One application is enough to hold my mustache shaped all day long.</li>
            <li> Not even close to as manly of a smell as the firehouse tacky will give you but the smell doesn&#x27;t last long anyways so</li>
            <li> Decent at first, but unfortunately does not hold well for me.</li>
            <li> I can see the wax not lasting very long because of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A mid-day second application frequently leaves flecks of dried wax all through my mustache.</li>
            <li> But at least it&#x27;s softer and we&#x27;re hopeful that in time, we can retrain his hair to grow sideways, instead of straight out.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend does have to apply it about twice a day though, it doesn&#x27;t hold for too long.</li>
            <li> and it stays put all day long.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s shape for long periods.  </li>
            <li> I work throughout the day and would likely be shown the door if I spent time reapplying wax in a pocket mirror.</li>
            <li> My mustache is fairly long (about 4 months of continuous growth), and I wear it in a handlebar.</li>
            <li> Lasts for as long as you don&#x27;t wash or rub it out.</li>
            <li> but if you have rough stubborn facial hair, over time it melts and doesn&#x27;t hold.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: A year or two later, trying to figure out how to make use of this wax, I melted down the wax and added almost equal amounts of coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I used to be a bit of a smart-ass, but now I find even the most ridiculous things I say are taken %100 seriously.</li>
            <li> Only negative is that my hairs don&#x27;t really stick to each other all that well; this may be b/c</li>
            <li> Fisticuffs wax offers a stiff hold, a touch of shine, and a lot of control.  </li>
            <li> Will stand up to a little fussing during the day, but if you do that much, probably need to carry a little with you.</li>
            <li> He has tried other mustache waxes in the past but found they didn&#x27;t hold very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to report that after several weeks of use and trying different methods of application (everything from single applications to applying multiple light coats to scraping out multiple BB sized globs and laying it on thick), this stuff doesn&#x27;t work well for me.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use it, and may experiment with other products at a later time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve long deserved!</li>
            <li> No issues about it coming open as one other has mentioned.</li>
            <li> he says it doesn&#x27;t hold for very long.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing fancy about my mustache, and the wax doesn&#x27;t seem to keep it where I want it for very long.</li>
            <li> The wax doesn&#x27;t seem to hold very long</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold very long.</li>
            <li> Overall great product, well thought out design vs a tube like clubman (which is a really terrible wax by the way.).</li>
            <li> but it is far too thick to be used on my facial hair without being visible</li>
            <li> /&gt;The cons are the hold is pretty poor.</li>
            <li> If tight, long lasting curls are your goal, look elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This will help keep my mustache from drooping down over my lips while I&#x27;m eating, but it doesn&#x27;t hold any styled shape very well, or at least not for very long.</li>
            <li> The heat of my face and breath was enough that it required reapplication every hour or less.  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend recently regret his handlebar mustache and had been using clubman previously however, in south Florida, it just didn&#x27;t hold up to the humidity.</li>
            <li> The center of my mustache loses its hold and droops down straight.</li>
            <li> My mustache is a stubborn bastard, I like to wear a relatively large handlebar above my beard, and sadly Fisticuffs wax just doesn&#x27;t hold up for me.</li>
            <li> I have a solid handlebar and it has been a tough experience finding a wax that not only provides a solid hold but also resists humidity.  </li>
            <li> so it looks like I&#x27;ve used some wet hair gel on my face.</li>
            <li> Ive never used this before and expected it to be basically butch wax.</li>
            <li> The wax is firm and takes some friction to get enough on my fingers to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not much hold</li>
            <li> I have to reapply to the center every 4 hours or so, or I develop &#x27;fangs&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Found myself re-applying this wax constantly to keep a firm hold.</li>
            <li> Was curious about the fisticuffs mustache wax.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just having a rough time training the stash,but we will keep at it .</li>
            <li> Carefully apply to the &amp;#34;main body&amp;#34; of your mustache, working it up and outward with both hands.</li>
            <li> IT DOES WORK for keeping your mustache out of your mouth but it will not hold a big handle bar, if they make a FIRM mustache wax</li>
            <li> I have a big, but not huge beard and mustache that I don&#x27;t style.</li>
            <li> main gripe is that the hold is rather weak on the thinner ends of the mustache, and needs a re-application every hour or so.</li>
            <li> Paired with a small comb this wax will for sure gets yours hard, or at least firm.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, use your Kent A81-T Extra Small Mustache and Beard Comb to put some definition in the part (center) of your mustache.</li>
            <li> And a little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> /&gt;-A little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little bit of this stuff goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> At first it was a bit difficult to dispense since the wax is harden in the tin, but I keep it in my front pant pocket</li>
            <li> The container is small enough that I forget it&#x27;s in my pocket.</li>
            <li> I might try some of the other brands out there to see how they stack up, but this worked for me.</li>
            <li> Have had butter luck with other brands.</li>
            <li> Works well, wears off a but quicker than I expected but it helps with the forming and the hair needs less of it as it gets used to the shape.</li>
            <li> However, the hold is medium to poor and you will need to re-apply multiple times a day to get your handlebars to actually stay up.</li>
            <li> My husband has a large handlebar mustache and was quite skeptical when I ordered him Fisticuffs Wax.  </li>
            <li> The wax is so hard i literally have to rub it for several minutes just to get some residue on my fingers.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to melt enough just by rubbing the pad</li>
            <li> My handlebar curls always fall down after 10 minutes of applying this stuff.</li>
            <li> I just bought this to make it lay down and off to the sides</li>
            <li> Take heed before you head down this path - it is not for the faint-hearted.</li>
            <li> ordered this wax for my boyfriend as he wanted to start training his mustache to go out to the sides instead of growing down into his beard.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try some of their other products!</li>
            <li> Other than thatI would say not to waste your time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Clubman, Firehouse, and a few other brands.  </li>
            <li> It has a lemon/citrus smell with slight hints of pine.</li>
            <li> My husband says it isnt firm enough for his really thick and course hair</li>
            <li> I can control my mustache with a half of a pea size amount</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it 4, but subtract that half star.  </li>
            <li> A helpful hint for first timers don&#x27;t be afraid to apply a lot of wax</li>
            <li> find to keep the tight tips i need re-application throughout the day with fisticuffs.</li>
            <li> It holds well but doesn&#x27;t stand up to a humid environment, also it can be a little tricky to mold with this product.</li>
            <li> and I have had some luck applying it to my goatee for a little added hold.</li>
            <li> I like this product, but just wish that it could be a little easier to apply.</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t hold and leaves little flakes in my husband&#x27;s mustache.  </li>
            <li> Not as tacky as I&#x27;d like and a little too greasy for me.</li>
            <li> It makes my boyfriends dad feel like a fancy pants with his fancy little tin and groomed stache.</li>
            <li> I would say it&#x27;s very average.  </li>
            <li> Looking forward to trying their other products!!</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> it holds firm and out of the way.</li>
            <li> as though you&#x27;ve got dried snot all over your mustache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ben waxing everyday since.  </li>
            <li> then I guarantee it will be a part of my everyday routine.  </li>
            <li> But as the weather cooled, it is too stiff, so I decided to give this</li>
            <li> This stuff is too stiff.</li>
            <li> Not too stiff.  </li>
            <li> Wax is too stiff to get out of the tin.</li>
            <li> Little tin is convenient and fits in the pocket and is slimmer than a small pocket knife.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ve not been applying it correctly or</li>
            <li> Not sure if that is intentional,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if anything is even coming off because it doesn&#x27;t seem to hold my mustache</li>
            <li> Not sure if this goes for all mustache waxes, but it seemed to wear off after an hour or two.</li>
            <li> Of the few waxes I&#x27;ve tried so far, this is by far the worst.  </li>
            <li> The only issue I have with this is that it takes a lot of wax and it is difficult to get out of the container if it is not melted.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> No more picky kisses...</li>
            <li> Has a very firm hold.</li>
            <li> Its a little tough to apply.</li>
            <li> I had to return the tin I ordered because it was too hard to get any wax out.</li>
            <li> The wax is extremely hard and it doesn&#x27;t even feel like anything is rubbing off on my fingers.</li>
            <li> I tried this stuff and found it to be way to hard to even get out of the tin.  </li>
            <li> My mustache wasn&#x27;t fully supported by this wax, at least not with the amount I&#x27;d like to put in.</li>
            <li> I found I had to use quite a bit of it to form my mustache tips into points, and even then the hair absorbs the wax and it gradually loses hold.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the middle of July too, not some cold arctic day.</li>
            <li> I was asked several times if I had a cold, because it looked as though I&#x27;d had a runny nose... &amp;#34;Greasy&amp;#34; is not a word I want associated with any part of my person, least-wise my face.</li>
            <li> Have to re apply at least 4 times a day.</li>
            <li> Does not hold at all, at least for a manly handlebar stache.</li>
            <li> Loses shape after 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have thick bristle stash tho</li>
            <li> Not too thick that it pulled my mustache</li>
            <li> I know I have really thick hair, and it&#x27;s been doing it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this an extra half star, but I&#x27;m ever so slightly disappointed by the softer hold.  </li>
            <li> and by all day I mean 9-5.....</li>
            <li> Waste of money!!</li>
            <li> The scent is subtle and pleasing.</li>
            <li> Very hard and hard to apply.  </li>
            <li> I find it to be on the harder side cold but</li>
            <li> This wax is really weak.  </li>
            <li> This was a pretty miserable experience.</li>
            <li> and I have a very thick mustache,</li>
            <li> Wax is too hard, and is difficult to get out and apply.  </li>
            <li> I guess it could be worse, and be overbearing.</li>
            <li> Worthless (by comparison, my &#x27;stache is short) and immediately returned.</li>
            <li> Poor design for container.</li>
            <li> I have a feeling that if you have a cheater stache, or thin hair, then this wax would probably work well.</li>
            <li> makes the stache softer, but not great hold.</li>
            <li> I stand behind GBS products 100%</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not really an option either though: the tin is too small to work with and smokes terribly when touched by flame.</li>
            <li> I know reapplying is recommended, but it is not ideal for me.</li>
            <li> let down :(</li>
            <li> Ever have one of those drunken nights where you order random stuff off of Amazon?  </li>
            <li> It took a few days of waxing to build up a sort of base layer of wax, but once I did...</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re sporting the handlebar like me, then you know how tiresome it can be to have to re-wax your stache as it gets droopy throughout the day.</li>
            <li> This product is too difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Really disappointing.</li>
            <li> I have crazy curly eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Maybe I have cold fingers</li>
            <li> It also flakes like a mad dog.</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> This stuff aint too bad.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed with this product ...</li>
            <li> I lost my sticker though :(</li>
            <li> Disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t taste awful</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It holds well but doesn&#x27;t stand up to a humid environment, also it can be a little tricky to mold with this product. It takes a bit before it gets going. But probably will buy again. Smells good, wish there were other options for smell.</li>
            <li> I was using Firehouse Wax during the summer here, because, massive heat. But as the weather cooled, it is too stiff, so I decided to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is much softer from the tin than Firehouse, which had me a little concerned, but it works great. Much easier to work in, and holds all day, no problem. Will stand up to a little fussing during the day, but if you do that much, probably need to carry a little with you.</li>
            <li> smells great! works well.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. I use a tiny amount each morning, holds the mustache off my mouth and lips. Pleasant smell, which is important for something that is right under your nose.</li>
            <li> Good hold for the curl on the ends but couldn&#x27;t handle keeping the center from straightening back out over my lip. Still the best I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> This is ok..The package is such that you will not want to put it in your pocket for use later in the day, you will find that your keys are full of wax.</li>
            <li> I thought this was going to hold It only holds For 5 minutes sculpts nicely but no hold to back it up I gotta find something stronger all in all let down :(</li>
            <li> perfect and fast shipping</li>
            <li> The wax I&#x27;ve using every day and it works well on holding my Stacie in place during the day.. I know I will buy more of this product. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> helps keep my stache under control, just don&#x27;t use too much. you need just enough</li>
            <li> This is a great product for keeping your stache in the shape you want it!  I just like to keep hair out of my mouth, keep a nice split at the center and this wax works perfect for that.  I&#x27;m sure it would be great for doing a handlebar based on how well it holds for me.  I really enjoy the scent as well!</li>
            <li> Wax is very hard to use, Holds great once you get some out of the tin, getting it out is the issue.</li>
            <li> what else could you ask for in a wax...strong hold great fragrance...all in a handy little tin you can fit effortlessly in your pocket</li>
            <li> My boyfriend didn&#x27;t really like it. he says it doesn&#x27;t hold for very long.</li>
            <li> Its a little tough to apply. I had to add a heat source to soften the wax. I probably would try something else though.</li>
            <li> first try with moustache wax</li>
            <li> Smells good and easy to take around. My boyfriend does have to apply it about twice a day though, it doesn&#x27;t hold for too long. First time buying moustache wax and if I had to purchase again I&#x27;d consider this product again only after trying others first. I had no idea which one to get and for the price and size it isn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ve not been applying it correctly or what but it is far too thick to be used on my facial hair without being visible and I have a very thick mustache,</li>
            <li> Do you have an unruly, misbehaving mustache? I did. That&#x27;s right.. did.... Fisticuffs helped me wax my &#x27;stache into submission. It is now at my beck and call. It does whatever I tell it to and it does so with a lemony scent. The wax itself is pretty stiff, I use a small fine comb to comb it in rather than scraping it with my finger as others have recommended. I found the finger method to be too lumpy on application. The wax holds for several hours but be prepared to have to reapply mid-day. The scent is subtle and pleasing. The tin is sturdy and sized well for pocket travel.</li>
            <li> I got this wax for my husband when he started growing handlebars and it definitely did not disappoint. The tin is a great size to carry in pants pockets even though he usually waxes his &#x27;stache before he goes to bed and it stays put all day long. He&#x27;s a construction worker, so that&#x27;s really no small order. Will definitely buy again when he runs out!  Great, great stuff!</li>
            <li> Smells great and works great!</li>
            <li> This wax smells great and set your stache like cement. Recommended for unruly handlebars.</li>
            <li> This is the first mustache wax I have used, and it was nice for the price but slightly disappointing. It has a great scent, comes in a convenient carrying tin that fits in your pocket, a fairly nice consistency but it lacks in long lasting hold. I style my mustache very simply, to keep it out of my mouth when I eat and so I  don&#x27;t chew on it through out the day. There&#x27;s nothing fancy about my mustache, and the wax doesn&#x27;t seem to keep it where I want it for very long. I have to re-apply wax through out the day just to keep it looking the way that I want. I am able to restyle my mustache just enough to keep it out of my mouth and out of the way when I eat, but other than that I have to use more wax. I can see the wax not lasting very long because of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very pleasant. It has a lemon/citrus smell with slight hints of pine. It&#x27;s very refreshing when you catch the scent throughout the day. The aroma itself if probably my favorite aspect of this wax. I&#x27;m reluctant to buy another wax so soon, for fear of not being able to find one with a scent as pleasing as this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wax is easy enough to retrieve from the tin. Just scrape the top of your fingernail across the wax to extract it. Once you have  the amount of wax you want, rub it between your index fingers or index and thumb to soften it a bit more. You then apply to your mustache and comb through. All you have to do is style it to your liking. But as I said before, the hold will weaken fairly quickly over time and you will have to reapply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all it&#x27;s a decent first time wax for someone who has never used any before. It&#x27;s soft enough that it wont cause you any real issues when applying it to your mustache, and has a very pleasant scent that will make it easier to make the decision to reapply. The tin it comes in is very convenient, and it&#x27;s priced very reasonably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to a first time wax user because of the price and the scent. Other than thatI would say not to waste your time.</li>
            <li> Smells ok....gr8 hold at first but doesn&#x27;t last more than an hr for me. I have thick bristle stash tho so maybe better for fine haired peep</li>
            <li> Too thick, very hard to apply/work with, which can lead more easily to clogged pores on the upper lip (if you&#x27;re at all prone to that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried treating it as a hot wax instead, using direct flame from a lighter. That&#x27;s not really an option either though: the tin is too small to work with and smokes terribly when touched by flame.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a gentle yet firm wax and this it! Nice smell and consistency overall a good product.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different waxes and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> Good quality wax, I ordered it in the winter time...so it is a little hard to use as one might normally be able to...I just warmed it up a bit with a heat gun that I had around the house just enough to use it.  I worked great.  I would definitely buy it again...</li>
            <li> Excellent medium hold wax. I reapply once during a shift</li>
            <li> Recently started training my mustache. I was using Beardbrand wax before however the scent was a little too intense in my opinion for a mustache wax. This is a good everyday medium hold wax with a light and pleasant scent. I am just starting the training as I mentioned so I may still need a stronger hold to get there but once you&#x27;re going this is a perfect choice.</li>
            <li> Awesome smell and great hold..make sure you check out their other products and make sure to buy a Kent comb for your stache (makes a big difference)</li>
            <li> This product is great for touch ups out in the world however I gave it four stars because I don&#x27;t use this wax as my main wax. Only for touch ups. Works great for what I need it for &amp; it&#x27;s perfect for travel &amp; everyday carry. Btw my main wax if you&#x27;re wondering is Clubs Man.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of hard, wish it were softer, (That&#x27;s what she said)</li>
            <li> This is the first mustache wax I have ever used. I like it well enough, but it is a little mild on the holding power. I guess it could be worse, and be overbearing. I will continue to use it, and may experiment with other products at a later time. But for now, this one is doing it for me.</li>
            <li> Not super happy with this. This was my first mustache wax and it did not seem to hold well. Also it was hard to warm up. It took a good bit to soften it between your fingers and tended to clump up in my mustache. I even tried my wifes blow drier to soften the wax, both in the tin and on my mustache. I felt like I had to constantly apply it every couple of hours and i could still not get things to stay put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all I would not recommend this wax.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite waxes!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this wax.  Before buying, I read the other reviews and many were saying that it wouldn&#x27;t hold for long. Some mentioned it could be considered a medium hold, while others indicated that their facial hairs were coarse and probably too strong to be held in place by anything but a firm hold wax.  Since my facial hairs are not coarse, but rather fine and manageable, I decided that I&#x27;d give this product a try.  I&#x27;m sorry to report that after several weeks of use and trying different methods of application (everything from single applications to applying multiple light coats to scraping out multiple BB sized globs and laying it on thick), this stuff doesn&#x27;t work well for me.  It keeps my moustache in place for approximately 30 minutes to an hour at the most, regardless of the application.  It seems to work as a decent conditioner and I have had some luck applying it to my goatee for a little added hold. I think it works better on my goatee for the simple fact that my chin doesn&#x27;t see nearly as much movement as my upper lip.  Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve had to come to the realization that, while using this wax, I can&#x27;t smile or eat anything without my moustache falling nearly as fast as if I had nothing on it at all.  Really disappointing.</li>
            <li> Its great can in time and everything but it doesn&#x27;t. Hold as well as I would like</li>
            <li> Fairly easy to apply (especially if it&#x27;s been in your pocket a few minutes prior, body heat is sufficient to make it softer), and the smell is pleasant (though a bit too strong).&lt;br /&gt;My main gripe is that the hold is rather weak on the thinner ends of the mustache, and needs a re-application every hour or so. On the thicker center of the mustache, it holds better and you can forget about it for some 3-4 hours. Applying a bunch more is not really an option because it will give your mustache a reflective sheen, which is particularly visible if you have a dark mustache like myself.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sufficiently happy with it that I bought another one while waiting to try the Firehouse brand - we&#x27;ll see how that goes.</li>
            <li> Great product, medium hold and notes of citrus in its fresh scent.  Would be a 5 star at a cheaper price point.</li>
            <li> This tin is much better for taking with you in your pocket, and the wax is delightful.</li>
            <li> I had to return the tin I ordered because it was too hard to get any wax out. Not sure if that is intentional, but I really could not use it.</li>
            <li> Great for stylin your &#x27;stache!</li>
            <li> Soft hold, quickly looses strength. Smells AMAZING, does what it&#x27;s supposed to but not for long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t buy again but that because I like a stronger hold. Would recommend to friends, just not for me.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed with this product ... The wax is extremely hard and it doesn&#x27;t even feel like anything is rubbing off on my fingers. The wax is so hard i literally have to rub it for several minutes just to get some residue on my fingers. I&#x27;m not sure if anything is even coming off because it doesn&#x27;t seem to hold my mustache well. I would not recommend this product</li>
            <li> Worked perfect...for about ten minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily it smells okay and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s important, right?  Not.  Worthless (by comparison, my &#x27;stache is short) and immediately returned.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. Clever packaging. Fun gift.</li>
            <li> Smells real good, kinda like lemons or another citrus, and makes the mustache easier to deal with</li>
            <li> Love this stuff easy to use cool container good price point and tames my wirey thick moustache</li>
            <li> Great wax, easy to use and mold, long lasting</li>
            <li> This stuff is too stiff. It&#x27;s the consistency of a candle. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. My husband has been looking for a way to keep up his mustache and change up his look a bit. The wax takes a bit to melt enough to be workable, but once you coat the mustache it holds firm and out of the way. Now my hubby is experimenting with all sorts of styles, his current favorite is the handlebar.</li>
            <li> I have had a hard time getting a hold on a mustache wax that really does a solid job holding together throughout the day without having to apply enough so it looks like I&#x27;ve used some wet hair gel on my face. This has been one of the better solutions for the job. I think my facial hair is extra coarse, however--the wax doesn&#x27;t hold for more than a couple hours and seemingly isn&#x27;t able to tame the most unruly, wispy hairs. The smell is close to neutral though, which is convenient unless you have a mustache in a place other than directly under your nose.</li>
            <li> The wax is easy to apply and get out of the tin. My mustache wasn&#x27;t fully supported by this wax, at least not with the amount I&#x27;d like to put in. It&#x27;s a good product, but I&#x27;m not sure if wax is for me...</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and comes with some nice extra&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Great hold and convenient tin for keeping in my back pocket for touching up the stache throughout long work days.</li>
            <li> I like this wax a lot. The smell is nice and doesn&#x27;t stay long but the hold does. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff aint too bad. Doesnt have a super strong hold but if i apply and wait a few mins and do a dab more it will keep the curl on my mustache pretty good. Like the smell of this too, has kind of a citrus auroma to it. 5 stars if it held a little bit better. All in all a good buy. .</li>
            <li> I like this product.  I used Clubman before, which was ok, but didn&#x27;t hold as well.  Clubman also seemed to dissolve more quickly if it became wet.  Fisticuffs holds better, I like the tin, it keeps in my pocket better and though water will affect it, it doesn&#x27;t dissolve as readily so it will hold if it is raining (as long as you don&#x27;t soak it).</li>
            <li> I have reasonably coarse mustache hair, and I am training my mustache to go into handlebars for the first time.  This is the first wax I have ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice consistency, and is easily removed from the tin with a fingernail.  (Just curl a bit onto your index finger and then swipe it off onto your thumb)  it has a very nice mild lemony smell with a hint of beeswax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the hold is really only a medium hold. I found I had to use quite a bit of it to form my mustache tips into points, and even then the hair absorbs the wax and it gradually loses hold.  It seems to do better in the main part of my mustache, helping it keep it&#x27;s shape for long periods.  I have found that I need to re-apply it throughout the day multiple times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 stars for excellent scent, low price and good quality, -2 for weaker than advertised hold on coarse hair and lack of staying power.</li>
            <li> I love this product thanks..</li>
            <li> I have a solid handlebar and it has been a tough experience finding a wax that not only provides a solid hold but also resists humidity.  I had fun applying this wax but was quickly let down after my curl came undone hours later after being active.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing I have found so far is simply holding gel.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it is tacky and holds well, the smell is so minimal that I do not even notice it after a few minutes and my wife finds it pleasant, I noticed a nice hint of lemon, This is not ideal for a beard, but my wild lip whiskers no longer tickle my nose....it lasts all day.....and by all day I mean 9-5.....I work a 12.5 hour day and probably could have used a touch up once....I have to say its wonderful and I hope that this review helps you.</li>
            <li> I like this product, but just wish that it could be a little easier to apply. It&#x27;s pretty hard and it takes getting used to heating it to make it softer for application. But once it&#x27;s on your facial hair, it holds pretty nicely throughout the day. You got to use a fair amount for it to hold the entire day, but I also like that it doesn&#x27;t turn your hair rock hard, and isn&#x27;t greasy. Good product.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what you think it is. It sticks and styles your mustache just the way you would want and expect it to! A helpful hint for first timers don&#x27;t be afraid to apply a lot of wax the more you apply the better you will be able to hold your mustache the way you want.</li>
            <li> Ever have one of those drunken nights where you order random stuff off of Amazon?  This was one of those purchases, and I do not regret it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product comes in an easily portable tin, perfect for on the go application.  A little bit of this stuff goes a long way!  Smells of lemon and ginger, which I personally like.  Can&#x27;t wait to try some of their other products!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It arrived very soon after I ordered it and it works great. Has a very firm hold. Perfect for a handlebar moustache. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for something they can apply and forget about.</li>
            <li> My first ever mustache wax. It has a decent smell and it seems to do the job. Not sure if this goes for all mustache waxes, but it seemed to wear off after an hour or two.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, and it has a nice smooth texture. I had hoped for a bit more hold though.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, this is only the second wax I&#x27;ve tried, the first being Clubman.  That being said, I do believe this is my permanent choice.  The shape of the tin, the ease of opening it (it slides open) and the ease of application alone make this a 5 star product.  That being said, the scent is a light lemon, quite pleasant, and the hold is pretty good, though not entirely stiff.  If a few hairs start going astray, it&#x27;s extremely easy to apply a tad more.  Even with a pretty coarse mustache that I&#x27;m still training, I&#x27;m quite happy with how well the product lasts.  With the Clubman, it seemed that after waxing once, 10% of the tube was gone, but this is a fraction of that.  This is a wonderful product and I will be a repeat customer once this tin finally runs out.</li>
            <li> It arrived sooner than expected and was as described for a great price. Ive never used this before and expected it to be basically butch wax. It is.</li>
            <li> Nice wax, easy container</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried only 2 to 3 brands of wax and by far this is the best. At first it was a bit difficult to dispense since the wax is harden in the tin, but I keep it in my front pant pocket and it &#x27;warms&#x27; it up and then the consistency is perfect. Next time I&#x27;ll order the lavender scent.</li>
            <li> good quality but did not work well on my mustache and beard.  It certainly helped, but did not tame the hairs well, perhaps if I tried it for a few weeks it would have been trained</li>
            <li> This is more natural hold so it acts similar to wax. It worked well for a curl as well as a more natural or brushed look. I love the smell and the nice application, especially when using a mustache comb. I don&#x27;t know how it will hold up in heat because it is a more natural. Overall great product, well thought out design vs a tube like clubman (which is a really terrible wax by the way.). Definitely will buy again.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t perfect, but it&#x27;s really good.  The hold doesn&#x27;t last as long as something like clubman, but it goes on more easily and can quickly be reapplied for touch ups.  I like that the tin easily fits in my back pocket.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s made from natural ingredients, smells nice, and is pliable. You can use just a little to keep yer stache in check from day to day or use a little more to get nice handlebars with pliable hold. I made the jump from Clubman&#x27;s to this and am very happy with it. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Stuff smells decent, as others have said, it smells like lemon. It is good at making the stache soft, but if you&#x27;re looking for something to hold a curl all day, look elsewhere. My handlebar curls always fall down after 10 minutes of applying this stuff.</li>
            <li> Awesome package for the price. Fits nicely in my pocket for on the go application. Came with a sweet sticker.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a mustache wax. I have a medium to fine mustache. I bought it so that I could keep from getting my mustache in my mouth while eating.  The wax doesn&#x27;t seem to hold very long and I&#x27;ve taken to carrying it with me so I can reapply as needed. As I said, this is my first time using the stuff so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare to. It has a pleasent, lemon scent that isn&#x27;t overwhelming. The container is small enough that I forget it&#x27;s in my pocket. The wax is firm and takes some friction to get enough on my fingers to use. I think this will be more effective as my mustache gets longer.</li>
            <li> This is a good wax but is a little light for my stiff stash.  I use it when I don&#x27;t want quite the stiffness of Firehouse wax.  Has a pleasant lemon scent.</li>
            <li> Best mustache wax I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> With so many waxes on amazon and no experience with any I depended on reviews alone to make a choice and it was the right one.  Fisticuffs wax offers a stiff hold, a touch of shine, and a lot of control.  And a little bit goes a long way so one tin would last most users a long time...  Good buy.</li>
            <li> Great stuff I am a 1st time handlebar Mustache guy and Fisticuffs is my 2nd wax I tried.  Works great but if it was clear so could not be seen that would make it perfect.  The stuff is like glue and holds well.  It washes out great.</li>
            <li> Grave before Shave. This stuff is great, subtle citrus scent. Holds all day.</li>
            <li> The shaping is great, the hold not so much.</li>
            <li> i use the lavender scented wax and pine scented beard oil and I&#x27;ve got shine and hold all day. Made right here in California too, you can&#x27;t beat that.&lt;br /&gt;Check out their website, the guy running the show has great style and backs a solid product.</li>
            <li> It took a few days of waxing to build up a sort of base layer of wax, but once I did... Ooooo girl! This made the ends of my stache look like scorpion tails! Just a quick scrape in the tin with a finger nail, and a smear down each side is perfect! Paired with a small comb this wax will for sure gets yours hard, or at least firm.</li>
            <li> So far, this is my favorite mustache wax. If you use a bit, you can get a soft hold without feeling like your mustache is caked in wax but, if you need a firm hold, it certainly does the trick. It&#x27;s easy to apply, pleasant aroma, and the tin size makes it perfect for keeping in my pocket.</li>
            <li> I have a petite handlebar mustache, and I have some big curls with it. Fisticuffs is an excellent wax, it comes with a great presentation (they gave me a free sticker), and a convenient flat tin that fits perfectly in my pants pockets. I will say though that this is not the firmest wax I have used, and if you are looking for a wax that will have super tight curls you should consider another wax. That aside, I highly recommend fisticuffs wax!</li>
            <li> Good product, exactly as I expected.  Though, they could include instructions on how to use it.  I had to youtube directions.  My husband loves it!</li>
            <li> Fisticuffs wax holds like crazy while smelling great! I wear it during the hot summer days i spend unloading tractor trailers and my handlebars maintain that perfect curl. Will definitely buy more when needed.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;d say this is a great product. It smells nice. It&#x27;s easy to use. It doesn&#x27;t leave waxy streaks in your mustache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish that it would hold my mustache in a curl. I have a very wiry, very curly mustache, and it just doesn&#x27;t seem to have the holding power that I need. It&#x27;s also very affected by heat, so if you live in a hot, moist climate, it might not control your frolicking face fur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that it works great for keeping the hair above my lip rather than in my mouth. It&#x27;s pretty much perfect for that. If I&#x27;m not looking for any fancy styling, this works great for keeping the hair out of my mouth. It&#x27;s also good for your mustache. Thor knows that we need all the conditioning we can for our manhood&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this wax, and I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if it could contain my copper wire stache, but it just doesn&#x27;t seem as if it can. I&#x27;ll come back and re-review once I get some more length (and some more training) on my mustache.</li>
            <li> If you are a fine-mustachioed fella such as myself and have been plagued by other waxes pulling your hard-earned mustache hairs right out of the follicle before you can even complete your facial masterpiece....well look no further! Whether you jockey a desk, enjoy blasting down hills on a bike at 65 khm, or sweat your you-know-what off in the gym all day, Fisticuffs Mustache Wax is the way to get your mustache through the day. But wait, there&#x27;s more! This stuff is workable right off the bat! Draw a bit of this wax onto your fingernail and work into your &#x27;stache&#x27; and you&#x27;ll immediately be immersed into a world laced with hints of lemon and cardamom. The hold Fisticuffs gives far outlives the cardamom heaven that now exists beneath your nose, but don&#x27;t fret it easily can be removed with a hot shower and a good old-fashioned bar of soap if need be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Subtext: Fine-mustachioed is not a self paying compliment, rather a grade of facial hair. If you are a coarse-haired individual well you may want to pursue a heavier wax.</li>
            <li> This wax is reasonably pliable with a nice, yellow color that applies clear, and I love the citrus smell. Now, I was lead to believe this wax maintained a decent hold on the stache, but I found the hold to be medium at best. The wax does not hold in the center at all, and after a couple hours, my curls start to droop (and that&#x27;s on a good day). I&#x27;ve read reviews that suggest this wax is great for those who are looking for a medium hold and those who only want to shape the stache, and I will agree to that. Once I notice my curls are drooping, I can&#x27;t keep my hands out of my face. I shape and pull and twist for the remainder of the day, and while I can&#x27;t say it maintains the hold I&#x27;m looking for, it does keep hair out of my mouth. I give it a 3 stars for presentation, color, smell, and cool factor (one of the coolest wax brands/logos I&#x27;ve seen). But I dock it 2 points for lack of hold for the length I have. I know reapplying is recommended, but it is not ideal for me. I work throughout the day and would likely be shown the door if I spent time reapplying wax in a pocket mirror. I recommend Wacky Tacky for an all-day hold with any style (curled handlebar or a pulled-natural look). I only have a 3 month old stache though, so I&#x27;ll return in about 6 months to a year to review again and I&#x27;ll determine how much better or worse this wax behaves with longer whiskers</li>
            <li> I have the hardest time getting any wax out of this thing and onto my stache. I&#x27;ve tried keeping it in my pocket to warm it up. Rubbing back and forth really fast. Nothing seems to make it easy. It&#x27;s the middle of July too, not some cold arctic day. Wish it rubbed onto my fingers more easily.</li>
            <li> First official mustache wax, I&#x27;ve been using hair gels and pomades. I love the tin it comes in it makes it easy to through in your pocket for maintenance on the go.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get this to hold longer than 2 minutes for the life off me. It also flakes like a mad dog. It&#x27;s a high price to pay for a tiny tin that doesn&#x27;t work and makes your face look like a wilted dandruff monkey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: A year or two later, trying to figure out how to make use of this wax, I melted down the wax and added almost equal amounts of coconut oil. While, their is likely even less hold than before, it no longer gives me booger-beard and leaves my mustache feeling nice and smooth. It&#x27;s not much hold but it does indeed give me more control than nothing.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product,very good!!!!!</li>
            <li> Decent hold. Citrus scent. Poor design for container. One day in my pocket and won&#x27;t stay shut. Check out High Life Heavy Pomade, I got this to have a change but I&#x27;m going back to High Life. Milder scent, strong hold.</li>
            <li> This product is nothing more than an example of creative re-packaging. This is NOT mustache wax, it is Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm in a tin that someone has put a &amp;#34;Mustache Wax&amp;#34; sticker on. Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm is $2.99 versus the $11.49 that I foolishly paid for this. It just makes one&#x27;s handlebar gleimous and flaccid. I was asked several times if I had a cold, because it looked as though I&#x27;d had a runny nose... &amp;#34;Greasy&amp;#34; is not a word I want associated with any part of my person, least-wise my face.</li>
            <li> Pleasant scent, easy to work with, not quite up to snuff for really hot weather. All-around a good product.</li>
            <li> This wax works awesome. Even on hot days. Very rarely do I need to reapply, and style in the afternoon, or evening.</li>
            <li> Works well, wears off a but quicker than I expected but it helps with the forming and the hair needs less of it as it gets used to the shape. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> WAX IT UP! Good Stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just use a hair dryer for 30 secs to a minute directly on it to make malleable/ pliable on the hi hot setting, then after applying with fingers &amp; mustache/beard comb, put hairdryer on cool setting &amp; blow on hair to set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When on the road or walking around, keep in pocket so stays warm enough or hit it with the hair dryer in a public restroom to get it pliable again</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT WILL BUY AGAIN.</li>
            <li> This wax is really weak.  It smells great, but won&#x27;t hold a curl longer than a few minutes.  Of the few waxes I&#x27;ve tried so far, this is by far the worst.  I prefer tacky Firehouse brand wax by far.</li>
            <li> At First I thought that this will last him about 2 days since it was so small. We got it probably a month ago now and it&#x27;s still got a lot left. It holds really well and spreads easily. It&#x27;s also not so greasy. I was hoping the handlebar stage wouldn&#x27;t last long due to not liking to get a face full of pomade like stuff when we kiss. I now get why he doesn&#x27;t like to kiss as much when I wear lipstick haha. Well this definitely solved that problem and I don&#x27;t care if he has that stash for the rest of his life.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, lovely lemon scent that is not at all overpowering. I have a coarse, wavy mustache, and this holds it well enough, and keeps the moustache out of my mouth -- the reason i started waxing it. It&#x27;s not sturdy enough for my hair to use for styling, and i need to reapply some after about 8h of wearing it. Does not stand up very well to humidity, but is a solid product that i&#x27;m glad to have among my styling and waxing options.</li>
            <li> A must read for new or experienced recruiters or anyone for that matter. A truly eye opening look at the world  of recruiting, it&#x27;s ups, downs, and best practices.</li>
            <li> Great citris scent and good hold. best i&#x27;ve used yet. Kinna want to try the Cock Grease?</li>
            <li> Wax is too hard, and is difficult to get out and apply.  Just does not work for me.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, this is my first mustache wax experience, so take this for what it&#x27;s worth. I sport what I call a Gunfighter Handlebar, which is like a regular handlebar that rides a little lower and doesn&#x27;t curl as high. This stuff seems to do the trick, although it takes a larger amount than I&#x27;ve seen used in some mustache wax demos. As others have said, it doesn&#x27;t last all day, but that seems like a lot to ask, especially for those of us in hot, humid climes. The price seems fair compared to what else is out there, it smells good, it comes in a neat little package, and that&#x27;s enough for me. I might try some of the other brands out there to see how they stack up, but this worked for me.</li>
            <li> Doesnt hold my stache no matter how much i put in.</li>
            <li> The wax smells good and is easy to apply. It doesn&#x27;t hold as strong as other waxes but will keep your &#x27;stash out of the way</li>
            <li> Works great... and will be even better with a bit more growth</li>
            <li> My husband has a giant beard and mustache. He has tried other mustache waxes in the past but found they didn&#x27;t hold very well. He had heard that Fisticuffs was pretty good and so I ordered it for him. He tried it and really likes it. It has a nice hold without looking and feeling too stiff. It has a nice woodsy smell. It came in the mail with a cool Fisticuffs sticker.</li>
            <li> This is a solid choice, but not a five-star product. First, the pro&#x27;s: it&#x27;s fairly cheap. That&#x27;s never bad. It has a fairly pleasant smell. It comes in a nice, slide-top tin, which tucks neatly into your pocket to carry around for touch-up applications. And, there&#x27;s the downside: you will need to reapply after a time. My mustache is fairly long (about 4 months of continuous growth), and I wear it in a handlebar. I have to reapply to the center every 4 hours or so, or I develop &#x27;fangs&#x27;. The center of my mustache loses its hold and droops down straight. However, this really isn&#x27;t unbearable, and it&#x27;s certainly better than what you&#x27;re likely to find in your local drugstore.</li>
            <li> Works good but a little too greasy, an I only used a small amount. I think it&#x27;s because you breath on it making it melt an turn to grease. But it does work so don&#x27;t get me wrong I like it an will be buying more, just not going to use it everyday.</li>
            <li> is not the same as the picture</li>
            <li> Works great holds well good product for your mustache.</li>
            <li> Disappointed! This stuff doesn&#x27;t hold and leaves little flakes in my husband&#x27;s mustache.  Very hard and hard to apply.  Waste of money!! Shells great though</li>
            <li> Smells lemony fresh. No good for holding but great for conditioning and a just little shaping.</li>
            <li> This wax holds well, but I found it needed considerable warming before it became fluid enough to apply. I used a hair dryer for about 3 minutes to warm it up and then it worked fine.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband&#x27;s handlebar. We live in Florida and his work takes him outside a lot- it holds for most of the day -- good stuff!</li>
            <li> It is a great mustache was. It is easy to apply and it has an instant hold. No need to wait until it sets. One application is enough to hold my mustache shaped all day long.</li>
            <li> This wax is very stylish. Comes in a cool tin with a cool old timey sticker. I also found the honey lemon scent quite nice. However, the hold is medium to poor and you will need to re-apply multiple times a day to get your handlebars to actually stay up.</li>
            <li> This is the best mustache wax if your a guy who means business. If you&#x27;re sporting the handlebar like me, then you know how tiresome it can be to have to re-wax your stache as it gets droopy throughout the day. With Fisticuffs, that&#x27;s not an issue. It&#x27;s a bit on the stiffer side of waxes, so it really does a superior job keeping your mustache in place. The tin is a fantastically portable size, and at nine bucks, you probably can&#x27;t afford not to get it. My last wax was from the Art of Shaving store, was an inferior product to Fisticuffs, and it set me back almost $30. Also, this wax has a great, but not overpowering, ginger scent that I, and more importantly my wife, find to be quite pleasant.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, holds well without making my stache hard.  Doesn&#x27;t taste awful, it&#x27;s inevitable that you&#x27;ll end up tasting it when you eat.</li>
            <li> Not as tacky as I&#x27;d like and a little too greasy for me. Doesn&#x27;t hold very long.</li>
            <li> It spreads easily by hand without the need of a comb, but the hold isn&#x27;t very good.  Found myself reapplying several times a day.  Smells nice.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t hold that well...</li>
            <li> First time growing an epic stache! This product applies well, and allows to to curl your whiskers or just have it look neat. Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Tin is about the size of a Wrigley 5 piece pack of gum. I have been using on my mustache for a couple of months now, and still have 75% left. Wax is a little difficult to warm up to workable consistency, but holds mustache shape great once applied! Smells like lemon. Very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> This product is simply the best, longest lasting wax for my classic handlebar look!&lt;br /&gt;Even when I go to work for a 10 he shift it holds up all day. Love this product and I do recommend it to ALL!! Lol</li>
            <li> Found myself re-applying this wax constantly to keep a firm hold. Nothing special, smells fine, nice appearance to the tin as well. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Makes your mustache the best mustache it can be.&lt;br /&gt;Gives it the confidence and pluck to do what needs to be done.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t appologize.&lt;br /&gt;Smells like a dream.</li>
            <li> I fell asleep with a curled mustache and i woke up with a only slightly less curled mustache which was easily fixed in a quick twist of the fingers. What more is there to say? Lasts for as long as you don&#x27;t wash or rub it out.</li>
            <li> My husband says it isnt firm enough for his really thick and course hair but hes also got grizzly bear hair.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do a good job for my course upper lip. Have to re apply at least 4 times a day.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it and our sons love the logo and keep the stickers. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Clubman, Firehouse, and a few other brands.  This goes on soft and has a medium hold.  Smells fantastic, a little woodsy mixed with lemon.  The tin is perfectly pocket-sized and surprisingly doesn&#x27;t open on its own.</li>
            <li> Nice smell with a medium hold. Could be a dash tackier, but it conditions well. Sometimes I use this as a nice starter &amp; I thicken the ends with something like the &amp;#34;Firehouse&amp;#34; wax...</li>
            <li> i was expecting to wax to keep my mustache down a bit better.  definitely have to reapply after 2 hrs.</li>
            <li> It did a decent job of keeping my longer mustache out of my mouth and swept to the side. Not a heavy hold though.</li>
            <li> Not terrible but if your doing a mans job and sweat you will have to reapply serval times a day. Have had butter luck with other brands.</li>
            <li> My husband has a large handlebar mustache and was quite skeptical when I ordered him Fisticuffs Wax.  He tried it and loves it.</li>
            <li> Fisticuffs Mustache Wax has allowed me to achieve the diabolical &#x27;Snidely Whiplash&#x27; look I&#x27;ve long deserved! The wax is easy to carry and dispense in its convenient metal case, allowing me to use just the right amount to achieve the well-groomed villain look I desire, without becoming a poster child for the &#x27;plastic &#x27;stache&#x27; movement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fisticuffs Mustache wax has a pleasing, but not-too-strong odor, and holds well. Further, it doesn&#x27;t gum up one&#x27;s facial hair. The &#x27;hold&#x27; does fade over time, but the easy-to-use case means touching up your &#x27;stache is a snap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Death before shave!</li>
            <li> go strong wax but dont expect to sculpt your stach once its on</li>
            <li> The wax was good but the quantity was not acceptable.</li>
            <li> I disagree with many of the reviews that state this has an excellent hold.  I would say it&#x27;s very average.  As others have stated, it does have quite a pleasant smell - unlike many other brands of wax.</li>
            <li> Smells good. Just the right amount of hold.</li>
            <li> A great product. My husband loves it. He has had a mustache for nearly 30 years now. Has never needed a wax til now cause of the white hairs he is now getting. The wax works perfectly for him and he only needs a little. A great product and price.</li>
            <li> Not sticky enough.  But, nice container and easy access.  Just not for curly hair.</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell.  Not too stiff.  Hold for me about a half day or more.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with mustache wax so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to....except for when I tried hair gel which didn&#x27;t achieve the required results. The tin has a cool design and gives you an old school feel even if you don&#x27;t like or need the wax. Its also compact so you can easily carry it with you, which may be necessary as you often have to reapply the wax to keep the hold. Its easy to use just take a fingernail sized amount out, rub it in between your fingers to warm it up, and then apply to your mustache. You&#x27;ll be the talk of the town as you walk through mainstreet with your newly groomed mustache.</li>
            <li> Does not hold at all, at least for a manly handlebar stache.</li>
            <li> took my a long time to knead into a substance i can use on my mustache, it was very dense</li>
            <li> good moderate hold, smells nice</li>
            <li> Great little tin for mustache march. Easier to warm than the large tins.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, but I will probably try another brand next time around.  I was not blown away by it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  Had handle bars for 40 years. Would not hold</li>
            <li> My husband likes this stuff.. Works great!</li>
            <li> First of all, this is the only wax I have used so far. It works ok, but doesn&#x27;t hold for very long in the heat and humidity of FL.</li>
            <li> This is a fairly soft wax.  If tight, long lasting curls are your goal, look elsewhere.  This wax is perfect for simply keeping things tidy though.  It smells of citronella.</li>
            <li> This wax is probably OK. It smells good and should work but I can&#x27;t get enough of it on my fingers to apply to my mustache. It is about the consistency of candle wax. So when I feel like taking the time to heat it up some way, I&#x27;ll give it another try but I don&#x27;t like to spend that much time fussing with cosmetics.</li>
            <li> Awesome hold, good smell, holds all day mostly</li>
            <li> This is my first foray into facial hair products, so I don&#x27;t have any baseline for comparison, but this wax has seemed like a pretty mixed bag. My mustache hair is pretty thick, pretty long, and pretty heavy, so maybe this was never the right product for me anyway, but it works great for maybe an hour, and then it doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will help keep my mustache from drooping down over my lips while I&#x27;m eating, but it doesn&#x27;t hold any styled shape very well, or at least not for very long. There&#x27;s a fine line between using just enough to get the job done and using too much, where the wax forms a kind of unsightly crust that makes it look as though you&#x27;ve got dried snot all over your mustache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the container, a round shape would be better for warming the wax up, and the container gets to looking pretty gross once it&#x27;s inevitably covered in waxy fingerprints.</li>
            <li> I never review products, but this one is too good not to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Convenient packaging allows you to easily carry this wax with you wherever you&lt;br /&gt;-Great scent, not too strong &amp; doesn&#x27;t smell like a wax&lt;br /&gt;-Powerful hold.  I&#x27;ve used a lot of hair products, and this one has the best hold by far&lt;br /&gt;-A little bit goes a long way.  I can control my mustache with a half of a pea size amount</li>
            <li> Great mustache wax.  Easy to apply, smells good and terrific hold.</li>
            <li> It makes my boyfriends dad feel like a fancy pants with his fancy little tin and groomed stache.</li>
            <li> my comparison to firehouse wax. I like the fisticuffs wax a lot.  people mention it has a kind of lemony piney smell to it. i know what your thinking, (pine sol?) well nope its not that at all so don&#x27;t worry. I would compare it to more of a lemon wedge cake. Its a clean smell. Not even close to as manly of a smell as the firehouse tacky will give you but the smell doesn&#x27;t last long anyways so who cares.&lt;br /&gt;The fisticuffs doesn&#x27;t quite hold my tips to the true rollie fingers tightness i sometimes desire. But I will often go for a less tight tipped imperial, best not to attract so much attention from the ladies. for this look I put the fisticuffs in before bed and its perfect the next day for an unwaxed look but still keeps the curls at bay.&lt;br /&gt;I find to keep the tight tips i need re-application throughout the day with fisticuffs. where the firehouse tacky I put in before i sleep and i don&#x27;t re-apply till it gets washed out.&lt;br /&gt;all around i&#x27;m happy to have both in my arsenal and i just alternate depending on my mood.&lt;br /&gt;good product.</li>
            <li> Too light and soft for my needs. Firehouse Moustache Wax</li>
            <li> Keeps the hair out of my mouth without issue!!  Still works after having a couple drinks!!</li>
            <li> Works great, smells great...keeps my stache out of my mouth while eating.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product which surpasses the former product he was using.  Great for shaping and holding his handlebar moustache.  He is recommending it to others.</li>
            <li> It works wonders and helps keep my husband&#x27;s new growth under control. I love this stuff and definitely recommend to anyone interested.</li>
            <li> Best wax for a strong hold. Moustache gets great comments. I would recommend it to anyone with a wide,heavy handlebar moustache.</li>
            <li> I love this product, wax isnt super sticky like others I have tried. Holds great. The best part about it is the smell. Has a light lemon smell to it. Absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is great for those unruly gray whiskers that try to get up your nose. The smell is good, and after you comb it in, it holds without being seen, no waxy film either. Not to mention the cool little tin that it comes in.</li>
            <li> First let me say, this wax smells amazing. I&#x27;ve received more compliments while wearing this product than most colognes I&#x27;ve ever used. That said... My mustache is a stubborn bastard, I like to wear a relatively large handlebar above my beard, and sadly Fisticuffs wax just doesn&#x27;t hold up for me. After about 15-20 minutes my proud handles started drooping and became a lopsided mess. I have a feeling that if you have a cheater stache, or thin hair, then this wax would probably work well. Give it a try, there is only one way to find out.</li>
            <li> good product.  makes the stache softer, but not great hold.</li>
            <li> Great product ,strong hold ,great scent  Fast shipping !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been growing my &amp;#34;epic beard&amp;#34; and needed something to style my whiskers. This is probably the better of the two waxes I have tried out. It didn&#x27;t discolor my beard, which the other one did, and seemed to have a decent hold. Will not turn your mustache to concrete, but it held decently enough. I was able to style my mustache and beard and have it stay for about half a day. I enjoyed the scent, too, which is kind of citrusy. I have very thick beard hair, but I was actually able to style it, which was surprising.The picture is of my beard after using Fisticuffs Wax.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have crazy curly eyebrows. After trying tons of gels and other products, this is the only thing I have found that can smooth them out.</li>
            <li> Works for a quick wax but didn&#x27;t have the holding power I was hoping for.  The heat of my face and breath was enough that it required reapplication every hour or less.  I keep it in my coat pocket for those times where I need a quick fix and don&#x27;t need it to last hours.  Scent is mild but refreshing lemon</li>
            <li> Lasts about 5 minutes</li>
            <li> Decent at first, but unfortunately does not hold well for me. I guess I am in need of a stronger product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a nice smell, but absolutely useless for stick straight hair like mine. Loses shape after 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Good hold for most of the day. I love the smell. I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Good item does what it was bought for. I would recommend it to my friends. I would by another one.</li>
            <li> Now this is how mustache wax is made,works great and has a pleasant lemon smell,very easy to use and carry around.</li>
            <li> Hold&#x27;s decent but if your mustache is unruly you may want a stronger wax. This smells better than most waxes. Also, the art work and design is really cool if you&#x27;re into that sort of thing.</li>
            <li> This product didnt hold for me, but the smell is much better than brother&#x27;s love. i just prefer the stiff hold of brother,s love</li>
            <li> Nice wax,  I give it 3-4 stars because I have found that I prefer a wax with the greatest holding power.&lt;br /&gt;The product is easy to  apply and has a pleasing scent, hold power is medium.</li>
            <li> I am still in the early stages of waxing my stache so take my review for what you will. I find the smell is very pleasing (smells citrus/lemon drop). I find it to be on the harder side cold but a ball/scrape between the fingers makes it workable quickly. Appealing tin but too bad the tin isn&#x27;t painted or a rugged sticker to allow for carry to always sport the logo as I think I have found a good wax. Washable has not been an issue so if you have been looking I suggest picking one up, you may just like it too!</li>
            <li> For the price, this is a very good mustache wax.  Maybe I have cold fingers but it&#x27;s hard to melt enough just by rubbing the pad so I have to scrape some off with my thumbnail and then rub it between my fingers to soften it up.  It smells great and seems to last for most of the day.  My only criticism is that I wish the hold was a bit more firm.  I have to reshape fairly frequently.</li>
            <li> It was bought as a gift for my son and he loves it.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have with this is that it takes a lot of wax and it is difficult to get out of the container if it is not melted.&lt;br /&gt;Once it is on the mustache it keeps the shape perfectly for the entire day.</li>
            <li> This is, as another customer has stated, a brick of Burt&#x27;s Bees chap stick for 5 times the price. This did not hold my mustache in place. No matter the amount I applied it would just fall right back down, and repeated combings would just make the top of my lip sore from all the hairs being pulled out. It also made my mouth feel scummy and sticky. This was a pretty miserable experience. DO NOT BUY.&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, I have found that the longer your hair gets, the easier it is to manage on it&#x27;s own. Just washing and combing it immediately after while it is still damp is the best thing. It is far more manageable throughout the day.</li>
            <li> work&#x27;s for what we use it for  we use it on our dog to keep hair out of his eye&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Starts softer and ends stiffer, I like this stuff, smells nice too. Just started the handle bar, but this was a great help.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. I haven&#x27;t much to compare it to except some captain fawcett but this stuff has a good hold that isn&#x27;t damaging to the stache, and the Tin is small enough to out in the coin slot of any pair of jeans for reapplication throughout the day. I will be buying again. Masculine ish smell, though it is not my favorite at all</li>
            <li> Was curious about the fisticuffs mustache wax. It works well for both mustache and beard, and even a dab in the part line on my hair. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews for many other products I decided to buy the Fisticuffs wax. I am really pleased with it. It smells good and works like it should. Little tin is convenient and fits in the pocket and is slimmer than a small pocket knife. No issues about it coming open as one other has mentioned. I am a repeat customer for sure!!! Recommend It for all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just having a rough time training the stash,but we will keep at it .</li>
            <li> absolutely the best! smells good and neutral color works great with my blonde &#x27;stach!</li>
            <li> The hold: excellent!  Whether i just use a little to keep the stache out of my mouth or go full on bareknuckle boxer, this stuff is great.  Rub your thumbprint on the surface if you just want a little, or use the top of your fingernail to grab a heartier portion to apply.  Holds all day and allows you to refresh your look.  It also smells great!  Like a honey/lemon drop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff, I think this will last a while.</li>
            <li> It did what I wanted. !!!!!!!!! ! It is colorless. Box is pocked handy. Perfect for very long mustache. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Smells good but not terribly easy to work with. Bought for my husband.</li>
            <li> Hubby loves it and it&#x27;s smells like fresh ginger. Works fast no need to over apply. Very happy w this product</li>
            <li> The pros for using this are that it smells great. Mostly a citrus smell. Of the several beard/mustache products I have, this is what you would want under your nose.The tin is easy to keep in your pocket with a small Kent mustache comb without being intrusive. It&#x27;s also easy to apply since it is very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons are the hold is pretty poor. I have a big, but not huge beard and mustache that I don&#x27;t style. I just bought this to make it lay down and off to the sides and it doesn&#x27;t manage to do that very well. If you add more wax it looks very greasy/clumpy even after being combed through well. A mid-day second application frequently leaves flecks of dried wax all through my mustache. If this were 25% or so more tacky it would be perfect. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again though. It would probably work well for shorter mustaches.</li>
            <li> Has a nice ginger fragrance the wife loves.</li>
            <li> Love the ease it goes on and love how it smells.  Just put it on so we will see how it holds up.</li>
            <li> It works great and it smells good like lemon.&lt;br /&gt;I love the way it fells on my mustache.&lt;br /&gt;I will definiteorder again.</li>
            <li> I bought this after the disaster that was Clubman&#x27;s. DO NOT buy Clubman&#x27;s unless your hair is white. I bought the neutral, but it leaves your mustache looking frosted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fisticuffs on the other hand, is great. You can get it out of the tin w/o running hot water over it, but it&#x27;s more manageable if you warm it up. Only negative is that my hairs don&#x27;t really stick to each other all that well; this may be b/c the hold isn&#x27;t freakishly strong, or b/c I have some untrained hairs or both. There&#x27;s no residue, it&#x27;s not messy, has a nice citrus smell, works all day long. Definitely would recommend and would buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS- tin slides open... rather easily. I wrap a rubber band around mine so it doesn&#x27;t open in my pocket.</li>
            <li> I even emailed Fisticuffs up and asked them how to apply wax.  Ben waxing everyday since.  Nice smell to it.  The cover gets really easy/loose to open after a week of use.  I suppose it&#x27;s the wax!  I need to take some pliers to it and close it up some.  The label has worn off after only ~2 weeks.  Overall, works for me.</li>
            <li> It is just bees wax.  There are similar products at Whole Foods that are cheaper.</li>
            <li> Gotta get more.  Love this stuff</li>
            <li> My boyfriend recently regret his handlebar mustache and had been using clubman previously however, in south Florida, it just didn&#x27;t hold up to the humidity. Fisticuffs has proven to be strong and his new favorite!!! It also smells lovely. Extremely satisfied with this product and would purchase again. Looking forward to trying their other products!!</li>
            <li> Great service. Works well.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best I have found. Application is so easy, I will be buying more .</li>
            <li> Been buying this brand for several months now, and have to say I love it! Works great on the handlebar curls.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, and softens my husbands mustache ... But we were hoping for something that would work like an 80&#x27;s hair gel - hold it in place.  This doesn&#x27;t.  But at least it&#x27;s softer and we&#x27;re hopeful that in time, we can retrain his hair to grow sideways, instead of straight out.</li>
            <li> Stuff holds good when you first put it on but if you have rough stubborn facial hair, over time it melts and doesn&#x27;t hold. Just acts more like a beard balm or something. Don&#x27;t have much experience with these things but this is my take on it. Has a gingery smell to it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold. Wax is too stiff to get out of the tin.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, like the styling ability, not so impressed by the hold duration.  I can get it to put my long whiskers up into a curly bare knuckled brawling mustache, but getting them to stay there for long is beyond this products capabilities.</li>
            <li> No more picky kisses...&lt;br /&gt;My wife is happy, so I&#x27;m kissin again :)</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product.  The smell is pleasing also.</li>
            <li> This is a great wax. Takes a little heating up to apply easily but it holds very strong, all day. Is a little sticky at first but that goes away pretty quickly. Definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I use this product daily and really like it a lot. It is ESSENTIAL if you have a large mustache and want to keep it looking fairly decent. I guess I use this 2-3 times per day, as needed. I have both the lavender and lemon scented, both are very nice.&lt;br /&gt;First, use your Kent A81-T Extra Small Mustache and Beard Comb to put some definition in the part (center) of your mustache.This only takes a moment.&lt;br /&gt;You will quickly learn how scrape a small amount from the surface of the container with your thumbnail, then place that wax between index finger and thumb and smush it together to melt and spread on just your fingertips. Carefully apply to the &amp;#34;main body&amp;#34; of your mustache, working it up and outward with both hands. Reapply as needed. Then, just comb the &amp;#34;part&amp;#34; center-point outward, just mildly, or you will remove wax and need to reapply. You will get the hang of it with practice. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I tried this stuff and found it to be way to hard to even get out of the tin.  I thought it should&#x27;ve been some what creamier.  I couldn&#x27;t get it to work for me.</li>
            <li> excellent product, great hold, great sent</li>
            <li> Got this for my boyfriend. His mustache smells great when I kiss him. He always has it in his pocket and constantly uses it, so I say it works.</li>
            <li> Nothing better for my foo man chu.</li>
            <li> Really nice smell medium hold definitely will buy again A+ I lost my sticker though :(</li>
            <li> This was my first mustache wax I ever tried. I didn&#x27;t have a reference point for the beginning but it was a great wax for me. Not too thick that it pulled my mustache but it helt it in place good. The size of the tin is comfortable in my pocket. now that I have a full-grown handlebar mustache I still carry this and use it on occasion. I have switched over to primary and secondary he can you handle bar it brand for a stronger longer hold. this stuff smells great/natural</li>
            <li> holds for about an hour, that&#x27;s it&lt;br /&gt;Will try something different next time</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, smears well, and stays put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells good too.  What more you want from your stach wax?</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. The smell is awesome.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold for very long, but overall good</li>
            <li> Doesnt hold all day unless you use a lot. Smells good though.</li>
            <li> It has a fresh lemon scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering. I wish it had a little bit more hold, but overall, it is good for any mustache enthusiast looking to shape the lip hair.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! I&#x27;m new to wax, so I can&#x27;t give too much of a great review, but I know I have really thick hair, and it&#x27;s been doing it&#x27;s job. Buy some. Oh, smells great, too!</li>
            <li> This is the best that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Not as much hold as Fireman&#x27;s Tacky.  But the odour is nice.  I wish I could give this an extra half star, but I&#x27;m ever so slightly disappointed by the softer hold.  Ah, hell.  I&#x27;ll give it 4, but subtract that half star.  ;-)</li>
            <li> Softer than I hoped for. Does not manage my whiskers well. Maybe it is the petrolatum jelly in it.</li>
            <li> I have been using GBS brand for over a year now and I am a part of the club on FB.  I have the bay rum scented mustache wax( bay rum package deal on their actual site) but I have also tried this one as well.  They smell great and are good for your whiskers but the hold is honestly not that great and I find myself reapplying on almost a bihourly basis.  I stand behind GBS products 100% but if your looking for somethin u can put in and forget about then its not the wax for you.  IT DOES WORK for keeping your mustache out of your mouth but it will not hold a big handle bar, if they make a FIRM mustache wax then I guarantee it will be a part of my everyday routine.  Best beard oils and bombs around hands down and the prices are awesome!</li>
            <li> Keeps my Mo under control. A little pricey but worth it (get what you pay for!)</li>
            <li> Looking for a clean sharp looking mustache? This is what you want. Scent is very mild and pleasurable. If you are new to this product please watch YouTube videos on how to use. The bead baron has a great how to video.</li>
            <li> Great for a Handle Bar Mustache. It doesn&#x27;t take much on the tip of your finger to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Got this for my grandpa for Christmas, it smells so good I can&#x27;t wait for him to use it! I&#x27;ll let you know what he thinks after he uses it.</li>
            <li> Its decent as far as wax goes. It can need reapplication after a while but overall is a solid product. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This mustache wax smells very good but is a very modest hold so unless your beard or mustache is naturally tame this might not keep it in place. But it does smell so good that I do like to keep using it on Oak Asian maybe if it&#x27;s just a quick groom or fix up for a short time.</li>
            <li> great product, works great!</li>
            <li> My son loves this wax</li>
            <li> Ever since I grew out my moustache and began styling it in a slight, twisted handlebar, I&#x27;ve noticed great changes in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kids, around 20 or so, now regularly call me &amp;#34;sir&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m 37. D*** right you call me &amp;#34;sir&amp;#34;, ya punks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve experienced a noticeable uptick in female attention, especially from ladies of diverse cultural backgrounds. Not sure what that&#x27;s about, honestly, but it is significant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;ve notice a great deal more respect and deference headed my way in the workplace, from superiors and colleagues alike. I used to be a bit of a smart-ass, but now I find even the most ridiculous things I say are taken %100 seriously. All the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, say what you will, but ALL of the above is true. Take heed before you head down this path - it is not for the faint-hearted.</li>
            <li> Love it. Good strong masculine scent.</li>
            <li> To start, it smells good. But the good news stops there...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is very solid wax. Even after warming it in my pocket, the wax still comes off in an amount that would be acceptable for maybe chapstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need to curl the ends of my mustache up for a play I&#x27;m in and in order to get enough wax out of the tin I have to scrape it out with my nails. I&#x27;m getting something else. This product is too difficult to use.</li>
            <li> ordered this wax for my boyfriend as he wanted to start training his mustache to go out to the sides instead of growing down into his beard. we both really love the smell of it and he seems pleased with how it feels in his mustache and how well it holds up.</li>
