            <li>I used this post workout and it felt amazing...</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing</li>
            <li>I use it on everyone&#x27;s neck more for the aroma and the consistency is good for massaging skin in that area.  </li>
            <li>The gel has a pleasant, non intrusive aroma, absorbs easily into the skin, and is helpful in reducing leg cramps.</li>
            <li>smell is very strong (tea tree).</li>
            <li>but as it warms under your hands, it is very easy to rub in and spread out.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried em all and this is by far the best!</li>
            <li>So happy to find it again as I just finished my first jar.</li>
            <li>but according to them the product is super good.</li>
            <li>but maybe that is a good thing, not unpleasant.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>I love this mineral cooling and pain</li>
            <li>/&gt;would love to have more, have recommend to my friend and family.</li>
            <li>It is uplifting for sure.</li>
            <li>and I love the smell :)</li>
            <li>Plus, I love how tea tree smells.</li>

            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>i love jason.  </li>
            <li>Happy so see it on Amazon for such a good price.</li>
            <li>many &#x27;thank you&#x27;s&#x27;.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used better.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll find more uses for it.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I am very happy that AmaZon is carrying this cooling gel as it is nowhere to be found around here as I have recently moved to this state.</li>
            <li>I had the tingling of a great big cystic nodule beginning (pleasant right?)</li>
            <li>Available through Amazon and many health-food stores.</li>
            <li>It does have quite a strong smell.</li>
            <li>Great alternative to the greasy &amp;#34;cool-heat&amp;#34; topical agents.</li>
            <li>i am being honest when i tell you this pain that i have had is intense and on the 1-10 pain scale..</li>
            <li>Not as good as the Natural Muscle Pain Therapy.</li>
            <li>Not really bad but strong.</li>
            <li>This is pretty good, it is a solid type of cream, so you use kind of a chunk of it</li>
            <li>Original Review, 2 stars:  </li>
            <li>I find it works best after a warm shower when the pores are open although just a gentle rub is enough for results or the product will produce a burning sensation.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>She says it helps to soothe stiffness and mild joint pain.</li>
            <li>THis seems to  relieve the pain of my mild arthritis in my hand.  </li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering, it smells a bit like vicks, and fades fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>Have always used this product and marvel at how quickly it takes the pain away.  </li>
            <li>ive been using this particular one for many years.</li>
            <li>Some mild odor but not unpleasant.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved and used Tea Tree products for years, then all the health food stores in town closed</li>
            <li>Get right to the pain.  </li>
            <li>my sisters are using this product and mom also liked the fresh smell and the product is working for them, not much for me</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t feel like this has very much in it.  </li>
            <li>The price was very reasonable so give it a try.</li>
            <li>I have a torn hamstring and am trying this stuff out for the first time.</li>
            <li>I soak in a steamy bath first then rub my shoulders and neck with this gel and then don my sleep shirt</li>
            <li>, you wouldn&#x27;t want it on large areas.  </li>
            <li>But overall this is my new favorite product</li>
            <li>so I was so pleased to find it on Amazon and even better it was half the price as the local store.</li>
            <li>and it really did help.</li>
            <li>&quot; but really it&#x27;s an ointment, like Vicks vapor rub.</li>
            <li>The ointment is very comedogenic, which exacerbates the problem.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li>Starts out cool/icy and then warms up the sore spot really well.</li>
            <li>It really relieves pain.  </li>
            <li>I purchase one 4 ounce jar every 6 months - which makes it very cost affective as well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t smell much tea tree</li>
            <li>because I know that is very medicinal</li>
            <li>It helps if you cover the area you just used it on to incubate it, if you don&#x27;t, you really can&#x27;t feel any difference.</li>
            <li>Not terribly greasy, but certainly not what I wanted since I bought this for my skin.</li>
            <li>the mainstream brands causes skin irritations, but this is absorbed by your skin more quickly and without the greasy irritating residue.</li>
            <li>i rub this on there chests and they breath in all the goodness that is in this (mainly the tea tree oil)  </li>
            <li>She highly recommends it.</li>
            <li>After daily use it has made a huge difference in Hubby&#x27;s dry, bruised and overworked feet.  </li>
            <li>I have one client about 80 years old who swears it helps her pain.</li>
            <li>She is 90 years old and has&lt;br /&gt;been</li>
            <li>I have yet to see if it will stop it completely, for those of you who suffer with cystic acne you know how stubborn they can be.</li>
            <li>i thought i&#x27;d burn threw a small jar pretty fast</li>
            <li>I have tried many prescriptions and other therapy with little or no relief.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Since it comes in a small tub, it&#x27;s easy to apply only what is necessary eliminating the issue with clearing the extra off your hands -- using water</li>
            <li>it hits a strong ten when it is at its worse.</li>

            <li> it hits a strong ten when it is at its worse.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite thing, when my kids have a cold</li>
            <li> I have used this product a long time.  </li>
            <li> It seems a bit, but not unexpected.  </li>
            <li> and I have yet to hear anything back other than rave reviews and</li>
            <li> I liked the cooling benefit, but unfortunately the screw cap on my jar was broken with it arrived, or I would have given it five stars.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this product due to the organic ingredients.  </li>
            <li> But, I can&#x27;t say that it does anything for pain other than with a placebo effect.</li>
            <li> Bought this to help with sciatic nerve pain, and has worked wonders for other things as well.  </li>
            <li> It helps with my knee pain and other aches.</li>
            <li> This gel is not too greasy and a little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> I little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> As for the smell, it smells like ben-gay, but that&#x27;s due to the methyl salicylate which is the active ingredient in products like these.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> The heat kicks in within a few minutes and is extremely therapeutic and relaxing.</li>
            <li> consistency is a little waxy like chapstick, but that doesn&#x27;t bug me.</li>
            <li> little while ago, I found another use for it.</li>
            <li> After a few months, the contents became chunky...</li>
            <li> Even tired it picks me up just to rub on hands and back of neck!Thanks</li>
            <li> Would probably call it a heavy cream.  </li>
            <li> I usually reorder two at a time, I might as well put it on automatic reorder.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, although it doesn&#x27;t fully absorb into your skin, leaving a slight coating on your skin, similar to sunscreen or bug repellent.</li>
            <li> Use it and go to bed and it will keep the pain away for at least 6 hours.</li>
            <li> And not as expensive as the other creams either!!  </li>
            <li> Frankly, I think the advertised brands are an expensive waste of money.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not overwhelmingly successful.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it feels greasy like petroleum jelly and that greasy substance remains on your skin after using it.  </li>
            <li> So, unfortunately, I had to throw the product away.</li>
            <li> After a brutal cardio week followed by leg day, my legs were in agony and I was having a hard time even navigating stairs.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my mother that suffers from arthritis pain.</li>
            <li> I was shocked</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> It is an oily base though</li>
            <li> He even says they don&#x27;t hurt as badly anymore!  </li>
            <li> It smell awful.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great for  pain  this is my second order !</li>
            <li> I buy this for my mother that suffers from arthritis pain. It helps a lot with the pain.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very strong (tea tree).</li>
            <li> Original Review, 2 stars:  It&#x27;s ok.  It works and smells similar to Ben-Gay.  I wanted to try this product due to the organic ingredients.  Unfortunately, it feels greasy like petroleum jelly and that greasy substance remains on your skin after using it.  Therefore, I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, 12/16/13, 1 star:  After a few months, the contents became chunky...there were hardened areas of cream.  I tried applying the cream, but the \\&quot;balls\\&quot; in the cream didn&#x27;t dissolve immediately.  So, unfortunately, I had to throw the product away.</li>
            <li> THE BEST STUFF!  Get right to the pain.  Try it you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li> Delivered on time. Disappointed. Did not meet expectation.  No pain relief for me or my mother what so ever.</li>
            <li> Does not work. I used it for a back pain and it did not help.</li>
            <li> Great alternative to the greasy &amp;#34;cool-heat&amp;#34; topical agents. This stuff does the trick really well without the harsh smell, nor chemical addictives often associated with Methol based sore-muscle ointments. It still has aild minty odor, but it doesn&#x27;t permeate thru an entire building and out onto the street... Since it comes in a small tub, it&#x27;s easy to apply only what is necessary eliminating the issue with clearing the extra off your hands -- using water w/the mainstream brands causes skin irritations, but this is absorbed by your skin more quickly and without the greasy irritating residue. I&#x27;ve tried em all and this is by far the best! Slightlyote exoensive, but you get what you pay for. Frankly, I think the advertised brands are an expensive waste of money.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product! Just had total knee replacement and all my muscles in my leg were sore.Jason&#x27;s soaks deep into the muscle and relieves the pain and spasms!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother for her osteoarthritis. She uses it on her knees and shoulders. She says it helps to soothe stiffness and mild joint pain. She highly recommends it.</li>
            <li> I love this mineral cooling and pain it&#x27;s good for my arthritis relieve the pain and gave me a good night rest.  It give relief from exercises  I am out and&lt;br /&gt;would love to have more, have recommend to my friend and family.</li>
            <li> Feels good, relaxes muscles.</li>
            <li> Very effective at relieving muscle pain. And not as expensive as the other creams either!!  Now watch the price go up in the coming months...........</li>
            <li> BEST STUFF EVER FOR ACHES AND PAINS !!!!</li>
            <li> I use this on my feet. Wonderful</li>
            <li> THis seems to  relieve the pain of my mild arthritis in my hand.  I can&#x27;t comment on sever condition.  Aroma is rather stronb but maybe that is a good thing, not unpleasant.  Does not absosrb away into the skin readily,this could be welcome or annoying depending on your needs.</li>
            <li> This works well on aches and pains, even those beyond muscle strains and soreness.  Use on limbs, back, hands or feet, wherever you hurt.  Some mild odor but not unpleasant.  Available through Amazon and many health-food stores.</li>
            <li> This is my go to product when i don&#x27;t have time for a massage. I find it works best after a warm shower when the pores are open although just a gentle rub is enough for results or the product will produce a burning sensation.&lt;br /&gt;For spot treatment this works!</li>
            <li> Not as good as the Natural Muscle Pain Therapy.</li>
            <li> I use their production last 15 years</li>
            <li> The smell is very nice, I use it on my clients and they always remark about the nice smell. It is uplifting for sure. But, I can&#x27;t say that it does anything for pain other than with a placebo effect. I have one client about 80 years old who swears it helps her pain. It could just be lifting her mood because it has an aromatherapy effect.  I use it on everyone&#x27;s neck more for the aroma and the consistency is good for massaging skin in that area.  It is an oily base though, you wouldn&#x27;t want it on large areas.  I don&#x27;t find it all that cooling either.  It does have aromatherapy benefits without a doubt and that indeed can reduce pain for people.</li>
            <li> After a brutal cardio week followed by leg day, my legs were in agony and I was having a hard time even navigating stairs. I used this post workout and it felt amazing...it smells like muscle rub but it wasn&#x27;t over powering and it really did help. I use it a lot LOL.</li>
            <li> I have a torn hamstring and am trying this stuff out for the first time. It works so well! Instant relief and I love the smell :)</li>
            <li> Amazon calls this \\&quot;tea tree oil gel\\&quot; but really it&#x27;s an ointment, like Vicks vapor rub. Not terribly greasy, but certainly not what I wanted since I bought this for my skin. The ointment is very comedogenic, which exacerbates the problem. I guess I&#x27;ll figure out a use for it, but if anyone knows of an actual tea tree oil gel product on Amazon, let me know.</li>
            <li> I have patellar femoral syndrome that causes my knees to give me loads of pain in the middle of my day. I use this all the time and it provides comforting relief. Plus, I love how tea tree smells.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best!! I use it for dryness, a good massage and so soothing! Even tired it picks me up just to rub on hands and back of neck!Thanks</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Bought this to help with sciatic nerve pain, and has worked wonders for other things as well.  After daily use it has made a huge difference in Hubby&#x27;s dry, bruised and overworked feet.  He even says they don&#x27;t hurt as badly anymore!  The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering, it smells a bit like vicks, and fades fairly quickly.  A little goes a long way, although it doesn&#x27;t fully absorb into your skin, leaving a slight coating on your skin, similar to sunscreen or bug repellent.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my mother and there is not a day she would go without it.  She says it helps with the pain in her joints.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing it works like a charm . I will definitely buy this product again. A Great Products!</li>
            <li> Love this for my sore muscles...hands and feet.  So happy to find it again as I just finished my first jar.</li>
            <li> this product is great for people with arthritis i have used it for years  i have psoriatic arthritis and i use this for  specific areas instant relief!!!!</li>
            <li> at good price and it doesn&#x27;t take much. i thought i&#x27;d burn threw a small jar pretty fast i use every night for about a month and still have 3/4 &#x27;s of a jar</li>
            <li> Have always used this product and marvel at how quickly it takes the pain away.  I recommend it without reservations.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I guess it is  gel. Would probably call it a heavy cream.  It does have quite a strong smell. Not really bad but strong.</li>
            <li> i love jason.  ive been using this particular one for many years.</li>
            <li> It smell awful. You would not use it and go to church. Use it and go to bed and it will keep the pain away for at least 6 hours.</li>
            <li> Works well on aches and pains. Starts out cool/icy and then warms up the sore spot really well.</li>
            <li> Soothes the burning neuropathy in my feet wonderfully!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom who swears by it. She is 90 years old and has&lt;br /&gt;been this using this for her aches and pain and gets great relief.</li>
            <li> I have used this product a long time.  It really relieves pain.  Happy so see it on Amazon for such a good price.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this for years.  Loves the product.  Relieves muscle pain</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! I will never be without. I am a massage therapist and I get quite a workout performing my job. In place of getting massage myself, I turn to my jar of Jason Tea Tree Oil Gel. I soak in a steamy bath first then rub my shoulders and neck with this gel and then don my sleep shirt (so the gel will not rub off on to my sheets) and then settle in. The heat kicks in within a few minutes and is extremely therapeutic and relaxing. This gel is not too greasy and a little goes a very long way. I purchase one 4 ounce jar every 6 months - which makes it very cost affective as well. I recommend this product to my clients (and friends and family) all the time to use between their sessions with me and I have yet to hear anything back other than rave reviews and many &#x27;thank you&#x27;s&#x27;. This is my favorite at home remedy for sore, tired and achy muscles and my nightstand drawer will always have a jar of my &#x27;Wonder Mud&#x27;!</li>
            <li> This is pretty good, it is a solid type of cream, so you use kind of a chunk of it but as it warms under your hands, it is very easy to rub in and spread out.  It seems a bit, but not unexpected.  I don&#x27;t smell much tea tree and I was hoping I would because I know that is very medicinal and I don&#x27;t feel like this has very much in it.  I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because it works but it&#x27;s not overwhelmingly successful.  It&#x27;s okay, I&#x27;ve used better.  The price was good, I&#x27;m going to keep it.  It helps if you cover the area you just used it on to incubate it, if you don&#x27;t, you really can&#x27;t feel any difference.</li>
            <li> my sisters are using this product and mom also liked the fresh smell and the product is working for them, not much for me but according to them the product is super good.</li>
            <li> I liked the cooling benefit, but unfortunately the screw cap on my jar was broken with it arrived, or I would have given it five stars.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my post workout sore muscles, and for that it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is a little waxy like chapstick, but that doesn&#x27;t bug me. As for the smell, it smells like ben-gay, but that&#x27;s due to the methyl salicylate which is the active ingredient in products like these.&lt;br /&gt;A little while ago, I found another use for it. I had the tingling of a great big cystic nodule beginning (pleasant right?) applying this took away the pain and slowed it&#x27;s progression. I have yet to see if it will stop it completely, for those of you who suffer with cystic acne you know how stubborn they can be. But overall this is my new favorite product and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll find more uses for it.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this for my family members who have muscle problems (muscle strains, arthritis, aches and pains) and they claim this is the best ointment they have ever used.  I usually reorder two at a time, I might as well put it on automatic reorder.  :)</li>
            <li> The gel has a pleasant, non intrusive aroma, absorbs easily into the skin, and is helpful in reducing leg cramps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved and used Tea Tree products for years, then all the health food stores in town closed so I was so pleased to find it on Amazon and even better it was half the price as the local store.</li>
            <li> I am very happy that AmaZon is carrying this cooling gel as it is nowhere to be found around here as I have recently moved to this state. This product is the only one I have found that soothes and relieves my fibromyalgia and bursitis!</li>
            <li> It helps with my knee pain and other aches.</li>
            <li> i got this not only for pain control but also as a product that would cause problems with my skin. It has a very pleasant scent. I little goes a very long way. I use a cotton ball or tissue to apply it.&lt;br /&gt;I have an area on my hip/pelvic area that has hurt for almost 6 years. I was told it is nerve damage and arthritis was to blame. I have tried many prescriptions and other therapy with little or no relief.&lt;br /&gt;I applied this to my hip and within about 20 min.. the pain was gone. I was shocked but then i applied it again at work when i was hurting and within about 15-20 minutes the pain was gone again.&lt;br /&gt;Now i am being honest when i tell you this pain that i have had is intense and on the 1-10 pain scale..it hits a strong ten when it is at its worse. I won&#x27;t review something i don&#x27;t believe in and I believe in this product.The price was very reasonable so give it a try.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite thing, when my kids have a cold i rub this on there chests and they breath in all the goodness that is in this (mainly the tea tree oil)  and i swear it helps with there stuffy noses and chest congestion!&lt;br /&gt;great on muscles too!</li>
            <li> It is the only thing that helps with my server leg cramps.</li>
