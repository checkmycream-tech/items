    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>What a great product!</li>
            <li>and I love it!!!</li>
            <li>For years I have been using the egg which worked great</li>
            <li>So happy I bought this.</li>
            <li>It feels great and makes me focus on an overlooked area.  </li>
            <li>The price was great - cheaper than on Clarisonic&#x27;s website.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been extremely happy with it.</li>
            <li>My wife has another Clarisonic product with great battery life.</li>
            <li>When I saw the Pedi in a store I figured it would be a good product</li>
            <li>But I am very pleased with the results - even though I&#x27;m not using it as I should.  </li>
            <li>The products that come with it really are awesome.  </li>
            <li>but this whole set together is wonderful.</li>
            <li>It is nice that it comes with it</li>
            <li>Excellent product, does what it is advertised to do, very surprised.</li>
            <li>The lotions and scrubs in the box are more effective than the Pedi.</li>
            <li>But for $200 it should do much more.</li>
            <li>I borrowed from a friend and it worked ok</li>
            <li>Love my clarisonic pedi set.</li>
            <li>I love how it cleans and scrubs my feet..</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>but there is many problem&lt;</li>
            <li>br /&gt;1- charger its work with my just 1 day and its not working any more</li>
            <li>I bought it for myself thinking it would be as impressive as the regular Clarisonic for faces.  </li>
            <li>After one use I can see the Diamancel product works much better than the Pedisonic.  </li>
            <li>But this Pedi brush is nothing more than a $200 paperweight.</li>
            <li>Nice for a quick pedicure.</li>
            <li>But after a week of use, it is going back: no improvement and frankly, I have better results using a pumice stone and a good foot cream (at a fraction of the cost, mind you!).</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m certain it will be a great item to begin to use on a consistent basis!</li>
            <li>It is fine for face.</li>
            <li>and it works fine -</li>
            <li>You would think it should make your feet smooth as silk.  </li>
            <li>While the brush feels great, the smoothing head buffs only the topmost layer of skin.  </li>
            <li>The clarisonic facial brush works amazing - a homerun!  </li>
            <li>we was familiar with the quality of the brand  </li>
            <li>We were not disappointed.</li>
            <li>This product is absolutely amazing my feet are baby soft.  </li>
            <li>have never had it run out during a pedi, even on the full 10-12 minute thorough days.</li>
            <li>I wanted this to be a really cool treat I gave myself.</li>
            <li>I purchased a Clarisonic full size scrubber as well.</li>
            <li>its quick to finish battery</li>
            <li>Yes, it is pricey, but Clarisonic is a good brand that lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I keep it plugged in between uses and charged it for the full 24 hours before first use.  </li>
            <li>I bought one and my teenage daughter loved it so much that I got one for her too.  </li>
            <li>She has used it once now, and in her own words, she is &amp;#34;very impressed&amp;#34; with the result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rechargeable device and its two snap on accessories can do three basic functions:  </li>
            <li>I own multiple Clarisonic products and this looks very much like a Clarisonic product.  </li>
            <li>(Clearly one of &amp;#34;My Favorite Things&amp;#34; sending it for a few of my girls..they will love it too!</li>
            <li>I am using it exactly as directed.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical but after 1 use, it was amazing!!!</li>
            <li>It works really well!  </li>
            <li>her feet are as smooth and soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li>As any product, you should always wait till they come out with the second one, it always has all the kinks tested &amp; taken out &amp; is usually a better product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not their product even though it looks exactly like the one my friend purchased from Macys, an authorized dealer.  </li>
            <li>Just be aware if you buy it here, no 2 year warranty.</li>
            <li>Stopped working during first use.</li>
            <li>So feet feel silky smooth for an evening, but major calluses are still there.</li>
            <li>I had dry heels as most people do.  </li>
            <li>My wife has had dry rough feet for years, and has her own collection of brushes, pumis stones, buffers, creams, etc, to keep them smooth.</li>
            <li>just one more product from Clarisonic that I can not live without!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Return authorization was just printed and its boxed up and ready to go.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m going to scrub off to much skin like I have with the egg.</li>
            <li>It works very well.  </li>
            <li>i really don&#x27;t now what to do</li>
            <li>but just about any scrub and lotion will work as well for a much cheaper price.  </li>
            <li>My feet are much softer than using a pumice stone alone.</li>
            <li>And for $200 - really?  </li>
            <li>but it looks like a real quality product</li>
            <li>She uses it very often and loves it.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I thought for sure that I had wasted my money</li>
            <li>Would recommend it to anyone interested in soft feeling feet.</li>
            <li>I think this foot transformation kit is highly overrated.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Especially living in Florida and living in sandles - this is an absolute necessity!!</li>
            <li>so far, it&#x27;s really unimpressive.  </li>
            <li>But if you add up the cost of the products, the device itself is only a fraction of what you&#x27;re paying for and it&#x27;s fun to use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After one session using the smoothing disc on rough dry patches, followed by the buffing brush with Pedi-Buff, and then Pedi-Balm cream, her feet were smoother than they had ever been using her own treatment.</li>
            <li>i need new charger and its on clarisonc site</li>
            <li>It was a waste of money and I have reverted to using my old pedi-egg and a pumice stick, which work infinitely better.</li>
            <li>They should have made it to fit the facial one, but of course, it&#x27;s all a money ploy to get you to buy a second one!</li>
            <li>I get better results from a plain old heel cream I buy at the grocery store for $8 a tube.  </li>
            <li>However, I used it as directed for over a week, and once the funk on my foot started to soften, I actually can really feel the vibration now!  </li>
            <li>Hubby bought this for me as a gift (with his Amazon account) and while I was excited to receive it, the device is definitely NOT worth the hefty price tag.  </li>
            <li>I fared only a little better with the brush head.  </li>
            <li>Once charged, I have had little success with this device holding a charge for more than a few minutes.</li>
            <li>The products are easy to use and sit next to my other clarisonic products</li>
            <li>Clarisonic clearly does not want to stand by their product.</li>
            <li>It was just over 1 year old and used perhaps 1-2 times per week.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.  </li>
            <li>She even went as far as to say Amazon or whoever is selling the product</li>
            <li>Despite following the directions to a &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; it didn&#x27;t do much of anything for my feet.</li>
            <li>After using it only once, my heels are so much softer.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;3- its good but not perfect</li>
            <li>Following directions with the included scrub and the wet brush attachment, my feet felt even more rough than before.  </li>
            <li>I have dry, cracked heels and was really hoping this would help me manage them.</li>
            <li>By the way, the device is easy to recharge: The very small charger attaches magnetically to the handle.</li>
            <li>Barely makes it through 1 cycle before it needs to be recharged.</li>
            <li>If fully charged, it won&#x27;t even last you using it one full round on your feet.</li>
            <li>This is expensive but worth it!!!</li>
            <li>They take a night to charge, and who wants to charge it every other day?  </li>
            <li>I certainly am less inclined to try any other HUGELY over priced Clarisonic products.</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is that a full charge only holds for approximately 18 minutes, so it does need to be charged more frequently than their facial brushes.  </li>
            <li>Though those first few battles may be lost, there&#x27;s a war to be won....  </li>
            <li>That foot looks *almost* normal, and the other one is a thing of beauty.  </li>
            <li>After a week of use, I really see little improvement.  </li>

            <li> That foot looks *almost* normal, and the other one is a thing of beauty.  </li>
            <li> After a week of use, I really see little improvement.  </li>
            <li> Plus at least for right now there&#x27;s a 60 day money back</li>
            <li> Does not last long enough to do one foot.</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers that the metal filing attachment is not nearly gritty enough, and I could not feel the &amp;#34;sonic vibrations&amp;#34; at all.  </li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I used to get little cracks on the back middle of my heel, but they&#x27;re gone now.</li>
            <li> I have really dry, cracked feet.  </li>
            <li> You can use the smoothing disc on dry feet, the buffing brush with Pedi-Buff cream for smoothing, and the buffing brush with Pedi-Boost peeling liquid.</li>
            <li> you can use it daily, 2-3x week or less than that.</li>
            <li> but better and in the end less expensive than a pedicure every few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Its effectiveness is minimal.  </li>
            <li> (and Amazon is just the fulfillment center) is &amp;#34;copying&amp;#34; their products and that is why it&#x27;s not working to my satisfaction.  </li>
            <li> i was so carefully with it</li>
            <li> It IS expensive, but definitely worth it to me.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I have to agree wholeheartedly with the other reviewers on the results of the Clarisonic Pedi Sonic Foot Transformation kit.  </li>
            <li> After reading other reviews about the Diamancel Diamond Foot Buffer #11, I thought I would try that.  </li>
            <li> The product was sold by Planet Beauty (an &amp;#34;authorized retailer&amp;#34;) through amazon, however Clarisonic was still unable to help.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think my horrible cracked feet would ever be able to become soft and they are on their way.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t throw it or fall down</li>
            <li> If you have calluses that are serious enough that you have considered this product, you might want to reconsider.  </li>
            <li> The system shuts down after a few minutes of use.</li>
            <li> Yes, it was a little pricey.....</li>
            <li> Sadly, it smooths rough areas on your feet only slightly.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with battery life</li>
            <li> naaaahhhh , waste of $</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;boost&amp;#34; may work well - I&#x27;m not sure.  </li>
            <li> And, it&#x27;s just one small instrument to store.</li>
            <li> The charger, being a flat oval, does not adhere well to the device and slides around, making contact difficult.</li>
            <li> This product stopped fully functioning a few months in but was still roughly getting the job done for a while until it stopped charging and was completely useless.</li>
            <li> Now if I could make myself take 10 or so minutes every day and use this but in today&#x27;s world of busyness, it is hard to do.  </li>
            <li> It is hard work, and often I pitch in to help.</li>
            <li> I posted a negative review on their website which was rejected and not posted.</li>
            <li> One of my feet was in reasonable shape, the other was an itchy, flaky, peeling nasty mess (sorry for TMI).  </li>
            <li> I try to use it, but it is next to impossible to leave something on your feet for 3 minutes and just keep your feet up - at least for me it is.</li>
            <li> know how when you&#x27;re a kid and want a toy really badly, and when you finally get it you think it was overhyped?  </li>
            <li> But even then, weak.  </li>
            <li> its only for us :(</li>
            <li> I suspect the ones with ridiculous battery life may be lemons and would hound Clarisonic for a replacement!</li>
            <li> If your feet are in BAD shape, it&#x27;s going to take longer for a product to work, and you have to keep up with it everyday.</li>
            <li> My feet are not in awful shape and I have to say that a pumice stone and scrub brush followed by some lotion would have given me the same results.  </li>
            <li> I got one for Mother&#x27;s day and was not impressed with the product.  </li>
            <li> Is Amazon selling fake products?  </li>
            <li> If you attempt to use it in the shower the battery runs out before you can finish - also an expensive product.</li>
            <li> Save your money.... not impressed.</li>
            <li> The battery life is very poor.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product and hardly ever use it as a result.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and an extremely disappointing one.</li>
            <li> Very expensive product for what I got out of it.</li>
            <li> Very expensive product.</li>
            <li> and I was so disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I am just really disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just so disappointed in this device.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> it, but have been very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Battery life is terrible.  </li>
            <li> And the battery life is terrible!</li>
            <li> Despite the awful reviews I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> I have horrible calluses on my feet.</li>
            <li> Terrible battery life.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s horrible.  </li>
            <li> While the product performs well, the battery life is horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Battery life is terrible.  Does not last long enough to do one foot.</li>
            <li> The charger, being a flat oval, does not adhere well to the device and slides around, making contact difficult. Once charged, I have had little success with this device holding a charge for more than a few minutes. Its effectiveness is minimal.  This was a gift and an extremely disappointing one. It was a waste of money and I have reverted to using my old pedi-egg and a pumice stick, which work infinitely better.</li>
            <li> This product stopped fully functioning a few months in but was still roughly getting the job done for a while until it stopped charging and was completely useless. It was just over 1 year old and used perhaps 1-2 times per week. I would not buy this product again simply because it does not function properly or hold a charge.  Very expensive product for what I got out of it.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews that were mixed (especially among Amazon users) but decided I wanted to try this anyway.  One of my feet was in reasonable shape, the other was an itchy, flaky, peeling nasty mess (sorry for TMI).  The first time I used it, I thought for sure that I had wasted my money and I was so disappointed.  I agree with other reviewers that the metal filing attachment is not nearly gritty enough, and I could not feel the &amp;#34;sonic vibrations&amp;#34; at all.  I fared only a little better with the brush head.  However, I used it as directed for over a week, and once the funk on my foot started to soften, I actually can really feel the vibration now!  That foot looks *almost* normal, and the other one is a thing of beauty.  The products that come with it really are awesome.  So what&#x27;s working, the products or the hand piece?  I probably could use a file with the products and get a similar effect.  But if you add up the cost of the products, the device itself is only a fraction of what you&#x27;re paying for and it&#x27;s fun to use.  I think you do just need to give it some time before assuming that it&#x27;s ineffective--don&#x27;t let the &amp;#34;gentleness&amp;#34; fool you.  Though those first few battles may be lost, there&#x27;s a war to be won....  Plus at least for right now there&#x27;s a 60 day money back guarantee if you order through Clarisonic, so doesn&#x27;t hurt to give it a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I have not had battery life issues with mine at all-- have never had it run out during a pedi, even on the full 10-12 minute thorough days. I keep it plugged in between uses and charged it for the full 24 hours before first use.  I suspect the ones with ridiculous battery life may be lemons and would hound Clarisonic for a replacement!</li>
            <li> so far, it&#x27;s really unimpressive.  And for $200?? You would think it should make your feet smooth as silk.  I am using it exactly as directed.  I had dry heels as most people do.  After a week of use, I really see little improvement.  I would not recommend this for the price.  Maybe for $40 as an exfoliator.  But even then, weak.  I am just really disappointed.  I get better results from a plain old heel cream I buy at the grocery store for $8 a tube.  I wanted this to be a really cool treat I gave myself. Instead I feel like I was ripped off. I certainly am less inclined to try any other HUGELY over priced Clarisonic products.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but after 1 use, it was amazing!!! I immediately bout one for my mom.  This is expensive but worth it!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, does what it is advertised to do, very surprised. Would recommend it to anyone interested in soft feeling feet.</li>
            <li> We have two Clarisonics here for the face - I bought one and my teenage daughter loved it so much that I got one for her too.  When I saw the Pedi in a store I figured it would be a good product and I put it on my wishlist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know how when you&#x27;re a kid and want a toy really badly, and when you finally get it you think it was overhyped?  Well, that&#x27;s my take on the Clarisonic Pedi set.  Hubby bought this for me as a gift (with his Amazon account) and while I was excited to receive it, the device is definitely NOT worth the hefty price tag.  Then when you look at the cost of the replacement brushes and scrub, well, it just has to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I charged the device and used as directed.  My feet are not in awful shape and I have to say that a pumice stone and scrub brush followed by some lotion would have given me the same results.  After the second use it needed to be charged.  They take a night to charge, and who wants to charge it every other day?  That&#x27;s ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Return authorization was just printed and its boxed up and ready to go.  I&#x27;m just so disappointed in this device.  Had it been 1/4 the price I might have kept it.  But for $200 it should do much more.</li>
            <li> I borrowed from a friend and it worked ok but then my mother&#x27;s pedicurist recommended a Dremel tool from the hardware store. I bought one. it is about $30.  It works really well!  Your husband can use it for his projects and you can change the head and use it on your feet. Save yourself the $170!</li>
            <li> M wife was always grinding on her feet with a pumice stone and never getting any results.  Since she has been using the Clarisonic her feet are as smooth and soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.  I saw no results and I feel totally deceived by Clarisonic&#x27;s claims about this product.</li>
            <li> I like the Clarisonic line, but this needs improvement. I&#x27;ve used it like recommend but have not seen the results they said I should. And the battery life is terrible! If fully charged, it won&#x27;t even last you using it one full round on your feet. As any product, you should always wait till they come out with the second one, it always has all the kinks tested &amp; taken out &amp; is usually a better product. They should have made it to fit the facial one, but of course, it&#x27;s all a money ploy to get you to buy a second one! Other than that, I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I have dry, cracked heels and was really hoping this would help me manage them. But after a week of use, it is going back: no improvement and frankly, I have better results using a pumice stone and a good foot cream (at a fraction of the cost, mind you!). I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love my clarisonic pedi set. For years I have been using the egg which worked great but this whole set together is wonderful. I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m going to scrub off to much skin like I have with the egg. So happy I bought this. Clarisonic hasn&#x27;t let me done yet!</li>
            <li> I got one for Mother&#x27;s day and was not impressed with the product.  I called Clarisonic to return the product under their 90 days customer satisfaction quarantee program 1-888-525-2747, option 2.  Quoting Clarisonic, &amp;#34;Amazon is not an authorized dealer of Clarisonic and so we can not honor the warranty or the money back guarantee policy.&amp;#34;  They claime it&#x27;s not their product even though it looks exactly like the one my friend purchased from Macys, an authorized dealer.  She even went as far as to say Amazon or whoever is selling the product (and Amazon is just the fulfillment center) is &amp;#34;copying&amp;#34; their products and that is why it&#x27;s not working to my satisfaction.  Has anyone heard of this before?  Is Amazon selling fake products?  I own multiple Clarisonic products and this looks very much like a Clarisonic product.  Just be aware if you buy it here, no 2 year warranty.</li>
            <li> The battery life is very poor. The system shuts down after a few minutes of use. It take hours to recharge. The lotions and scrubs in the box are more effective than the Pedi. Very expensive product. I purchased a Clarisonic full size scrubber as well. It is fine for face. If you attempt to use it in the shower the battery runs out before you can finish - also an expensive product.</li>
            <li> Despite the awful reviews I purchased this product. Despite following the directions to a &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; it didn&#x27;t do much of anything for my feet. Even the products that came with it were mediocre at best.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll have better results using a pumice stone in the shower than using this.</li>
            <li> Now if I could make myself take 10 or so minutes every day and use this but in today&#x27;s world of busyness, it is hard to do.  But I am very pleased with the results - even though I&#x27;m not using it as I should.  I didn&#x27;t think my horrible cracked feet would ever be able to become soft and they are on their way.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product and hardly ever use it as a result.</li>
            <li> I have really dry, cracked feet.  I got this for Christmas.  It works very well.  I don&#x27;t even use it every day.  The only complaint I have is that a full charge only holds for approximately 18 minutes, so it does need to be charged more frequently than their facial brushes.  Yes, it is pricey, but Clarisonic is a good brand that lasts a long time. I&#x27;ve had my face brush for well over 3 years.</li>
            <li> I have horrible calluses on my feet. This product is absolutely amazing my feet are baby soft.  Thank you Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> Just bought it. It feels great and makes me focus on an overlooked area.  The products are easy to use and sit next to my other clarisonic products</li>
            <li> Terrible battery life. Takes forever to recharge. Save your money.... not impressed.</li>
            <li> Stopped working during first use.</li>
            <li> My wife has had dry rough feet for years, and has her own collection of brushes, pumis stones, buffers, creams, etc, to keep them smooth. It is hard work, and often I pitch in to help. At her suggestion, I purchased this Clarisonic Pedi foot transformation kit as a Christmas present. She has used it once now, and in her own words, she is &amp;#34;very impressed&amp;#34; with the result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rechargeable device and its two snap on accessories can do three basic functions:  You can use the smoothing disc on dry feet, the buffing brush with Pedi-Buff cream for smoothing, and the buffing brush with Pedi-Boost peeling liquid. At any given time, each of the three processes can be used alone or in combination. All steps can be followed with Pedi-Balm cream for softening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After one session using the smoothing disc on rough dry patches, followed by the buffing brush with Pedi-Buff, and then Pedi-Balm cream, her feet were smoother than they had ever been using her own treatment. She is looking forward to using it on a regular basis, and give it a &amp;#34;thumbs up&amp;#34;. By the way, the device is easy to recharge: The very small charger attaches magnetically to the handle.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this branding she loves this product</li>
            <li> Everything as promised</li>
            <li> What a great product! I love how it cleans and scrubs my feet..just one more product from Clarisonic that I can not live without! (Clearly one of &amp;#34;My Favorite Things&amp;#34; sending it for a few of my girls..they will love it too!</li>
            <li> Companies can buy through clarisonic for 25.00 and for retail sells for like 75 dollars...not 200 plus dollars! Dont get scammed on this price!</li>
            <li> I think this foot transformation kit is highly overrated.&lt;br /&gt;I simply don&#x27;t like it.  I had read about it and wanted to&lt;br /&gt;try it, but have been very disappointed.</li>
            <li> i love it but there is many problem&lt;br /&gt;1- charger its work with my just 1 day and its not working any more i was so carefully with it i didn&#x27;t throw it or fall down but its stopped working&lt;br /&gt;2- its quick to finish battery&lt;br /&gt;3- its good but not perfect&lt;br /&gt;now i really don&#x27;t now what to do i need new charger and its on clarisonc site and they not accept my visa its only for us :(</li>
            <li> The price was great - cheaper than on Clarisonic&#x27;s website.  I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with battery life (I have plenty of time to do both feet with the scrubbie and the sander).  I don&#x27;t think I will reorder the lotion and the scrub stuff.  It is nice that it comes with it and it works fine - but just about any scrub and lotion will work as well for a much cheaper price.  The &amp;#34;boost&amp;#34; may work well - I&#x27;m not sure.  I try to use it, but it is next to impossible to leave something on your feet for 3 minutes and just keep your feet up - at least for me it is.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift and I love it!!! After using it only once, my heels are so much softer. There are different ways to use it...you can use it daily, 2-3x week or less than that. Definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have to agree wholeheartedly with the other reviewers on the results of the Clarisonic Pedi Sonic Foot Transformation kit.  I bought it for myself thinking it would be as impressive as the regular Clarisonic for faces.  Sadly, it smooths rough areas on your feet only slightly. Following directions with the included scrub and the wet brush attachment, my feet felt even more rough than before.  I just sent it all back for a refund.  After reading other reviews about the Diamancel Diamond Foot Buffer #11, I thought I would try that.  Only $50 instead of the $200 for Pedisonic.  After one use I can see the Diamancel product works much better than the Pedisonic.  And, it&#x27;s just one small instrument to store.</li>
            <li> I noticed a lot of people only tried this product for a week... maybe even once. If your feet are in BAD shape, it&#x27;s going to take longer for a product to work, and you have to keep up with it everyday. It says on the website that you&#x27;ll notice a difference in 2 weeks. I&#x27;ve been extremely happy with it. My feet are much softer than using a pumice stone alone. I used to get little cracks on the back middle of my heel, but they&#x27;re gone now. It IS expensive, but definitely worth it to me. Saves $30 a pop per pedicure!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s horrible.  I bought it for my wife and she returned it a week later.  It just doesn&#x27;t do anything - I don&#x27;t know what else to say?  It&#x27;s simply not aggressive enough.  Complete waste of money.  And for $200 - really?  The clarisonic facial brush works amazing - a homerun!  But this Pedi brush is nothing more than a $200 paperweight.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife. While the product performs well, the battery life is horrible. Barely makes it through 1 cycle before it needs to be recharged. My wife has another Clarisonic product with great battery life. When I contacted Clarisonic I was told they could not help me as I ordered the product through Amazon and not an &amp;#34;authorized retailer&amp;#34;. The product was sold by Planet Beauty (an &amp;#34;authorized retailer&amp;#34;) through amazon, however Clarisonic was still unable to help. I posted a negative review on their website which was rejected and not posted. Clarisonic clearly does not want to stand by their product. I have contacted Planet Beauty, hopefully they will help. I would never buy another Clarisonic product again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for myself; however, I havent used it yet but it looks like a real quality product so I&#x27;m certain it will be a great item to begin to use on a consistent basis! Especially living in Florida and living in sandles - this is an absolute necessity!!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my wife.  She uses it very often and loves it.  She had the clarisonic face brush so  we was familiar with the quality of the brand  We were not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how well this actually worked. No issues with it holding a charge.  Yes, it was a little pricey.....but better and in the end less expensive than a pedicure every few weeks.  For those with callous issues....this is a must buy!</li>
            <li> naaaahhhh , waste of $</li>
            <li> Nice for a quick pedicure.</li>
            <li> If you have calluses that are serious enough that you have considered this product, you might want to reconsider.  While the brush feels great, the smoothing head buffs only the topmost layer of skin.  So feet feel silky smooth for an evening, but major calluses are still there.</li>
            <li> This was a birthday present and it worked well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,</li>
    </ol>
