            <li>Love everything about this!</li>
            <li>It has great flavor &amp; a nice light tint of color...wears quickly &amp; isn&#x27;t all that moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>It is very lightly tinted which is what I prefer.</li>
            <li>and I loved them so much I bought more!  </li>
            <li>Love it Love it</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s probably cause of the cinnamon it contains (: overall very great and plumping!</li>
            <li>I soon saw why we had so many satisfied customers.</li>
            <li>balm works better.</li>
            <li>I love this balm.</li>
            <li>OH MY GOSH, I LOVE THIS ONE TOO</li>
            <li>, I AM SO GLAD</li>
            <li>I love Hurrah products, but this one is a bit too &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34; for me.</li>
            <li>Love all of the flavors.  </li>
            <li>I am a cinnamon fiend, so of course I love this lip balm.</li>
            <li>Smells great with a nice texture and sheer tint that can be made darker just by applying more layers.</li>
            <li>so that is good and it moisturizes well, but has  a very oily look.  </li>
            <li>It was okay, nothing really special.</li>
            <li>Is light weight and</li>
            <li>Plus, the tint is quite light; so, one can wear it without its being too noticeable.</li>
            <li>This lip balm smells and tastes fantastic.</li>
            <li>Coconut oil is a fabulous moisturizer...</li>
            <li>Overall, really LOVE this product!!  </li>
            <li>The flavor is great, I love that it&#x27;s raw organic,</li>
            <li>I love the shape and they are very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>These lip balms are super.</li>
            <li>First of all, I hatethe way it smells!</li>
            <li>the lip-feel and consistency is lovely, and it makes my lips SUPER soft.  </li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s all organic, vegan, natural, etc.</li>
            <li>I noticed that our customers kept coming back for more.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t like this product!</li>
            <li>and this is pretty close in color</li>
            <li>It has the right amount of cinnamon taste, strong enough to notice but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I do love that the tube is sort of flat and fits in a pocket well.</li>
            <li>(the description mentioned that may happen, so I wasn&#x27;t caught off guard) but on subsequent uses, I really didn&#x27;t have any sensation except creamy smooth cinnaminy balm.  </li>
            <li>The cinnamon is warming but not irritating.</li>
            <li>Also the color is very shiny but without much tint at all</li>
            <li>Love the flavor and slight lip tint</li>
            <li>After a few exercises in self-control, I stopped licking it off and enjoyed the scent and the shear tint</li>
            <li>So I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product if you have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>I love the cinnamon, but there is a little bite to it when you put it on, it&#x27;s not bad, but if you are not expecting it you might be a little surprised!</li>
            <li>super moisturizes my lips,  a little expensive though but is worth it! :)</li>
            <li>This tinted lip balm did not have quite enough color for me but is very moisturizing</li>
            <li>The color with the cinnamon balm is not as saturated as the  black cherry, and the cinnamon has a bit of a bite to it that was not expected.. not unpleasant, but</li>
            <li>but the Hurraw is actually moisturizing, the complete opposite of the Burt&#x27;s lip shimmer.</li>
            <li>I admit that the first use (cinnamon flavor) was a little bit too tingly,</li>
            <li>my lips are super smooth throughout this dry, cold, snowy winter.</li>
            <li>Black Cherry balm so much that I ordered the cinnamon.</li>

            <li> perfect for winter lips with just a hint of color</li>
            <li> Best lip balm ever. The shape is a bonus.</li>
            <li> Love it Love it Love it!!!!! Is light weight and super moisturizes my lips,  a little expensive though but is worth it! :)</li>
            <li> Amazing! Feels so good and it tingles a bit! After a while my lips get chapped again, but it&#x27;s probably cause of the cinnamon it contains (: overall very great and plumping!</li>
            <li> A couple years ago we began selling Hurraw! Lip balm in our shop. I noticed that our customers kept coming back for more. So, I decided to try it myself. I soon saw why we had so many satisfied customers. I&#x27;ve used other brands of lip balm in the past to keep from having chapped and cracked lips . The Hurraw! balm works better. I especially like the cinnamon balm. It has the right amount of cinnamon taste, strong enough to notice but not overpowering. Plus, the tint is quite light; so, one can wear it without its being too noticeable. An added benefit is that it is entirely organic.</li>
            <li> Does nothing for my lips, a waste of money, I am saying.</li>
            <li> Goodness gracious, I wasn&#x27;t actually expecting it to have a FLAVOR!! They always say that about the scents, but this actually TASTES like cinnamon--sweet cinnamon!! After a few exercises in self-control, I stopped licking it off and enjoyed the scent and the shear tint it gave my lips. I love this balm. Seriously, good buy, here or on the site (where it&#x27;s cheaper.)</li>
            <li> OH MY GOSH, I LOVE THIS ONE TOO, I AM SO GLAD THAT I ORDERED THIS ONE IN CINNAMON AS WELL, VERY GOOD STUFF FOR YOUR LIPS!!! THANK YOU!!!</li>
            <li> This lip balm smells and tastes fantastic. The cinnamon is warming but not irritating. It is very lightly tinted which is what I prefer.</li>
            <li> This tinted lip balm did not have quite enough color for me but is very moisturizing so I will use it like chapstick.</li>
            <li> It was okay, nothing really special. Ended up throwing it away.</li>
            <li> Great for people who like cinnamon. I love Hurrah products, but this one is a bit too &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34; for me.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like this product! A total waste of money! First of all, I hatethe way it smells! It makes it unbearable to wear! Also, it stings my lips and irritates them! So I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product if you have sensitive skin! Also the color is very shiny but without much tint at all and it isn&#x27;t moisturizing, instead, it&#x27;s drying and irritating!&lt;br /&gt;Over all! I want my money back and I stopped using it after I tried it a couple of times...</li>
            <li> Love the feel and smell!</li>
            <li> it burns....ouch!!!! won&#x27;t buy this flavor again</li>
            <li> My sister in law bought me the Hurraw lip balms for Christmas and I loved them so much I bought more!  I love the cinnamon, but there is a little bite to it when you put it on, it&#x27;s not bad, but if you are not expecting it you might be a little surprised!</li>
            <li> I loved the Hurraw! Black Cherry balm so much that I ordered the cinnamon. The color with the cinnamon balm is not as saturated as the  black cherry, and the cinnamon has a bit of a bite to it that was not expected.. not unpleasant, but really not  something I like.  I&#x27;ll stick with the Black Cherry from now on. I do love that the tube is sort of flat and fits in a pocket well.</li>
            <li> Love the flavor and slight lip tint</li>
            <li> Hurraw is the best lip balm with the added benefit of being organic.  Arrived as scheduled.  Love all of the flavors.  Love it!</li>
            <li> The color is very sheer so that is good and it moisturizes well, but has  a very oily look.  Looks like you have smeared oil on your lips, which is not very good.</li>
            <li> I am a cinnamon fiend, so of course I love this lip balm. I have been using Burt&#x27;s Bees nutmeg lip shimmer and this is pretty close in color but the Hurraw is actually moisturizing, the complete opposite of the Burt&#x27;s lip shimmer.</li>
            <li> Love everything about this! Smells great with a nice texture and sheer tint that can be made darker just by applying more layers. Love that it&#x27;s all organic, vegan, natural, etc., so when it inevitably ends up in my body, as all lip products do, I don&#x27;t have to worry about toxins. Coconut oil is a fabulous moisturizer...my lips are super smooth throughout this dry, cold, snowy winter. Well done, Hurraw! Thank you!</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!  I admit that the first use (cinnamon flavor) was a little bit too tingly, (the description mentioned that may happen, so I wasn&#x27;t caught off guard) but on subsequent uses, I really didn&#x27;t have any sensation except creamy smooth cinnaminy balm.  The flavor is great, I love that it&#x27;s raw organic, the lip-feel and consistency is lovely, and it makes my lips SUPER soft.  Overall, really LOVE this product!!  Came back to order other tasty sounding flavors!</li>
            <li> These lip balms are super. I love the shape and they are very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It has great flavor &amp; a nice light tint of color...wears quickly &amp; isn&#x27;t all that moisturizing.  I do like it &amp; I will buy it again.</li>
