            <li>a very good buy for the money!</li>
            <li>They can&#x27;t improve on the BEST!</li>
            <li>Perfect!</li>
            <li>at 10 times the price but amazing results !!</li>
            <li>Makes my hair beautiful and shiny with one swoop.</li>
            <li>Great for the non-professional.</li>
            <li>Surface still in great shape after years of use.</li>
            <li>Product works great,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll bet this is just as good as the CHI</li>
            <li>I loved my conair because it gave my hair that perfectly straightened hair (you know where you hair always seems to land in the right place whenever it moves).</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how much I love it!</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I was loving this until the 5th time I used it</li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t even warm after running the straightener through it.  </li>
            <li>I love it and am most saddened by the fact that my sister took it to college!</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m here today to buy my own :)</li>
            <li>And even though I just bought this one, I&#x27;m asking my parents for a better one for</li>
            <li>but it works way better than this.</li>
            <li>It is cheap for a reason!</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>They were ok for the money ...</li>
            <li>I would much much more recommend the 16 dollar conair ceramic 2 inch straightener, my roommate has it</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I have had a very great experience with this flat iron.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to handle too.</li>
            <li>The thermal protection of the spray along with the ceramic plates, gets your hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I use it almost everyday to shape/curl my hair, and it has been wonderful.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have an indicator for when it reaches the setting it&#x27;s set for, just a light to indicate that it&#x27;s on.  </li>
            <li>; wide, the cord swivels as I use it, and best of all, the switch and dial are situated in the right place.</li>
            <li>I purchased this straightener when I lost my original one moving.  </li>
            <li>I am pretty sure it&#x27;s damaging my hair</li>
            <li>Right into the sink!</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly - fits well in the hand.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair super frizzy.</li>
            <li>It does not get nearly hot enough to do a good job of straightening the hair at all.  </li>
            <li>I turned it on to try it for the first time and it never worked!</li>
            <li>but I blame that more on my hair than the flat iron, as my hair easily tangles.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t enjoy too much heat on my hair, ended up giving to my niece</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>This product heats quickly and works pretty well for me.  </li>
            <li>, my hair is naturally very straight.</li>
            <li>Heats really fast too!</li>
            <li>I have this exact product, and although I bought it somewhere else, I just have to share my experience with people who are interested in buying it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does NOT take 60 seconds to heat up, but once it does (after 5-10 minutes), it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I will admit that my hair is fairly straight naturally, so I can&#x27;t attest to how well it works on really thick or curly hair, but it works perfectly for me.</li>
            <li>I bought one of these straightening irons several (many?)</li>
            <li>and i must say, it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>works really well!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say if you want quality and are willing to pay a few more bucks go for the conair!</li>
            <li>I did appreciate the seller willing to refund my money as soon as they received it, I did not appreciate however paying for the return shipping that was $7.00 to NY when the iron itself was $16.00, really defeated the purpose almost.</li>
            <li>Please do your self a favor and just pay extra money to get a good quality flat iron.</li>
            <li>and I really like this one.</li>
            <li>my roommate, who has the same one, likes hers and it was cheap.</li>
            <li>and I tried using this one, it would take days to really straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>it doesnt even get your hair straight.</li>
            <li>and it gets my hair sooo straight even in the humidity of florida</li>
            <li>and it works real well with my hair.</li>
            <li>but that doesnt bother me too much.</li>
            <li>i tried curling my hair with it and that doesnt work too well either cuz it pulls too much.</li>
            <li>I never liked them as much as my good ol&#x27; RV062.  </li>
            <li>It is a good product but use it minimal else it will damage hair if u use it on a daily basis</li>
            <li>Instead they sent me another Revlon brand flat iron with very cheap make which naturally did not work as I</li>
            <li>Long cord for easy handling.</li>
            <li>Revlon really does make decent hair products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how the product performs as far as hair straightening, but it makes sealing mylar bags super easy!</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, so maybe this is why, but the sucker gets HOT HOT HOT.</li>
            <li>decent product, does what it is required to do</li>
            <li>but for 20$ it gets the job done and if you treat it right it lasts for a pretty long time.</li>
            <li>It and my daughter dues it every day well worth the price.and if i ever need anotyher one i will come back to you</li>
            <li>So for the moment I&#x27;m considering purchasing one of the more expensive hair straighteners which in the long run are better investments than buying several relatively cheap ones like this one.</li>
            <li>so i kept bugging my dad to buy me a new one</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have this iron exactly, but mine is Helen of Troy, which is the same company, and it looks identical and has identical features.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough even on the highest setting after 15 minutes and my hair always gets caught between the plate and the plastic</li>
            <li>The size, not too long, the ceramic plates just right at 1&amp;#34</li>
            <li>My hair&#x27;s only a little wavy and responds well to most irons and products.</li>
            <li>Clearly a design flaw.</li>
            <li>I have owned this one for 8 years and used it quite frequently (3-4 days/wk).</li>
            <li>-dry my hair straight and only use the iron for the ends and to give my hair a nicer finish, but the darned thing won&#x27;t even do that, now keep in mind that my hair isn&#x27;t by any means unmanageable it is only loosely curled and healthy since i&#x27;ve never permed it dyed it or anything of the sort.</li>
            <li>i got this flat iron not know much about straignters</li>
            <li>It is small, but it reaches closer to your head, although bigger irons cover more hair at a time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The temp is either too high or too low</li>
            <li>Also, my hair doesn&#x27;t stay straight for very long and my bangs never seem to straighten correctly with this one.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t get as hot as i thought and left my hair super dry, not real ceramic and the plates aren&#x27;t long enough for longer hair.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve purchased a couple of the newer ones to leave different places where I stay frequently.</li>
            <li>one little flaw the plastic cap that hides the screw broke right away</li>
            <li>It consistently heats up to the highest setting (25) in less than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>my old flat iron just died on me</li>
            <li>The item I received was not the Revlon Professional flat iron.</li>
            <li>I have had it for 4 years, and there is not a single chip in the ceramic plating.</li>
            <li>I have very frizzy, wavy  hair and by passing it slowly through the shaft of hair, you can get your hair board straight.</li>
            <li>Because of this, I waste so much time!  </li>

            <li> Because of this, I waste so much time!  </li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron on a whim, because the $80 one I bought at my local beauty supply shop literally singed all of my bangs off.</li>
            <li> This one simply does not get hot enough to straighten my medium length, thick, and wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair, it&#x27;s currently the only flat iron I have, and it takes several swipes to get it moderately straight.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never gotten it actually flat with this iron, just \\&quot;styled\\</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve now bought GHD flat irons ...</li>
            <li> My other one was the exact same size and straightened my hair in less than half the time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this iron for a very long time, but that might just be because i refuse to use it.</li>
            <li> it will only work if you have really thin and straight hair.</li>
            <li> Such a disappointment, since it was super pricey.</li>
            <li> , the only problem with that one is that after repeated use it can damage hair a little.</li>
            <li> So while it was cheap and it straightens my hair, I desperately miss my conair.</li>
            <li> Curious to know if these were still being sold anywhere, I went online.  </li>
            <li> And I have never had any of the problems that other posters listed about hair getting caught in between the plates.</li>
            <li> However, for whatever reason, this iron makes my hair feel very rough</li>
            <li> If you have thin or short hair, it might work, but I would still suggest trying a different product.</li>
            <li> The plates are not real ceramic and after a few uses the \\&quot;ceramic\\&quot; coating starts to peel off.</li>
            <li> That one somehow broke in half in my dorm room.</li>
            <li> I know that the chi might be a little over priced</li>
            <li> there are some flaws, like it does crimp my hair a little</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to say it works almost as well as a very expensive version.</li>
            <li> My daughter has had to buy three in a year due to failure of the heating elements.</li>
            <li> It burned out immediately and was not able to use it.</li>
            <li> Not pleased.</li>
            <li> so in the mean time i had to borrow my step mothers</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t heat up enough even on the highest setting (freakin&#x27; 25!), which makes straightening hair VERY difficult.</li>
            <li> Very painful, and very damaging to hair.</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed with this iron (and the smaller travel one).</li>
            <li> I found it very hard to use&lt;br</li>
            <li> This flat iron is crap.</li>
            <li> It is a very poorly made product and does not deliever.</li>
            <li> It does well for now, since I have nothing else, but seriously DONT BUY THIS!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the hair iron because at the moment that I heat smell so bad</li>
            <li> expected.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> This straightener is horrible.</li>
            <li> and i hated it!!!</li>

            <li> Dear sr  I don&#x27;t like the hair iron because at the moment that I heat smell so bad and I can&#x27;t use</li>
            <li> I have about 6 different irons and I really like this one. It&#x27;s really easy to handle too. I have very frizzy, wavy  hair and by passing it slowly through the shaft of hair, you can get your hair board straight. I also use a heat spray and that makes it even easier. The thermal protection of the spray along with the ceramic plates, gets your hair silky smooth. a very good buy for the money! Heats really fast too! Revlon really does make decent hair products.</li>
            <li> Before I bought this straightener I has a conair. I loved my conair because it gave my hair that perfectly straightened hair (you know where you hair always seems to land in the right place whenever it moves). That one somehow broke in half in my dorm room. Then I bought this one cause my roommate, who has the same one, likes hers and it was cheap. While, it does straighten my hair, it doesn&#x27;t give my hair that straightened look. Also, my hair doesn&#x27;t stay straight for very long and my bangs never seem to straighten correctly with this one. So while it was cheap and it straightens my hair, I desperately miss my conair. And even though I just bought this one, I&#x27;m asking my parents for a better one for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my hair is naturally very straight. I think if I had curly hair and I tried using this one, it would take days to really straighten my hair. I&#x27;d say if you want quality and are willing to pay a few more bucks go for the conair!</li>
            <li> I have this exact product, and although I bought it somewhere else, I just have to share my experience with people who are interested in buying it. &lt;br /&gt;It does NOT take 60 seconds to heat up, but once it does (after 5-10 minutes), it works pretty well. It reaches on those places where bigger irons don&#x27;t, however the reason that has made me decide to return it is that there&#x27;s a tiny gap between the plates and the plastic part on the inner end of the plates, so my hair kept getting caught in there! Very painful, and very damaging to hair.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t last long. My daughter has had to buy three in a year due to failure of the heating elements. Clearly a design flaw.</li>
            <li> This straightener is horrible. It doesn&#x27;t heat up enough even on the highest setting (freakin&#x27; 25!), which makes straightening hair VERY difficult. Such a disappointment, since it was super pricey. (I got it on a whim at Target.)</li>
            <li> It is a very poorly made product and does not deliever. The plates are not real ceramic and after a few uses the \\&quot;ceramic\\&quot; coating starts to peel off. It does not distribute heat evenly and actually ends up burning your hair. Please do your self a favor and just pay extra money to get a good quality flat iron. I know that the chi might be a little over priced but it works way better than this.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron on a whim, because the $80 one I bought at my local beauty supply shop literally singed all of my bangs off. Plop! Right into the sink! So I refused to spend a lot of money on a replacement. I have owned this one for 8 years and used it quite frequently (3-4 days/wk). It finally bit the dust, so I am here to buy the same one again. That&#x27;s how much I love it! It consistently heats up to the highest setting (25) in less than 2 minutes. Makes my hair beautiful and shiny with one swoop. And I have never had any of the problems that other posters listed about hair getting caught in between the plates. I will admit that my hair is fairly straight naturally, so I can&#x27;t attest to how well it works on really thick or curly hair, but it works perfectly for me.</li>
            <li> I was loving this until the 5th time I used it and it just didn&#x27;t turn on. It is cheap for a reason!</li>
            <li> I purchased this straightener when I lost my original one moving.  BIG MISTAKE.  My other one was the exact same size and straightened my hair in less than half the time.  This one simply does not get hot enough to straighten my medium length, thick, and wavy hair.  My hair isn&#x27;t even warm after running the straightener through it.  Because of this, I waste so much time!  If you have thin or short hair, it might work, but I would still suggest trying a different product.</li>
            <li> LOVE It and my daughter dues it every day well worth the price.and if i ever need anotyher one i will come back to you</li>
            <li> This flat iron is crap. I have thick hair, it&#x27;s currently the only flat iron I have, and it takes several swipes to get it moderately straight. I&#x27;ve never gotten it actually flat with this iron, just \\&quot;styled\\&quot; I guess. It does well for now, since I have nothing else, but seriously DONT BUY THIS!!!</li>
            <li> Works just like it should. Heats up quickly - fits well in the hand. Great for the non-professional.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these straightening irons several (many?) years ago locally.  The size, not too long, the ceramic plates just right at 1&amp;#34; wide, the cord swivels as I use it, and best of all, the switch and dial are situated in the right place. Revlon has fancied up this model over the years and I&#x27;ve purchased a couple of the newer ones to leave different places where I stay frequently. I never liked them as much as my good ol&#x27; RV062.  Curious to know if these were still being sold anywhere, I went online.  When I discovered they were, I ordered several. It&#x27;s never been on the shelves of the places I shop in recent years.  I wish Revlon would bring it back and promote it.  They can&#x27;t improve on the BEST!</li>
            <li> They were ok for the money ... i&#x27;ve now bought GHD flat irons ... at 10 times the price but amazing results !!</li>
            <li> I bought this iron after my stylist had one almost identical to it. I LOVE IT! It is small, but it reaches closer to your head, although bigger irons cover more hair at a time. I don&#x27;t have this iron exactly, but mine is Helen of Troy, which is the same company, and it looks identical and has identical features.  I love it and am most saddened by the fact that my sister took it to college! I want to buy another of this iron.</li>
            <li> i got this flat iron not know much about straignters and i hated it!!! it doesnt even get your hair straight. it will only work if you have really thin and straight hair. but it takes 15 minutes to heat up then once you use it for 5 minutes you have to wait for it to heat up again. now im think about getting a FHI.</li>
            <li> I have had a very great experience with this flat iron. I&#x27;m willing to say it works almost as well as a very expensive version. My hair is fine, so maybe this is why, but the sucker gets HOT HOT HOT. I have had it for 4 years, and there is not a single chip in the ceramic plating. I use it almost everyday to shape/curl my hair, and it has been wonderful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this iron for a very long time, but that might just be because i refuse to use it. It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough even on the highest setting after 15 minutes and my hair always gets caught between the plate and the plastic handle usually resulting in ripping my hair out, on top of everything it doesn&#x27;t even work because i usually blow-dry my hair straight and only use the iron for the ends and to give my hair a nicer finish, but the darned thing won&#x27;t even do that, now keep in mind that my hair isn&#x27;t by any means unmanageable it is only loosely curled and healthy since i&#x27;ve never permed it dyed it or anything of the sort. I would much much more recommend the 16 dollar conair ceramic 2 inch straightener, my roommate has it and it gets my hair sooo straight even in the humidity of florida, the only problem with that one is that after repeated use it can damage hair a little. So for the moment I&#x27;m considering purchasing one of the more expensive hair straighteners which in the long run are better investments than buying several relatively cheap ones like this one.</li>
            <li> This product is not getting the job done. It does not get nearly hot enough to do a good job of straightening the hair at all.  I wish you would get  the V063, I would buy 5 of them.</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed with this iron (and the smaller travel one). My hair&#x27;s only a little wavy and responds well to most irons and products. However, for whatever reason, this iron makes my hair feel very rough and it just doesn&#x27;t seem to work. It&#x27;s billed as being \\&quot;ceramic\\&quot; but the plates are low-quality. I am pretty sure it&#x27;s damaging my hair and I regret trying to save money with this crappy iron!! Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> Perfect! Heat rapidly and adjust to temperature you need. Surface still in great shape after years of use. Long cord for easy handling.</li>
            <li> my old flat iron just died on me so i kept bugging my dad to buy me a new one but he refused to buy one over 80$. so in the mean time i had to borrow my step mothers and i must say, it works pretty well. she&#x27;s had it for years and it works real well with my hair. there are some flaws, like it does crimp my hair a little but that doesnt bother me too much. i tried curling my hair with it and that doesnt work too well either cuz it pulls too much. but for 20$ it gets the job done and if you treat it right it lasts for a pretty long time. i&#x27;m here today to buy my own :)</li>
            <li> It is a good product but use it minimal else it will damage hair if u use it on a daily basis</li>
            <li> I love it it&#x27;s worth it. I will buy another but it will be in the 2 inch size.&lt;br /&gt;Ok</li>
            <li> Justamente la descripcion del producto, sin daños ni atraso en el envio, todo perfecto :D&lt;br /&gt;Lamento escribir en espanol, estoy trabajando mi ingles</li>
            <li> works really well! Does not burn my hair, it makes it shine. The product arrived on time and I use it often.</li>
            <li> This product heats quickly and works pretty well for me.  Sometimes my hair would seem to get caught on it, but I blame that more on my hair than the flat iron, as my hair easily tangles.  It doesn&#x27;t have an indicator for when it reaches the setting it&#x27;s set for, just a light to indicate that it&#x27;s on.  I&#x27;ll bet this is just as good as the CHI they&#x27;re selling for around $80.00.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how the product performs as far as hair straightening, but it makes sealing mylar bags super easy! Recommended for this purpose.</li>
            <li> I found it very hard to use&lt;br /&gt;The temp is either too high or too low&lt;br /&gt;does not serve the purpose of hair straightening</li>
            <li> I turned it on to try it for the first time and it never worked! It burned out immediately and was not able to use it. I did appreciate the seller willing to refund my money as soon as they received it, I did not appreciate however paying for the return shipping that was $7.00 to NY when the iron itself was $16.00, really defeated the purpose almost.</li>
            <li> Product works great, one little flaw the plastic cap that hides the screw broke right away, it is of no use except to hide the screw so not a problem</li>
            <li> Smells like its burning rubber. Makes my hair super frizzy. Not pleased.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get as hot as i thought and left my hair super dry, not real ceramic and the plates aren&#x27;t long enough for longer hair.</li>
            <li> The item I received was not the Revlon Professional flat iron. Instead they sent me another Revlon brand flat iron with very cheap make which naturally did not work as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> decent product, does what it is required to do but I don&#x27;t enjoy too much heat on my hair, ended up giving to my niece</li>
