            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t been happy with MapofBeauty&#x27;s wigs.</li>
            <li>It fits very nicely and looks so natural.</li>
            <li>Great affordable wig!&lt;br /&gt;Gotten 5 wigs, now I ONLY get them from Mapofbeauty!</li>
            <li>But great wig overall</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick, for something coming in from China, it came a little more than a week, which is really good!</li>
            <li>It was amazing the wig has alot of height in volume came here very soft and also came here within 2wks</li>
            <li>This wig is beautiful and only tangles fast if you don&#x27;t know how to care for it.</li>
            <li>The colors are true to the description.  </li>
            <li>I may even get this wig in another color since it was such a good deal.</li>
            <li>It was also more straight than wavy.</li>
            <li>pretty I love it so much!</li>
            <li>If your a beginner with wigs then I suggest you practice with cheap ones first.</li>
            <li>This wig is very smooth and shiny and it really looks like real virgin hair.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything too much, because it was so cheap.</li>
            <li>The length is great, just above my natural waist line.</li>
            <li>The only thing I can say on this that is positive is that it came with a wig cap that works very well and is of good quality.</li>
            <li>The bang is kind long</li>
            <li>I wanted a wig for fun, and this is just shabbily made and the bangs are hideously too short and look goofy.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a really pretty wig</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t look exactly like picture</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>but I love it all the same.</li>
            <li>but overall I&#x27;m pleased</li>
            <li>First wig I bought off amazon.</li>
            <li>if you powder the wig it looks real!</li>
            <li>Only thing I don&#x27;t love is the very top of the wig cause its a little wig looking.</li>
            <li>Normally that happens when you buy cheap wigs, but what got me about this particular one was the make of it.</li>
            <li>I was very dissatisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>It looks so real.</li>
            <li>It looks and feels real.</li>
            <li>Quality and look were more than expected.  </li>
            <li>they were costume wigs i really wish the seller put that on their page</li>
            <li>my hair is super short</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and thick which surprised me since I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be a very high quality wig.</li>
            <li>so easily I can&#x27;t wear it down.</li>
            <li>So surprised!</li>
            <li>it looks so natural!</li>
            <li>Well worth the price- not cheaply made at all like most other novelty wigs.  </li>
            <li>I should&#x27;ve just spent more money and ordered a more expensive wig.</li>
            <li>Major shedding and tangling.</li>
            <li>It is very cheaply and poorly made.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these wigs to ladies who like the long length and bangs.  </li>
            <li>It does tangle, but only because it&#x27;s really long, haha.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, this wig is really nice, if you know what a Rhapsody wig from Gothic Lolita Wigs looks like, it s a pretty decent knockoff, and it&#x27;s thin, but not too uncomfortably thin.</li>
            <li>If your looking for an everyday wig I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this wig at all but for a costume go right ahead.</li>
            <li>The curls are hard to comb, and it doesn&#x27;t look real, or even close to real.</li>
            <li>Feels like real hair, came earlier than expected, bangs are a little much to manage but definitely as product is described!!</li>
            <li>It tangles a bit, but that&#x27;s part of the synthetic fibers (and long hair in general).</li>
    </ol>

            <li> so i get cold easily!</li>
            <li> Reason I give four stars is because it takes so long to ship and the bangs are a tad long.</li>
            <li> The bangs are a bit long, but everyone&#x27;s head is shaped differently so a little trim didn&#x27;t mess anything up.</li>
            <li> Everyone loves it and says it works with my dark complexion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick enough wig but it sheds EVERYWHERE and tangles</li>

            <li> Real thin.... can see straight through the wig!</li>
            <li> and I had cut a little off the length</li>
            <li> Run a little.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> They got my other order wrong, but hopefully they reply back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it 2 thin and shiny</li>
            <li> The worse.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.</li>
            <li> you get what you pay for although it wasn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> Like beyond heat damaged hair someone tried to fix with an oil base product.</li>
            <li> It Sheds really really bad!</li>

            <li> Feels like real hair, came earlier than expected, bangs are a little much to manage but definitely as product is described!!</li>
            <li> I call this Mt barbie doll wig. Hair tangles alot but add water and oil sheen it&#x27;s a really pretty wig</li>
            <li> I bought this wigin all three colors for under $20.00.  The wigs are good quality and look nice on.  It does not tangle too often.  Just use a wig brush.  The colors are true to the description.  I get compliments all the time.  I love the prices and the quality.  I would highly recommend these wigs to ladies who like the long length and bangs.  Look younger with the bangs and hide those brow lines.</li>
            <li> you get what you pay for although it wasn&#x27;t bad it wasn&#x27;t great either. I only got it to role play in so I wore it twice. If your looking for an everyday wig I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this wig at all but for a costume go right ahead.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it 2 thin and shiny</li>
            <li> I was very dissatisfied with this purchase. It is very cheaply and poorly made. Major shedding and tangling. The texture is very similar to that of fishing twine.</li>
            <li> Great quality, not as wavy as pictured but it is really a nice piece.  I would recommended this to everyone.</li>
            <li> most durable -easy hairpiece i have ever had</li>
            <li> The wig came almost a week before the estimated arrival date. The bangs are a bit long, but everyone&#x27;s head is shaped differently so a little trim didn&#x27;t mess anything up. The length is great, just above my natural waist line. It&#x27;s nice and thick which surprised me since I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be a very high quality wig. It tangles a bit, but that&#x27;s part of the synthetic fibers (and long hair in general). I may even get this wig in another color since it was such a good deal.</li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve just spent more money and ordered a more expensive wig. I wanted a wig for fun, and this is just shabbily made and the bangs are hideously too short and look goofy. I tried to make it work, but I just can&#x27;t with this. *Halloween wig?*</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t look exactly like picture</li>
            <li> This is amazing. It looks so real. Only thing I don&#x27;t love is the very top of the wig cause its a little wig looking. But the hair is gorgeous. It looks and feels real. I love it and I definitely recommend getting it. 5 stars</li>
            <li> The wig was okay but not the best.. great for cosplay but not every day wear!</li>
            <li> It tangled and shed like it was nobody&#x27;s business. Normally that happens when you buy cheap wigs, but what got me about this particular one was the make of it. It looked greasy and fried. Like beyond heat damaged hair someone tried to fix with an oil base product. So far I haven&#x27;t been happy with MapofBeauty&#x27;s wigs. Very poor quality.</li>
            <li> Hair works great but bangs were shorter then the picture and no clips to hold in place. Hair tangles less if leave braided when not using.</li>
            <li> arrived on time or a day sooner I believe.  Quality and look were more than expected.  Will buy from them again for sure.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything too much, because it was so cheap. Shipping was quick, for something coming in from China, it came a little more than a week, which is really good!

It does tangle, but only because it&#x27;s really long, haha. I really like it!</li>
            <li> The curls are hard to comb, and it doesn&#x27;t look real, or even close to real. I wore it a couple of times at my house to test it and I couldn&#x27;t find a pro.</li>
            <li> The wig is very lovely. It didn&#x27;t have waves like it was supposed to but I love it all the same. It arrived in good time and was well protected. It fits very nicely and looks so natural. Everyone loves it and says it works with my dark complexion. If your a beginner with wigs then I suggest you practice with cheap ones first. This wig is beautiful and only tangles fast if you don&#x27;t know how to care for it.</li>
            <li> Looks different on me than I imagined and I had cut a little off the length but overall I&#x27;m pleased</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the wigs at all they were costume wigs i really wish the seller put that on their page so ppl that do order week know</li>
            <li> nice just ass seen in picture.</li>
            <li> I like the wig. I gave it to a friend as a gift as she&#x27;s a wig lover.</li>
            <li> Great affordable wig!&lt;br /&gt;Gotten 5 wigs, now I ONLY get them from Mapofbeauty!</li>
            <li> Run a little. But great wig overall</li>
            <li> This wig is very beautiful looks so real and pretty I love it so much! The bang is kind long but it&#x27;s okay nothing you can&#x27;t trim with scissors or just do a side bangs style under a knit hat and it will look amazing and warm in winter :)</li>
            <li> The worse. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick enough wig but it sheds EVERYWHERE and tangles so easily I can&#x27;t wear it down. It was also more straight than wavy. The only thing I can say on this that is positive is that it came with a wig cap that works very well and is of good quality.</li>
            <li> So surprised! This wig is very smooth and shiny and it really looks like real virgin hair. Well worth the price- not cheaply made at all like most other novelty wigs.  There is not an abundance of hair on the wig, however the quality makes up for it.</li>
            <li> Real thin.... can see straight through the wig! It Sheds really really bad! Haven&#x27;t worn it because of the shedding</li>
            <li> Lost my hair because  of radiation. ..my hair is super short so i get cold easily! I love my wig it looks so natural! i will order the brown one soon :)</li>
            <li> First wig I bought off amazon. Great quality and if you powder the wig it looks real! Reason I give four stars is because it takes so long to ship and the bangs are a tad long.</li>
            <li> It was amazing the wig has alot of height in volume came here very soft and also came here within 2wks how awesome</li>
            <li> Perfect for Blake Belladonna of team RWBY! Perfect length and no styling needed.</li>
