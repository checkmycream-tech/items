            <li> I&#x27;ve used a different scent of this Dial Antibacterial body wash for a while and decided to give this one a try. It smells great, but not too strong to be overpowering. It lathers well and rinses clean. Everything I ask for in a body wash.</li>
            <li> First of all the smell is terrible.  I feel like I&#x27;m washing myself with smelly chemicals rather than soap.  I&#x27;m used to using bar soap like Dove and Lever 2000. Those smell so much better.  Also I don&#x27;t feel like the body wash rinses off clean.  I still feel soapy and I&#x27;m never sure for how long to rinse off.  I thought changing to body wash might be better but I think I&#x27;ll stick with bar soap.</li>
            <li> Nice refreshing scent that doesn’t come across as overpowering.  It’s light enough that it neither bothers my allergies, nor can I smell it within minutes of drying off, even when trying to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap lathers well and you immediately feel the moisturizing effect when you are done.</li>
            <li> As expected - good product.</li>
            <li> Great product and I love Dial soaps. So grown up now.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend. I bought this for my teenage boys because they&#x27;re in the acne stage, and it has really helped.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize what a difference this stuff would make. My skin feels significantly better/different than it did before I started this body wash.</li>
            <li> Great smell ... and it was cheaper than the local stores .. that only have it once in a while</li>
            <li> i loooove dial body wash its&lt;br /&gt;the bomb!&lt;br /&gt;i use it for my body and lever 2000 soap&lt;br /&gt;for all my other parts ;)</li>
            <li> By far THE best body wash I have EVER used.&lt;br /&gt;It smells absolutely amazing. I go through body wash in about 2 weeks, so I am constantly buying new ones. But I ALWAYS come back for this. It also is GREAT at actually cleaning my body. It helps with any breakouts on my skin. And doesn&#x27;t dry my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this so much!</li>
            <li> Dial Antibacterial Body Wash, excellent for cleaning germs, bacteria and refreshes the skin.  I buy all Dial Body Washes as long as I see &#x27;antibacterial&#x27; on the bottle. It is an excellent product for cleansing skin.</li>
            <li> Smell is really pleasant and makes you feel clean. If you remember the early 90&#x27;s and know the &amp;#34;Sweet Pea&amp;#34; smell that girls use to wear from bath and body works.. this is pretty much that same smell.</li>

            <li> It is a bit hard on my skin.</li>
            <li> This product is great. The smell is nice and invigorating and it keeps me smelling good and feeling clean throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Great product.amazon. I bought this after a hospital stay .  Great for infection care and the smell is incredible.  a great body wash.  Ordering from Amazon is great.  Comes right to your door a great convenience.</li>
            <li> I recently switched to an antibacterial body wash after smelling really awful one day this summer. I used this one time and after that I don&#x27;t smell at all. Even without deodorant!</li>
            <li> Great body wash, feel fresh all day.</li>
            <li> IM ABOUT 6&#x27;1 AND VERY LITE LITE 230 LBS DO YOU WANT ME TO GO INTO DETAIL ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS BEHIND A CLOSED SHOWER CURTEN?&lt;br /&gt;WHAT HAPPENS IN THE SHOWER STAYS IN THE SHOWER .. IM JUST SAYING</li>
            <li> Love the antibacterial for the gym and it&#x27;s cheap. I wouldn&#x27;t really describe the smell as Mountain Fresh; more of a fruity kind of smell to me.</li>
            <li> The spinal surgeon who operated on my husband required him to have an antibacterial body wash both before and for many months after the procedure.

            <li> Good smell, good price, I love amazon. To buy this else where for me I save $3.00 by buying this on amazon. I have tried the spring scented body washes and like them as well but I wanted to try something else.</li>
            <li> Good.love this and only use this soap in the shower. Different scents are good my favorite is the blue one more.</li>
            <li> Excellent product because of wonderful smell and always refreshed feeling after using product.  This scent however is now not always in  stores because it was discontinued. Was replaced by another scent and is not as nice.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this Dial product, and thankfully I just bought one to try out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The liquid is really thick - almost green-slime looking. As for the smell; it&#x27;s okay, but way too strong for my liking. I had been using Old Spice products over the years and figured I&#x27;d give this a shot. (After all, Dial is a known brand so how wrong could I be). Well, I shot... and I missed. Won&#x27;t be buying any more in the future.</li>
            <li> Being a Huge Dial fan, and Amazon fanatic, I jumped at the chance to get this Mountain Fresh Body Wash at this price! As an avid Amazon buyer and comparison shopper, I could not beat this price...I am considering the automatic ship to save even more! Just a dab will do ya! lol, lasting suds if you use a poof! I have 5 people using this and not a  dent in it in a week!</li>
            <li> Very good price and good product. I use this brand for a long time and I am happy with it.</li>
