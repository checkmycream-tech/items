            <li>I think La Cerise does a good job regarding puffiness and darkness.  </li>
            <li>Could see some difference after 2 weeks but nothing out of this world surprising.</li>

            <li>So this product could be called phenomenal!</li>
            <li>I loved the results and how smoothly it when on around my eyes.</li>
            <li>This is better for me.</li>
            <li>and it THINK that works better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I ordered La Cerise Anti-Aging Vitamin C Eye Gel.  </li>
            <li>Its cooling, soothing and refreshing around my eyes.</li>
            <li>It makes me feel more awake</li>
            <li>but I have fallen in love with this product.</li>
            <li>I love the La Cerise Anti-Aging VITAMIN C EYE GEL Serum.</li>
            <li>Why pay more for inferior products.</li>
            <li>and I bought more.</li>
            <li>and I am hoping they will decrease as I use more of the product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, nothing to brag about and no difference made.</li>
            <li>At my age its simply remarkable to obtain any positive result at all.</li>
            <li>My order was shipped quickly and packed nicely.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for a great product!</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product that has helped my puffy eye to reduce for the first time since I started using different product.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>I was fortunate to receive a sample of this eye gel.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li>fresh and easy to put on, that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using the remainder on my face, outside of my eyes because I&#x27;m convinced the ingredients are good.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly into the skin</li>
            <li>To be honest, I don&#x27;t believe that there is any magic cream, gel, lotion, etc that significantly removes puffiness or dark circles.</li>
            <li>Also, the skin under my eye is much smoother and the gel keeps those fine lines at bay.  </li>
            <li>In the morning, the puffiness I usually experience is greatly reduced.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also bought higher end stuff</li>
            <li>I am a first time eye gel user</li>
            <li>It really seems to work great, especially with my dark under eye circles!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really tell if this does all that much</li>
            <li>I have been using the eye serum all over my face for about a month and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>Really like this eye gel.</li>
            <li>So many other eye products have caused swelling.</li>
            <li>My eyes are not as dark underneath and my lines seem to have gotten better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy, getting older, and wife says I should consider stuff like this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many more expensive products that just don&#x27;t perform even a fraction as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many products with little results.</li>
            <li>I have used the gel for a few weeks now and see improvement, more for darkness of circles  </li>
            <li>When I know my sleep will be limited, I Make sure to use this around my eyes to help me look awake the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>dark circles and puffiness are more diet related than cosmetic.</li>
            <li>So far, I give it a &amp;#34;so, so&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I stayed sniffly and had red, puffy eyes the whole day.</li>
            <li>and I have noticed that I don&#x27;t have dark circles as much as I used to!</li>
            <li>I tried this eye gel for the first time 2 months ago since I have had under eye puffiness and dark circles from not getting enough sleep.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product to help with puffiness and dark circles.</li>

            <li> highly recommend this product to help with puffiness and dark circles.</li>
            <li> I have been to the plastic surgeon and the only help they have is injections that help with the dark circles, but it only lasts about a year.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t go a single night without using it now.  </li>
            <li> and I only need an extremely small amount which I tap under the entire undereye area.  </li>
            <li> My overall complexion is smoother and less wrinkled.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect from this cream but when used at night, it definitely helps me wake without bags or dark circles under my eyes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d used it a few times, but then one day, after I&#x27;d finished putting on my makeup, a tiny bit must have melted into the corners of my eyes, and I was on fire!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I have dark circles and eyelids due to genetics and this product</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it if you have naturally dark skin and even darker circles.</li>
            <li> it removed  puffiness from my eyes and dark circles.</li>
            <li> The dark circle are not quite as dark</li>
            <li> Now after daily use morning and at night before sleeping, I&#x27;m noticing the puffiness is much less and the crows feet are still there but not as defined as before, They are slowly smoothing out quite a bit.</li>
            <li> Basically it was for the crows feet and a little puffiness beneath my eyes.</li>
            <li> I tried it for over a week expecting a little improvement, and I got zero results....</li>
            <li> They stuck in a little sample along with my order.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it once or twice everyday for a couple months now.  </li>
            <li> It softened the lines around my eyes by at least 50%.</li>
            <li> Anyway, while I was using it around my eyes, I didn&#x27;t see any dramatic effects.</li>

            <li> I used it for awhile.  When I ran out, I got something different.  But now I&#x27;m going back.  This is better for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy, getting older, and wife says I should consider stuff like this.  Now I&#x27;m into stuff like this.  Can&#x27;t really tell if this does all that much but it feels good going on.  I&#x27;ve also bought higher end stuff and it THINK that works better.  I think La Cerise does a good job regarding puffiness and darkness.  And, per wife, the Vit C part is a big plus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I ordered La Cerise Anti-Aging Vitamin C Eye Gel.  I keep it in the refrigerator and use it before going to bed so the gel&#x27;s benefits are working throughout the night.  In the morning, the puffiness I usually experience is greatly reduced.  Also, the skin under my eye is much smoother and the gel keeps those fine lines at bay.  It dries quickly into the skin and I only need an extremely small amount which I tap under the entire undereye area.  I don&#x27;t go a single night without using it now.  Thanks so much for a great product!</li>
            <li> I tried this eye gel for the first time 2 months ago since I have had under eye puffiness and dark circles from not getting enough sleep. I use it every morning. Its cooling, soothing and refreshing around my eyes. It makes me feel more awake and I have noticed that I don&#x27;t have dark circles as much as I used to! I will definitely continue to use the La Cerise Anti-Aging VITAMIN C EYE GEL product.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate to receive a sample of this eye gel.  I am a first time eye gel user but I have fallen in love with this product. I will continue to use this as it effective, pleasant and texturally pleasing to me.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I don&#x27;t believe that there is any magic cream, gel, lotion, etc that significantly removes puffiness or dark circles. I have been to the plastic surgeon and the only help they have is injections that help with the dark circles, but it only lasts about a year. I will save my $ and quit buying stuff like this from now on and pay for something that will actually help.</li>
            <li> I love the La Cerise Anti-Aging VITAMIN C EYE GEL Serum. It softened the lines around my eyes by at least 50%. At my age its simply remarkable to obtain any positive result at all. So this product could be called phenomenal! I&#x27;ve used many more expensive products that just don&#x27;t perform even a fraction as well. Why pay more for inferior products. Thank you, La Cerise!</li>
            <li> Could see some difference after 2 weeks but nothing out of this world surprising. Will keep using it and see. So far, I give it a &amp;#34;so, so&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> i found this product to provide no difference, i used the entire bottle. fresh and easy to put on, that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> I have dark circles and eyelids due to genetics and this product didn&#x27;t work at all.  I&#x27;ve used it once or twice everyday for a couple months now.  Don&#x27;t buy it if you have naturally dark skin and even darker circles.</li>
            <li> la cerise anti-aging serum works great..... and is a product i recomend extremely happy with my purchase. it removed  puffiness from my eyes and dark circles.</li>
            <li> My eyes are not as dark underneath and my lines seem to have gotten better.  A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product that has helped my puffy eye to reduce for the first time since I started using different product.&lt;br /&gt;They work as described. I had to order for my friends and sisters who suffer the same thing. I am so happy and I bought more.</li>
            <li> I have used the gel for a few weeks now and see improvement, more for darkness of circles  (which is why I bought the product) than wrinkles as that was not an issue.</li>
            <li> I have been using the eye serum all over my face for about a month and it works very well.  My overall complexion is smoother and less wrinkled.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect from this cream but when used at night, it definitely helps me wake without bags or dark circles under my eyes! When I know my sleep will be limited, I Make sure to use this around my eyes to help me look awake the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to help with puffiness and dark circles. For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> I recently received a bottle of La Cerise Anti-Aging Vitamin C Eye Gel Serum.  I use it in the morning under my makeup.  It does seem to remove the morning puffiness around my eyes.  The dark circle are not quite as dark and I am hoping they will decrease as I use more of the product.  It does feel soothing around the eyes.  I would recommend  this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, nothing to brag about and no difference made.</li>
            <li> I like my purchase alot. It really seems to work great, especially with my dark under eye circles! The seller is great! My order was shipped quickly and packed nicely. I recommend this seller and will purchase from again. A+ Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> I never heard of the La Cerise beauty line until I started shopping at Amazon. I got a trial size with another La Cerise product I bought. I loved the results and how smoothly it when on around my eyes. Basically it was for the crows feet and a little puffiness beneath my eyes. Now after daily use morning and at night before sleeping, I&#x27;m noticing the puffiness is much less and the crows feet are still there but not as defined as before, They are slowly smoothing out quite a bit. I&#x27;ve tried so many products with little results. I&#x27;m staying with La Cerise Vitamin C Eye Gel.</li>
            <li> Bought this because my eyes started getting puffy.... I tried it for over a week expecting a little improvement, and I got zero results.... Don&#x27;t waist you money like I did.....</li>
            <li> Really like this eye gel. Cooling with a brightening and tightening effect. So many other eye products have caused swelling. This one is a winner!</li>
            <li> I like this company. They stuck in a little sample along with my order. I&#x27;m a pushover for freebies, but I&#x27;m not doing too well with the eye gel serum. I&#x27;d used it a few times, but then one day, after I&#x27;d finished putting on my makeup, a tiny bit must have melted into the corners of my eyes, and I was on fire! I stayed sniffly and had red, puffy eyes the whole day. That&#x27;s happened twice now, and I won&#x27;t risk messing up my day by applying it when I&#x27;m going out. I&#x27;m using the remainder on my face, outside of my eyes because I&#x27;m convinced the ingredients are good. Anyway, while I was using it around my eyes, I didn&#x27;t see any dramatic effects. I&#x27;m pretty sure dark circles and puffiness are more diet related than cosmetic. I&#x27;ve got to get back to drinking tons of filtered water.</li>
