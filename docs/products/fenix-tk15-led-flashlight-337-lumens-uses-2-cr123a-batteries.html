            <li>Was an excellent flashlight while it worked.</li>
            <li>The switch resistance is perfect  for thumb operation in off-set mounts.</li>
            <li>It fits in the V70 holster perfectly.</li>
            <li>The button to change levels is great.</li>
            <li>Great durable product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bright, if you use it on the highest/brightest mode.</li>
            <li>and i thought that was bright</li>
            <li>This light is awesome!</li>
            <li>The lowest is good for wandering around inside the house at night.  </li>
            <li>This flashlight is one of the best that I have found all of the features found &amp; more than some brands costing twice as much or more.</li>
            <li>This 337 Lumens Fenix LED flashlight is okay!</li>
            <li>Loved the brightness and could easily see to shoot my ar-15 100 yards at night.</li>
            <li>The thing that is so great about this light to me is that 5,47 and 143 lumens are going to be great for walking in and geting set up for morning hunts, and the 337 lumens will come in very useful on the evening hunts when you need to recover a deer and still not have so much light that you get busted for spotlighting.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know much about lumens, but this thing is VERY bright.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Still a good light though.</li>
            <li>This light is sturdy and is plenty bright for patrol purposes.</li>
            <li>great light for the money, seems durable, bright light, sweet strobe, knocks surefire&#x27;s dick in the dirt at this price.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this light.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>but i am sure that it will more than meet my standards.</li>
            <li>Most of my co-workers have a streamlight.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, a fantastic light for a good price.</li>
            <li>I love this light.</li>
            <li>This is most certainly the brightest tactical flashlight that I own.  </li>
            <li>I cant explain how impressed I have been with this nifty little tool.</li>
            <li>I use the light to look for eye sign.</li>
            <li>None put out as much light as my Fenix lights.</li>
            <li>I use the light every night</li>
            <li>My job requires me to have a light and this is the way to go.</li>
            <li>I bought this light to be used on my patrol rifle.</li>
            <li>The extra batteries are yet another great addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have curently been useing a 80 lumen coleman flash light that cost around $35</li>
            <li>It could function as off hand light support for pistol training</li>
            <li>I would recommend this beauty of a light to anyone who needs to depend on quality to survive.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The light construction is strong and is pretty light.</li>
            <li>I needed a light that could illuminate oil levels at the top of thirty foot tall pumps right after reading pressure on a gauge right in front of my face.</li>
            <li>I good flashlight is essential.</li>
            <li>Great combination of high light output, quality and features in a size compact enough to carry anywhere.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s so useful and the light is consistent.</li>
            <li>Love the different settings of light.</li>
            <li>The rechargable batteries it accepts are nice because I was spending a lot of money of the regular batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive</li>
            <li>the price is right.</li>
            <li>have been running this light for 3-4 months now and still haven&#x27;t had to get a new battery.&lt;br</li>
            <li>litium batteries).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has a strobe feature accessible by a button near the &#x27;head&#x27; which can be fun or disorienting depending on your goal...</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still on its first set (my flashlight came w/ 6</li>
            <li>Highest light setting generates intense beam and even the lowest setting is adequate for general purpose and extended life.</li>
            <li>amazing little light, well made,bright,battery life is pretty good,only use high when you need it, strobe will make you puke if you look at it for any length of time</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice to back off the lumens when looking in a toolbox in a dimly lit room.</li>
            <li>The only thing that bothers me is that i waited so long to come off of the $ and just buy a light of this quality.:)</li>
            <li>The second is bright enough for general use and is probably about the brightness of most &#x27;regular&#x27; flashlights.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s built very well.</li>
            <li>had my light for about a year now and every once in a while the light will short out but usually just slapping the light fixes this.</li>
            <li>It has led me through many dark areas in the desert, so I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Recommend highly.</li>
            <li>I would highly recomend this to anyone considering it.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t rough on the light at all and never dropped it</li>
            <li>Other than that, this light fits in the ruler pocket of my coveralls, has the power I need and</li>
            <li>Good Flashlight, but after a month and a half of regular use, stopped working, and warranty is only for a month...</li>
            <li>I have been working the midnight shift for the last year with a smaller, inferior light and this Fenix knocked that one out of the park.</li>
            <li>The light reflects back a very long way away and give me plenty of time to spot the animal.</li>
            <li>The TK15, with it&#x27;s wide range of adjustability, allows me to use fewer lumens up close and then crank up the candlepower for more distant readings.</li>
            <li>This little light with illuminate the entire front yard of a residence from safe tactical distances and adds very little front end weight to the rifle.</li>
            <li>The next two settings are just silly bright.  </li>
            <li>Also, squeezing the momentary a little too hard simply leaves the light on, also unlike the Surefires, which require an additional step to make the light stay</li>
            <li>I have dreamed of owning a flashlight that was more than average, but i also have trouble spending $ on things like this.</li>
            <li>and they work great and are much less expensive to use that the CR123A.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s not necessary, try using it on the low, medium low, or medium high mode to save your battery life.</li>
            <li>The light is a little brighter than the 12 however the 12 pattern is a little tighter and throws light a little further.</li>
            <li>The smooth switch is hard to find with one hand, especially with gloves on.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The secondary switch that allows multiple light levels is a plus.  </li>
            <li>I plan to use a small dot of adhesive non-skid stair traction tape to make the tactile feel of the button a little better.</li>

            <li> Is it tough enough to be used as an improvised weapon with the strike bezel?  </li>
            <li> you bought it for tactical use, know that the flashlight does not neck down at all in girth (like the Surefire) which makes it a little hard to use when you hold it between your fingers.  </li>
            <li> It may be bit heavier than usual tactical flashlights, but it does get the job done.</li>
            <li> I was a Surefire guy and am now a Fenix fanatic!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Great combination of high light output, quality and features in a size compact enough to carry anywhere.  Highest light setting generates intense beam and even the lowest setting is adequate for general purpose and extended life. Works well with the CR123 batteries - may try the rechargeables at some point.  The combination of end cap switch and side mode/intensity button is a big improvement on models requiring twisting the handle to change modes. Recommend highly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this flashlight for over a year now and I carry it with me everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so useful and the light is consistent. I wish I could have one of these in each&lt;br /&gt;vehicle and camping tote I have. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever buy a different flashlight&lt;br /&gt;again!</li>
            <li> I have paid a lot more for name brands such as Streamlight / Surefire, only to be disappointed. This flashlight beats them hands down.</li>
            <li> amazing little light, well made,bright,battery life is pretty good,only use high when you need it, strobe will make you puke if you look at it for any length of time, now I hope I don&#x27;t lose it.</li>
            <li> great light for the money, seems durable, bright light, sweet strobe, knocks surefire&#x27;s dick in the dirt at this price.</li>
            <li> Good Flashlight, but after a month and a half of regular use, stopped working, and warranty is only for a month...</li>
            <li> Was an excellent flashlight while it worked. Loved the brightness and could easily see to shoot my ar-15 100 yards at night. Wasn&#x27;t rough on the light at all and never dropped it but it stopped working after about 4 months.</li>
            <li> I have had a TK12 for 4 years. Got this one for my wife. The button to change levels is great. The light is a little brighter than the 12 however the 12 pattern is a little tighter and throws light a little further. We live in the mountains of Colorado and it gets pitch dark at night without a moon. No street lights. I use the light to look for eye sign. The light reflects back a very long way away and give me plenty of time to spot the animal. My buddies have other brands of lights,SureFire etc. None put out as much light as my Fenix lights.I use the light every night so I got rechargeable batteries and they work great and are much less expensive to use that the CR123A.</li>
            <li> This light is awesome! My job requires me to have a light and this is the way to go. I use it every night. Love the different settings of light. The rechargable batteries it accepts are nice because I was spending a lot of money of the regular batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive had my light for about a year now and every once in a while the light will short out but usually just slapping the light fixes this. My friend has the same light and his has this minor annoying short too is why I gave it a 4 instead of 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still a good light though.</li>
            <li> My job in the nuclear power industry requires reading alot of gauges, sightglasses and other indicators both close up and far off. I needed a light that could illuminate oil levels at the top of thirty foot tall pumps right after reading pressure on a gauge right in front of my face. The TK15, with it&#x27;s wide range of adjustability, allows me to use fewer lumens up close and then crank up the candlepower for more distant readings. It&#x27;s also nice to back off the lumens when looking in a toolbox in a dimly lit room. Really bright lights reflect off chrome tools and can be annoying. My only nit pick is the power output switch. The smooth switch is hard to find with one hand, especially with gloves on. I plan to use a small dot of adhesive non-skid stair traction tape to make the tactile feel of the button a little better. Other than that, this light fits in the ruler pocket of my coveralls, has the power I need and the price is right. I&#x27;m satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this light to be used on my patrol rifle. This light is sturdy and is plenty bright for patrol purposes. This little light with illuminate the entire front yard of a residence from safe tactical distances and adds very little front end weight to the rifle. The switch resistance is perfect  for thumb operation in off-set mounts. Hope it helps.  19 years LE</li>
            <li> It may be bit heavier than usual tactical flashlights, but it does get the job done. It has led me through many dark areas in the desert, so I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This 337 Lumens Fenix LED flashlight is okay! It&#x27;s bright, if you use it on the highest/brightest mode. However, if you do use it on the brightest mode too often, it will drain your battery life within an hour or so. If it&#x27;s not necessary, try using it on the low, medium low, or medium high mode to save your battery life. That&#x27;s all i can recommend... And also, I would recommend stocking up on the CR123 batteries for this flashlight like i did! You&#x27;re gonna need it!</li>
            <li> This is most certainly the brightest tactical flashlight that I own.  It is on the larger size so it will not fit in smaller pockets, pouches or other compartments and it will be noticed in your pocket.  Is it waterproof?  Yes.  Is it tough enough to be used as an improvised weapon with the strike bezel?  Yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The secondary switch that allows multiple light levels is a plus.  The extra batteries are yet another great addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, for the entire package...this is a must buy.</li>
            <li> I have dreamed of owning a flashlight that was more than average, but i also have trouble spending $ on things like this. I was wonting something that i could take with me deer hunting that would help with the recoveries. I have not got to test that out yet but i am sure that it will more than meet my standards. I have curently been useing a 80 lumen coleman flash light that cost around $35 and i thought that was bright (I was mistaken). The thing that is so great about this light to me is that 5,47 and 143 lumens are going to be great for walking in and geting set up for morning hunts, and the 337 lumens will come in very useful on the evening hunts when you need to recover a deer and still not have so much light that you get busted for spotlighting. The only thing that bothers me is that i waited so long to come off of the $ and just buy a light of this quality.:)</li>
            <li> The light construction is strong and is pretty light. It could function as off hand light support for pistol training or I&#x27;ve run it on a shotgun. It&#x27;s just flat out durable.</li>
            <li> This flashlight is one of the best that I have found all of the features found &amp; more than some brands costing twice as much or more.</li>
            <li> I use this product on patrol. It fits in the V70 holster perfectly. Great durable product. I&#x27;d recommend it to all my LE family.</li>
            <li> I love this light. Small yet very stronge and powerfull. I am very pleased with this light. I&#x27;ll buy another one and recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Im an aircraft mechanic. I good flashlight is essential. Most of my co-workers have a streamlight. I bought the TK15 because of its size. When you lay it down, it doesn&#x27;t roll. It&#x27;s brighter than the streamlight. It&#x27;s built very well. I would highly recomend this to anyone considering it.</li>
            <li> I cant explain how impressed I have been with this nifty little tool. I have been working the midnight shift for the last year with a smaller, inferior light and this Fenix knocked that one out of the park. I would recommend this beauty of a light to anyone who needs to depend on quality to survive.&lt;br /&gt;I have been running this light for 3-4 months now and still haven&#x27;t had to get a new battery.&lt;br /&gt;A+  I was a Surefire guy and am now a Fenix fanatic!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know much about lumens, but this thing is VERY bright.  It has four settings.  The lowest is good for wandering around inside the house at night.  The second is bright enough for general use and is probably about the brightness of most &#x27;regular&#x27; flashlights.  The next two settings are just silly bright.  :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it every day just to see how long the batteries last and it&#x27;s still on its first set (my flashlight came w/ 6 generic &amp;#34;123&amp;#34; litium batteries).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has a strobe feature accessible by a button near the &#x27;head&#x27; which can be fun or disorienting depending on your goal...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you bought it for tactical use, know that the flashlight does not neck down at all in girth (like the Surefire) which makes it a little hard to use when you hold it between your fingers.  Also, squeezing the momentary a little too hard simply leaves the light on, also unlike the Surefires, which require an additional step to make the light stay on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, a fantastic light for a good price.</li>
