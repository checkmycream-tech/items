            <li>After discontinuing use of the product, it cleared right up.</li>
            <li>pretty cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>you first put it on you</li>

            <li>I used it a few times and it clear me right away, great to use with the shampoo.</li>
            <li>Sulfur 8 is the first non prescription medication that really works on my skin problem.  </li>
            <li>Although it makes my head tingle, I haven&#x27;t seen much benefit from this.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I do or don&#x27;t recommend this product because it did not have much impact on me, but it may on you.</li>
            <li>Its very soothing and helps prevent breakouts.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work and it smell alwful.</li>
            <li>i started losing so much hair after i used it.</li>
            <li>and I have to say this stuff really works my dandruff was gone in like two days</li>
            <li>, it completely took care of the itching and allowed me to wear my braids peacefully.</li>
            <li>Perhaps this is better for someone who has less hair.</li>
            <li>will notice a sensation similar to icy/ hot</li>
            <li>I got this, plus hot oil, and Selsun Blue (medicated) shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for years it is hard to find in some stores I love the soothing feeling on my scalp and my hair is growing</li>
            <li>I was desperate for a solution to my scalp eczema problem and read all the great reviews for this.</li>
            <li>It is a wonder drug as far as  </li>
            <li>I am 38 years old, and had horrendous dandruff from age 11 until I was 32.  </li>
            <li>After doing an alternating hot oil treatment and then sulfur on the next day, for a week, and using Selsun Blue every morning in the shower, my dandruff was 99% gone.  </li>
            <li>I am of African descent with highly coily hard-to-manage temperamental 4c hair.</li>
            <li>- just kidding :) It does go on sticky and difficult to rub into my scalp as I have too much hair.  </li>
            <li>Then while completely bald, I developed severe dandruff in those spots so that nothing would grow the hair back.  </li>
            <li>Last year, I started protected my wrapped natural hair in a net-type wig cap because it held my hair in the wrap</li>
            <li>The upside is that after keeping it in my hair and re-applying for a few days, dandruff and psoriatic dermatitis stay at bay almost indefinitely -- certainly weeks after the pomade&#x27;s washed out.  </li>

            <li> He found this in the &amp;#34;dandruff&amp;#34; section next to other shampoos.  </li>
            <li> It is a very long process to grow edges.  </li>
            <li> I had a extremely dry scalp which caused dandruff</li>
            <li> I have search forever to find something to help my son&#x27;s dry scalp problem and looked all over the stores for this product and found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Eventually the thin band around the netted wig cap made my edges completely bald as it moved back and forth on my edges leaving only the thin strip of baby hair at the very edge where the cap didn&#x27;t touch.  </li>
            <li> My dermatologist and other doctors made a fortune on me.  </li>
            <li> It stopped my dandruff in less than 1 week and in 4 months, I had 2 inches of hair on my edges.  </li>
            <li> After fifteen years of fighting nasty psoriatic dandruff complete with welts and scaling with hundreds of dollars of mostly ineffective shampoos with fancy antifungal ingredients, who would have thought that lowly sulfur would finally bring my ugly little battle to a close?</li>
            <li> I still use this sulfur every few months just to ensure that the dandruff does not return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of using this product my hair is tame moisturized with a well defined coil pattern.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t rock.  </li>
            <li> In fairness, as a baby I was diagnosed with a sulfa allergy, but I read where being allergic to sulfa medications doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean you&#x27;ll have a reaction to sulfur-based products.</li>
            <li> My hair was growing like crazy and then I noticed my already thin edges were thinning</li>
            <li> but I do suffer from scalp folliculitis which can cause itchy, painful and irritating breakouts.</li>
            <li> I may try it on a cold sore someday</li>
            <li> I was afraid it would clog my pores so my hair wouldn&#x27;t grow.  </li>
            <li> : The smell is bad I suggest putting it on before bed</li>
            <li> this product if you have bad dandruff.  </li>
            <li> but it looked horrible.  </li>
            <li> We went there together, in search of something, anything, that would help my terrible scalp.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I just ordered this and I plan to mix it with Glovers Mane to help my hair grow.</li>
            <li> Although it makes my head tingle, I haven&#x27;t seen much benefit from this.  It smells and feels like Carmex, so I may try it on a cold sore someday - just kidding :) It does go on sticky and difficult to rub into my scalp as I have too much hair.  Perhaps this is better for someone who has less hair. I can&#x27;t say I do or don&#x27;t recommend this product because it did not have much impact on me, but it may on you.</li>
            <li> Works don&#x27;t like smel!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dandruff but I do suffer from scalp folliculitis which can cause itchy, painful and irritating breakouts. I use this whenever my scalp starts getting irritated. Its very soothing and helps prevent breakouts. Its does make it more difficult to detangle my afro afterwards though.</li>
            <li> good stuff,use it for my itchy ears,and use on my scalp for my edges,it feels breezy on my scalp,i don&#x27;t care of the smell!</li>
            <li> Was cheaper at Walmart&lt;br /&gt;Like product</li>
            <li> I love the product and use it often for itchy scalp but cost had become prohibitive. I bought a larger size for a lesser price</li>
            <li> the sulfur 8 formula is terrific.love the tingly feelin.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work and it smell alwful.</li>
            <li> Used this for years and could not find it locally.  The price was right on Amazon so I just had to have it. Should have purchased more than one. Will buy more.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product! It DOES really make hair more manageable and DOES improve hair texture! I am of African descent with highly coily hard-to-manage temperamental 4c hair. After 2 weeks of using this product my hair is tame moisturized with a well defined coil pattern. If I didnt know otherwise,  running my fingers through my now silky hair, I would swear I had a Jheri Curl.....lol....the hair has INCREDIBLE shine and the tingle it gives is an added bonus.....Happy Camper</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD FORMULA I USED DANDRUFF GONE</li>
            <li> I only used this one time. Never again. i started losing so much hair after i used it. Aweful experience.</li>
            <li> In fairness, as a baby I was diagnosed with a sulfa allergy, but I read where being allergic to sulfa medications doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean you&#x27;ll have a reaction to sulfur-based products. I was desperate for a solution to my scalp eczema problem and read all the great reviews for this. For the price, I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. Within a day of using it the tops of my ears and parts of my scalp were red and irritated. After discontinuing use of the product, it cleared right up. Use at your own risk...I switched to simple coconut oil and it works wonders. Plus, it smells MUCH better.</li>
            <li> I love this for my hair care</li>
            <li> Sulfur 8 is the first non prescription medication that really works on my skin problem.  It is a wonder drug as far as  I am  concerned. And at a fraction of the cost of my  prescription medication.</li>
            <li> My mom gave this to me about a week ago. I had a extremely dry scalp which caused dandruff and I have to say this stuff really works my dandruff was gone in like two days and I haven had a itch yet .&lt;br /&gt;Pros: stops itching and dandruff with in hours of use&lt;br /&gt;Gives scalp a cool feeling&lt;br /&gt;Is pretty cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The smell is bad I suggest putting it on before bed so you don&#x27;t smell it in the morning&lt;br /&gt;When you first put it on you will notice a sensation similar to icy/ hot</li>
            <li> The best so far.  I am so glad I bought this, it completely took care of the itching and allowed me to wear my braids peacefully. I will definitely be buying more. I got more for my money!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> The downside is it&#x27;s a pomade, which is a look I usually don&#x27;t rock.  The upside is that after keeping it in my hair and re-applying for a few days, dandruff and psoriatic dermatitis stay at bay almost indefinitely -- certainly weeks after the pomade&#x27;s washed out.  After fifteen years of fighting nasty psoriatic dandruff complete with welts and scaling with hundreds of dollars of mostly ineffective shampoos with fancy antifungal ingredients, who would have thought that lowly sulfur would finally bring my ugly little battle to a close?</li>
            <li> I have search forever to find something to help my son&#x27;s dry scalp problem and looked all over the stores for this product and found it on Amazon. I love Amazon too!</li>
            <li> Last year, I started protected my wrapped natural hair in a net-type wig cap because it held my hair in the wrap and it was breathable.  My hair was growing like crazy and then I noticed my already thin edges were thinning but I didn&#x27;t know why.  Eventually the thin band around the netted wig cap made my edges completely bald as it moved back and forth on my edges leaving only the thin strip of baby hair at the very edge where the cap didn&#x27;t touch.  Ugh! so counterproductive.  Then while completely bald, I developed severe dandruff in those spots so that nothing would grow the hair back.  It didn&#x27;t itch but it looked horrible.  After trying every remedy, head and shoulders, selsun blue, t-gel, phytheol, jamaican castor oil, monistat 7, neosporin, I finally tried sulfur 8.  It stopped my dandruff in less than 1 week and in 4 months, I had 2 inches of hair on my edges.  I was afraid it would clog my pores so my hair wouldn&#x27;t grow.  It is a very long process to grow edges.  I hope the growth continues.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years it is hard to find in some stores I love the soothing feeling on my scalp and my hair is growing</li>
            <li> OUTSTANDING.  I am 38 years old, and had horrendous dandruff from age 11 until I was 32.  I used every dandruff shampoo under the sun including horrendous coal tar shampoo.  I tried some meds.  I used Nizoral for 15 years in prescription and over-the-counter strength.  NOTHING worked.  My dermatologist and other doctors made a fortune on me.  I switched dermatologists and got onto Cicloprox.  $120 a bottle for that stuff...it worked, but in order to keep yourself dandruff-free, you have to keep using it indefinitely. And then...eureka.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend, a retired MD who practiced in the Philippines, found this at the local pharmacy.  We went there together, in search of something, anything, that would help my terrible scalp.  He found this in the &amp;#34;dandruff&amp;#34; section next to other shampoos.  I got this, plus hot oil, and Selsun Blue (medicated) shampoo.  After doing an alternating hot oil treatment and then sulfur on the next day, for a week, and using Selsun Blue every morning in the shower, my dandruff was 99% gone.  I still use this sulfur every few months just to ensure that the dandruff does not return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this product if you have bad dandruff.  Quit wasting your time at the dermie.  They do not want to cure you because if they do, you won&#x27;t come back and they can&#x27;t make money on you.</li>
            <li> very good for the dandruff I used it a few times and it clear me right away, great to use with the shampoo.</li>
