            <li>I should have stuck with the very best Marula oil, Swazi Secrets!</li>
            <li>Item was perfect as described.</li>
            <li>It has a wonderful \\&quot;nutty\\&quot; aroma.</li>
            <li>I rub it on my face and neck and it feels wonderful!</li>
            <li>Go with the Swazi oil instead, because it is truly lighter and makes my skin look and feel great.</li>
            <li>I  think I will not ever be without this oil if it continues to give me great results.</li>
            <li>This has been a great experience, using Shea Terra.  </li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>

            <li>I absolutely LOVE this \\&quot;Shea Terra Organics</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing, great both for my dry cheeks and oilier nose and chin.</li>
            <li>Package arrived quickly and the oil is lovely..</li>
            <li>It does not feel too oily,  just ever so light and dissolves into the skin almost immediately.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in my skin -- it feels more hydrated and just generally looks better!</li>
            <li>The smell is clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second bottle now and love the results on my skin.</li>
            <li>When I first tried Marula Oil</li>
            <li>Came back from Africa and had to get in on this magic oil.</li>
            <li>The oil has had a positive effect on the condition of my skin.  </li>
            <li>great for hair and skin, use mixed with other oils.  </li>
            <li>This brand is pure and way cheaper than fancy-schmansy brands.</li>
            <li>Two little squirts do your whole face and it absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li>Does not smell as nice as the more expensive brand.</li>
            <li>so this really keeps my skin supple.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>It is very sticky.</li>
            <li>My german shepherd mix; however, remained calm and dignified throughout application.  </li>
            <li>I am blonde,68 years old with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I just started using this product, so it&#x27;s to early to judge.</li>
            <li>This purchase was my first foray into using marula oil, so I&#x27;ve not tried the more expensive brands.  </li>
            <li>First of all I am leery about putting anything called &#x27;oil&#x27; on my wide pore, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>Finally I found something that calms and hydrates my face in this freezing and windy New York winter.</li>
            <li>It feels much like the more expensive brand.</li>
            <li>Has an old dirty smell - I added a few drops of rose geranium essential oil and it seems to help - love the feel of my skin after application, lasts a long time without feeling greasy</li>
            <li>and this brand is 100% pure like the other brands - I will continue purchasing this product.</li>
            <li>I live in the mountains where it&#x27;s very dry</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle now and love the results on my skin. I live in the mountains where it&#x27;s very dry so this really keeps my skin supple.</li>
            <li> This product says it isn&#x27;t greasy, but for me it&#x27;s extremely greasy and clogs my pores. I should have stuck with the very best Marula oil, Swazi Secrets! But I wanted to save $5 and ordered Shea Terra instead. Go with the Swazi oil instead, because it is truly lighter and makes my skin look and feel great.</li>
            <li> See the didference already</li>
            <li> WARNING: Do not open in the vicinity of a cheweenie!  My daughter&#x27;s chihuahua / daschund went just about ape s**t when I put this on.  My german shepherd mix; however, remained calm and dignified throughout application.  I like the oil and it seems to moisturize my skin well, so the little dog will just have to deal.</li>
            <li> Package arrived quickly and the oil is lovely..thanks</li>
            <li> I am blonde,68 years old with sensitive skin. When I first tried Marula Oil I bought the Leaky Collection. Was pleased with the result. When I drove to MN to visit my sister, I got the Shea Terra product for her. Discovered the only difference between Leaky &amp; Shea is price.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product, so it&#x27;s to early to judge. It feels much like the more expensive brand. Does not smell as nice as the more expensive brand. If it works as well I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. I have been using it for a few days and I can already feel the difference in my face and neck. I use it morning and night. It does not feel too oily,  just ever so light and dissolves into the skin almost immediately.  I  think I will not ever be without this oil if it continues to give me great results. The smell is clean.</li>
            <li> I feel like a queen in luxury when I put on this oil.  I can&#x27;t stop myself from saying &amp;#34;ahhhhh&amp;#34; or &#x27;ooohhh&amp;#34; when I put it on before bed.  It is so quenching for my skin and smells nutty and yummy!  Will re-order when I am out.  The price allows me to.</li>
            <li> This purchase was my first foray into using marula oil, so I&#x27;ve not tried the more expensive brands.  However, I don&#x27;t think I will ever need to.  This has been a great experience, using Shea Terra.  I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in my skin -- it feels more hydrated and just generally looks better!</li>
            <li> Finally I found something that calms and hydrates my face in this freezing and windy New York winter. It&#x27;s amazing, great both for my dry cheeks and oilier nose and chin. I apply it under my eyes also.</li>
            <li> AMAZING FOR MY HAIR AND FACE...</li>
            <li> Item was perfect as described.</li>
            <li> I like the product and I ordered some more thank you</li>
            <li> The oil has had a positive effect on the condition of my skin.  I use it on my face mixed with argan and hempseed oils at night.  When the temperatures are very low I apply the oil with facial lotion.  The combination keeps my skin moist (I have dry skin.).  In the morning my skin is still moist.  I also use the oil mixture on my hair to condition the ends.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this \\&quot;Shea Terra Organics Marula Oil 100% pure\\&quot; and use it on my face at night before bed. It has a wonderful \\&quot;nutty\\&quot; aroma. I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s much less expensive than the other brands (the other brands are almost 4 x&#x27;s more expensive!) and this brand is 100% pure like the other brands - I will continue purchasing this product. One 2 oz. bottle lasts several months using once a day.</li>
            <li> Came back from Africa and had to get in on this magic oil.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to quantify the quality of skin care products such as these. First of all I am leery about putting anything called &#x27;oil&#x27; on my wide pore, acne prone skin. Two little squirts do your whole face and it absorbs nicely. I like the way my middle aged skin feels after application. I have also found it helpful on problem dry spots around my fingernails after a manicure. This brand is pure and way cheaper than fancy-schmansy brands. At this price I recommend it giving it a try.</li>
            <li> Has an old dirty smell - I added a few drops of rose geranium essential oil and it seems to help - love the feel of my skin after application, lasts a long time without feeling greasy</li>
            <li> It is very sticky. But if leaves my skin very smooth. Please dilute the oil with some drops of water.</li>
            <li> My husband purchased this &amp; has been using it for over a month. He says his skin is softer &amp; not so dry around his eyes. Guess I&#x27;ll have to trade in my Vitamin E Enhance Oil I purchased &amp; start using this.</li>
            <li> great for hair and skin, use mixed with other oils.  A little goes  long way.  2nd x buying it from here.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  A little goes a long way.  I rub it on my face and neck and it feels wonderful!</li>
