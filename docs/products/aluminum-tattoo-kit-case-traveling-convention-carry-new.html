            <li> Love this box hold all tattoo equipment great,</li>
            <li> Good size case. Fits my machines well. Made very nice</li>
            <li> Quality Product, plenty of space!</li>
            <li> Nice product. However, it did not hold everything we needed it to so we returned it for a larger case.</li>
            <li> I bought a beginner tattoo kit and it fits all my gear in it, two machines, needles, 50+ paints, motor, power cords, etc.</li>
            <li> My fiance wanted a new tattoo gun box. It came quickly. It was nice and new. When organized right it fits all of his stuff in it.</li>
            <li> the product itself looks great, only disappointment for me is it was alot smaller than i expected. i could not fit all of my equipment</li>
            <li> This is a sweet little case. It fits two guns, just enough stuff to travel and locks for safety, though I feel like if it was stolen someone could break the lock. Its not a huge case so it could be easily grabbed. The lock would probably only delay someone getting into it in the end, but by then its already stolen so its not like someone would return it if they could not open it. Its best just to keep an eye on it. Its a good starter case I would say, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Great for the price.  I use it all the time &amp; have no trouble with transport.</li>
            <li> Nice hard constructed case to protect your investment I also like the locking ability tor the little extra security. perfect for a begginer kit.</li>
            <li> It holds everything that I need it to hold. It&#x27;s durable, lightweight, and looks nice. It was a great purchase.</li>

            <li> I love it!!! So easy to carry around and store!</li>
            <li> When received had some scuffing on it and an inch or two of the metal band was bent. Still nice for the price for a beginner case</li>
            <li> Well worth the price. A little smaller than I thought but, it works well. I highly recommend this product to all.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the deal. Great for the money and better than average item. Very sturdy case and holds up to abuse.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this purchase. However,, its a tad smaller than I expected. Enough room to hold all tattoo supplies.</li>
            <li> Amazing amount of gear will fit in this thing! Two guns, a dozen 1 ounce bottles, pedal, a lot of needles, and a inkpot holder all fit in mine.</li>
            <li> falling apart a little on the inside but hey u get what you pay for. so no complaints here :)</li>
            <li> Fits everything nice and snug.I didnt realize it came with locks and keys. Pretty cool,keeps stuff organized.Lots room for inks,needles etc.&lt;br /&gt; My power supply dont fit though,not a big deal.</li>
            <li> Neither of the locks worked from time of arrival.&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed. I needed a box that locked.&lt;br /&gt;It is useless to me.</li>
