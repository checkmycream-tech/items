            <li>I have no idea what they are, and you have to strain your eyes to see them, but they make your skin look and feel amazing.  </li>
            <li>It smells amazing, lathers perfectly, and leaves my skin wonderfully soft.  </li>
            <li>this is a very good, body wash,, very creamy and NON DRYING.</li>

            <li>I love to shower with this body wash.  </li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing and smells great.</li>
            <li>Even my husband loves it and requests more whenever we are close to running out.</li>
            <li>I also love that it can be used as a shaving cream and not leave you with moisture burn.  </li>
            <li>I love Olay products I have used them for years and nothing else I have used make the grade.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell, and the way it stores in the shower caddy.</li>
            <li>Like the smell, look and more.  </li>
            <li>Would purchase again and again for sure.</li>
            <li>If it wasn&#x27;t excellent I would not have purchase it a second time.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the ribbons product they have come out with.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s spelled \\&quot;Creme\\&quot; ribbons, but \\&quot;Cream\\&quot; is more like it.  </li>
            <li>and if you add a couple drops of your favorite body oil with it...</li>
            <li>It has a clean scent, kind of flowery.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, it&#x27;s very moisturizing and smells so good.</li>
            <li>It was so great to be able to find it cheaper on Amazon and in bulk instead of having to buy the individual bottles.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, does wonders at moisturizing your skin, and just overall is a good way to start the day.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally, I don&#x27;t mind paying more for a product if I really like it - and I really liked this product with JUST the almond oil.  </li>
            <li>decided to use both the Olay 2-In-1 Advanced Ribbons</li>
            <li>Advanced Moisture Body Wash 18 Oz (Pack of 3) with the \\&quot;Dove Visible Care Cr&amp;egrave;me Body</li>
            <li>They work fabulously together.</li>
            <li>always had to apply lotion after washing, in order to keep my body silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell; pretty but not too strong.  </li>
            <li>I feel clean and fresh!</li>
            <li>This works great and doesn&#x27;t dry out our skin.</li>
            <li>body wash not only does a wonderful job of cleaning, but it leaves your skin feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased with the product and discovered it doesn&#x27;t take as much per shower as the cheaper products.</li>
            <li>A lot is often left near the end of the bottle, but the top comes off fairly easily and you can get a couple more uses out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite body wash by far.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many different types of body wash and concluded that Oil of Olay Advanced Ribbons beats them all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find out that not only did they have it, but I could put in a standing order to have it delivered to my door automatically on my time schedule.  </li>
            <li>This body wash is pleasantly scented and left my skin moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>&amp; Gamble recently decided to add rose essence, making it a much stronger and almost sicky</li>
            <li>I have been buying this body wash at the local store for a while now, and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product, and when our local Wal-Mart stopped carrying it I came to Amazon.com immediately to look for it.  </li>
            <li>I get it cheaper online and get the exact ones I want.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>sweet scent - described by P&amp;G Customer Service as their new \\&quot;floral fruity scent\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feels silky soft and squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>After trying several body washes, I found Olay Body Wash with Almond Oil which is the only moisturizing Olay body wash with a light fresh scent that doesn&#x27;t battle with my cologne, and leaves my skin feeling smooth and silky after my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was very satisfied with the large quantity for a small price.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Making these much cheaper than the Supermarket prices.</li>
            <li>The price does not differ much.</li>
            <li>AND I ALL READY SEE AN IMPROVEMENT.  </li>
            <li>This body wash keeps your entire body silky smooth...</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this body wash and refuse to use anything other than Olay.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and hope they never stop making it.  </li>
            <li>It runs a very close second to Olay with Almond Oil, and now that Olay with Almond Oil only is no longer available, I will return to YSL for my bath products.</li>
            <li>I cannot live without this bodywash.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;new and improved\\</li>
            <li>The things are exactly the same, I guess.</li>
            <li>Never oily, smells great and leaves a few tiny little \\&quot;sparkles\\&quot; on your skin.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feels so soft.  </li>
            <li>I usually buy this body wash at the drug store, but it is much cheaper on Amazon and delivered free, so now I buy it on here and save a lot of money on an essential.</li>
            <li>I know that body wash is more expensive (in general) to use than bars of soap, but it&#x27;s certainly easier</li>
            <li>have tried many expensive bodywashes in the past and this is at the top of my list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t dried out my skin, which is a nice change from my usual body wash.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to any one having dry itchy skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is left soft and moisturized without adding a step in my daily routine.</li>
            <li>Wonderfully soft skin and no itchy dry tightness later.</li>

            <li> I love to shower with this body wash.  It makes my skin feels so soft.  I feel clean and fresh! I am very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guess, what, I updated my comments on 10/9/2013:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to use both the Olay 2-In-1 Advanced Ribbons Soothing Cr&amp;egrave;me + Advanced Moisture Body Wash 18 Oz (Pack of 3) with the \\&quot;Dove Visible Care Cr&amp;egrave;me Body Wash\\&quot;.

            <li> This is my favorite body wash by far.  It smells amazing, does wonders at moisturizing your skin, and just overall is a good way to start the day.  It lathers nicely and is easy to use with a loofah.  I also love that it can be used as a shaving cream and not leave you with moisture burn.  I&#x27;ve used this for years and every time I&#x27;ve tried another product I&#x27;ve always ditched it and gone back to this.</li>
            <li> I cannot live without this bodywash. I have used it for alittle over two years and it has greatly improved my eczema. Also, I used to get \\&quot;winter itch\\&quot; every winter, but since I switched to Olay Ribbons I no longer suffer from severe dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many expensive bodywashes in the past and this is at the top of my list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative that I can think of is my mother says it builds up on the shower and is hard to clean off.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both have very dry skin which gets even worse with the dry indoor air during winter. This works great and doesn&#x27;t dry out our skin.</li>
            <li> I love Olay products I have used them for years and nothing else I have used make the grade.  I always go back to Olay products.</li>
            <li> this is a very good, body wash,, very creamy and NON DRYING. It is still a big lather soap. And does require lotion afterwards. I am taking advantage of the SUBSCRIBE AND SAVE option. Making these much cheaper than the Supermarket prices. I love the smell, and the way it stores in the shower caddy. Very good for both men and women. And again, does not STRIP the skin of moisture, like GEL based body washes.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with the large quantity for a small price. Will continue to buy this from now on.</li>
            <li> This is the best body wash you can buy.  It works so well and is quite a bit cheaper online, than in the store.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t ever go wrong with Olay in anything.  Like the smell, look and more.  Would purchase again and again for sure.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this body wash.  It smells amazing, lathers perfectly, and leaves my skin wonderfully soft.  With a few days of use I no longer need a daily moisturizer.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I bought this twice. If it wasn&#x27;t excellent I would not have purchase it a second time. It makes my skin feels silky soft and squeaky clean. You can go ahead and purchase it. I promise you wont be sorry.</li>
            <li> I use this product on mornings and I love it. It makes my skin feel softer and smoother. I have been using other Olay body washes but this one is heavenly.</li>
            <li> I like to use body wash that lathers very nicely but is not too smelly, and this fits the bill. I know that body wash is more expensive (in general) to use than bars of soap, but it&#x27;s certainly easier and I bought this item on a good sale and have been very happy with it. It hasn&#x27;t dried out my skin, which is a nice change from my usual body wash.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  i was having a hard time finding it at some stores - so I went to amazon and now 3 of these appear on my doorstep every so often.  It is great.  I now share with my daughters.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get as sudsy as I would like in a body wash. I use it with a washcloth and the washcloth absorbs it almost immediately without it reaching my skin. Perhaps if I used a loofa-type sponge it would be more effective.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different types of body wash and concluded that Oil of Olay Advanced Ribbons beats them all.&lt;br /&gt;I always had to apply lotion after washing, in order to keep my body silky smooth.  With this product, that is no longer necessary.&lt;br /&gt;The body wash not only does a wonderful job of cleaning, but it leaves your skin feeling soft.  I would recommend this product over any other.  Please don&#x27;t mistake this for other Oil of Olay washes, this one outshines them all.</li>
            <li> Great product and great scent.  I have been using Oil of Olay for as long as i can remember.  I love the ribbons product they have come out with.  I&#x27;ve never had a problem with dry skin with this product and always get complimented on the smell.</li>
            <li> To me this is the best bath wash there is around. It makes your skin soft and leaves you with a wonderful smell on your body. I use this bath wash all the time.&lt;br /&gt;If you have never tried it you are in for a treat. It is just wonderful.</li>
            <li> After trying several body washes, I found Olay Body Wash with Almond Oil which is the only moisturizing Olay body wash with a light fresh scent that doesn&#x27;t battle with my cologne, and leaves my skin feeling smooth and silky after my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proctor &amp; Gamble recently decided to add rose essence, making it a much stronger and almost sicky sweet scent - described by P&amp;G Customer Service as their new \\&quot;floral fruity scent\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I don&#x27;t mind paying more for a product if I really like it - and I really liked this product with JUST the almond oil.  The \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; version however is not something I would buy - even on sale with a coupon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the three stores in my area that carry Olay body wash, the almond oil creme ribbons flew off the shelves.  Why they felt the need to change a product that was obviously selling well escapes me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to using Olay, I used Yves Saint Laurent.  It runs a very close second to Olay with Almond Oil, and now that Olay with Almond Oil only is no longer available, I will return to YSL for my bath products.</li>
            <li> I DIDNT LIKE THE SMELL IT LEFT</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s spelled \\&quot;Creme\\&quot; ribbons, but \\&quot;Cream\\&quot; is more like it.  I love this product, and when our local Wal-Mart stopped carrying it I came to Amazon.com immediately to look for it.  I was thrilled to find out that not only did they have it, but I could put in a standing order to have it delivered to my door automatically on my time schedule.  \\&quot;Creme Ribbons\\&quot; is just that.  Never oily, smells great and leaves a few tiny little \\&quot;sparkles\\&quot; on your skin.  I have no idea what they are, and you have to strain your eyes to see them, but they make your skin look and feel amazing.  I highly recommend this product and hope they never stop making it.  Olay products truly do help your skin look and feel younger.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, but what else would you expect from the people at Olay. I was pleased with the product and discovered it doesn&#x27;t take as much per shower as the cheaper products.</li>
            <li> was not what i wanted but used it up was not what i was getting in the store but they quit selling it.</li>
            <li> Out in the country and lots of minerals in water. Forced air electric heat . My sister and I were both  getting dry itchy skin after our showers. My mother recommended this to my sister. I bought the 3 pack.  Our skin has never felt so good. I would highly recommend this to any one having dry itchy skin.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, it&#x27;s very moisturizing and smells so good. The scent lingers for hours, almost like a perfumed lotion, but in soap form. It has a clean scent, kind of flowery.</li>
            <li> As I have bought one before this in shop, I decided to try ordering online. The price does not differ much. The things are exactly the same, I guess. So do not worry about the quality. It also saves you time and effort to get it from a supermarket.</li>
            <li> THIS BODY WASH IS GREAT.  I HAVE VERY DRY SKIN AND HAVE JUST STARTES USING THE  BODY WASH 7 DAYS AGO AND I ALL READY SEE AN IMPROVEMENT.  THANK YOU FO A GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Wonderfully soft skin and no itchy dry tightness later. I have very dry skin and winter makes it worse. This body wash really helps keep me from drying out so badly!</li>
            <li> This body wash is pleasantly scented and left my skin moisturized and soft. It is one of the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this body wash and refuse to use anything other than Olay. It can cost me about 8 dollars a bottle. I get it cheaper online and get the exact ones I want. It leaves your skin soft and smooth. It is also great to use for shaving.</li>
            <li> This body wash keeps your entire body silky smooth...and if you add a couple drops of your favorite body oil with it...you smell delicious...depending on the oil scent.</li>
            <li> Using regular soap/body wash tends to dry my skin out which obviously isn&#x27;t something that I like or want. I can fix the problem by applying lotion after a shower but I don&#x27;t have time for that nor do I feel like spending extra money on lotion. I tried Olay Ribbons years ago when it came out and have been using it since. My skin is left soft and moisturized without adding a step in my daily routine. I absolutely love it!</li>
