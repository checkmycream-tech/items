            <li>Has purchased these set with a Perfume purchase but this was a good deal without having to purchase any perfume.</li>
            <li>My daughter loved it.  </li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>My mother in law, who is 88, loved it.</li>
            <li>but I love the mascara and cosmetic bag!</li>
            <li>kind of a bummer</li>
            <li>The cosmetic bag is also a nice makeup compartment for your purse.</li>
            <li>Pleased with purchase, so good.</li>
            <li>Thank you :) very satisfied</li>
            <li>this is a good way to try products before you spend money on the full size</li>
            <li>This was a great gift set and we are both enjoying it very much.</li>
            <li>Its just okay.</li>
            <li>My grandmother really enjoyed this.</li>
            <li>love estee lauder</li>
            <li>I love the lipstick.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>good product and fast shipment</li>
            <li>Thank you Amazon for making it easy to purchase.</li>
            <li>Made a great Christmas present.</li>
            <li>All the skin products offered are fantastic for your skin care needs.</li>
            <li>I managed to clean off the stuff and its usable except for the night serum of course.</li>
            <li>, now I want it in full size.  </li>
            <li>Good deal, except u don&#x27;t get to choose colors, lipstick is light pink frost, will use over darker color, nice lil collection &amp; makeup bag, small sample size eye cream, overall good gift for friend, etc</li>
            <li>Thanks!  </li>
            <li>I love this bag, of course sample parts are super small, but really worth buying.</li>
            <li>Very upset.</li>
            <li>Fast service.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the day cream so much</li>
            <li>I like so much.</li>
            <li>These are sample bags you get for free when you spend more than $35 on Estee Lauder at Macy&#x27;s and other similar retail stores.</li>
            <li>Everything was new and unopened.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t the first Estee Lauder product I have ordered by Amazon and it definitely won&#x27;t be my last.</li>
            <li>disappointed by the colors, but gave me a chance to try some wonderful products in the bag.  </li>
            <li>So in my opinion its not worth spending $20 or more on these things when there tiny little samples you can get for free with your purchase in the store.</li>
            <li>Not happy with this purchase, i paid for items that the stores give for free!</li>

            <li> I have instant long long lashes</li>
            <li> I spent 30 bucks on this sample pack</li>
            <li> Not what I expected..</li>
            <li> Hope this clears up any confusion from prior reviews that said the product was missing items.</li>
            <li> The night repair serum completley emptied out into the rest of the product and I am not sure if it went un-noticed prior to shipping or if it happened during.</li>
            <li> Otherwise the small sample sizes of facial care I do like.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheating ، coz not all the collection delivered some r missing as ishadow delivered just one also the lipstick</li>
            <li> Missing 3 items on the package...</li>
            <li> The lavender sparkles compliment my green eyes,  the lip stick is so creamy and luscious.  </li>
            <li> It was missing one of the lipsticks</li>
            <li> the skin care small jar inlet one</li>
            <li> This item was purchased for my daughter as she loves to go through samples and small size items.  </li>
            <li> I missing some stuff!</li>
            <li> Did not come with all that is shown in picture, and eyeshadow was broken!</li>
            <li> You cant go wrong with this makeup !</li>
            <li> What I learned from this is to becareful on what I order!!! :(</li>

            <li> disappointed by the colors, but gave me a chance to try some wonderful products in the bag.  So now I&#x27;m hooked on the face wash.</li>
