            <li>She had never tried baby lips before and she loved it too!</li>
            <li>BUT it gives you a beautiful tint of color.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy....</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a gorgeous purple color</li>
            <li>I really loved it .</li>
            <li>This is a good purchase.</li>
            <li>I love it , my favorite it is a wonderful color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Get it, you&#x27;ll love!</li>
            <li>For Me, I Love Baby Lips!</li>
            <li>It smells nice, and my fiancé likes it on me.</li>
            <li>I thought I was going to be adding a nice, plummy color to my lip pallette this winter.</li>
            <li>and it isn&#x27;t too overwhelming either.</li>
            <li>is her favorite.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s cute, and looks effortless.</li>
            <li>Still love this brand, but I won&#x27;t be buying this shade again.</li>
            <li>Bought one of these for myself because I LOVE the baby lips line.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the things I&#x27;ve always enjoyed about baby lips.</li>
            <li>OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PRODUCT IS JUST WHAT IT SAID IT WOULD BE.  </li>
            <li>I love they taste, the feels, the colors, and the lightness of the tint.</li>
            <li>one is sure to you love it.</li>
            <li>Baby Lips is the best lip balm because it provides a nice color for your lips and hydrates very well, without the downsides of a lip gloss like getting your hair stuck on your lips on a windy day, or the overpigmented lipsticks that dry out your lips throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Like a cheap lipstick (which it is).</li>
            <li>although every other baby lips that I own has a nice scent to it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This makes you lips feel alive and amazing again.</li>
            <li>I like this better than Bert&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s because it glides on nicely and doesn&#x27;t have the odd smell that I dislike with Bert&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Normally I am ecstatic about any Baby Lips that I buy: they are light, very moisturizing and they are subtle..and all taste/smell</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not gloppy or heavy feeling and the color is great.  </li>
            <li>By far this is my favorite</li>
            <li>I love to wear it by itself or with a clear lipgloss.</li>
            <li>But this one is kind of gross.</li>
            <li>I was thinking it was a nice plum color, but actually it seemed to make my lips pale-looking.</li>
            <li>It is totally worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The texture on my lips is just right.  </li>
            <li>Very subtle, but perfect to reapply often.</li>
            <li>I kinda like it too ;).</li>
            <li>I am someone that uses Fresh Lip Products, which are highly moisturizing and beneficial in the winter months.  </li>
            <li>Came pretty fast too.</li>
            <li>I love these, and I think I&#x27;ve bought every single one except the electro line (not my thing).</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t live up to the standards of every other baby lips I own.</li>
            <li>it smelled very funky.</li>
            <li>Plus it was very inexpensive</li>
            <li>very chemically/waxy.</li>
            <li>THE WHOLE ORDER BEFORE PROMISED.</li>
            <li>I have bought a lot because my whole family loves it.</li>
            <li>For the price, this is very moisturizing and the moisture lasts for about 4-5 hours w/o eating.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend you don&#x27;t buy this , unless you like the smell of a rotten plum.</li>
            <li>(Just a heads up to the people who don&#x27;t have much of a colorful pink lips in the first place)</li>
            <li>I look horrible in warm tones and this one is a nice cool mauve color that enhances my natural lip color.  </li>
            <li>This was the second color I bought, I received the first one as a gift.</li>
            <li>Seems my 10 year old granddaughter has a collection of the Baby Lips Lip Balms and she had to have this one!  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell good, just weird but able to get past it</li>
            <li>Thankful for these hard to find Limited edition Baby Lips, my cousin is going to be delighted, just what she wanted.</li>
            <li>a old hand-me-down from the bottom of my aunt&#x27;s purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yuck.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it&#x27;s old stock?</li>
            <li>This baby lips doesn&#x27;t have much color on me, only a little shine really.</li>
            <li>The color of the balm itself is NOTHING like the picture (a deep plum) but more of an opaque duty rose color (think grandmas old couch) and tastes TERRIBLE (like old play lipstick from a child..</li>
            <li>I also put on one of the clear baby lips such as quenched or peppermint before bed.</li>
            <li>The packaging looked very tattered when it arrived, although it had been packed carefully.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a frosted color or overly shiny which I also like because after a certain age frosted lip colors look odd.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I purchased this not too long ago, and will not be buying again.</li>
            <li> It has been way too long.</li>
            <li> I want my baby lips within the next few days.</li>
            <li> I was getting disappointed because this is my favorite color and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.</li>
            <li> I was most disappointed in that this one had no scent,</li>
            <li> its not as dark as it looks .</li>
            <li> The package came black, and bent looked used.</li>
            <li> but I think it was dried out because of breakage.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed and aggravated right now.</li>
            <li> This one arrived broken and the color is not much either</li>
            <li> one was a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t go on thick.</li>
            <li> This was very thin feeling on my lips, no real smell or color significance.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to lip balm and this is one of my tops in brands.</li>
            <li> My GF goes crazy over these baby lips.</li>
            <li> I even mix it with a lipstick sometimes, and use it as a moisturizing base.</li>

            <li> By far this is my favorite, it&#x27;s a gorgeous purple color and it isn&#x27;t too overwhelming either. The perfect balance.</li>
            <li> I purchased this not too long ago, and will not be buying again. The package came black, and bent looked used. it smelled very funky. I highly recommend you don&#x27;t buy this , unless you like the smell of a rotten plum. pricey as well!</li>
            <li> My GF goes crazy over these baby lips. She must have every different one they offer and the yummy plummy is her favorite. I kinda like it too ;).</li>
            <li> I was getting disappointed because this is my favorite color and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. So finally I looked on here and there it was! Plus it was very inexpensive so I bought 3 tubes! Came pretty fast too.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel gross and sticky. Tint of pinkish purple color. Very subtle, but perfect to reapply often. It smells nice, and my fiancé likes it on me. Lil fruity, but you almost can&#x27;t even smell/or taste it. I love to wear it by itself or with a clear lipgloss. I even mix it with a lipstick sometimes, and use it as a moisturizing base. I love it. This was the second color I bought, I received the first one as a gift. And it&#x27;s cute, and looks effortless. BUT it gives you a beautiful tint of color. Lasts awhile before you have to reapply. NO tingling sensation like Burts Beees, Though I do like Burts sometimes. Get it, you&#x27;ll love! And it doesn&#x27;t go on thick. It is a perfect application!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad/old one of the badge. But this one is kind of gross. The color of the balm itself is NOTHING like the picture (a deep plum) but more of an opaque duty rose color (think grandmas old couch) and tastes TERRIBLE (like old play lipstick from a child.. very chemically/waxy. And smells as such too)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally I am ecstatic about any Baby Lips that I buy: they are light, very moisturizing and they are subtle..and all taste/smell good!&lt;br /&gt;This one was a big disappointment. I thought I was going to be adding a nice, plummy color to my lip pallette this winter. Instead I feel like a got a old hand-me-down from the bottom of my aunt&#x27;s purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yuck.</li>
            <li> This was very thin feeling on my lips, no real smell or color significance. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend. Like a cheap lipstick (which it is).</li>
            <li> This Maybelline Baby lips balm is the best one ever...</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell good, just weird but able to get past it</li>
            <li> I was thinking it was a nice plum color, but actually it seemed to make my lips pale-looking. Still love this brand, but I won&#x27;t be buying this shade again. (Just a heads up to the people who don&#x27;t have much of a colorful pink lips in the first place)</li>
            <li> Bought one of these for myself because I LOVE the baby lips line. Then I got one for my mom in this color. She had never tried baby lips before and she loved it too! Baby Lips is the best lip balm because it provides a nice color for your lips and hydrates very well, without the downsides of a lip gloss like getting your hair stuck on your lips on a windy day, or the overpigmented lipsticks that dry out your lips throughout the day. I love these, and I think I&#x27;ve bought every single one except the electro line (not my thing). I put some on in the morning and then take it with me in my purse to refresh throughout the day. I also put on one of the clear baby lips such as quenched or peppermint before bed. I&#x27;ve been using baby lips about 10 months and have never had chapped lips again! They are definitely my go-to lip product.</li>
            <li> The packaging looked very tattered when it arrived, although it had been packed carefully. This baby lips doesn&#x27;t have much color on me, only a little shine really. I was most disappointed in that this one had no scent, although every other baby lips that I own has a nice scent to it. It&#x27;s one of the things I&#x27;ve always enjoyed about baby lips.

            <li> Yummy For Me, I Love Baby Lips! I am addicted to lip balm and this is one of my tops in brands. I love they taste, the feels, the colors, and the lightness of the tint. If you want a long lasting color this is so not meant for you, because guess what, this is a lip balm not a lip stick or lip stain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This makes you lips feel alive and amazing again.

            <li> I really loved it . its not as dark as it looks . I have bought a lot because my whole family loves it.</li>
            <li> Seems my 10 year old granddaughter has a collection of the Baby Lips Lip Balms and she had to have this one!  She&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy....</li>
            <li> I am someone that uses Fresh Lip Products, which are highly moisturizing and beneficial in the winter months.  For the price, this is very moisturizing and the moisture lasts for about 4-5 hours w/o eating.  This is a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I love it , my favorite it is a wonderful color.&lt;br /&gt;A purple color.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s wonderful color.&lt;br /&gt;Any one is sure to you love it.</li>
            <li> I bought Yummy Plummy at Rite Aid for under $4.00 &amp; I would recommend it and will buy it again. The texture on my lips is just right.  It&#x27;s not gloppy or heavy feeling and the color is great.  I look horrible in warm tones and this one is a nice cool mauve color that enhances my natural lip color.  It&#x27;s not a frosted color or overly shiny which I also like because after a certain age frosted lip colors look odd.  I like this better than Bert&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s because it glides on nicely and doesn&#x27;t have the odd smell that I dislike with Bert&#x27;s Bees.</li>
