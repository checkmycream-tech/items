            <li>Great gray coverage!</li>
            <li>foe the best results.</li>
            <li>Maybe it might not be the best if wanting to deposit a lot of color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>color - the results are perfect.  </li>
            <li>However, this one looks perfect from the start.  </li>
            <li>At best, it upgraded the feel from wires to straw.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what I like the best!</li>

            <li>The best price I have found on this brand of dye and it works really good.</li>
            <li>instead, I&#x27;m happy to say that this product worked beautifully and WITHOUT stinging/itching/irritation to my scalp.  </li>
            <li>You can get great results with great products like this hair color and WEN.</li>
            <li>No ammonia or peroxide and smelled great.  </li>
            <li>The color was great.....</li>
            <li>It smelled great, and even tho</li>
            <li>Then you use the conditioner, which smells fab and does a great job of detangling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells great</li>
            <li>My roots came out great</li>
            <li>Brushing touching etc!!</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s gonna look cute going to work looking like a striped animal!!</li>
            <li>My color came out very nice (Darkest Brown).  </li>
            <li>How nice!  </li>
            <li>It rinses out fine and the color is awesome.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I have loved it ever since.  </li>
            <li>and I have loved it.  </li>
            <li>It smelled good and didn&#x27;t drip.  </li>
            <li>- I use a profession dye brush so that I get good coverage.  </li>
            <li>- Didn&#x27;t give good coverage of grey&lt;br</li>
            <li>So it is a good option for people like me.</li>
            <li>It smells and feels good.  </li>
            <li>Huge spots of my hair were somehow not dyed!!</li>
            <li>so I stick to the 3 which I love!</li>
            <li>I love this hair dye!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m okay with the end result I achieve, but not blown away or super impressed.  </li>
            <li>The price is amazing too.  </li>
            <li>Since then I have had amazingly fly-away, static-filled hair.</li>
            <li>liked the applicator,&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color is nice however...</li>
            <li>I liked the consistency if the dye.</li>
            <li>And it kind of looks like I covered my hair with shoe polish or something</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m probably going to have to do a warm olive oil treatment to repair the damage</li>
            <li>I used my own shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>so kind of came as a shock)</li>
            <li>I color my own hair</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best hair color I&#x27;ve tried OTC and better than the Nutrisse by miles.  </li>
            <li>This is the best by far!</li>
            <li>I also cut my own hair in a three way mirror and get many compliments.</li>
            <li>Product LOOKED smooth and smelled good too.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with how it looks and feels; I honestly would have thought I&#x27;d have to spend 4x as much by going to a salon to get these results.  </li>
            <li>Very smooth, no wires.</li>
            <li>So I switched to Nice &amp; Easy and used it every 2 months or so until I tried Olia about a month</li>
            <li>I get out of the Clairol Nice &#x27;N Easy box (buy this just for the conditioner).  </li>
            <li>The colour was a lovely shade</li>
            <li>OK.</li>
            <li>(Ammonia Free!  </li>
            <li>I love &amp;#</li>
            <li>I have washed my hair two more times since Friday.</li>
            <li>While I love the color, the application is faulty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that it does not dye my scalp or my forehead.  </li>
            <li>Still love being able to pay $10 vs $60</li>
            <li>I do have around 10% gray and it covers OK</li>
            <li>Color is ok.  </li>
            <li>Hair felt better after that.  </li>
            <li>I also like it because it&#x27;s more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; based and doesn&#x27;t have ammonia.</li>
            <li>Garnier Olga Oil satisfied all three requirements.</li>
            <li>I have tried many brands over the years and this one is definitely my favorite.  </li>
            <li>What I love the most is the color results.</li>
            <li>I have been using Naturtint for years (which I love), but it is hars to find in stores.</li>
            <li>I recommend it. :)</li>
            <li>However this damaged my healthy hair to the point where I had to get 2 inches cut off the ends.</li>
            <li>I got so many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>I sure hope the color lasts.</li>
            <li>(More rinsing &amp; cleaning)</li>
            <li>More importantly, ALL the grays were still showing!  </li>
            <li>and thankfully I found a color that works much better.  </li>
            <li>I love this haircolor.  </li>
            <li>Most manufacturers don&#x27;t make a violet for gray hair, but I have people stop me on the street, saying they love it, and ask what color I&#x27;m using.  </li>
            <li>: The color is perfect, there is no horrible smell (it smells fruity), and being a blonde shade, I did not have the issues with the color fading as some others have noted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>In fact, I would describe it more as squirting out of my hands.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish that Garnier would have perfected Olia before eliminating shades from Nutrisse (which IMO is a better product), but I&#x27;ll stick with it because I like the color</li>
            <li>It also leaves your hair looking healthy.</li>
            <li>First box: excellent coverage on the first 2-3&amp;#34; of hair (closest to scalp) -</li>
            <li>sure I want to buy this product again.</li>
            <li>I love this for her hair.</li>
            <li>I also love the conditioner in the tube.  </li>
            <li>It also stained my skin more then any hair color</li>
            <li>Twist of the top of the mixing bottle and combine the two color solutions and shake.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE that there is no ammonia and is oil based.</li>
            <li>I mostly chose to color my hair at home to cover my grays and save money.</li>
            <li>but the color overall is gorgeous!!</li>
            <li>I wish I could give this hair color a better review</li>
            <li>For once I&#x27;m not having to use a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser to clean my ears :o)</li>
            <li>Absolutely destroyed my hair!!!!</li>
            <li>Initially, I liked the original application bottle, and I was impressed at how easily the color and the toner came out of their respective tubes.</li>
            <li>So it turned my hair a good pretty color, EXCEPT it did not fully color all my grays.</li>
            <li>First, I will say that I absolutely loved the color result of this product.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t have given this product any stars at all, but it DID smell pretty good, so I guess I will give it credit for that.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re sensitive to ammonia, I suppose this would be a great product.</li>
            <li>And lastly, I LOVE that it&#x27;s ammonia free</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am really happy so far with the product.</li>
            <li>The first box dye I&#x27;ve ever tried and I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smells delicious&lt;br /&gt;Thick and easy to apply</li>
            <li>Easy instructions and application.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I found it easy to use.</li>
            <li>love that the color stays true.  </li>
            <li>It was the perfect dark brown.  </li>
            <li>The resulting color was very good and gray areas got better than average coverage.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a warm, beautiful dark rich color.</li>
            <li>I bought this hair dye for the first time and liked the idea of it being ammonia free - who likes burning itchy scalps anyway?</li>
            <li>Color was perfect, it colored my (previously color treated) hair evenly from roots to ends.</li>
            <li>My hair was fine to begin with</li>
            <li>made a huge mistake.\\</li>
            <li>I went from light brown from a clairol product to light brown in a Garnier product.</li>
            <li>Was comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>Throughout the years I&#x27;ve used many different brands and liked some better than others.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li>I do wash with sulfate free shampoo and conditioners and it the color lasts.  </li>
            <li>I used light brown on my already auburn with graying around temple hair.</li>
            <li>the 4 looks too light</li>
            <li>I applied the conditioner they so thoughtfully provided, and now I see why they advise you to  leave it in for two minutes.  </li>
            <li>What can I say, I&#x27;m cheap.</li>
            <li>This color is great and I only used on box.</li>
            <li>This is ammonia free</li>
            <li>I got a fabulous compliment from my boyfriend who can&#x27;t believe how well the color turned out compared to m y $200 salon dye</li>
            <li>I used this in the light auburn.</li>
            <li>I love this so much, I just bought 2 more</li>
            <li>Leave it on for the full amount of time (30 minutes) and just follow the easy directions.</li>
            <li>oil infused dye was a nice change though and did leave my hair softer than normal box</li>
            <li>It went on fairly consistently, but salon results are better of course.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t cover gray worth a darn!</li>
            <li>First I want to say that I actually really love the hair dye.  </li>
            <li>There really is no bad smell, but it most certainly had fumes.</li>
            <li>Best of all it DID dye my very gray hair the dark brown 4.0 it promised.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it was just my mistake to assume \\&quot;Intense\\&quot; meant bright red, and not fluorescent.</li>
            <li>Overall color results good.</li>
            <li>Full coverage of grays.</li>
            <li>I could not get the cap to go on straight no matter how many times I tried</li>
            <li>Only use this when you have a good chunk of time to spend rinsing.  </li>
            <li>My true color is between 3 and 4.</li>
            <li>The packaging was cool</li>
            <li>; could not get enough of how good my hair smelled.  </li>
            <li>After much research, we found out that if you soak you hair with vinegar and leave it in for about 20 minutes, you can get rid of most of the smell (it might take out some of the color too, not sure.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Coverage is not bad-</li>
            <li>It rinsed out easily and didn&#x27;t stain my scalp, which was nice, but it left my hair feeling like greasy, oily straw.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, great product.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s nice and thick and easy to apply, and the color (at first) is gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>I love the product, but the bottle is like a live thing!  </li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t any ammonia smell, color rinsed out quickly with no oily residue.  </li>
            <li>I like Vidal Sassoon and John Frieda a lot but unless the formulations they&#x27;ve just come out with are as mild smelling as this, Olia will be my permanent brand.</li>
            <li>Luckily, the color was</li>
            <li>only plus side of this experience is that I went to a Color Xperts Salon, and they not only got the dye out, but gave me the best hair color I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend applying this olio with a hair coloring brush and mixing it in a bowl for better, easier</li>
            <li>too light, but pretty color.&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li>-- this is the first dye I have found that is ammonia free AND permanent.  </li>
            <li>I have sisterloc and wanted a quick, fast, and easy process to dye my hair.</li>
            <li>My natural color is dishwater blond that tends to turn coppery when I lighten it, so I was using Nutrisse Light Ash Blonde for years with great success.</li>
            <li>As it was a Garnier product I thought that it would be easy to swop over to Garnier 10.0 Very Light Blonde as the instructions documented</li>
            <li>Although its great that there&#x27;s no ammonia I did have a lot of breakage and the darkest brown turned out black.</li>
            <li>Looking at the ingredients is obvious there are miscellaneous chemicals used with this product and the oils top bottom of the list!</li>
            <li>The whole shower floor, walls, curtain, and my body was SPLATTERED in what looked like something from a horror movie!!</li>
            <li>It smelled pretty and clean.  </li>
            <li>I used the natural light auburn on fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars because the actual hair dye is amazing.</li>
            <li>expect salon quality endurance, but it&#x27;s still worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, it says in the directions to make sure the applicator cap screws on completely before use.</li>
            <li>Natural Instincts shade was ok.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>It has been by far the MOST DAMAGING hair dye I have ever used in my 10+ years of hair color and trust me</li>
            <li>I chose the darkest golden brown.</li>
            <li>Her hair dresser always says how healthy shiny soft and no damage rarely any split ends.</li>
            <li>I was excited to find a dye without ammonia, so bought the Intense Auburn 6.60.</li>
            <li>It is OIL based right?  </li>
            <li>So I used it anyway, even with the cap not on exactly right.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not even the right color.  </li>
            <li>With the gloves on, the bottle slips right out of my hands.</li>
            <li>It has left my hair like straw and full of static ??</li>
            <li>I have been using Garnier Nutrisse Nourishing Hair Color (#30 Sweet Cola) for several years and love it.</li>
            <li>This habit creates a major static storm, something that had never happened before.</li>
            <li>I had it on for 25 minutes and the color is nice on the hair that wasn&#x27;t grey</li>
            <li>Nice &amp; Easy was a little too bright red and not as natural</li>
            <li>The grey coverage was good and the color was decent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After seeing all those fabulous commercials with women with just colored, shiny, silky-smooth hair, I decided to opt in for this new color experience by Garnier.</li>
            <li>It is remarkably easy to put in your hair and there are no messy drips on your neck or forehead.  </li>
            <li>I usually use Loreal Preference and not long ago tried an organic colorant called Tints of Nature, both of which worked great!</li>
            <li>It washed out pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Followed directions exactly.</li>
            <li>well, smell is so much better than traditional hair color</li>
            <li>The instructions were followed exactly.</li>
            <li>This review is from my wife, Lisa, and I corroborate her story ;-)</li>
            <li>Thank God I had just cleaned because I had to scrape up most of the developer off the walls, cabinets, and floor and place it back in the bottle.  </li>
            <li>but my hair is dyed and it looks pretty and shinny for now.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been dying my hair various shades of auburn for 18 years, and I&#x27;ve tried many, many different brands, and every one has faded to the point where I don&#x27;t even notice my roots when they grow out.  </li>
            <li>I tried it for the first time yesterday.</li>
            <li>it took FOREVER to rinse out, I literally ran out of hot water&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li>should mention that I go with light auburns to try to closely match my natural color.  </li>
            <li>Worth it in the long run, but be prepared &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>the dye color - one of the browns - is hanging it pretty OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Loreal and Garnier are a bit higher quality and won&#x27;t leave your hair fried.</li>
            <li>I followed the directly exactly.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t use shampoo or even hot water.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ever reacted to a hair dye.  </li>
            <li>My first thought was, to quote Gob Bluth, \\&quot;I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>still looks as it first did.</li>
            <li>Not only was my hair patchy because of all the missed spots, but most of the spots that did get dyed turned NEON pink/red.</li>
            <li>At first.  </li>
            <li>The color turned out pretty</li>
            <li>Overall, it did not color as well or leave my hair as healthy looking and shiny as Nutratint.</li>
            <li>I tried this for the first time.</li>
            <li>I have colored my hair for decades, (I&#x27;m 54, and hve colored my hair since I was 12)  using many  different shades of color.</li>
            <li>This  product did exactly what it said it would do.</li>
            <li>I got exactly what I  paid for and would  buy this product again.</li>
            <li>So the first day was a good day for a messy updo.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I was using higher end products based on the bottles</li>
            <li>Again, glad I have short hair.</li>
            <li>Also, my hair feels much dryer right after coloring than it did with Nutrisse, although that goes away after the first couple of washings (I also use Garnier Fructis shampoo and conditioner).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very dry, brittle hair, and I thought this haircolor would be gentle and make my hair nice and silky.  </li>
            <li>One of the more gentle hair colors that you can buy at the local CVS or Walgreens.</li>
            <li>Let me first say that I have been touching up the grey hair at my temples for a decade.</li>
            <li>VERY pretty color, the little grey I had (or as I like to say, &amp;#34;My Bling Strands&amp;#34; were gone, and my hair was great.  </li>
            <li>The color is also very rich and natural looking, very close to my natural color, which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Most commercial hair colors are filled with so many horrid chemicals that they will leave your hair a complete mess.</li>
            <li>Love it for my dry hair.</li>
            <li>I tend to have dry hair, and my hair is silky, the color is even, and I love it.</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s 60% oil based, my hair 3 weeks later after coloring it is still healthy looking, shiny, NO roots, not dull or washed out,</li>
            <li>: The name \\&quot;Olia\\&quot; reminds me of a certain synthetic fat product that was a marketing disaster.</li>
            <li>I have fairly large hands, but even I could not manage to hang onto the bulb-shaped bottle, let alone squeeze out the product in a uniform manner.</li>
            <li>I will certainly keep using the product vs $150 salons.</li>
            <li>I also thought it was kind of drying to my hair, hair feels a little more brittle and dry to the touch.</li>
            <li>I typically use Nutratint a more natural, vegetable based colorant available in health food stores and online at Amazon.</li>
            <li>I am quite familiar with home hair coloring since I am of an age where those pesky grays pop up on a regular basis &amp; I don&#x27;t need any help looking older, so I cover them up right away.  </li>
            <li>A huge recommend and the only hair color</li>
            <li>I have always taken so much pride with my hair</li>
            <li>It is really important to read peoples reviews, I only wish I had done it sooner, but I felt that the advertisement had now found a revolutionary product to sweep the market.</li>
            <li>The applicator bottle is too big to fit in my hand.  </li>
            <li>I applied section by section, my hair is shoulder-length, and I used the whole bottle.</li>
            <li>and I really saturated all of my hair with every drop of the color</li>
            <li>I try to split this in to two applications because it has too much oil for my hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the feel of the hair when I apply the whole package.</li>
            <li>5 weeks ago I used Olia because the &amp;#34;no ammonia&amp;#34; really appealed to me.</li>
            <li>Anything by Clairol or Revlon is an absolute disaster.</li>
            <li>When I was done my hair was not that much darker and it was splotchy and streaky.</li>
            <li>Who knows how fast it will wash out?</li>
            <li>and It doesn&#x27;t cover the gray very well at all.</li>
            <li>So thanks Olia, for swearing me off of box dye from now on.</li>
            <li>I worked it in really well and let it sit for another 20 min.</li>
            <li>I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Since I can no longer find it, I bought the Olia 9.0 Light Blonde and tried it about 6 weeks ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>I only ever use ammonia free dyes like Revlon Color Silk or the like</li>
            <li>Oh and NO Ammonia so gentle and doesn&#x27;t burn your scalp.</li>
            <li>Was very disapointed.</li>
            <li>If your hair is  much longer you will need 2 packages of color.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>If you are at all concerned about this, you might want to stay away from the whole family of Garnier Olia products.</li>
            <li>The step #3 conditioner is very luxurious.</li>
            <li>I am devastated, this has turned my hair blue, grey from a beautiful blonde colour.</li>
            <li>(If you are a visual person who can actually do your own hair.)</li>
            <li>Made my hair turn green which had ever happened to me after years of dying my own hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only been a couple of days, but so far, I am pleased.</li>
            <li>you would get the impression that this hair color uses only natural vegetable oils and no nasty chemicals.</li>
            <li>The mixture is not drippy at all, not at all, it is thick like a good conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised at some of the less enthusiastic reviews here - I will have to see how long the color lasts etc., but  for now, the day after colouring, I am extremely pleased.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly, coloring my whole head because it was a new shade and it had been a while.</li>
            <li>I should have just gone somewhere else, but for whatever reason, I decided that this one sounded like it might be a bit more gentle on my hair than the other hair dyes I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li>and it left my hair nice and shiny, but the color is flat and it looks like I colored my hair.  </li>
            <li>The smell is a clean floral, not overpowering, it is a very desirable scent - and the conditioner smells similar and If I could buy the conditioner I would.  </li>
            <li>I was horrified when I looked in the mirror to see my hair about 7 shades darker than normal!</li>
            <li>tty color, the little grey I had (or as I like to say, &amp;#34;My Bling Strands&amp;#34; were gone, and my hair was great.  </li>
            <li>What happened to 10 minutes like normal hair color?!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally dye my own hair ( too messy)</li>
            <li>I ended up having to rinse my gloves to wash the sink clean several times (and surrounding areas as well)</li>
            <li>First of all the developer is not in the dispenser, in my opinion this is a waste and just creates one more piece of trash for me to throw out.  </li>
            <li>I tried Olia for the first time last month, in dark intense auburn, and for the first time ever, I have visible and easily noticeable roots!  </li>
            <li>All and all I would use it again in a hair eat because my hair didn&#x27;t get as dried out as the other dyes, it was easy to use, it smelled amazing.</li>
            <li>I much prefer Nutratint as it gives a very natural, shiny result and covers grays very well.</li>
            <li>The top of my hair is in the orang family and the bottom is dark.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Sweet Cola for several years and people didn&#x27;t know I colored my hair until I told them I did.  </li>
            <li>WOW I used the other type Nutrise before and loved it, and this is the only color at the store.</li>
            <li>Please note that the natural auburn is quite subtle, if you are looking for a redder light auburn (say something like Loreal&#x27;s Excellence Light Auburn) then get the intense red light auburn shade instead.  </li>
            <li>The color is still vibrant.  </li>
            <li>Two weeks, three coconut oil treatments, and many hair repairing products later, my hair is finally beginning to not feel like straw.</li>
            <li>My only consolation is that my hair grows quickly.</li>
            <li>I am not very good at dying my own hair.  </li>
            <li>Super slick and smooth.</li>
            <li>the color was very uneven, was an intense color (too intense) in the areas where I started and was almost more of a highlight in the areas I ended with</li>
            <li>highly recommend this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this.</li>
            <li>but I trust this a little bit more.</li>
            <li>Once it ran clear, I used the WHOLE bottle of conditioner and finger combed my hair.</li>
            <li>I wear a smooth, longer bob and have a habit of running fingers through my hair to sort of \\&quot;fluff it\\&quot; when reading or thinking.</li>
            <li>My hair is golden blonde with orange tints.</li>
            <li>The Sweet Cola always covered my grey  </li>
            <li>It may be ammonia-free, but there is a chemical equally harsh, possibly more so in it.</li>
            <li>Will be purchasing this color again, unless it proves to under perform in next couple of weeks!</li>
            <li>I did take my usual benadryl before, and as a precaution 1 more dose, but didn&#x27;t really need it.  </li>
            <li>Worse than even a temporary color, this didn&#x27;t take at all and within days, was as good as gone.</li>
            <li>I even left it on for 40 mins instead of the recommended 30, and the silver is all still here, right after the shower to rinse out the dye.</li>
            <li>No matter what root booster, mousse, hair spray or thickener I use (all with good results in the past) my hair lays flat on my skull and refuses to come to life.</li>
            <li>but I thought that this product was ammonia free and could be used on other hair colours as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Reading the label - especially the legible part (much of it is illegible)</li>
            <li>, it looks very natural.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks very natural from day one.  </li>
            <li>All my grays are gone and the color looks very natural.</li>
            <li>It covered the gray and my hair was very soft.  </li>
            <li>But clearly, I lacked imagination!</li>
            <li>and I have used Garnier Belle Colour Extra Light Natural Blonde for 16 years</li>
            <li>I am so upset and devastated and find myself in a position to find a way to get my hair back to its original blonde colour.</li>
            <li>but I felt compelled to complete my mission!  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anybody who lacks patience, has arthritis or doesn&#x27;t have a wild sense of humor!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I love all of their products usually.  </li>
            <li>According to the box, my natural haircolor with the dye should have produced a darker color than the front of box, so I dont know what happened there!  </li>
            <li>Will go back to my more expensive Nutratint because it is a better and probably safer hair color product.</li>
            <li>I mixed the product and applied it quickly with a brush, starting from the roots.</li>
            <li>For the record, I used black and the shade was quite nice but unremarkable compared to other brands.&lt;br /&gt;Stay</li>
            <li>The process was easy, easier than some of the other at home products I&#x27;ve used, and the thick conditioner left my hair looking and feeling soft, with more volume and shinier than before.</li>
            <li>This stuff won&#x27;t rinse clearly...</li>
            <li>you create a lather in your hair and rinse it out till the water runs clear.  </li>
            <li>The water did run clear, and I did not have color residue on my hair.</li>
            <li>(I may not have rinsed it out completely.</li>
            <li>My hair is curlier, shinier, stronger, bouncy, and soft.</li>
            <li>Since I do not have a sensitive scalp, I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li>And there&#x27;s no obvious grow out line after a whole month.  </li>
            <li>PLUS, the coverage on my greys is still holding - wow.</li>
            <li>So far,</li>
            <li>I could have used four boxes, maybe, but because the dye doesn&#x27;t naturally saturate, and you have to work the dye in to get it to moved from the ONE SPOT</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;color not medium blonde - much blonder.&lt;br /&gt;bottle</li>
            <li>had sheen and felt soft.</li>
            <li>- No harsh ammonia smell</li>
            <li>I was surprised that my locs did sock up the dye.</li>
            <li>I realize that Natural Instincts is semi-permanent, but it also touts the ammonia-free label.</li>
            <li>but that turned out to be because the color was washing out completely.</li>
            <li>This caused it to be soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>The smell didn&#x27;t give me a headache or burn my sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>And it didn&#x27;t completely cover my greys.  </li>
            <li>I am a big fan of Garnier Herbashine, but I haven&#x27;t had much luck finding it anywhere these days.  </li>
            <li>and now I am almost completely bald.</li>
            <li>and i have naturally oily hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to a salon to have this disaster fixed.</li>
            <li>The smell is truly offensive and completely unacceptable.</li>
            <li>I got a medium brown color for my medium brown hair and it put some color to my grays, didn&#x27;t cover them completely</li>
            <li>so I just kept working it in until I thought all the hairs were covered completely.</li>
            <li>So much of it has broken off that it looks kind of like a pine branch, with hairs sticking out at ever angle, for the entire length.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>My hair is thick and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I have thick, healthy hair.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product for other&#x27;s with fine hair with gray.</li>
            <li>This bottle actually slipped right out of my hand about 3 different times.  </li>
            <li>had recently decided to use a more gentle hair dye, because my hair has gotten dry and slightly damaged.  </li>
            <li>cool shaped bottle, chic black gloves.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The &amp;#34;no ammonia&amp;#34;  is a good idea, but very poor results.</li>
            <li>I divided my [dirty] hair into four sections &amp; gently combed through my tight curls with a very wide-tooth comb &amp; moisturized with a light layer of coconut oil to protect &amp; strengthen my hair even more.</li>
            <li>I was dying my hair from dark blonde, and going from light to darker is always a</li>
            <li>I have both home and salon dyed my hair for 8+ years to cover grey, but my scalp is exremely sensitive to the chemicals used, even other ammonia free or semi-permanent colors.  </li>
            <li>The applicator is a strange, bulbous creation that wants to pop out of your hand.</li>
            <li>THEN they don&#x27;t give you enough product for long hair, so you won&#x27;t get full coverage in the back or at the ends of your hair.  </li>
            <li>And I wasn&#x27;t in a big hurry to wash my hair right away, because I had just dyed my hair and didn&#x27;t want to dry it out or stip color with shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always colored my own hair since I&#x27;m just covering grays and staying in the same medium/brown (sometimes a redder brown) category that isn&#x27;t a dramatic change from my natural color.  </li>
            <li>but I dont feel it dry my hair too much</li>
            <li>After 30 mins, I massaged my scalp and hair really well before rinsing in cold water followed by warm.</li>
            <li>I was unable to squeeze all of the developer and color agent into the dispenser, good thing I have short hair.</li>
            <li>The results were just that, a dark cooler toned red, a little bit brighter than the swatch on the bottle but still nice.</li>
            <li>; trim in my very near future.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually write reviews unless I feel very strongly one way or the other about a product.  </li>
            <li>That wasn&#x27;t necessary with this brand, and I&#x27;m definitely trying something a little more subdued next time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After researching for a year, I opted to try this brand on my virgin, deep dark brown, super curly 4b hair.</li>
            <li>and the main reason i color my hair is to cover the grey.</li>
            <li>have not had such a horrendous result since the one time I actually used Clorox on my hair when I was in high school.  </li>
            <li>in fact, water still wasn&#x27;t rinsing clear 5 days later...</li>
            <li>Natural Instincts was my regular until about a year ago when I noticed it was fading out faster.  </li>
            <li>and I double applied the conditioner so my hair felt completely silky.</li>
            <li>I have used many brands of hair dye and never experienced damage to this point.</li>
            <li>I did use the product 2 times and, like other reviewers on line, my hair also fell out in clumps immediately after application and after 2 months, I am experiencing continued, certainly more than normal hair loss every day, to the point where I am seriously concerned of when it is going to stop.</li>
            <li>Then when I went to shake it up, I had a hard time getting a good grip on the oddly football shaped dispenser bottle with really long tip.  </li>
            <li>Normally after a dye, my hair feels extra silky because of the super thick conditioner.</li>
            <li>I tried the new Olia for the first time this past Friday.  </li>
            <li>I left the color on my new growth for an extra 10 minutes and it still didn&#x27;t hold onto the grays.  </li>
            <li>The color is vibrant for about a week (3 washes), and then fades rapidly, especially on the grey hair.  </li>
            <li>The left side of my head has patches of color that took, the top of my head has spots of color and the hair that frames my face is really dark but only about halfway down my hair length.</li>
            <li>Just as much damaged as any other product.  </li>
            <li>The smell is very persistent and hard to get rid of - it doesn&#x27;t wash out readily.</li>
            <li>I have used professional salon colors that I mixed at home, tons of different box colors as well.</li>
            <li>My hair feels silky, not dry.</li>
            <li>The bottle looks really cool but was really hard to hold onto as everyone has already mentioned.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to have to get my head shaved because right now each of the few strands I have left are split and fried to bits.</li>
            <li>Many other brands I have used, come out TOO dark and takes a few washes to tone down to the right shade.  </li>
            <li>have dark brown hair and have to use a dark blonde to get to a light brown shade.  </li>
            <li>I chose 4.60, the Dark Intense Auburn.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t really have the same consistency as other colors i have used before.</li>
            <li>I purchased a medium blonde to try to cover up my platinum blonde highlights in my naturally medium blonde hair.</li>
            <li>Natural Instincts is a nice substitution for other Herbashine users that have any trouble finding thier usual color.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You should know that nobody, nobody is watching out for your health, in terms of potential ill effects of hair dye and many other products, and there is very little meaningful regulation.</li>
            <li>I am normally a bleach blonde with super thin hair.</li>
            <li>Compared to the many other brands I have tried, Olia has the least odor and left my hair the softest.</li>
            <li>If you do a Google search on it, you will find at least one forum where women have had their hair come out in clumps, or they&#x27;ve not been able to get it rinsed out after days and days of washing and rinsing, and other such horrors.</li>
            <li>Bottle is slippery when wet, but I can live with that.  </li>
            <li>Afterwards, I towel-dried my hair, and let it dry naturally.</li>
            <li>I had just gotten my hair cut the same day , and my hair just barely touches my shoulders, and there was just enough  color for me to use.</li>
            <li>I added some of my other usual leave-in conditioners and my hair feels fine.</li>
            <li>It did not cover any of the highlights and only made my natural hair a dry ashy color.</li>
            <li>My hair definitely doesn&#x27;t feel as dry as it did before and got rid of my way to white for a 22 year old roots.</li>
            <li>Okay, so it didn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance, but it took forever to get all the developer out of the container into the applicator bottle - the applicator bottle was shaped poorly and difficult to hold and use (</li>
            <li>My natural hair colour is mid-brown and coloured mid-blonde, but this turned my hair a dull shade of mid-greyish brown, which is really unflattering.</li>

            <li> - Didn&#x27;t give good coverage of grey&lt;br</li>
            <li> So it is a good option for people like me.</li>
            <li> It smells and feels good.  </li>
            <li> Huge spots of my hair were somehow not dyed!!</li>
            <li> so I stick to the 3 which I love!</li>
            <li> I love this hair dye!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m okay with the end result I achieve, but not blown away or super impressed.  </li>
            <li> The price is amazing too.  </li>
            <li> Since then I have had amazingly fly-away, static-filled hair.</li>
            <li> liked the applicator,&lt;br</li>
            <li> The color is nice however...</li>
            <li> I liked the consistency if the dye.</li>
            <li> And it kind of looks like I covered my hair with shoe polish or something</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m probably going to have to do a warm olive oil treatment to repair the damage</li>
            <li> I used my own shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> so kind of came as a shock)</li>
            <li> I color my own hair</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best hair color I&#x27;ve tried OTC and better than the Nutrisse by miles.  </li>
            <li> This is the best by far!</li>
            <li> I also cut my own hair in a three way mirror and get many compliments.</li>
            <li> Product LOOKED smooth and smelled good too.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with how it looks and feels; I honestly would have thought I&#x27;d have to spend 4x as much by going to a salon to get these results.  </li>
            <li> Very smooth, no wires.</li>
            <li> So I switched to Nice &amp; Easy and used it every 2 months or so until I tried Olia about a month</li>
            <li> I get out of the Clairol Nice &#x27;N Easy box (buy this just for the conditioner).  </li>
            <li> The colour was a lovely shade</li>
            <li> OK.</li>
            <li> (Ammonia Free!  </li>
            <li> I love &amp;#</li>
            <li> I have washed my hair two more times since Friday.</li>
            <li> While I love the color, the application is faulty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that it does not dye my scalp or my forehead.  </li>
            <li> Still love being able to pay $10 vs $60</li>
            <li> I do have around 10% gray and it covers OK</li>
            <li> Color is ok.  </li>
            <li> Hair felt better after that.  </li>
            <li> I also like it because it&#x27;s more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; based and doesn&#x27;t have ammonia.</li>
            <li> Garnier Olga Oil satisfied all three requirements.</li>
            <li> I have tried many brands over the years and this one is definitely my favorite.  </li>
            <li> What I love the most is the color results.</li>
            <li> I have been using Naturtint for years (which I love), but it is hars to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I recommend it. :)</li>
            <li> However this damaged my healthy hair to the point where I had to get 2 inches cut off the ends.</li>
            <li> I got so many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> I sure hope the color lasts.</li>
            <li> (More rinsing &amp; cleaning)</li>
            <li> More importantly, ALL the grays were still showing!  </li>
            <li> and thankfully I found a color that works much better.  </li>
            <li> I love this haircolor.  </li>
            <li> Most manufacturers don&#x27;t make a violet for gray hair, but I have people stop me on the street, saying they love it, and ask what color I&#x27;m using.  </li>
            <li> : The color is perfect, there is no horrible smell (it smells fruity), and being a blonde shade, I did not have the issues with the color fading as some others have noted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> In fact, I would describe it more as squirting out of my hands.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish that Garnier would have perfected Olia before eliminating shades from Nutrisse (which IMO is a better product), but I&#x27;ll stick with it because I like the color</li>
            <li> It also leaves your hair looking healthy.</li>
            <li> First box: excellent coverage on the first 2-3&amp;#34; of hair (closest to scalp) -</li>
            <li> sure I want to buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I love this for her hair.</li>
            <li> I also love the conditioner in the tube.  </li>
            <li> It also stained my skin more then any hair color</li>
            <li> Twist of the top of the mixing bottle and combine the two color solutions and shake.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE that there is no ammonia and is oil based.</li>
            <li> I mostly chose to color my hair at home to cover my grays and save money.</li>
            <li> but the color overall is gorgeous!!</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this hair color a better review</li>
            <li> For once I&#x27;m not having to use a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser to clean my ears :o)</li>
            <li> Absolutely destroyed my hair!!!!</li>
            <li> Initially, I liked the original application bottle, and I was impressed at how easily the color and the toner came out of their respective tubes.</li>
            <li> So it turned my hair a good pretty color, EXCEPT it did not fully color all my grays.</li>
            <li> First, I will say that I absolutely loved the color result of this product.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have given this product any stars at all, but it DID smell pretty good, so I guess I will give it credit for that.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re sensitive to ammonia, I suppose this would be a great product.</li>
            <li> And lastly, I LOVE that it&#x27;s ammonia free</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I am really happy so far with the product.</li>
            <li> The first box dye I&#x27;ve ever tried and I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smells delicious&lt;br /&gt;Thick and easy to apply</li>
            <li> Easy instructions and application.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I found it easy to use.</li>
            <li> love that the color stays true.  </li>
            <li> It was the perfect dark brown.  </li>
            <li> The resulting color was very good and gray areas got better than average coverage.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a warm, beautiful dark rich color.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dye for the first time and liked the idea of it being ammonia free - who likes burning itchy scalps anyway?</li>
            <li> Color was perfect, it colored my (previously color treated) hair evenly from roots to ends.</li>
            <li> My hair was fine to begin with</li>
            <li> made a huge mistake.\\</li>
            <li> I went from light brown from a clairol product to light brown in a Garnier product.</li>
            <li> Was comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Throughout the years I&#x27;ve used many different brands and liked some better than others.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I do wash with sulfate free shampoo and conditioners and it the color lasts.  </li>
            <li> I used light brown on my already auburn with graying around temple hair.</li>
            <li> the 4 looks too light</li>
            <li> I applied the conditioner they so thoughtfully provided, and now I see why they advise you to  leave it in for two minutes.  </li>
            <li> What can I say, I&#x27;m cheap.</li>
            <li> This color is great and I only used on box.</li>
            <li> This is ammonia free</li>
            <li> I got a fabulous compliment from my boyfriend who can&#x27;t believe how well the color turned out compared to m y $200 salon dye</li>
            <li> I used this in the light auburn.</li>
            <li> I love this so much, I just bought 2 more</li>
            <li> Leave it on for the full amount of time (30 minutes) and just follow the easy directions.</li>
            <li> oil infused dye was a nice change though and did leave my hair softer than normal box</li>
            <li> It went on fairly consistently, but salon results are better of course.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cover gray worth a darn!</li>
            <li> First I want to say that I actually really love the hair dye.  </li>
            <li> There really is no bad smell, but it most certainly had fumes.</li>
            <li> Best of all it DID dye my very gray hair the dark brown 4.0 it promised.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it was just my mistake to assume \\&quot;Intense\\&quot; meant bright red, and not fluorescent.</li>
            <li> Overall color results good.</li>
            <li> Full coverage of grays.</li>
            <li> I could not get the cap to go on straight no matter how many times I tried</li>
            <li> Only use this when you have a good chunk of time to spend rinsing.  </li>
            <li> My true color is between 3 and 4.</li>
            <li> The packaging was cool</li>
            <li> ; could not get enough of how good my hair smelled.  </li>
            <li> After much research, we found out that if you soak you hair with vinegar and leave it in for about 20 minutes, you can get rid of most of the smell (it might take out some of the color too, not sure.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Coverage is not bad-</li>
            <li> It rinsed out easily and didn&#x27;t stain my scalp, which was nice, but it left my hair feeling like greasy, oily straw.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, great product.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s nice and thick and easy to apply, and the color (at first) is gorgeous.  </li>
            <li> I love the product, but the bottle is like a live thing!  </li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t any ammonia smell, color rinsed out quickly with no oily residue.  </li>
            <li> I like Vidal Sassoon and John Frieda a lot but unless the formulations they&#x27;ve just come out with are as mild smelling as this, Olia will be my permanent brand.</li>
            <li> Luckily, the color was</li>
            <li> only plus side of this experience is that I went to a Color Xperts Salon, and they not only got the dye out, but gave me the best hair color I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend applying this olio with a hair coloring brush and mixing it in a bowl for better, easier</li>
            <li> too light, but pretty color.&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li> -- this is the first dye I have found that is ammonia free AND permanent.  </li>
            <li> I have sisterloc and wanted a quick, fast, and easy process to dye my hair.</li>
            <li> My natural color is dishwater blond that tends to turn coppery when I lighten it, so I was using Nutrisse Light Ash Blonde for years with great success.</li>
            <li> As it was a Garnier product I thought that it would be easy to swop over to Garnier 10.0 Very Light Blonde as the instructions documented</li>
            <li> Although its great that there&#x27;s no ammonia I did have a lot of breakage and the darkest brown turned out black.</li>
            <li> Looking at the ingredients is obvious there are miscellaneous chemicals used with this product and the oils top bottom of the list!</li>
            <li> The whole shower floor, walls, curtain, and my body was SPLATTERED in what looked like something from a horror movie!!</li>
            <li> It smelled pretty and clean.  </li>
            <li> I used the natural light auburn on fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars because the actual hair dye is amazing.</li>
            <li> expect salon quality endurance, but it&#x27;s still worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, it says in the directions to make sure the applicator cap screws on completely before use.</li>
            <li> Natural Instincts shade was ok.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> It has been by far the MOST DAMAGING hair dye I have ever used in my 10+ years of hair color and trust me</li>
            <li> I chose the darkest golden brown.</li>
            <li> Her hair dresser always says how healthy shiny soft and no damage rarely any split ends.</li>
            <li> I was excited to find a dye without ammonia, so bought the Intense Auburn 6.60.</li>
            <li> It is OIL based right?  </li>
            <li> So I used it anyway, even with the cap not on exactly right.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not even the right color.  </li>
            <li> With the gloves on, the bottle slips right out of my hands.</li>
            <li> It has left my hair like straw and full of static ??</li>
            <li> I have been using Garnier Nutrisse Nourishing Hair Color (#30 Sweet Cola) for several years and love it.</li>
            <li> This habit creates a major static storm, something that had never happened before.</li>
            <li> I had it on for 25 minutes and the color is nice on the hair that wasn&#x27;t grey</li>
            <li> Nice &amp; Easy was a little too bright red and not as natural</li>
            <li> The grey coverage was good and the color was decent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After seeing all those fabulous commercials with women with just colored, shiny, silky-smooth hair, I decided to opt in for this new color experience by Garnier.</li>
            <li> It is remarkably easy to put in your hair and there are no messy drips on your neck or forehead.  </li>
            <li> I usually use Loreal Preference and not long ago tried an organic colorant called Tints of Nature, both of which worked great!</li>
            <li> It washed out pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Followed directions exactly.</li>
            <li> well, smell is so much better than traditional hair color</li>
            <li> The instructions were followed exactly.</li>
            <li> This review is from my wife, Lisa, and I corroborate her story ;-)</li>
            <li> Thank God I had just cleaned because I had to scrape up most of the developer off the walls, cabinets, and floor and place it back in the bottle.  </li>
            <li> but my hair is dyed and it looks pretty and shinny for now.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair various shades of auburn for 18 years, and I&#x27;ve tried many, many different brands, and every one has faded to the point where I don&#x27;t even notice my roots when they grow out.  </li>
            <li> I tried it for the first time yesterday.</li>
            <li> it took FOREVER to rinse out, I literally ran out of hot water&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> should mention that I go with light auburns to try to closely match my natural color.  </li>
            <li> Worth it in the long run, but be prepared &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> the dye color - one of the browns - is hanging it pretty OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Loreal and Garnier are a bit higher quality and won&#x27;t leave your hair fried.</li>
            <li> I followed the directly exactly.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t use shampoo or even hot water.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever reacted to a hair dye.  </li>
            <li> My first thought was, to quote Gob Bluth, \\&quot;I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> still looks as it first did.</li>
            <li> Not only was my hair patchy because of all the missed spots, but most of the spots that did get dyed turned NEON pink/red.</li>
            <li> At first.  </li>
            <li> The color turned out pretty</li>
            <li> Overall, it did not color as well or leave my hair as healthy looking and shiny as Nutratint.</li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time.</li>
            <li> I have colored my hair for decades, (I&#x27;m 54, and hve colored my hair since I was 12)  using many  different shades of color.</li>
            <li> This  product did exactly what it said it would do.</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I  paid for and would  buy this product again.</li>
            <li> So the first day was a good day for a messy updo.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I was using higher end products based on the bottles</li>
            <li> Again, glad I have short hair.</li>
            <li> Also, my hair feels much dryer right after coloring than it did with Nutrisse, although that goes away after the first couple of washings (I also use Garnier Fructis shampoo and conditioner).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very dry, brittle hair, and I thought this haircolor would be gentle and make my hair nice and silky.  </li>
            <li> One of the more gentle hair colors that you can buy at the local CVS or Walgreens.</li>
            <li> Let me first say that I have been touching up the grey hair at my temples for a decade.</li>
            <li> VERY pretty color, the little grey I had (or as I like to say, &amp;#34;My Bling Strands&amp;#34; were gone, and my hair was great.  </li>
            <li> The color is also very rich and natural looking, very close to my natural color, which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Most commercial hair colors are filled with so many horrid chemicals that they will leave your hair a complete mess.</li>
            <li> Love it for my dry hair.</li>
            <li> I tend to have dry hair, and my hair is silky, the color is even, and I love it.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s 60% oil based, my hair 3 weeks later after coloring it is still healthy looking, shiny, NO roots, not dull or washed out,</li>
            <li> : The name \\&quot;Olia\\&quot; reminds me of a certain synthetic fat product that was a marketing disaster.</li>
            <li> I have fairly large hands, but even I could not manage to hang onto the bulb-shaped bottle, let alone squeeze out the product in a uniform manner.</li>
            <li> I will certainly keep using the product vs $150 salons.</li>
            <li> I also thought it was kind of drying to my hair, hair feels a little more brittle and dry to the touch.</li>
            <li> I typically use Nutratint a more natural, vegetable based colorant available in health food stores and online at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I am quite familiar with home hair coloring since I am of an age where those pesky grays pop up on a regular basis &amp; I don&#x27;t need any help looking older, so I cover them up right away.  </li>
            <li> A huge recommend and the only hair color</li>
            <li> I have always taken so much pride with my hair</li>
            <li> It is really important to read peoples reviews, I only wish I had done it sooner, but I felt that the advertisement had now found a revolutionary product to sweep the market.</li>
            <li> The applicator bottle is too big to fit in my hand.  </li>
            <li> I applied section by section, my hair is shoulder-length, and I used the whole bottle.</li>
            <li> and I really saturated all of my hair with every drop of the color</li>
            <li> I try to split this in to two applications because it has too much oil for my hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the feel of the hair when I apply the whole package.</li>
            <li> 5 weeks ago I used Olia because the &amp;#34;no ammonia&amp;#34; really appealed to me.</li>
            <li> Anything by Clairol or Revlon is an absolute disaster.</li>
            <li> When I was done my hair was not that much darker and it was splotchy and streaky.</li>
            <li> Who knows how fast it will wash out?</li>
            <li> and It doesn&#x27;t cover the gray very well at all.</li>
            <li> So thanks Olia, for swearing me off of box dye from now on.</li>
            <li> I worked it in really well and let it sit for another 20 min.</li>
            <li> I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> Since I can no longer find it, I bought the Olia 9.0 Light Blonde and tried it about 6 weeks ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> I only ever use ammonia free dyes like Revlon Color Silk or the like</li>
            <li> Oh and NO Ammonia so gentle and doesn&#x27;t burn your scalp.</li>
            <li> Was very disapointed.</li>
            <li> If your hair is  much longer you will need 2 packages of color.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> If you are at all concerned about this, you might want to stay away from the whole family of Garnier Olia products.</li>
            <li> The step #3 conditioner is very luxurious.</li>
            <li> I am devastated, this has turned my hair blue, grey from a beautiful blonde colour.</li>
            <li> (If you are a visual person who can actually do your own hair.)</li>
            <li> Made my hair turn green which had ever happened to me after years of dying my own hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a couple of days, but so far, I am pleased.</li>
            <li> you would get the impression that this hair color uses only natural vegetable oils and no nasty chemicals.</li>
            <li> The mixture is not drippy at all, not at all, it is thick like a good conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised at some of the less enthusiastic reviews here - I will have to see how long the color lasts etc., but  for now, the day after colouring, I am extremely pleased.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly, coloring my whole head because it was a new shade and it had been a while.</li>
            <li> I should have just gone somewhere else, but for whatever reason, I decided that this one sounded like it might be a bit more gentle on my hair than the other hair dyes I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li> and it left my hair nice and shiny, but the color is flat and it looks like I colored my hair.  </li>
            <li> The smell is a clean floral, not overpowering, it is a very desirable scent - and the conditioner smells similar and If I could buy the conditioner I would.  </li>
            <li> I was horrified when I looked in the mirror to see my hair about 7 shades darker than normal!</li>
            <li> tty color, the little grey I had (or as I like to say, &amp;#34;My Bling Strands&amp;#34; were gone, and my hair was great.  </li>
            <li> What happened to 10 minutes like normal hair color?!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally dye my own hair ( too messy)</li>
            <li> I ended up having to rinse my gloves to wash the sink clean several times (and surrounding areas as well)</li>
            <li> First of all the developer is not in the dispenser, in my opinion this is a waste and just creates one more piece of trash for me to throw out.  </li>
            <li> I tried Olia for the first time last month, in dark intense auburn, and for the first time ever, I have visible and easily noticeable roots!  </li>
            <li> All and all I would use it again in a hair eat because my hair didn&#x27;t get as dried out as the other dyes, it was easy to use, it smelled amazing.</li>
            <li> I much prefer Nutratint as it gives a very natural, shiny result and covers grays very well.</li>
            <li> The top of my hair is in the orang family and the bottom is dark.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Sweet Cola for several years and people didn&#x27;t know I colored my hair until I told them I did.  </li>
            <li> WOW I used the other type Nutrise before and loved it, and this is the only color at the store.</li>
            <li> Please note that the natural auburn is quite subtle, if you are looking for a redder light auburn (say something like Loreal&#x27;s Excellence Light Auburn) then get the intense red light auburn shade instead.  </li>
            <li> The color is still vibrant.  </li>
            <li> Two weeks, three coconut oil treatments, and many hair repairing products later, my hair is finally beginning to not feel like straw.</li>
            <li> My only consolation is that my hair grows quickly.</li>
            <li> I am not very good at dying my own hair.  </li>
            <li> Super slick and smooth.</li>
            <li> the color was very uneven, was an intense color (too intense) in the areas where I started and was almost more of a highlight in the areas I ended with</li>
            <li> highly recommend this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this.</li>
            <li> but I trust this a little bit more.</li>
            <li> Once it ran clear, I used the WHOLE bottle of conditioner and finger combed my hair.</li>
            <li> I wear a smooth, longer bob and have a habit of running fingers through my hair to sort of \\&quot;fluff it\\&quot; when reading or thinking.</li>
            <li> My hair is golden blonde with orange tints.</li>
            <li> The Sweet Cola always covered my grey  </li>
            <li> It may be ammonia-free, but there is a chemical equally harsh, possibly more so in it.</li>
            <li> Will be purchasing this color again, unless it proves to under perform in next couple of weeks!</li>
            <li> I did take my usual benadryl before, and as a precaution 1 more dose, but didn&#x27;t really need it.  </li>
            <li> Worse than even a temporary color, this didn&#x27;t take at all and within days, was as good as gone.</li>
            <li> I even left it on for 40 mins instead of the recommended 30, and the silver is all still here, right after the shower to rinse out the dye.</li>
            <li> No matter what root booster, mousse, hair spray or thickener I use (all with good results in the past) my hair lays flat on my skull and refuses to come to life.</li>
            <li> but I thought that this product was ammonia free and could be used on other hair colours as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Reading the label - especially the legible part (much of it is illegible)</li>
            <li> , it looks very natural.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks very natural from day one.  </li>
            <li> All my grays are gone and the color looks very natural.</li>
            <li> It covered the gray and my hair was very soft.  </li>
            <li> But clearly, I lacked imagination!</li>
            <li> and I have used Garnier Belle Colour Extra Light Natural Blonde for 16 years</li>
            <li> I am so upset and devastated and find myself in a position to find a way to get my hair back to its original blonde colour.</li>
            <li> but I felt compelled to complete my mission!  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anybody who lacks patience, has arthritis or doesn&#x27;t have a wild sense of humor!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I love all of their products usually.  </li>
            <li> According to the box, my natural haircolor with the dye should have produced a darker color than the front of box, so I dont know what happened there!  </li>
            <li> Will go back to my more expensive Nutratint because it is a better and probably safer hair color product.</li>
            <li> I mixed the product and applied it quickly with a brush, starting from the roots.</li>
            <li> For the record, I used black and the shade was quite nice but unremarkable compared to other brands.&lt;br /&gt;Stay</li>
            <li> The process was easy, easier than some of the other at home products I&#x27;ve used, and the thick conditioner left my hair looking and feeling soft, with more volume and shinier than before.</li>
            <li> This stuff won&#x27;t rinse clearly...</li>
            <li> you create a lather in your hair and rinse it out till the water runs clear.  </li>
            <li> The water did run clear, and I did not have color residue on my hair.</li>
            <li> (I may not have rinsed it out completely.</li>
            <li> My hair is curlier, shinier, stronger, bouncy, and soft.</li>
            <li> Since I do not have a sensitive scalp, I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> And there&#x27;s no obvious grow out line after a whole month.  </li>
            <li> PLUS, the coverage on my greys is still holding - wow.</li>
            <li> So far,</li>
            <li> I could have used four boxes, maybe, but because the dye doesn&#x27;t naturally saturate, and you have to work the dye in to get it to moved from the ONE SPOT</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;color not medium blonde - much blonder.&lt;br /&gt;bottle</li>
            <li> had sheen and felt soft.</li>
            <li> - No harsh ammonia smell</li>
            <li> I was surprised that my locs did sock up the dye.</li>
            <li> I realize that Natural Instincts is semi-permanent, but it also touts the ammonia-free label.</li>
            <li> but that turned out to be because the color was washing out completely.</li>
            <li> This caused it to be soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> The smell didn&#x27;t give me a headache or burn my sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> And it didn&#x27;t completely cover my greys.  </li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Garnier Herbashine, but I haven&#x27;t had much luck finding it anywhere these days.  </li>
            <li> and now I am almost completely bald.</li>
            <li> and i have naturally oily hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to a salon to have this disaster fixed.</li>
            <li> The smell is truly offensive and completely unacceptable.</li>
            <li> I got a medium brown color for my medium brown hair and it put some color to my grays, didn&#x27;t cover them completely</li>
            <li> so I just kept working it in until I thought all the hairs were covered completely.</li>
            <li> So much of it has broken off that it looks kind of like a pine branch, with hairs sticking out at ever angle, for the entire length.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and healthy.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, healthy hair.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product for other&#x27;s with fine hair with gray.</li>
            <li> This bottle actually slipped right out of my hand about 3 different times.  </li>
            <li> had recently decided to use a more gentle hair dye, because my hair has gotten dry and slightly damaged.  </li>
            <li> cool shaped bottle, chic black gloves.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The &amp;#34;no ammonia&amp;#34;  is a good idea, but very poor results.</li>
            <li> I divided my [dirty] hair into four sections &amp; gently combed through my tight curls with a very wide-tooth comb &amp; moisturized with a light layer of coconut oil to protect &amp; strengthen my hair even more.</li>
            <li> I was dying my hair from dark blonde, and going from light to darker is always a</li>
            <li> I have both home and salon dyed my hair for 8+ years to cover grey, but my scalp is exremely sensitive to the chemicals used, even other ammonia free or semi-permanent colors.  </li>
            <li> The applicator is a strange, bulbous creation that wants to pop out of your hand.</li>
            <li> THEN they don&#x27;t give you enough product for long hair, so you won&#x27;t get full coverage in the back or at the ends of your hair.  </li>
            <li> And I wasn&#x27;t in a big hurry to wash my hair right away, because I had just dyed my hair and didn&#x27;t want to dry it out or stip color with shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always colored my own hair since I&#x27;m just covering grays and staying in the same medium/brown (sometimes a redder brown) category that isn&#x27;t a dramatic change from my natural color.  </li>
            <li> but I dont feel it dry my hair too much</li>
            <li> After 30 mins, I massaged my scalp and hair really well before rinsing in cold water followed by warm.</li>
            <li> I was unable to squeeze all of the developer and color agent into the dispenser, good thing I have short hair.</li>
            <li> The results were just that, a dark cooler toned red, a little bit brighter than the swatch on the bottle but still nice.</li>
            <li> ; trim in my very near future.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews unless I feel very strongly one way or the other about a product.  </li>
            <li> That wasn&#x27;t necessary with this brand, and I&#x27;m definitely trying something a little more subdued next time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After researching for a year, I opted to try this brand on my virgin, deep dark brown, super curly 4b hair.</li>
            <li> and the main reason i color my hair is to cover the grey.</li>
            <li> have not had such a horrendous result since the one time I actually used Clorox on my hair when I was in high school.  </li>
            <li> in fact, water still wasn&#x27;t rinsing clear 5 days later...</li>
            <li> Natural Instincts was my regular until about a year ago when I noticed it was fading out faster.  </li>
            <li> and I double applied the conditioner so my hair felt completely silky.</li>
            <li> I have used many brands of hair dye and never experienced damage to this point.</li>
            <li> I did use the product 2 times and, like other reviewers on line, my hair also fell out in clumps immediately after application and after 2 months, I am experiencing continued, certainly more than normal hair loss every day, to the point where I am seriously concerned of when it is going to stop.</li>
            <li> Then when I went to shake it up, I had a hard time getting a good grip on the oddly football shaped dispenser bottle with really long tip.  </li>
            <li> Normally after a dye, my hair feels extra silky because of the super thick conditioner.</li>
            <li> I tried the new Olia for the first time this past Friday.  </li>
            <li> I left the color on my new growth for an extra 10 minutes and it still didn&#x27;t hold onto the grays.  </li>
            <li> The color is vibrant for about a week (3 washes), and then fades rapidly, especially on the grey hair.  </li>
            <li> The left side of my head has patches of color that took, the top of my head has spots of color and the hair that frames my face is really dark but only about halfway down my hair length.</li>
            <li> Just as much damaged as any other product.  </li>
            <li> The smell is very persistent and hard to get rid of - it doesn&#x27;t wash out readily.</li>
            <li> I have used professional salon colors that I mixed at home, tons of different box colors as well.</li>
            <li> My hair feels silky, not dry.</li>
            <li> The bottle looks really cool but was really hard to hold onto as everyone has already mentioned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to have to get my head shaved because right now each of the few strands I have left are split and fried to bits.</li>
            <li> Many other brands I have used, come out TOO dark and takes a few washes to tone down to the right shade.  </li>
            <li> have dark brown hair and have to use a dark blonde to get to a light brown shade.  </li>
            <li> I chose 4.60, the Dark Intense Auburn.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t really have the same consistency as other colors i have used before.</li>
            <li> I purchased a medium blonde to try to cover up my platinum blonde highlights in my naturally medium blonde hair.</li>
            <li> Natural Instincts is a nice substitution for other Herbashine users that have any trouble finding thier usual color.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You should know that nobody, nobody is watching out for your health, in terms of potential ill effects of hair dye and many other products, and there is very little meaningful regulation.</li>
            <li> I am normally a bleach blonde with super thin hair.</li>
            <li> Compared to the many other brands I have tried, Olia has the least odor and left my hair the softest.</li>
            <li> If you do a Google search on it, you will find at least one forum where women have had their hair come out in clumps, or they&#x27;ve not been able to get it rinsed out after days and days of washing and rinsing, and other such horrors.</li>
            <li> Bottle is slippery when wet, but I can live with that.  </li>
            <li> Afterwards, I towel-dried my hair, and let it dry naturally.</li>
            <li> I had just gotten my hair cut the same day , and my hair just barely touches my shoulders, and there was just enough  color for me to use.</li>
            <li> I added some of my other usual leave-in conditioners and my hair feels fine.</li>
            <li> It did not cover any of the highlights and only made my natural hair a dry ashy color.</li>
            <li> My hair definitely doesn&#x27;t feel as dry as it did before and got rid of my way to white for a 22 year old roots.</li>
            <li> Okay, so it didn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance, but it took forever to get all the developer out of the container into the applicator bottle - the applicator bottle was shaped poorly and difficult to hold and use (</li>
            <li> My natural hair colour is mid-brown and coloured mid-blonde, but this turned my hair a dull shade of mid-greyish brown, which is really unflattering.</li>
            <li> I typically choose a color that&#x27;s a little bit brighter than I want, since I&#x27;m expecting it to fade so quickly.</li>
            <li> A little too vibrant, actually.  </li>
            <li> I mean, seriously, this is the most natural auburn coloring I have ever found.  </li>
            <li> Adding both the developer and the colorant into the separate container means a less consistent outcome than other products that already have measured out the developer for you.  </li>
            <li> especially once it got the least bit of product on it - very slippery) - the color was not true to what the box indicated and came out much darker.  </li>
            <li> The color was nothing like I expected according to what it promised, it barely lasted 4 washes, and my hair felt immediately like what can only be described as a boat rope.  </li>
            <li> After going red for a while, I wanted to get close to my natural color, which matches up to the color on the box... except, this color is BLACK on my hair, not brown.</li>
            <li> I use the dark brown which is close to my natural hair</li>
            <li> I bought Dark soft Mahogany Brown.</li>
            <li> - Color is flat</li>
            <li> My grey in my hair dye same as the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li> Just use this if you are not covering grey, and have short hair.</li>
            <li> If, like me, you&#x27;re looking for grey coverage that doesn&#x27;t require touch-ups every 3-4 weeks, you might want to stick with a different formulation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always a little hesitant when purchasing a new hair color product.</li>
            <li> It was a very messy process, as the dye IS very oily or greasy and you cannot hang on to the bottle with the sub-standard gloves</li>
            <li> , it was kind of hard to spread the color throughout my hair (i have thin hair</li>
            <li> so there was no major color jump, just wanted to touch up the roots and refresh the color.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The gloves are smaller than those provided by other hair color products and are made of some plastic that causes the applicator to be more difficult to hold onto.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So when I first used Olia a month ago, I was initially disappointed because the color (light auburn) seemed darker to me.  </li>
            <li> Then it seemed like it completely faded in less than two weeks.  </li>
            <li> Also, the bottle is very oddly shaped, sort of like a huge egg, so it&#x27;s hard to hold (and to shake when mixing the formula)</li>
            <li> I generally take benadryl an hour before I dye and then continue benadryl for 2 days after because my scalp is itchy and extremely sensitve - but I can&#x27;t stand the greys</li>
            <li> The directions say to leave the product on the roots for 20 minutes, and then do the rest of your hair for 10 more minutes, but getting the gloves on/off and back on again is next to impossible because they rip.</li>
            <li> When I last got my hair cut, my hair dresser noted the extreme dryness of my hair and asked me if I was doing anything different.</li>
            <li> This product left my hair patchy and very dry.</li>
            <li> I bought two boxes of dye, since I have long hair - which is usually enough (and some left over) with other dyes.</li>
            <li> it did look very dark  as the color developed, don&#x27;t panic</li>
            <li> The box size is very deceptive.&lt;br /&gt;Developer (2 oz) comes in a tube sized for at least 6 oz.</li>
            <li> did my hair last night using this product in a dark blonde shade.</li>
            <li> It did not cover grey and was patchy.</li>
            <li> I noticed is the incredibly long time it took to rinse out.  </li>
            <li> but the grey is still there</li>
            <li> product convinced me that I should go grey and stop the coloring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The color didn&#x27;t even take on my grey hairs.</li>
            <li> What I didn&#x27;t like is that it didn&#x27;t give me 100% grey coverage like the box said.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get splotches of grey with the Olia, it just covered some strands and not others.  </li>
            <li> My hair is soft and fluffy.</li>
            <li> I have long curly,thick,fine hair.</li>
            <li> Immediately upon washing out the product, my hair felt different: sort of rough.</li>
            <li> not cover grey completely &amp; washed off after a few shampoos.</li>
            <li> and I liked the black theme, but this product SUCKS!!!</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I am less than pleased.</li>
            <li> washed off the dye and it had only slightly lifted the colour so overall</li>
            <li> My hair DOES have a funny feel to it when I condition which is odd because I usually got the same rough dry feeling when I shampooed</li>
            <li> First of all it is awkward to apply due to the funny shaped bottle.  </li>
            <li> Also, it grabbed onto my bit of grey around the hairline and made it look just a darker shade of grey!</li>
            <li> I chose a blond shade similar to the other brand</li>
            <li> All other things being equal, it has to be the lingering effects of Olia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still have grey after using this product!</li>
            <li> I deducted 5 minutes from the regular process time due to applying the product.</li>
            <li> Be warned ladies that this hair colour penetrates quite deeply and be very, very careful of the shade you choose.</li>
            <li> Personally I really like the subtle shade</li>
            <li> Garnier Olia stays true-to-color and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out the hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li> This color made my hair so dry it literally felt like straw.</li>
            <li> My hair is also dry as straw.</li>
            <li> So in addition to neon hair, it was dry and breaking.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is really dry.</li>
            <li> Made my hair so dry</li>
            <li> The reviewers who had negative comments must not have used the product correctly, because this is a high quality product, and does what it says it will do.&lt;br /&gt;A+++</li>
            <li> Mine is 3 for example, which is soft black or dark brown according to which brand you buy.</li>
            <li> and I was putting it on dark blonde hair</li>
            <li> Then to my dismay the applicator bottle (round like an orange and tiny flat base)flipped out from off the counter and a lot of the developer went fying all over my bathroom.  </li>
            <li> I grabbed this in a pinch, and the color is overall what I am looking for (dark brown), but it did nothing to cover gray hair.</li>
            <li> I have naturally dark brown hair, and I was only going for gray coverage</li>
            <li> Shampooed 3 days later and either I had gotten used to the shade, or it toned down a bit.  </li>
            <li> STILL looks terrible, and left my hair drier than I&#x27;ve ever experienced from other &amp;#34;harsher&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not permanent (lasts about as long as semi-permanent dye)&lt;br /&gt;Because the product is thick, you have to work a little harder to get into harder to saturate areas.&lt;br /&gt;Strange texture for the first day or so after coloring.</li>
            <li> I am burning my hair and scalp with blow drying, curling iron and round flat iron several times a day, trying to make it do SOMETHING, to absolutely no</li>
            <li> By the week and a half mark, only a trace of the color still appeared at root line.</li>
            <li> You receive the mixing bottle, the two solutions that need to be mixed and an after color conditioner, two black protective gloves and instructions.  </li>
            <li> I personally wanted something a little different and died my hair dark brown at the beginning of the summer.</li>
            <li> ONCE I had the mess cleaned up, I finally got everyhing in the applicator and got it on my head.</li>
            <li> I have always had a little extra color left on the hair in the past and have ruined several towels, pillowcases, etcetera.  </li>
            <li> I have sporadic grey throughout my dark hair, including one small section at my temple, and the Olia color simply does not last.  </li>
            <li> usually bouncy-to-curly Italian hair is as flat as a puddle.</li>
            <li> Like other commenters state, the first issue is just that the bottle is shaped so poorly</li>
            <li> The only reason I chose a 4 instead of 5 is because I think it does fade a little faster</li>
            <li> I tried the dark beige blonde colour - and be warned, this shade will turn your hair quite dark if you&#x27;ve already coloured your hair lighter before.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really permanent at all.</li>
            <li> I get my hair wet..</li>
            <li> I wet my hair, washed, and rinsed.  </li>
            <li> It DID NOT turn pink on my head.</li>
            <li> It has only been a few day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until</li>
            <li> I finally got impatient and used some shampoo.</li>
            <li> There is no way a woman my size can get a firm grip on this applicator bottle, especially wearing plastic gloves.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a round bulb that gets slippery, especially when you&#x27;re wearing gloves!</li>
            <li> it dried my hair out, had to use the entire tube of conditioner</li>
            <li> Complete fake, definitely not 60% oils instead the opposite.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money to do double damage to your hair.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s just say, that I closed my eyes, and started rinsing the gore out of my hair.</li>
            <li> Since the dye is oil based the bottle kept slipping out of my hand.  </li>
            <li> Kept slipping out of my hand</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been coloring my own hair for 20 years and this is by far the worst hair color I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my own hair for 10 years and this is by far the worst hair color product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> When I rinsed it out, my hair did feel a little dry and was only slightly improved after using the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I mean as natural as it can be.</li>
            <li> As it was &#x27;dying&#x27; my grey hair turned pink but after the rinse and condition, it was just a patchy mess of quasi-coverage.</li>
            <li> When I finally saw my hair in its dry colored state, I was very disappointed that it was far too light.  </li>
            <li> The color was supposed to be a dark brown, however, my hair came out dark brown in one spot, and the rest was a dark cherry RED.</li>
            <li> A little dark but the commercial states</li>
            <li> I have arthritis and it was a major hassle getting the developer out of the oversized hard plastic bottle it was in.  </li>
            <li> only drawback I have is that when I dye my hair I typically don&#x27;t wash my hair on the day of the dying, this formula uses oil to saturate your hair, so my hair felt a little greasy after the dye.  </li>
            <li> I thought for the high price of this item, compared to the other brands, I would be head over heels for it, but alas, I will not buy it again.  </li>
            <li> It costs about as much as my usual semi-permanent dye, but smells and feels ten times</li>
            <li> i am 42 and have a few stray hairs of grey along my hair line.  </li>
            <li> and I think the other is Clairol.</li>
            <li> Covers grey like it claims, however, the step 3 lock in conditioner is heavily scented for my preference.</li>
            <li> I had it a vivid red shade and went to an expensive salon to have a 2 process done</li>
            <li> I have never had this with any other hair color...</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t like the other OTC brands out there.</li>
            <li> which it would be by now with other hair colors</li>
            <li> My hair stylist usually puts low lights in my hair to break it up.</li>
            <li> The other plus is the non drip formula.  </li>
            <li> My hair felt a little dry, but nothing as drastic as other reviewers have mentioned.</li>
            <li> My hair didn&#x27;t take well with the box dye and has been a little dry since.</li>
            <li> I usually dye my hair dark red</li>
            <li> I used the conditioner and alarmingly my hair still felt odd.</li>
            <li> I am so surprised by the negative reviews!  </li>
            <li> Something is not right with this product.  </li>
            <li> It took less time rinsing the product out of my hair than any other dye I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to grip, especially with the slippery gloves provided.</li>
            <li> I have very little grey</li>
            <li> I bought a dark brown one, and the result was purplish-black.  </li>
            <li> only negative</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m average sized.</li>
            <li> I thought that, because it was a creme, it would saturate my hair without much problem - WRONG.</li>
            <li> Not one grey is left behind.  </li>
            <li> I am 35, and have average brownish hair past my shoulders that has lots of grey.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the cost or the risk, so BUYER BEWARE.</li>
            <li> Whoever decided this was a good packaging design for women&#x27;s hair color is an idiot!</li>
            <li> The color is freaky off from the other hair color brands!</li>
            <li> I used darkest brown because my hair color is really dark almost black.</li>
            <li> All the hair colors I have used in the past cover the grey for at least 3 weeks, this one didn&#x27;t do a thing to the grey.  </li>
            <li> I just touched up my gray roots with Clairol&#x27;s Natural Instincts and, while I have used this product numerous times in the past, I could not get over the difference in the feel of my hair after merely rinsing the color out.</li>
            <li> 3 weeks after using this hair color, hair feels greasy, dull, limp, heavy and extremely oily, in spite of almost daily washing.</li>
            <li> I have to rinse it out after less than 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a variety of red/purple shades, and this one fades less than the others.  </li>
            <li> That bottle is very hard to hang onto, because of it&#x27;s shape, especially when your hands are wet with hair color!</li>
            <li> So I spent another 1/2 hour trying to balance myself on what felt like an oil slick</li>
            <li> The dye was seeping out of the sides and was a mess.</li>
            <li> The gloves are a bit small and if wet, you cannot hold anything.  </li>
            <li> Not true</li>
            <li> If you have long hair buy at least 2 bottles</li>
            <li> bottle didn&#x27;t have chemical already in it, so required extra step.&lt;br /&gt;Chemicals too thick to mix by shaking bottle, had to stir them in bottle, causing more exposure to sickening chemical smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although three dispenser bottle is shaped pretty,  it is slippery and is a little inconvenient to hold while coloring.</li>
            <li> Today leave-in followed by a little Shea Butter Moisture Gel Souffle, shook out my hair and went.</li>
            <li> but I feel like it&#x27;s a little easier on my hair</li>
            <li> Not even a little bit.</li>
            <li> Not even a little bit.</li>
            <li> I think that Garnier needs to work on this one a little.</li>
            <li> Other than that, dont waste your money!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am afraid to use another hair color over this mess, but I cannot hold out much</li>
            <li> I had a hard time even shaking it up without it slipping from my hands.</li>
            <li> I expected a shade warmer, not this dull shade.</li>
            <li> Wasted almost $8.00.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give this 2.5 stars if I could, because I had a few issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I know a few things about hair dye.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste a nickel.</li>
            <li> Dried my hair</li>
            <li> I feel like this was a waste of time and money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Waste of time.  </li>
            <li> As a former hair dresser, I think this is one of the worse products on the market.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so heavy that it clumps your hair together and made me miss TONS of areas.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> My roots turned green but the rest of my hair did not change color.</li>
            <li> I have used some harsh peroxide and ammonia based treatments in my time.</li>
            <li> but it REALLY dried out my hair.</li>
            <li> Streaky, uneven penetration throughout my remaining</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> I have medium length thin hair and there was not enough in the dispenser to do all of my hair.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;ll admit my hair is long, and it IS an effort to distribute color evenly, but what caused my real concern, is that the base of the applicator bottle is rather round, and dome-like.</li>
            <li> That said, it seemed the color was still making my hair tangled and stiff.</li>
            <li> No strong smells.</li>
            <li> product comes with a LOT of unnecessary packaging, especially given the small amount provided.</li>
            <li> I usually leave my haircolors a few minutes longer than recommended on packaging material.</li>
            <li> I use #8 medium blonde, and I had no issues with unexpected color, but when rinsing out the color, my hair felt horrible; dry and a tangled mess.  </li>
            <li> Could not get rid of static and dried it out terribly</li>
            <li> But that is really hard to believe and apparently not true.</li>
            <li> I usually read the reviews BEFORE I make a purchase</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m betting it was a man who designed the (excessive) packaging for this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I used Olia a month ago my hair has been in a headband because it will not shape or style as it usually did.</li>
            <li> Worse than holding a wet bar of soap.  </li>
            <li> I used a small hair brush to blend it into my roots and the ends.</li>
            <li> I have dyed my hair for the past 10 years, and almost exclusively with box dye.</li>
            <li> it makes it really difficult to grip and squeeze, especially when you have slippery gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually color every 5--6 weeks.  </li>
            <li> After every time the hair is washed, 2-3 hours later it gets a stale oil smell, which rubs off on hats, hoods of jackets, pillowcases.</li>
            <li> This is a darker shade then I usually buy, so I did do an all over coloring.</li>
            <li> all the time and this stuff just plain sucks.</li>
            <li> The round, bulbous shape is hard to hold and hard to apply.</li>
            <li> At least I can do it over again in a few weeks - with something else!</li>
            <li> Also, it feels very heavy and thick on your hair.  </li>
            <li> I really like it because it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out or have a nasty chemical smell.</li>
            <li> it became slippery and hard to grasp.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> One thing I will say the bottle is hard to hold.</li>
            <li> horrible product changed the texture of my hair from soft to coarse, dull, lifeless, brittle.&lt;br /&gt;did</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking to enhance your natural color, this might not be a bad product.  </li>
            <li> It kept slipping out of my hand and made both the mixing and application difficult.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read the negative reviews from others in advance since they may have scared me off...</li>
            <li> Helped control my puffy thick hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick.</li>
            <li> With the combination of the patch makeover, and straw like hair, I was forced to go out and purchase a WIG.</li>
            <li> The reviews were correct on only ONE major issue and that is that the product applicator and the storage bottles for the developer and colorant, were all TERRIBLE!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or trash your hair on this one!!</li>
            <li> Well tonight I opened the box of the olio and the bottle was missing!!</li>
            <li> I even have a small bald spot now!</li>
            <li> Because the bottle is tapered in shape and your hands are somewhat slippery in those gloves, very difficult to handle, besides being too big for a woman&#x27;s hand!</li>
            <li> I finally remember to reapply when I suddenly realize that my haircolor is boring again.  </li>
            <li> Seriously did anyone even test this product?</li>
            <li> The oil base makes my hair much less frizzy and dry through the month.  </li>
            <li> The actual process of  applying the color was not so bad.  </li>
            <li> Only plus is it did not have a bad odor</li>
            <li> Coloring is never good for your hair</li>
            <li> Used this for the first time today and hated it!</li>
            <li> I have to get at least!</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT SUCKS!</li>
            <li> lot of previous reviews have commented on the awkward shape of the applicator.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I havee been colouring my hair for 20/25 years and have never experienced this after colouring.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions very closely and my hair looks horrible!!!</li>
            <li> The absolute worst hair dye I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> After about six weeks the frizzy situation gets worse.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely would not recommend this product to my worst enemy!</li>
            <li> It was so frustrating.  </li>
            <li> False advertising on the part of Garnier.  </li>
            <li> In addition, the design of the applicator is ridiculous!  </li>
            <li> is stays in, you end up missing spots, is bad for you, because this stuff is NOT supposed to be massaged into your scalp</li>
            <li> It is true that the product does not smell bad like some others but, the applicator dispenser is awful!  </li>
            <li> olio permanent haircolor is by far the worst product I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> This was by far the WORST dye experience I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> I hate the ammonia smell and the dryness I get from other products.</li>
            <li> Shocking that something that costs this much should be so disappointing.</li>
            <li> Even though the odor was not too bad with Oila, Nutratint has hardly any odor at all.</li>
            <li> and u found it really difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I dropped it 4 times and needless to say wound up with it all over my bathroom.  </li>
            <li> addition, the bulb-like applicator is difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> So I always have weird dye spots in my face and neck when I do it myself.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fu***n straw broken ends!</li>
            <li> I have purchased $20 dye kits (which I think is expensive) and this one beats them all.</li>
            <li> That was mysteriously disturbing.  </li>
            <li> Utter crap!</li>
            <li> Sorry Garnier</li>
            <li> The weird shape of the dispenser bottle was difficult to hold.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made my hair sticky, dry, and tangle horribly.</li>
            <li> The months that followed proved to be just as disappointing, as my hair was dry and brittle and I had the worst breakage ever.  </li>
            <li> I saw this box on the shelf I decided to just try it - after all I already have the worst reaction to other dyes</li>
            <li> It is so bad my husband is out now buying my regular brand because he was the one that notices how awful my hair was.</li>
            <li> It was like a bad episode of Criminal Minds without Shemar Moore in the shower with me!</li>
            <li> isn&#x27;t to say I&#x27;m unhappy with the product.</li>
            <li> I ended up cutting the crimped end off the developer tube and scooping out the remaining 1 oz of developer stuck in the container with a spoon.</li>
            <li> The mixing bottle is quite awkward to handle, being rounded</li>
            <li> After 4-5 mins, I rinsed in cold water.</li>
            <li> What a nasty result all round.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> The bottle was an awkward shape to use and hold.  </li>
            <li> It did not seem to color my hair as evenly, could see gray roots a week out of my color which was disappointing</li>
            <li> Slimy, horrible texture that was hard</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cumbersome, bad shape.</li>
            <li> bottle design is really bad.</li>
            <li> It is seriously bad.</li>
            <li> Bad coverage.</li>
            <li> This did not smell bad at all.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Chemicals gave me a sore throat and sick feeling which lasted for 2 days.</li>
            <li> When you apply it, it produces a nasty, horrible chemical stink that is at least as bad</li>
            <li> Disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I applied the conditioner thinking that might help and was disappointed that it still felt like greasy, oily straw when the conditioner was rinsed out.  </li>
            <li> ??? So I was quite disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> I was really disappointed considering that this is from Garnier.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy 😞</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Garnier does something about those stupid bottles...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d decided to use a semi-permanent one, but, annoyingly, the store where I was trying to buy some had stopped carrying any semi-permanent color at all.  </li>
            <li> I personally hate how bleached out my hair looks during the summer.</li>
            <li> However, the results were atrocious!  </li>
            <li> I actually hated the applicator.</li>
            <li> This was the worst experience coloring my hair in 20 years.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this product with the expectation that it would be &#x27;permanent&#x27; as the box states. It&#x27;s not really permanent at all. It washed out pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t to say I&#x27;m unhappy with the product. It costs about as much as my usual semi-permanent dye, but smells and feels ten times better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of previous reviews have commented on the awkward shape of the applicator. I feel the opposite. The applicator never slipped out of my hands, I found it easier to maneuver with, and it didn&#x27;t leave any rings of dye on my bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect salon quality endurance, but it&#x27;s still worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Pros-&lt;br /&gt;Smells delicious&lt;br /&gt;Thick and easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;Pretty packaging&lt;br /&gt;Cheap-ish&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful color&lt;br /&gt;I liked the applicator,&lt;br /&gt;so this is going in the pros.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Cons-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not permanent (lasts about as long as semi-permanent dye)&lt;br /&gt;Because the product is thick, you have to work a little harder to get into harder to saturate areas.&lt;br /&gt;Strange texture for the first day or so after coloring. (I may not have rinsed it out completely. This may be on me.)</li>
            <li> Wasted almost $8.00. Didn&#x27;t color a thing. Followed directions exactly. Might work for something else but didn&#x27;t color one Gray hair.</li>
            <li> Ladies run from this product. I look like a skunk. The top of my hair is in the orang family and the bottom is dark. I went from light brown from a clairol product to light brown in a Garnier product. Run do not use this product i have never had such drastic results in color.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dye for the first time and liked the idea of it being ammonia free - who likes burning itchy scalps anyway? The colour was a lovely shade and I was putting it on dark blonde hair so I thought I should achieve the result on the box.&lt;br /&gt;I left it on for over 30 mins as it did not look like it had lifted at all.&lt;br /&gt;I washed off the dye and it had only slightly lifted the colour so overall I am not happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;The oil infused dye was a nice change though and did leave my hair softer than normal box dyes.&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t recommend blonde shades if you want to do your roots or lift hair.</li>
            <li> I am devastated, this has turned my hair blue, grey from a beautiful blonde colour. I have always taken so much pride with my hair and I have used Garnier Belle Colour Extra Light Natural Blonde for 16 years but I thought that this product was ammonia free and could be used on other hair colours as advertised.  As it was a Garnier product I thought that it would be easy to swop over to Garnier 10.0 Very Light Blonde as the instructions documented it can be used if your hair has colour already on. Since my disaster I have found reviews which have reported the same happening to them. It is really important to read peoples reviews, I only wish I had done it sooner, but I felt that the advertisement had now found a revolutionary product to sweep the market. I am so upset and devastated and find myself in a position to find a way to get my hair back to its original blonde colour. DO NOT even try this product as you are playing with DANGER. I would never recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Never going to use again!!! It has left my hair like straw and full of static ?? I havee been colouring my hair for 20/25 years and have never experienced this after colouring. Very unhappy 😞</li>
            <li> Overall color results good. Colored roots well, smell is so much better than traditional hair color treatments.&lt;br /&gt;The reason for 3 stars?&lt;br /&gt;This product comes with a LOT of unnecessary packaging, especially given the small amount provided. The box size is very deceptive.&lt;br /&gt;Developer (2 oz) comes in a tube sized for at least 6 oz. I ended up cutting the crimped end off the developer tube and scooping out the remaining 1 oz of developer stuck in the container with a spoon. The mixing bottle is quite awkward to handle, being rounded it became slippery and hard to grasp.&lt;br /&gt;The kit included;&lt;br /&gt;1-instructions&lt;br /&gt;1-developer tube&lt;br /&gt;1-colorant tube&lt;br /&gt;1-mixing bottle, screw lid attached&lt;br /&gt;1-after color conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t use this product again and wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> The color is nice however... This stuff won&#x27;t rinse clearly... Two weeks after using I still have purple everytime I get my hair wet.. Not to mention my towel has purple streaks all over it. It&#x27;s made my hair sticky, dry, and tangle horribly. Would advise against using.</li>
            <li> This was the worst experience coloring my hair in 20 years. It did not cover grey and was patchy. The instructions were followed exactly. I am now sitting with a competing product on my hair as I write this review. Do not recommend at all to anyone. As it was &#x27;dying&#x27; my grey hair turned pink but after the rinse and condition, it was just a patchy mess of quasi-coverage. Having to re-color my hair within an hour caused burning and discomfort on my scalp which lasted a day.</li>
            <li> Great gray coverage! I usually leave my haircolors a few minutes longer than recommended on packaging material.</li>
            <li> I got this from walgreens. Love it for my dry hair. Full coverage of grays. Helped control my puffy thick hair. Was comfortable to use. I let it stay on my hair for 45 mins and didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews unless I feel very strongly one way or the other about a product.  I have been coloring my hair for years  and olio permanent haircolor is by far the worst product I&#x27;ve ever used.  The actual process of  applying the color was not so bad.  However, the results were atrocious!  The color was nothing like I expected according to what it promised, it barely lasted 4 washes, and my hair felt immediately like what can only be described as a boat rope.  Even the conditioner that came with it didn&#x27;t help.  The months that followed proved to be just as disappointing, as my hair was dry and brittle and I had the worst breakage ever.  Never has my hair looked this damaged.  Do yourself a favor and do not try this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  This review is from my wife, Lisa, and I corroborate her story ;-)</li>
            <li> OK. I usually read the reviews BEFORE I make a purchase but this time I was feeling compulsive and grabbed OLIA off the shelf.  The reviews were correct on only ONE major issue and that is that the product applicator and the storage bottles for the developer and colorant, were all TERRIBLE! I have arthritis and it was a major hassle getting the developer out of the oversized hard plastic bottle it was in.  Then to my dismay the applicator bottle (round like an orange and tiny flat base)flipped out from off the counter and a lot of the developer went fying all over my bathroom.  Thank God I had just cleaned because I had to scrape up most of the developer off the walls, cabinets, and floor and place it back in the bottle.  It is OIL based right?  So I spent another 1/2 hour trying to balance myself on what felt like an oil slick and I gave up trying to hold on to any of the bottles because they all just kept fying out of my hands.  I was close to throwing everything back in the box and throwing it out but I felt compelled to complete my mission!  ONCE I had the mess cleaned up, I finally got everyhing in the applicator and got it on my head. Yah!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only had the product on my hair for 35 minutes.  I wet my hair, washed, and rinsed.  It took less time rinsing the product out of my hair than any other dye I&#x27;ve used.  It DID NOT turn pink on my head. Best of all it DID dye my very gray hair the dark brown 4.0 it promised.  My hair DOES have a funny feel to it when I condition which is odd because I usually got the same rough dry feeling when I shampooed but my hair is dyed and it looks pretty and shinny for now.  It has only been a few day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until Garnier does something about those stupid bottles... I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anybody who lacks patience, has arthritis or doesn&#x27;t have a wild sense of humor!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars because the actual hair dye is amazing. I used darkest brown because my hair color is really dark almost black. The color is gorgeous!  It&#x27;s a warm, beautiful dark rich color. I liked the consistency if the dye. It&#x27;s thick. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like....I actually hated the applicator. It&#x27;s a cumbersome, bad shape. It&#x27;s a teardrop and u found it really difficult to use. Also, it says in the directions to make sure the applicator cap screws on completely before use. Ok. I could not get the cap to go on straight no matter how many times I tried and I assemble IKEA furniture with no problem. So I used it anyway, even with the cap not on exactly right. What a disaster!  The dye was seeping out of the sides and was a mess. It&#x27;s not really a big deal now that I know because I&#x27;ll just use another applicator bottle next time. Garnier....please keep the dye the same but change the applicator bottle.</li>
            <li> This is the WORST hair dye I have ever used.  I have been coloring my hair for over 20 years.  That&#x27;s a lot of hair dye to have tried.&lt;br /&gt;I had recently decided to use a more gentle hair dye, because my hair has gotten dry and slightly damaged.  I&#x27;d decided to use a semi-permanent one, but, annoyingly, the store where I was trying to buy some had stopped carrying any semi-permanent color at all.  I should have just gone somewhere else, but for whatever reason, I decided that this one sounded like it might be a bit more gentle on my hair than the other hair dyes I&#x27;ve been using. (Ammonia Free!  Made with oils!)  So I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;I have not had such a horrendous result since the one time I actually used Clorox on my hair when I was in high school.  (What can I say?  I wanted platinum blonde, and every color I&#x27;d tried just left my hair yellowish.)&lt;br /&gt;My hair is fried.  It feels like straw and looks like a shrub.  So much of it has broken off that it looks kind of like a pine branch, with hairs sticking out at ever angle, for the entire length.&lt;br /&gt;And ya know what?  It&#x27;s not even the right color.  I bought a dark brown one, and the result was purplish-black.  And it kind of looks like I covered my hair with shoe polish or something, it&#x27;s so artificial-looking and dull.&lt;br /&gt;Garnier, please do the world a favor and stop inflicting your crappy products on us.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair various shades of auburn for 18 years, and I&#x27;ve tried many, many different brands, and every one has faded to the point where I don&#x27;t even notice my roots when they grow out.  I finally remember to reapply when I suddenly realize that my haircolor is boring again.  I tried Olia for the first time last month, in dark intense auburn, and for the first time ever, I have visible and easily noticeable roots!  The color is still vibrant.  A little too vibrant, actually.  I typically choose a color that&#x27;s a little bit brighter than I want, since I&#x27;m expecting it to fade so quickly. That wasn&#x27;t necessary with this brand, and I&#x27;m definitely trying something a little more subdued next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I noticed is the incredibly long time it took to rinse out.  Only use this when you have a good chunk of time to spend rinsing.  I finally got impatient and used some shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m betting it was a man who designed the (excessive) packaging for this product. The applicator bottle is too big to fit in my hand.  I&#x27;m average sized. 5&#x27;5&amp;#34; and my thumb to pinky span is about 8&amp;#34;. The applicator bottle at its thickest part is 8&amp;#34;. There is no way a woman my size can get a firm grip on this applicator bottle, especially wearing plastic gloves. I dropped it 4 times and needless to say wound up with it all over my bathroom.  Because the bottle is tapered in shape and your hands are somewhat slippery in those gloves, very difficult to handle, besides being too big for a woman&#x27;s hand! Whoever decided this was a good packaging design for women&#x27;s hair color is an idiot!</li>
            <li> After researching for a year, I opted to try this brand on my virgin, deep dark brown, super curly 4b hair. I divided my [dirty] hair into four sections &amp; gently combed through my tight curls with a very wide-tooth comb &amp; moisturized with a light layer of coconut oil to protect &amp; strengthen my hair even more. I followed the instructions to a tee... yes the bottle is weird-shaped, but I never had enough dye on the gloves for it to slip out of my hands like others said.  I shook it &#x27;til my arms hurt. I applied section by section, my hair is shoulder-length, and I used the whole bottle. After 30 mins, I massaged my scalp and hair really well before rinsing in cold water followed by warm. Once it ran clear, I used the WHOLE bottle of conditioner and finger combed my hair. After 4-5 mins, I rinsed in cold water. I applied Kinky-Curly Knot Today leave-in followed by a little Shea Butter Moisture Gel Souffle, shook out my hair and went. My hair is curlier, shinier, stronger, bouncy, and soft. I could only be happier with the results if I had used a lighter color.  I used 4.35 and will try 6.xx in 3 months.</li>
            <li> This product is awful.</li>
            <li> made my hair 10x darker than what the box said and will not wash out. Will never use again. Only plus is it did not have a bad odor</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always colored my own hair since I&#x27;m just covering grays and staying in the same medium/brown (sometimes a redder brown) category that isn&#x27;t a dramatic change from my natural color.  Throughout the years I&#x27;ve used many different brands and liked some better than others. I&#x27;d give this 2.5 stars if I could, because I had a few issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In applying the color, the shape of the bottle was horrid. It&#x27;s a round bulb that gets slippery, especially when you&#x27;re wearing gloves! I had a hard time even shaking it up without it slipping from my hands. Then it was a pain to squeeze the mixture on my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After going through the process, rinsing and drying, I can see that the dye did not color the grays at my temples although I specifically targeted that area -- twice, as directed by the instructions. The color is also a tad splotchy. I expect that  will even out with a washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re sensitive to ammonia, I suppose this would be a great product. I&#x27;m okay with the end result I achieve, but not blown away or super impressed.  Since I do not have a sensitive scalp, I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I tried it for the first time yesterday. I chose a blond shade similar to the other brand but it turned out blue-grey. Horrible!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been coloring my own hair for 20 years and this is by far the worst hair color I&#x27;ve ever tried. I&#x27;m not an Amazon Verified purchaser, I bought it at CVS but I wish I&#x27;d gotten online and read the reviews before I bought it in store!&lt;br /&gt;1) it dried my hair out, had to use the entire tube of conditioner, I&#x27;m probably going to have to do a warm olive oil treatment to repair the damage&lt;br /&gt;2) it took FOREVER to rinse out, I literally ran out of hot water&lt;br /&gt;3) the color was very uneven, was an intense color (too intense) in the areas where I started and was almost more of a highlight in the areas I ended with and I really saturated all of my hair with every drop of the color&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely never again! I usually use Loreal Preference and not long ago tried an organic colorant called Tints of Nature, both of which worked great!</li>
            <li> I used the natural light auburn on fine hair.  Color was perfect, it colored my (previously color treated) hair evenly from roots to ends. Please note that the natural auburn is quite subtle, if you are looking for a redder light auburn (say something like Loreal&#x27;s Excellence Light Auburn) then get the intense red light auburn shade instead.  Personally I really like the subtle shade, it looks very natural.  My hair is about 4 inches below the shoulder and one bottle was all that I needed.  There isn&#x27;t any ammonia smell, color rinsed out quickly with no oily residue.  I would definitely recommend this product for other&#x27;s with fine hair with gray.</li>
            <li> Complete fake, definitely not 60% oils instead the opposite. Looking at the ingredients is obvious there are miscellaneous chemicals used with this product and the oils top bottom of the list!</li>
            <li> Used this for the first time today and hated it! Slimy, horrible texture that was hard to rinse-out. I was horrified when I looked in the mirror to see my hair about 7 shades darker than normal! I tried the dark beige blonde colour - and be warned, this shade will turn your hair quite dark if you&#x27;ve already coloured your hair lighter before. My natural hair colour is mid-brown and coloured mid-blonde, but this turned my hair a dull shade of mid-greyish brown, which is really unflattering. I expected a shade warmer, not this dull shade. Also, it grabbed onto my bit of grey around the hairline and made it look just a darker shade of grey! What a nasty result all round. I know I should have done a strand-test, but geez, this has never happened before. Be warned ladies that this hair colour penetrates quite deeply and be very, very careful of the shade you choose. At least I can do it over again in a few weeks - with something else!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Clairol products for years to cover my greys.  Natural Instincts was my regular until about a year ago when I noticed it was fading out faster.  So I switched to Nice &amp; Easy and used it every 2 months or so until I tried Olia about a month ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should mention that I go with light auburns to try to closely match my natural color.  Natural Instincts shade was ok.  Nice &amp; Easy was a little too bright red and not as natural looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when I first used Olia a month ago, I was initially disappointed because the color (light auburn) seemed darker to me.  Shampooed 3 days later and either I had gotten used to the shade, or it toned down a bit.  Anyway, I have loved it ever since.  I mean, seriously, this is the most natural auburn coloring I have ever found.  My husband thinks my hair looks like Tiger&#x27;s Eye now, and he loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that the color stays true.  Hasn&#x27;t gone brassy at all.  And there&#x27;s no obvious grow out line after a whole month.  PLUS, the coverage on my greys is still holding - wow. I am so happy with how it looks and feels; I honestly would have thought I&#x27;d have to spend 4x as much by going to a salon to get these results.  So far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost forgot to mention - it doesn&#x27;t stink when you&#x27;re applying it.  How nice!  But you do have to rinse and rinse and rinse.  Worth it in the long run, but be prepared &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I love &amp;#34;New Garnier Olia Powered Permanent&lt;br /&gt;Haircolor! Its ingredient is the oil, which relaxes-&lt;br /&gt;softens-styles the hair.  The color stays vibrant.&lt;br /&gt;and natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;T. M.</li>
            <li> I try to split this in to two applications because it has too much oil for my hair. I don&#x27;t like the feel of the hair when I apply the whole package.</li>
            <li> I bought two boxes of dye, since I have long hair - which is usually enough (and some left over) with other dyes. I thought that, because it was a creme, it would saturate my hair without much problem - WRONG. I could have used four boxes, maybe, but because the dye doesn&#x27;t naturally saturate, and you have to work the dye in to get it to moved from the ONE SPOT is stays in, you end up missing spots, is bad for you, because this stuff is NOT supposed to be massaged into your scalp AND it gets everywhere as you&#x27;re pulling at your hair to work the dye into spots that it didn&#x27;t cover - not to mention, it just didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;take&amp;#34; to part of my hair. My hair is now two different colors, and I have to wait to dye it again. Thank god my hair is curly and it can pass as highlights for now. I&#x27;ve been dying my hair since I was 16 (I&#x27;m 33) and I know a few things about hair dye. This stuff is horrible. After going red for a while, I wanted to get close to my natural color, which matches up to the color on the box... except, this color is BLACK on my hair, not brown. Never again.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nutrisse for years and I have loved it.  I tried the new Olia for the first time this past Friday.  As always, I followed the directions.  I rinsed my hair until the water ran clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is now Tuesday.  I have washed my hair two more times since Friday. Every time I shampoo and rinse, the water is pinkish (used an auburn shade--660?) I just got into the shower today and again the color is washing out.  I thought this was supposed to be permanent.  The color is leaking out on my  pillow at night, my towels and my shirts.  It has ruined a white shirt and stained a pillowcase.  While I love the color, the application is faulty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the bulb-like applicator is difficult to use.  It slips out of my hand easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take this back to the drawing board, please.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally dye my own hair ( too messy) but I decided to get this product and try it to save money. I have used medium garnet red 5.6 which seems to be a newer color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I mixed the product and applied it quickly with a brush, starting from the roots. I usually dye my hair dark red so there was no major color jump, just wanted to touch up the roots and refresh the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this color because I wanted a cooler toned red,  without a coppery tone. The results were just that, a dark cooler toned red, a little bit brighter than the swatch on the bottle but still nice. It went on fairly consistently, but salon results are better of course. My hair felt a little dry, but nothing as drastic as other reviewers have mentioned. Overall, I am happy with the results. I recommend applying the dye with a brush and not leaving it on longer than 20 minutes foe the best results.</li>
            <li> i am 42 and have a few stray hairs of grey along my hair line.  All the hair colors I have used in the past cover the grey for at least 3 weeks, this one didn&#x27;t do a thing to the grey.  I had it on for 25 minutes and the color is nice on the hair that wasn&#x27;t grey but the grey is still there and the main reason i color my hair is to cover the grey. False advertising on the part of Garnier.  Also, the bottle is very oddly shaped, sort of like a huge egg, so it&#x27;s hard to hold (and to shake when mixing the formula)</li>
            <li> I am not very good at dying my own hair.  So I always have weird dye spots in my face and neck when I do it myself.  I love that it does not dye my scalp or my forehead.  I even dye my eyebrows and don&#x27;t have people staring at me because my face has been dyed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dark brown hair and have to use a dark blonde to get to a light brown shade.  Still love being able to pay $10 vs $60+ in the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only do my roots but I dont feel it dry my hair too much but I also do Keratin treatment on my hair.  I do wash with sulfate free shampoo and conditioners and it the color lasts.  My shade just lightens and does not deposit a lot of color.  I do have around 10% gray and it covers OK but not 100%.  Maybe it might not be the best if wanting to deposit a lot of color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a lot of different brands and this one works for me.  Im sticking with it.</li>
            <li> Color is ok.  But the texture of my hair is not.  Don&#x27;t like the feel or look of my hair after coloring with Olia.  Back to Clairol, and wondering why I switched.</li>
            <li> 5 weeks ago I used Olia because the &amp;#34;no ammonia&amp;#34; really appealed to me. Have been using L&#x27;Oreal for 20 years prior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle design is really bad. The round, bulbous shape is hard to hold and hard to apply. It was a very messy process, as the dye IS very oily or greasy and you cannot hang on to the bottle with the sub-standard gloves provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coverage is not bad- my grays are just starting to pop out and the dye color - one of the browns - is hanging it pretty OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT! BUT! BUT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My usually bouncy-to-curly Italian hair is as flat as a puddle. No matter what root booster, mousse, hair spray or thickener I use (all with good results in the past) my hair lays flat on my skull and refuses to come to life. All other things being equal, it has to be the lingering effects of Olia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I used Olia a month ago my hair has been in a headband because it will not shape or style as it usually did. I am burning my hair and scalp with blow drying, curling iron and round flat iron several times a day, trying to make it do SOMETHING, to absolutely no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am afraid to use another hair color over this mess, but I cannot hold out much longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;no ammonia&amp;#34;  is a good idea, but very poor results.</li>
            <li> Worse than even a temporary color, this didn&#x27;t take at all and within days, was as good as gone. Shocking that something that costs this much should be so disappointing. Don&#x27;t waste a nickel.</li>
            <li> One of the more gentle hair colors that you can buy at the local CVS or Walgreens. Most commercial hair colors are filled with so many horrid chemicals that they will leave your hair a complete mess. Anything by Clairol or Revlon is an absolute disaster. Loreal and Garnier are a bit higher quality and won&#x27;t leave your hair fried. Garnier Olia stays true-to-color and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out the hair.</li>
            <li> Absolutely destroyed my hair!!!! It&#x27;s fu***n straw broken ends! I can&#x27;t believe they advertise it as nurturing to your hair!! The color is freaky off from the other hair color brands! I used Loreal champagne blonde and the equivalent in this hair color (8 1/2) has been a nightmare! My hair is golden blonde with orange tints. The texture is straw! My hair is busting at every stress point! Brushing touching etc!! I cant believe I left my preference and my age defy colors! One is Loreal and I think the other is Clairol. All I can say is my hair is destroyed! I have to get at least! Two inches off!!</li>
            <li> Works well. Covers grey like it claims, however, the step 3 lock in conditioner is heavily scented for my preference. Other than that, great product. Easy instructions and application. Makes my hair soft. Doesn&#x27;t dry out. Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> CONS&lt;br /&gt;color not medium blonde - much blonder.&lt;br /&gt;bottle slippery&lt;br /&gt;gloves slippery&lt;br /&gt;Mixing bottle didn&#x27;t have chemical already in it, so required extra step.&lt;br /&gt;Chemicals too thick to mix by shaking bottle, had to stir them in bottle, causing more exposure to sickening chemical smell.&lt;br /&gt;Chemicals gave me a sore throat and sick feeling which lasted for 2 days. I am chemically sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;They went for style over practicality or ease of use. cool shaped bottle, chic black gloves. Did anyone test this product when it was in the developmental stage?&lt;br /&gt;If you want to complain to the company you have to write to L&#x27;Oreal in France, or give all kinds of personal information on the Garnier website.&lt;br /&gt;This product convinced me that I should go grey and stop the coloring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;Much too light, but pretty color.&lt;br /&gt;Hair had sheen and felt soft.</li>
            <li> It smelled good and didn&#x27;t drip.  It didn&#x27;t fry my hair the way others said. My hair is thick and healthy.  The color didn&#x27;t even take on my grey hairs. And I bought a medium brown.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in this product. I have been using Garnier Nutrisse Nourishing Hair Color (#30 Sweet Cola) for several years and love it. Can&#x27;t find it in local stores anymore so I thought I would give this a try since it&#x27;s by the same company.  Bottle is slippery when wet, but I can live with that.  What I didn&#x27;t like is that it didn&#x27;t give me 100% grey coverage like the box said.  It rinsed out easily and didn&#x27;t stain my scalp, which was nice, but it left my hair feeling like greasy, oily straw.  I applied the conditioner thinking that might help and was disappointed that it still felt like greasy, oily straw when the conditioner was rinsed out.  I decided to wash my hair with color-extend shampoo and condition with my conditioner I get out of the Clairol Nice &#x27;N Easy box (buy this just for the conditioner).  Hair felt better after that.  Dried my hair and it left my hair nice and shiny, but the color is flat and it looks like I colored my hair.  Not the same results I get with the Garnier Nutrisse product.  I&#x27;ve used the Sweet Cola for several years and people didn&#x27;t know I colored my hair until I told them I did.  Not the same result with this product.  The Sweet Cola always covered my grey  - I use a profession dye brush so that I get good coverage.  I didn&#x27;t get splotches of grey with the Olia, it just covered some strands and not others.  I feel like this was a waste of time and money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros - Didn&#x27;t stain my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;  - Left my hair shiny&lt;br /&gt;  - No harsh ammonia smell&lt;br /&gt;  - Didn&#x27;t burn my scalp&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - Didn&#x27;t give good coverage of grey&lt;br /&gt;  - Left my hair feeling like greasy, oily straw&lt;br /&gt;  - Applicator isn&#x27;t the easiest to use&lt;br /&gt;  - Color is flat</li>
            <li> I really like it because it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out or have a nasty chemical smell. It rinses out fine and the color is awesome. I also like it because it&#x27;s more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; based and doesn&#x27;t have ammonia. I mean as natural as it can be. Coloring is never good for your hair but I trust this a little bit more. The only reason I chose a 4 instead of 5 is because I think it does fade a little faster but I feel like it&#x27;s a little easier on my hair so I don&#x27;t mind. All in all I like it a lot and have used it 6 or 7 times now.</li>
            <li> I followed the directly exactly. When I was done my hair was not that much darker and it was splotchy and streaky. That was the only thing that was noticeable. I called my girlfriend and told her and she said the same thing happened with her. It is so bad my husband is out now buying my regular brand because he was the one that notices how awful my hair was. My hair is all one length. The left side of my head has patches of color that took, the top of my head has spots of color and the hair that frames my face is really dark but only about halfway down my hair length. Seriously did anyone even test this product? It is seriously bad. I have been coloring my hair for years and have never run across this problem.</li>
            <li> Used Garnier products before.  But this product did not even color my roots!  Gray stayed gray after 30 minutes. Waste of time.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> I have been coloring my hair for over 40 years and this is the worst product I have used.  Okay, so it didn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance, but it took forever to get all the developer out of the container into the applicator bottle - the applicator bottle was shaped poorly and difficult to hold and use (especially once it got the least bit of product on it - very slippery) - the color was not true to what the box indicated and came out much darker.  I definitely would not recommend it or ever use again.</li>
            <li> I have sisterloc and wanted a quick, fast, and easy process to dye my hair. Garnier Olga Oil satisfied all three requirements. I used light brown on my already auburn with graying around temple hair. My grey in my hair dye same as the rest of my hair. I was surprised that my locs did sock up the dye. I used my own shampoo and conditioner. My hair is soft and fluffy. Will use again.......,</li>
            <li> I am so surprised by the negative reviews!  I have tried many brands over the years and this one is definitely my favorite.  What I love the most is the color results. I use the dark brown which is close to my natural hair color - the results are perfect.  My hair looks very natural from day one.  Many other brands I have used, come out TOO dark and takes a few washes to tone down to the right shade.  However, this one looks perfect from the start.  Secondly, it covers my greys!!!!  Not one grey is left behind.  And lastly, I LOVE that it&#x27;s ammonia free -- this is the first dye I have found that is ammonia free AND permanent.  The odor is very low compared to ammonia based dyes.  The price is amazing too.  I have purchased $20 dye kits (which I think is expensive) and this one beats them all.</li>
            <li> I use this whenever I want, even every 10 days or so, as I am always in a rush and do not like to make appointments for hair coloring. I also cut my own hair in a three way mirror and get many compliments. People even ask if I am wearing a wig since my hair is so shiny! I use WEN also (for three years now) and I no longer have dry,dull hair, as I did when I had a beauty salon do my color. So it is a good option for people like me. Just find your number. Mine is 3 for example, which is soft black or dark brown according to which brand you buy. Go by the number. I have very little grey but I want NONE. My true color is between 3 and 4. the 4 looks too light so I stick to the 3 which I love! Good luck! Spend your money on a massage or a bodywork person or Alexander Technique teacher. Or take singing lessons or cello. (If you are a visual person who can actually do your own hair.) You can get great results with great products like this hair color and WEN.</li>
            <li> Terrible. I have been using Naturtint for years (which I love), but it is hars to find in stores. I grabbed this in a pinch, and the color is overall what I am looking for (dark brown), but it did nothing to cover gray hair. I even left it on for 40 mins instead of the recommended 30, and the silver is all still here, right after the shower to rinse out the dye. Didn&#x27;t use shampoo or even hot water. Disappointing. Back to ordering boxes of Naturtint online...</li>
            <li> I just used this 2 days ago and will be purchasing a different brand today to fix my hair. This color made my hair so dry it literally felt like straw. I followed the directions very closely and my hair looks horrible!!! Never buying this again!</li>
            <li> This is a TERRIBLE product.  I tried it once.  It stripped the $200 keratin treatment out of my hair.  It also did not cover all the gray hair.  BEWARE, if you have a keratin treatment, do not use this!!!!!  I have used Loreal Excellence on my keratin treated hair before and it did not do this.  Also, Excellence always covers all the grays. I would give it 0 stars if I could.</li>
            <li> Compared to the many other brands I have tried, Olia has the least odor and left my hair the softest. Will definitely be buying it again. I like Vidal Sassoon and John Frieda a lot but unless the formulations they&#x27;ve just come out with are as mild smelling as this, Olia will be my permanent brand. For the record, I used black and the shade was quite nice but unremarkable compared to other brands.&lt;br /&gt;Stay away from Loreal Preference. The ammonia smell is horrific and takes about 3 days to dissipate.</li>
            <li> The first box dye I&#x27;ve ever tried and I&#x27;m in love! The color is beautiful. I recommend it. :)</li>
            <li> I have been coloring my hair for over 30 years, and have tried everything on the market (OTC and Pro.). This is the first time I have ever reacted to a hair dye.  I have to rinse it out after less than 10 minutes.  Luckily, the color was O.K.  I had no reaction to the skin test.  In addition, the design of the applicator is ridiculous!  It is hard to grip, especially with the slippery gloves provided. Worse than holding a wet bar of soap.  I had to use two hands to mix the contents. The gloves are a bit small and if wet, you cannot hold anything.  As a former hair dresser, I think this is one of the worse products on the market.  Also, it did not condition the hair as it colored, as advertised.  Just as much damaged as any other product.  Can not recommend for any reason.</li>
            <li> Worst hair dye I have ever used. The color was supposed to be a dark brown, however, my hair came out dark brown in one spot, and the rest was a dark cherry RED. My fiance nicknamed me Patches, as a result..... If only I could go back in time....and NEVER have purchased this product... My hair is also dry as straw. With the combination of the patch makeover, and straw like hair, I was forced to go out and purchase a WIG. gah.</li>
            <li> Worst box color I&#x27;ve ever used. Bad coverage. Huge spots of my hair were somehow not dyed!! What the hell? Had to redo it within a week. Don&#x27;t waste your money to do double damage to your hair.</li>
            <li> WOW I used the other type Nutrise before and loved it, and this is the only color at the store. I am 35, and have average brownish hair past my shoulders that has lots of grey.  THIS PRODUCT SUCKS! I have never had a hair dye not work before. So it turned my hair a good pretty color, EXCEPT it did not fully color all my grays. It turned some of them into metallic shiny silver!!! I still have grey after using this product! THEN they don&#x27;t give you enough product for long hair, so you won&#x27;t get full coverage in the back or at the ends of your hair.  Just use this if you are not covering grey, and have short hair. BEWARE!  Who knows how fast it will wash out? The packaging was cool and I liked the black theme, but this product SUCKS!!!</li>
            <li> The absolute worst hair dye I have ever tried. I purchased this because of the advertised no ammonia and healthier dye for your hair. However this damaged my healthy hair to the point where I had to get 2 inches cut off the ends. As if the damage wasn&#x27;t enough it didn&#x27;t dye my hair one bit. I purchased a medium blonde to try to cover up my platinum blonde highlights in my naturally medium blonde hair. It did not cover any of the highlights and only made my natural hair a dry ashy color. I have used many brands of hair dye and never experienced damage to this point. Two weeks, three coconut oil treatments, and many hair repairing products later, my hair is finally beginning to not feel like straw. Please please take my advice and purchase a different dye. HORRIBLE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this hair color and It doesn&#x27;t cover the gray very well at all. I left the color on my new growth for an extra 10 minutes and it still didn&#x27;t hold onto the grays.  Another thing that I noticed was an abnormal amount of hair loss when rinsing the color out.</li>
            <li> First, I will say that I absolutely loved the color result of this product. It was the perfect dark brown.  I got so many compliments on it. Also, I am a veteran home hair color consumer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now . . . Something is not right with this product.  It may be ammonia-free, but there is a chemical equally harsh, possibly more so in it. There really is no bad smell, but it most certainly had fumes. Fumes that stung both my eyes and throat. That was mysteriously disturbing.  Then, when I washed the color out, my hair felt like wires.  My first thought was, to quote Gob Bluth, \\&quot;I&#x27;ve made a huge mistake.\\&quot; Then I conditioned it, thinking that would take care of the wiry feel. At best, it upgraded the feel from wires to straw.  ??? So I was quite disappointed in this product.  I just touched up my gray roots with Clairol&#x27;s Natural Instincts and, while I have used this product numerous times in the past, I could not get over the difference in the feel of my hair after merely rinsing the color out. Very smooth, no wires. Post-conditioner? Super slick and smooth. I realize that Natural Instincts is semi-permanent, but it also touts the ammonia-free label. I DO NOT recommend Olia. If you do a Google search on it, you will find at least one forum where women have had their hair come out in clumps, or they&#x27;ve not been able to get it rinsed out after days and days of washing and rinsing, and other such horrors. It&#x27;s not worth the cost or the risk, so BUYER BEWARE.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dye! No ammonia. No strong smells. Beautiful color. I&#x27;m always a little hesitant when purchasing a new hair color product. I love this so much, I just bought 2 more so I have my color stocked up! It&#x27;s been almost two weeks since I&#x27;ve colored my hair and the color still looks as it first did. My hair feels silky, not dry. That&#x27;s what I like the best! I sure hope the color lasts. If it doesn&#x27;t I will still use the product. I hate the ammonia smell and the dryness I get from other products.</li>
            <li> A BLOOD BATH IN THE SHOWER!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After seeing all those fabulous commercials with women with just colored, shiny, silky-smooth hair, I decided to opt in for this new color experience by Garnier. I chose 4.60, the Dark Intense Auburn. Initially, I liked the original application bottle, and I was impressed at how easily the color and the toner came out of their respective tubes. Product LOOKED smooth and smelled good too. I shook the bottle to blend the ingredients as per instructions, and began applying it. Moments later, as I continued, the hair color itself became sticky, and caused my hair to wad up. Now, I&#x27;ll admit my hair is long, and it IS an effort to distribute color evenly, but what caused my real concern, is that the base of the applicator bottle is rather round, and dome-like. It slipped out of my gloved hands several times and splattered into the sink. That bottle is very hard to hang onto, because of it&#x27;s shape, especially when your hands are wet with hair color! I ended up having to rinse my gloves to wash the sink clean several times (and surrounding areas as well) That said, it seemed the color was still making my hair tangled and stiff. I used a small hair brush to blend it into my roots and the ends. (More rinsing &amp; cleaning) I then piled all my hair up, clipped it, and went off to play Candy Crush for 30 minutes......&lt;br /&gt;Next: THE SHOWER INCIDENT!!!!!!!!!!1&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s just say, that I closed my eyes, and started rinsing the gore out of my hair. When I opened my eyes, &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; The whole shower floor, walls, curtain, and my body was SPLATTERED in what looked like something from a horror movie!! OMG...OMG.... I applied the conditioner they so thoughtfully provided, and now I see why they advise you to  leave it in for two minutes.  YOU NEED THAT TIME TO WASH AWAY THE EVIDENCE OF A MASSACRE!! It was like a bad episode of Criminal Minds without Shemar Moore in the shower with me! Afterwards, I towel-dried my hair, and let it dry naturally. VERY pretty color, the little grey I had (or as I like to say, &amp;#34;My Bling Strands&amp;#34; were gone, and my hair was great.  ONE THING: NO shine. At all. Not even a little bit. Le Sigh.......tty color, the little grey I had (or as I like to say, &amp;#34;My Bling Strands&amp;#34; were gone, and my hair was great.  ONE THING: NO shine. At all. Not even a little bit. Le Sigh.......</li>
            <li> I have dyed my hair for the past 10 years, and almost exclusively with box dye. What can I say, I&#x27;m cheap. I was excited to find a dye without ammonia, so bought the Intense Auburn 6.60. I was dying my hair from dark blonde, and going from light to darker is always a cinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But nope. This was by far the WORST dye experience I&#x27;ve ever had. Like other commenters state, the first issue is just that the bottle is shaped so poorly it makes it really difficult to grip and squeeze, especially when you have slippery gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onto the actual dye. The worst part is that it just doesn&#x27;t spread. It&#x27;s so heavy that it clumps your hair together and made me miss TONS of areas. It was so patchy that I had to get another box just to fix all the spots, and even with someone else dyeing it for me this time, we still missed tons of spots because of the quality of the dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the finished result! Not only was my hair patchy because of all the missed spots, but most of the spots that did get dyed turned NEON pink/red. Maybe it was just my mistake to assume \\&quot;Intense\\&quot; meant bright red, and not fluorescent. Normally after a dye, my hair feels extra silky because of the super thick conditioner. So in addition to neon hair, it was dry and breaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only plus side of this experience is that I went to a Color Xperts Salon, and they not only got the dye out, but gave me the best hair color I&#x27;ve ever had. So thanks Olia, for swearing me off of box dye from now on. WORST PRODUCT EVER.</li>
            <li> Awful, awful product. The applicator is a strange, bulbous creation that wants to pop out of your hand. The color takes FOREVER to wash out... in fact, water still wasn&#x27;t rinsing clear 5 days later... but that turned out to be because the color was washing out completely. By the week and a half mark, only a trace of the color still appeared at root line. Scalp has been itchy and hair brittle. I&#x27;m deep conditioning ends daily to try to salvage it... but I see a 1&amp;#34; trim in my very near future. Don&#x27;t waste your time or trash your hair on this one!!</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product to anyone.  I use #8 medium blonde, and I had no issues with unexpected color, but when rinsing out the color, my hair felt horrible; dry and a tangled mess.  The included conditioner did help with this feeling, but I did not like it.  Unfortunately,(stupid on my part) I did use the product 2 times and, like other reviewers on line, my hair also fell out in clumps immediately after application and after 2 months, I am experiencing continued, certainly more than normal hair loss every day, to the point where I am seriously concerned of when it is going to stop.</li>
            <li> I had a coupon and so I tool a chance on this. I bought Dark soft Mahogany Brown. I have long curly,thick,fine hair. I had it a vivid red shade and went to an expensive salon to have a 2 process done go cover up the red. (Red is the hardest shade to cover). So my colorcoloe was fading and the red was coming through. Well tonight I opened the box of the olio and the bottle was missing!! I used my salon coloring brush and a mixing bowl to use. I applied the color to my roots and let it sit for 15 minutes. I deducted 5 minutes from the regular process time due to applying the product. I then went back after the 15 min. And applied the rest of the colour to my strands. I worked it in really well and let it sit for another 20 min. Wow! This color is great and I only used on box. It covered up my red and I got the colour on the box too. My hair is really dry. This caused it to be soft and shiny. I have used professional salon colors that I mixed at home, tons of different box colors as well. This is the best by far! The smell didn&#x27;t give me a headache or burn my sensitive scalp. I highly recommend applying this olio with a hair coloring brush and mixing it in a bowl for better, easier I will be buying this again!</li>
            <li> This made a night and day difference.  The oil base makes my hair much less frizzy and dry through the month.  After about six weeks the frizzy situation gets worse.  I usually color every 5--6 weeks.  Easy to use. Although three dispenser bottle is shaped pretty,  it is slippery and is a little inconvenient to hold while coloring.</li>
            <li> I love the product, but the bottle is like a live thing!  It kept slipping out of my hand and made both the mixing and application difficult.  It definitely should be redesigned!</li>
            <li> The color washed out after 2 weeks. The cloying pseudo-flowery smell also disappeared after 2 weeks, replaced by a rancid oil smell. After every time the hair is washed, 2-3 hours later it gets a stale oil smell, which rubs off on hats, hoods of jackets, pillowcases. The oil is supposed to be plant-derived. Maybe an automotive plant? The residue of the Industrial-strength oil prevents shampoo from lathering! 3 weeks after using this hair color, hair feels greasy, dull, limp, heavy and extremely oily, in spite of almost daily washing. Horror!</li>
            <li> Even after all the bad reviews I thought why not, I&#x27;d give it a try!! I should have stuck with my feeling!! I saturated my hair with the color, and I have spots all over where the color didn&#x27;t take!! I have never had this with any other hair color... Very disappointed!! Would not ever recommend this to anyone!! Now I have to wait to try and dye my hair again, that&#x27;s gonna look cute going to work looking like a striped animal!! Ugh! I would not give this any stars, but it would not let me continue without rating it at all..SAD!!</li>
            <li> Waste of money. Did not cover gray AT ALL</li>
            <li> Made my hair turn green which had ever happened to me after years of dying my own hair. My roots turned green but the rest of my hair did not change color. Utter crap!</li>
            <li> I bought this hair color because it seemed like it might be like one that my hairdresser used.  No ammonia or peroxide and smelled great.  The bottle was an awkward shape to use and hold.  Since the dye is oil based the bottle kept slipping out of my hand.  My hair felt stringy after I washed the dye out.  I used the conditioner and my hair still felt stringy.  The color was great..... At first.  Then it seemed like it completely faded in less than two weeks.  And it didn&#x27;t completely cover my greys.  Garnier&#x27;s semi-permanent hair color lasts alot longer. I was really disappointed considering that this is from Garnier. I love all of their products usually.  I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.  I think that Garnier needs to work on this one a little.</li>
            <li> Let me first say that I have been touching up the grey hair at my temples for a decade. I have thick, healthy hair. I followed the directions exactly, coloring my whole head because it was a new shade and it had been a while.Immediately upon washing out the product, my hair felt different: sort of rough. I thought the conditioner would help. I used the conditioner and alarmingly my hair still felt odd. Since then I have had amazingly fly-away, static-filled hair. I wear a smooth, longer bob and have a habit of running fingers through my hair to sort of \\&quot;fluff it\\&quot; when reading or thinking. This habit creates a major static storm, something that had never happened before. When I last got my hair cut, my hair dresser noted the extreme dryness of my hair and asked me if I was doing anything different. This result was very surprising, I did not think a product could damage my hair. But clearly, I lacked imagination! My only consolation is that my hair grows quickly.</li>
            <li> horrible product changed the texture of my hair from soft to coarse, dull, lifeless, brittle.&lt;br /&gt;did not cover grey completely &amp; washed off after a few shampoos.</li>
            <li> To all those out there considering trying this product, please DON&#x27;T!  It is the worst home hair color I have ever used!!! I am quite familiar with home hair coloring since I am of an age where those pesky grays pop up on a regular basis &amp; I don&#x27;t need any help looking older, so I cover them up right away.  I am a big fan of Garnier Herbashine, but I haven&#x27;t had much luck finding it anywhere these days.  I decided to try Olia because it is a Garnier product, and I was intrigued by it being oil-based.  I have very dry, brittle hair, and I thought this haircolor would be gentle and make my hair nice and silky.  The product didn&#x27;t change my hair texture at all, but that&#x27;s not all of my complaints.  First of all it is awkward to apply due to the funny shaped bottle.  Also, it feels very heavy and thick on your hair.  Then it has be left on for 30 minutes!  What happened to 10 minutes like normal hair color?!  Then when you FINALLY get to rinse it out, it takes FOREVER to get it all out because water and oil dont mix!  When I finally saw my hair in its dry colored state, I was very disappointed that it was far too light.  I have naturally dark brown hair, and I was only going for gray coverage so I found a color that was supposed to be close to mine.  According to the box, my natural haircolor with the dye should have produced a darker color than the front of box, so I dont know what happened there!  More importantly, ALL the grays were still showing!  I had to wait six weeks to re-color my hair and thankfully I found a color that works much better.  Natural Instincts is a nice substitution for other Herbashine users that have any trouble finding thier usual color.  I wouldn&#x27;t have given this product any stars at all, but it DID smell pretty good, so I guess I will give it credit for that.  Other than that, dont waste your money!</li>
            <li> I love this haircolor.  I use Darkest Violet 3.16 and it covers the gray.  Most manufacturers don&#x27;t make a violet for gray hair, but I have people stop me on the street, saying they love it, and ask what color I&#x27;m using.  I&#x27;ve used a variety of red/purple shades, and this one fades less than the others.  I&#x27;m still receiving compliments on the color and it&#x27;s been 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> My natural color is dishwater blond that tends to turn coppery when I lighten it, so I was using Nutrisse Light Ash Blonde for years with great success. Since I can no longer find it, I bought the Olia 9.0 Light Blonde and tried it about 6 weeks ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: The color is perfect, there is no horrible smell (it smells fruity), and being a blonde shade, I did not have the issues with the color fading as some others have noted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The name \\&quot;Olia\\&quot; reminds me of a certain synthetic fat product that was a marketing disaster. Did they actually use a focus group to pick the name? The applicator is a nightmare! I have fairly large hands, but even I could not manage to hang onto the bulb-shaped bottle, let alone squeeze out the product in a uniform manner. With the gloves on, the bottle slips right out of my hands. In fact, I would describe it more as squirting out of my hands. I kept dropping it. The directions say to leave the product on the roots for 20 minutes, and then do the rest of your hair for 10 more minutes, but getting the gloves on/off and back on again is next to impossible because they rip. Also, my hair feels much dryer right after coloring than it did with Nutrisse, although that goes away after the first couple of washings (I also use Garnier Fructis shampoo and conditioner).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish that Garnier would have perfected Olia before eliminating shades from Nutrisse (which IMO is a better product), but I&#x27;ll stick with it because I like the color and I don&#x27;t like the other OTC brands out there.</li>
            <li> this is the product to buy if you color your hair!</li>
            <li> I only ever use ammonia free dyes like Revlon Color Silk or the like but I decided with all the hype to give this a try. It has been by far the MOST DAMAGING hair dye I have ever used in my 10+ years of hair color and trust me I have used some harsh peroxide and ammonia based treatments in my time. The color faded and my hair has been falling out in chunks. My hair was fine to begin with and now I am almost completely bald. I&#x27;m going to have to get my head shaved because right now each of the few strands I have left are split and fried to bits. I cannot believe this product is still on the market.</li>
            <li> I have used several different box brands and decided to give this one a try. I chose the darkest golden brown. The color turned out pretty but it REALLY dried out my hair. I used it as directions said to, it was kind of hard to spread the color throughout my hair (i have thin hair so kind of came as a shock) it didn&#x27;t really have the same consistency as other colors i have used before. Like i said the color turned out really beautiful but I&#x27;m not going to risk the dryness again.</li>
            <li> I typically use Nutratint a more natural, vegetable based colorant available in health food stores and online at Amazon. I much prefer Nutratint as it gives a very natural, shiny result and covers grays very well. It also leaves your hair looking healthy. Looking for a cheaper alternative in a commercial color I tried Olia. It did not seem to color my hair as evenly, could see gray roots a week out of my color which was disappointing and I tried to cover roots well with the color. I also thought it was kind of drying to my hair, hair feels a little more brittle and dry to the touch. Overall, it did not color as well or leave my hair as healthy looking and shiny as Nutratint. Even though the odor was not too bad with Oila, Nutratint has hardly any odor at all. Will go back to my more expensive Nutratint because it is a better and probably safer hair color product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised at some of the less enthusiastic reviews here - I will have to see how long the color lasts etc., but  for now, the day after colouring, I am extremely pleased. The process was easy, easier than some of the other at home products I&#x27;ve used, and the thick conditioner left my hair looking and feeling soft, with more volume and shinier than before. The color is also very rich and natural looking, very close to my natural color, which is what I wanted. Will be purchasing this color again, unless it proves to under perform in next couple of weeks!</li>
            <li> First box: excellent coverage on the first 2-3&amp;#34; of hair (closest to scalp) - in fact, it&#x27;s basically Ronald McDonald colored. Streaky, uneven penetration throughout my remaining hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought a second box to try to correct the issue.  STILL looks terrible, and left my hair drier than I&#x27;ve ever experienced from other &amp;#34;harsher&amp;#34; types of hair color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will **NEVER** purchase this brand again.</li>
            <li> The resulting color was very good and gray areas got better than average coverage.  Re: the application process: Adding both the developer and the colorant into the separate container means a less consistent outcome than other products that already have measured out the developer for you.  The gloves are smaller than those provided by other hair color products and are made of some plastic that causes the applicator to be more difficult to hold onto.  The shape of the applicator is not practical for application, though its volume is needed to allow for proper mixing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure I want to buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Wrecked my hair ! Could not get rid of static and dried it out terribly</li>
            <li> i dye my mothers hair with this 2 times a month. Her hair dresser always says how healthy shiny soft and no damage rarely any split ends. I love this for her hair. The amount we touch up every two weeks as her hair grows fast and do all over after about 2 months it still never has dead ends damage. One thing I will say the bottle is hard to hold. I use a bowl and brush.</li>
            <li> I absolutely would not recommend this product to my worst enemy! I colored my hair with this in June and about a week later started having my hair fall out in clumps!!! I even have a small bald spot now! I contacted the company and they assured me that hair color does not cause hair loss. They even sent me a letter saying that too. I just thought how insensitive! So here it is almost September and my hair is still falling out. Needless to say, I am less than pleased.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cover gray worth a darn! I color my own hair all the time and this stuff just plain sucks.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best hair color I&#x27;ve tried OTC and better than the Nutrisse by miles.  Since it&#x27;s 60% oil based, my hair 3 weeks later after coloring it is still healthy looking, shiny, NO roots, not dull or washed out, which it would be by now with other hair colors and I&#x27;ve tried.  I also love the conditioner in the tube.  I will buy this again and again.  Thank you Garnier!  Oh and NO Ammonia so gentle and doesn&#x27;t burn your scalp.</li>
            <li> Was very disapointed. Made my hair so dry and i have naturally oily hair. It also stained my skin more then any hair color i have ever used. The grey coverage was good and the color was decent. A little dark but the commercial states my hair feels and looks heathier. Not true</li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time. I found it easy to use. The bottle does need to be redesigned to make it easier to hold. I have African American textured hair which is relaxed, so oil is something that I don&#x27;t have a problem with having on my hair. When I rinsed it out, my hair did feel a little dry and was only slightly improved after using the conditioner. I added some of my other usual leave-in conditioners and my hair feels fine. All my grays are gone and the color looks very natural. It&#x27;s only been a couple of days, but so far, I am pleased.</li>
            <li> DID NOT cover my gray at all. My hair feels awful too. I had high hopes for this. Don&#x27;t waste your time. I&#x27;m going to a salon to have this disaster fixed.</li>
            <li> It is true that the product does not smell bad like some others but, the applicator dispenser is awful!  Kept slipping out of my hand and I could not squeeze it to get the last of the product into my hair.  Also, there is not enough product.  I have medium length thin hair and there was not enough in the dispenser to do all of my hair.  I thought for the high price of this item, compared to the other brands, I would be head over heels for it, but alas, I will not buy it again.  It also didn&#x27;t do that well on the gray.  Sorry Garnier</li>
            <li> Even tho I got mine at Rite Aid drug store, I wanted to write a review.&lt;br /&gt;I did my hair last night using this product in a dark blonde shade. I have colored my hair for decades, (I&#x27;m 54, and hve colored my hair since I was 12)  using many  different shades of color. This  product did exactly what it said it would do. It smelled great, and even tho it did look very dark  as the color developed, don&#x27;t panic, this is just how its supposed to work. Leave it on for the full amount of time (30 minutes) and just follow the easy directions. This is a darker shade then I usually buy, so I did do an all over coloring. I had just gotten my hair cut the same day , and my hair just barely touches my shoulders, and there was just enough  color for me to use. If your hair is  much longer you will need 2 packages of color.&lt;br /&gt;My hair turned out perfect. I tend to have dry hair, and my hair is silky, the color is even, and I love it. I got exactly what I  paid for and would  buy this product again. The reviewers who had negative comments must not have used the product correctly, because this is a high quality product, and does what it says it will do.&lt;br /&gt;A+++</li>
            <li> This did not smell bad at all.  It smelled pretty and clean.  You receive the mixing bottle, the two solutions that need to be mixed and an after color conditioner, two black protective gloves and instructions.  If your used to home coloring, there are no surprises with mixing.  Twist of the top of the mixing bottle and combine the two color solutions and shake.  The surprise it there is no ammonia scent at all.  The smell is a clean floral, not overpowering, it is a very desirable scent - and the conditioner smells similar and If I could buy the conditioner I would.  My fianc&amp;eacute; could not get enough of how good my hair smelled.  The mixture is not drippy at all, not at all, it is thick like a good conditioner.  It is remarkably easy to put in your hair and there are no messy drips on your neck or forehead.  You leave this on for 30 minutes.  And again, there is no overpowering eye stinging smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then you create a lather in your hair and rinse it out till the water runs clear.  Between you and me I have always had a little extra color left on the hair in the past and have ruined several towels, pillowcases, etcetera.  The water did run clear, and I did not have color residue on my hair. Then you use the conditioner, which smells fab and does a great job of detangling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback I have is that when I dye my hair I typically don&#x27;t wash my hair on the day of the dying, this formula uses oil to saturate your hair, so my hair felt a little greasy after the dye.  And I wasn&#x27;t in a big hurry to wash my hair right away, because I had just dyed my hair and didn&#x27;t want to dry it out or stip color with shampoo.  So the first day was a good day for a messy updo.  If I did it again, I&#x27;d pick a weekend day to do it and wash the next morning.  All and all I would use it again in a hair eat because my hair didn&#x27;t get as dried out as the other dyes, it was easy to use, it smelled amazing.</li>
            <li> I am normally a bleach blonde with super thin hair. I personally hate how bleached out my hair looks during the summer. My hair stylist usually puts low lights in my hair to break it up. I personally wanted something a little different and died my hair dark brown at the beginning of the summer. My hair didn&#x27;t take well with the box dye and has been a little dry since. I decided to give this a try since its oil based. My hair definitely doesn&#x27;t feel as dry as it did before and got rid of my way to white for a 22 year old roots. I ended up using my personal gloves for the process because I ripped the ones they gave me on accident. The bottle looks really cool but was really hard to hold onto as everyone has already mentioned. I feel like I was using higher end products based on the bottles but it seemed wasteful at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am really happy so far with the product. I LOVE that there is no ammonia and is oil based. This is waaay safer to use and put on your body. I will certainly keep using the product vs $150 salons.</li>
            <li> Reading the label - especially the legible part (much of it is illegible) you would get the impression that this hair color uses only natural vegetable oils and no nasty chemicals. But that is really hard to believe and apparently not true. When you apply it, it produces a nasty, horrible chemical stink that is at least as bad that as that of any obviously toxic hair dye. The smell is truly offensive and completely unacceptable. The smell is very persistent and hard to get rid of - it doesn&#x27;t wash out readily. After much research, we found out that if you soak you hair with vinegar and leave it in for about 20 minutes, you can get rid of most of the smell (it might take out some of the color too, not sure.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should know that nobody, nobody is watching out for your health, in terms of potential ill effects of hair dye and many other products, and there is very little meaningful regulation. If you are at all concerned about this, you might want to stay away from the whole family of Garnier Olia products. We will never again allow it in the house.</li>
            <li> This is ammonia free so it didn&#x27;t burn my nose or scalp during the 30 minute setting period. I mostly chose to color my hair at home to cover my grays and save money. I got a medium brown color for my medium brown hair and it put some color to my grays, didn&#x27;t cover them completely but the color overall is gorgeous!! I got a fabulous compliment from my boyfriend who can&#x27;t believe how well the color turned out compared to m y $200 salon dye jobs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip, start with the grays and hairline, try to spend time massaging the color into the length of every hair, it took me about 15 minutes to get there. The dye potion is not as viscous/oily as I am used to so I just kept working it in until I thought all the hairs were covered completely. The step #3 conditioner is very luxurious. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this hair color a better review but I can&#x27;t.  It smells great, it&#x27;s nice and thick and easy to apply, and the color (at first) is gorgeous.  I&#x27;ve used the Darkest Brown 3 times now, and I won&#x27;t be using it again. I have sporadic grey throughout my dark hair, including one small section at my temple, and the Olia color simply does not last.  The color is vibrant for about a week (3 washes), and then fades rapidly, especially on the grey hair.  I&#x27;ve colored my hair for years and have a lot of experience with home dyes, and I&#x27;ve never had haircolor fade the way the Olia has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking to enhance your natural color, this might not be a bad product.  If, like me, you&#x27;re looking for grey coverage that doesn&#x27;t require touch-ups every 3-4 weeks, you might want to stick with a different formulation.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible. I will NEVER use again and DO NOT RECOMMEND! This product left my hair patchy and very dry. I don&#x27;t understand considering this is an OIL-BASED product. I&#x27;m worried that I&#x27;m not going to get my hair recovered and have to cut it to save it. Please, save yourself the hassle and DO NOT purchase this product or try it.</li>
            <li> I have both home and salon dyed my hair for 8+ years to cover grey, but my scalp is exremely sensitive to the chemicals used, even other ammonia free or semi-permanent colors.  I generally take benadryl an hour before I dye and then continue benadryl for 2 days after because my scalp is itchy and extremely sensitve - but I can&#x27;t stand the greys so I suffer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw this box on the shelf I decided to just try it - after all I already have the worst reaction to other dyes so it was not a risky proposition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thankful I didn&#x27;t read the negative reviews from others in advance since they may have scared me off... instead, I&#x27;m happy to say that this product worked beautifully and WITHOUT stinging/itching/irritation to my scalp.  I did take my usual benadryl before, and as a precaution 1 more dose, but didn&#x27;t really need it.  My scalp did not tingle during the application and I double applied the conditioner so my hair felt completely silky. A huge recommend and the only hair color I will be using going forward.</li>
            <li> The best price I have found on this brand of dye and it works really good. If you have long hair buy at least 2 bottles</li>
            <li> First I want to say that I actually really love the hair dye.  It smells and feels good.  My color came out very nice (Darkest Brown).  It covered the gray and my hair was very soft.  That packaging was AWFUL!!!!!.  First of all the developer is not in the dispenser, in my opinion this is a waste and just creates one more piece of trash for me to throw out.  I was unable to squeeze all of the developer and color agent into the dispenser, good thing I have short hair. Then when I went to shake it up, I had a hard time getting a good grip on the oddly football shaped dispenser bottle with really long tip.  I literally had to use to hands to shake this up.  The weird shape of the dispenser bottle was difficult to hold.  It was disappointing because I liked the shape of the tip and was looking forward to having a lot of control.  This bottle actually slipped right out of my hand about 3 different times.  It was so frustrating.  Again, glad I have short hair. The other plus is the non drip formula.  For once I&#x27;m not having to use a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser to clean my ears :o)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this. I used this in the light auburn. My roots came out great but it did not color the rest of my hair, and I well saturated my hair. I waited 2 days to wash my hair after using it and when I washed my hair all of the color bled out. I&#x27;ve been dying my own hair for 10 years and this is by far the worst hair color product I have ever used. Thank god for Color Oops!</li>
            <li> Although its great that there&#x27;s no ammonia I did have a lot of breakage and the darkest brown turned out black.</li>
