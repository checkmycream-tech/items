    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Not the best.</li>
            <li>What I like best about this shaver is that it has a flexible head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best used to compliment a manual razor but shouldn&#x27;t be used on</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the best shaver for the money.</li>
            <li>This was the best price.</li>
            <li>This Remington is not the best one they have built</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not the best razor on the market.</li>
            <li>Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li>but the plastic isn&#x27;t the best quality.  </li>
            <li>GREAT shaver for the money!</li>
            <li>very good for the price</li>
            <li>Worked great for a week.</li>
            <li>A really great trimmer.</li>
            <li>was no9t happy.</li>
            <li>It will work great on light/medium and non-dense beards.    </li>
            <li>This is a great low-cost shaver.</li>
            <li>My own experience with the brand has been wonderful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do yourself a favor and save up for something around $130 for a good shaver.  </li>
            <li>It is not rubberized for a good grip.</li>
            <li>but this is a good one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is an all plastic design given the price point, it can be a good shaver for travel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had good luck with Remington electric shavers, so it was no surprise when the Remington F3-3900B met my expectations.</li>
            <li>For an inexpensive shaver, it does a surprisingly good job.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think any electric shaver can do as good a job as a manual razor.  </li>
            <li>The product seemed to be good, but according to him the packaging made it seem as if it was used.</li>
            <li>Good value for the money.</li>
            <li>But if you are looking for a good electric razor</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s true for all foil shavers, they work best with firmer skin.</li>
            <li>If you love Remington, just choose a nicer model!</li>
            <li>(I think my wife&#x27;s just glad he&#x27;s shaving!)  </li>
            <li>This Remington F3-3900B shaver was impressive on first use.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>It pivots nicely as you go, too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been too thrilled with any electric razor for shaving my legs</li>
            <li>Nothing spectacular.  </li>
            <li>it is handy for cleaning out the trimmings that get stuck in the cutter blocks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found it especially useful at the jaw and chin.</li>
            <li>Charging time is good as well as being able to use it plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>husband routinely uses a high end foil razor made by Panasonic with which he is very happy (well to the extent that he musters enthusiasm for anything utilitarian).  </li>
            <li>This was a very cheaply made shaver.</li>
            <li>The power button feels like very cheap plastic</li>
            <li>well the hubby likes to keep an electric shaver around for quick touch ups and this one looked like a good bet.  </li>
            <li>This razor is okay.</li>
            <li>Was better than the one I was replacing</li>
            <li>It cut just OK.</li>
            <li>Complain is more like it.  </li>
            <li>Okay, I get it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think you will find a better razor at this price.</li>
            <li>His beard is, at most, medium in texture.</li>
            <li>He was so glad to get this inexpensive Remington because he wanted to have a spare to keep in his car.</li>
            <li>The razor is made mostly of plastic, has a two foil head, and a popup trimmer.</li>
            <li>I was really impressed with the REMINGTON F5-5800A and initially thought the REMINGTON F3-3900B RECHARGEABLE FOIL WITH PIVOT AND FLEX TECHNOLOGY would shave just as close to the skin.</li>
            <li>I already have an electric shaver that I love</li>
            <li>So far so good as the saying goes as this has been good to me.</li>
            <li>but also just SOUNDS like it has a ton more oomph.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the best for very coarse hair or for people with softer skin.</li>
            <li>and it worked ok.  </li>
            <li>my instinct would not be to grab this one, there are others that are much better, the quality of this one just doesn&#x27;t seem to be up there.</li>
            <li>Overall an excellent entry-level electric razor that provides as close a shave as electric shavers costing many times more.</li>
            <li>I guess I did at their age, too), and while the pivot head isn&#x27;t as useful as the advertising might suggest, it does a good job.  </li>
            <li>top of the line in my book.</li>
            <li>ok.  </li>
            <li>After trying to put the screen back into position the razor seemed to work okay, but he wasn&#x27;t very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Works ok.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The reason I like an electric shaver is to avoid shaving off the top of a raised mole on my face.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Shaves ok.</li>
            <li>and he liked the weight of it- on the light side.  </li>
            <li>No matter how many times he passed it over his face</li>
            <li>I suggest spending more money for one of the better models.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay deal</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>for many years (until the rechargeable battery died) which had been described by a well known consumer&#x27;s magazine as \\&quot;the Mercedes of women&#x27;s razors\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>For the price I do not believe you can do better.</li>
            <li>If it came with a cleaning brush, charging dock and a better charge indicator it would be a 5 star product.  </li>
            <li>He also thought it clogged more easily than others he has used.  </li>
            <li>For an electric razor it does a good job shaving, not as close an a manual, but good enough in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Medium-light is probably more accurate.</li>
            <li>The top of the shaver tends to block light from reaching what I&#x27;m trying to trim.</li>
            <li>In my experience it was an accurate description, delivering a shave almost as close as a blade safely and comfortably.  </li>
            <li>Now, I can&#x27;t say for sure that the F3 isn&#x27;t 100% better, but it would have to be to be worth owning</li>
            <li>I must give a thumbs up to Amazon, returning it was easy.</li>
            <li>The on/off switch is the size of your thumb and switches easily.  </li>
            <li>head is easily flexible.</li>
            <li>The head protector doesn&#x27;t go on or come of easily.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic mowed through the beard easily giving a fine shave.</li>
            <li>As a result, he’s mostly going to use this for off-cycle touch-ups of his scruff and not as a replacement for a full shave with a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit noisy and not as comfortable as the rotary style shavers, but works well and charges very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Previously, I owned a Braun 3612 which for the price did an excellent job in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>that being said, even with the best electric shavers, you can&#x27;t get all the hairs removed, which usually requires the old manual blade shaver, but for a quick shave when you&#x27;re in a hurry or just need something for your travel bag, then this is ideal.</li>
            <li>This razor is light weight, and is made really cheap.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really recommend Remington brand shavers at all to be honest.</li>
            <li>The plastics, power button, pivot head, and head cover feel cheap.</li>
            <li>This model is so cheap</li>
            <li>/&gt;It just seems cheap to me, who is admittedly not an expert on electric shavers.  </li>
            <li>For the price and my needs, the F3 fit the bill and performs about the way I figured it would.</li>
            <li>Light weight&lt;</li>
            <li>It is not rinse-able, but it is fairly easy to clean with the included comb.  </li>
            <li>I have dense, coarse hair, and this Remington dida great job of clearing it out.  </li>
            <li>charging light does nothing except that it glows when you are charging.</li>
            <li>If I find after recharging that the light does go off when fully charged, I&#x27;ll update this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In all actuality, this shaver feels quite cheap in your hand and frankly does not give you that close of a shave.</li>
            <li>B00188BQXI Remington WDF-3600 Smooth &amp; Silky Women&#x27;s Shaver]]</li>
            <li>The cheap Remington foil shavers are marginal.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is wider than most shavers, which is useful for a clean cut.</li>
            <li>The first two times it worked to clear my beard, but after that it stopped working great.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s price will make it accessible for those on a budget.</li>
            <li>I have fine blonde hair, I thought this would be good to keep around in case</li>
            <li>This razor is an entry level basic foil shaver which does a good job on medium to fine hair.</li>
            <li>The cut was clean.</li>
            <li>My face appears rosy and clean after I shave with this Remington.</li>
            <li>(I use it, though, to clean up areas of my face not covered by my trim beard, so do not need</li>
            <li>Finally last year I was able to once again order the razor linked above, and found that it still was the best of what was available for women, at that point having tried them all (or very close to it)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Actually works really good god</li>
            <li>It is rechargeable and does a good enough job on the shave.</li>
            <li>Overall, good value for the money.</li>
            <li>The battery holds a good charge that allows for several shaves before needing recharged.</li>
            <li>It lasts 30 minutes on a full charge.</li>
            <li>charge time for a full charge.</li>
            <li>The Remington F3-3900B is definitely not a bad electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>For a basic shaver, it&#x27;s a good deal, although I&#x27;d recommend this one more for traveling rather than using it as your main shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In many ways it’s effectively the same foil shaver as that old model, just with a more ergonomic handle and rechargeable battery.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And, most importantly, it goes back on easily.</li>
            <li>For that, one is better off purchasing something of a better quality, such as the REMINGTON F5-5800A RECHARGEABLE FOIL WITH INTERCEPTOR SHAVING TECHNOLOGY.</li>
            <li>Works well, but foil seemed to wear too quickly.  </li>
            <li>It cost four times more, but was ten times better.</li>
            <li>But this one is barely adequate.</li>
            <li>The pivot function is nice and not all electric razors have that, but the overall cheap feel of the product doesn&#x27;t give the user confidence in the pivoting motion.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t buy another Remington product until they have improved their quality and made reasonably priced parts easily available (or include 3 or 4 replacement screens with the original purchase).</li>
            <li>On normal growth it did OK, but required a lot of going over spots trying to get stray whiskers.</li>
            <li>He said it was a pretty \\&quot;light weight\\&quot; shaver.</li>
            <li>Actually works better than the one i originally had!</li>
            <li>After the first shave the blades don&#x27;t cut as clean?</li>
            <li>It fit well in his rather large hand</li>
            <li>Do this three (3) times THEN install the new cutters you had the foresight to get with the original purchase!.</li>
            <li>stars for build: mechanically sound, quality blade but very plastic</li>
            <li>Economical and practical.</li>
            <li>I expected a good product from Remington and this one is.</li>
            <li>And I am not a beginner I have used electric most of my adult life - Remington</li>
            <li>I am in the unusual position of being able to compare it to most of what is on the market, because when I came back to Amazon to purchase a replacement I discovered that for some reason they would not ship it to Hawaii</li>
            <li>/&gt;It worked right out of the &amp;#34;box.&amp;#34; And it shaves quite closely for an electric shaver.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This new model does not appear to be as strong or cut as close.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, mainly plastic, and has a two foil head and a popup trimmer.</li>
            <li>It took much longer to get a clean shave with the Remington.</li>
            <li>Great Shaver makes me clean and neat, has a long run time and totally rocks</li>
            <li>The handle is comfortable and easy to hold in various positions.</li>
            <li>You could get by with it, but I, personally, would much rather pay more, be done quicker, and enjoy a nicer shave.</li>
            <li>For that, one is better off purchasing something of a better quality, such as the REMINGTON F5-5800A RECHARGEABLE FOIL WITH INTERCEPTOR SHAVING TECHNOLOGY.ons, has a low battery life, and is time-consuming to clean.</li>
            <li>This is a good little shaver, economically priced.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The top pops off easily to clean the loose hair out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d also pay a few extra bucks if the case sported a snazzy racing stripe or pretty colored balloons or something, so maybe I&#x27;m not the best judge of this sort of thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, I guess he isn&#x27;t going to use it very much</li>
            <li>This sits towards the lower end of their line, but like other Remingtons, is reliable, produces a safe, close and comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>I have had foil shavers before and have never had to run through the same spots as many times as this</li>
            <li>But remember this unit is not expensive.</li>
            <li>After opening the razor from the box, I was quite surprised at how light the razor is.</li>
            <li>After just the first use, I noticed that the razor did not give as close a shave as the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I have used the razor more than once a day and, therefore, have occasionally had to charge it 2-3 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so these were my first 2 electric razors.</li>
            <li>This is my first time my family has used a foil type shaver.</li>
            <li>$23.62, which is the price today on Amazon, this would be an inexpensive shaver if it were worth that much, but it&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After first use it did not work as well</li>
            <li>F3 keeps its charge pretty well.  </li>
            <li>However, I was looking for something that was quicker than shaving with a razor but not expensive.  </li>
            <li>so a higher end shaver is what he uses for every day.  </li>
            <li>He also really likes the pop-up trimmer!</li>
            <li>I would not expect it to hold up under daily use for more than 6 months to a year.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The foil section doesn’t get hot (measured 90 degrees F with infrared temp gage).&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>So, if you have light facial hair, with thin hairs, this razor is excellent.</li>
            <li>It cuts really well on light/medium beards, the head tilts back and forth to allow for face contours, it grips well, and it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li>While you won&#x27;t need to replace foils and cutters often, be sure to grab yourself one when its on sale for future use.    </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s an LED light to signal charging and charge complete.  </li>
            <li>When I first used it, I charged it for 24 hours plus, as recommended in the instructions.</li>
            <li>(Course, maybe it needed to be charged quite a bit more than 24 hours initially?).</li>
            <li>shaving quality is about the same, too: it gets most of the hair but tends to leave some small patches here and there; it takes multiple passes over the same area to get most of the hair; it’s most effective on shorter whiskers than longer; and, ultimately, the stubble seems to reappear more quickly than when he shaves with a blade.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It takes several days&#x27; worth of passes to get all of the stubble, and even then it doesn&#x27;t leave a smooth finish.</li>
            <li>I finally turned to Amazon and found this razor, it meets all my expectations, which are, simply, a compact, rechargeable razor, at a good price, that does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>Coming from a DA307 that I&#x27;ve been using for the last ten or so years, this model seems much more cheaply made.</li>
            <li>one is not as good as past models.</li>
            <li>and After 8-10 total rounds on my face your maybe half done, especially fine hairs.</li>
            <li>all the new inprovements only make it better.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re Asian like me, this shaver will work fine for you.</li>
            <li>/&gt;For a super smooth shave, I do usually finish with a quick pass of a disposable razor.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;o</li>
            <li>I have a heavy beard being Italian, but this shaver does a great job.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not about to spend even the seemingly reasonable $20 to find out.</li>
            <li>The foil microscreen shaver does an acceptable job, no complaints with that feature, but the pop-out trimmer is very sub-par.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very noisy and  We received this razor to test; if we had paid for it, it would have been returned after one try.</li>
            <li>It gets VERY close to my skin without tearing it up and leaving me wounded.</li>
            <li>I have a different Remington electric razor that was targeted towards females that not only works really great (over two years later!)</li>
            <li>Absolute junk.</li>
            <li>But, it gets the job done and does it really well.</li>
            <li>And there is no indicator to tell you how much charge is left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was cheap enough that I decided to cut my loss and toss it.  </li>
            <li>But, to tide me over, I pulled out a 10 year old travel shaver (Shave Man) from the back of my closet and tested it to see if it still worked; it did a better job than the Remington ever did, so added the charger to my collection of unused AC adapters and deposited the Remington where it should have been all along, the trash.</li>
            <li>far as facial hair, my son said it&#x27;s ok as well.  </li>
            <li>But if you have a lot of facial hair, with coarse and dense hair, this razor won&#x27;t be effective anymore.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed with the razor, which my son is using, was that it was very loud.  </li>
            <li>As many of the other posts I bought this as a cheaper way to shave 2-3 times a week.</li>
            <li>After recently being reintroduced to the quality of the Remington brand, I was excited to test and try the REMINGTON F3-3900B RECHARGEABLE FOIL WITH PIVOT AND FLEX TECHNOLOGY.</li>
            <li>I still think my other is better</li>
            <li>After a week can&#x27;t get the same clean cut as before.</li>
            <li>charge time is fast, you can also use it with the cord, and it is a decent size, so not quite as clunky as others if you are traveling and space</li>
            <li>The twin foil design with pivot and flex technology allows the shaving surface to glide over the face and give a clean shave without having to go over those problem areas several times.</li>
            <li>a full shave).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is certainly reasonable for this quality of a shaver (currently just under $24 at Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I guess they didn&#x27;t put their usual product design team on this one, however, because I just asked him for an honest opinion about the shaver</li>
            <li>Overall, not a bad value for the price.</li>
            <li>*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At $47.24, which would be double the price on Amazon today, this would be a somewhat inexpensive shaver if it were worth that much, but it&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems to hold a charge for a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li>I used an older version of their women&#x27;s [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>and so I purchased something else locally, found it unsatisfactory, came back and bought another and another (many of which I reviewed at the time)</li>
            <li>His opinion of this shaver is that it’s just ok: if Remington still uses the slogan “as close as a blade or your money back” then he’d ask for his money back.</li>
            <li>Also included is a double sided comb with short and long bristles, and it&#x27;s a really good comb.</li>
            <li>It even sounds tinier and high pitched when using.</li>
            <li>Either way I highly recommend this rechargeable razor.</li>
            <li>It was listed new for us, and it came in a open damaged box, and it had hair in it, and looked like a returned open box item that was used for sure.</li>
            <li>While more expensive units will incorporate rubber grips, this model is all plastic, but the textured plastic still allows good drip with dry hands.</li>
            <li>My husband normally uses a Norelco that costs about $70 on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I normally use Norelco rotary shavers.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t cut the more bristly white and grey hairs leaving a patchy appearance to the shave and necessitating the additional use of another razor.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know for sure, but I think it can only be used as a dry shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only positive is that it does hold a charge really well.</li>
            <li>; that this razor features and it charges quickly and runs long.  </li>
            <li>Either that or my skin just needed something new to stimulate the circulation.</li>
            <li>The battery of the F3-3900B isn&#x27;t as strong as other Remingtons, either: if the razor if fully charged you will get between 6-12 shaves before you have to completely charge the razor again.</li>
            <li>It is hopeless on more than a few days&#x27; growth -- at least of my own personal beard -- and on a one-day growth it still takes a really large number of passes.  </li>
            <li>But even after the 24 hour period plus a few hours, the light never went off, that is to indicate a full charge, so as far as I can tell, so far at least, I won&#x27;t be able to tell when it is done charging.</li>
            <li>at $11.81, which would be half the price, this would be a very inexpensive shaver if it were worth that much, but it&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Remington is also much harder to clean and has a weaker trimmer.</li>
            <li>My only problem is there is no low battery light.</li>
            <li>I never liked the offset shape, it sort of forces itself into a position in which it doesn&#x27;t shave all that well; a straight handle would have been more maneuverable.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re used to a manual wet shave it will not be a satisfying experience as you will have to make several passes to get at all the</li>
            <li>I am frankly surprised because the women&#x27;s razor comes with those things and more, but Remington makes quite a variety for men and just a few for women.  </li>
            <li>He has never needed to shave daily, though he normally does simply to look neat and clean.  </li>
            <li>The charger is quick and the battery lasts for at least five full shaves.</li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for more then a couple of uses and the power is always so low, I have to keep shaving over the same area several times.  </li>
            <li>In this case, you get an inexpensive shaver that delivers exactly what you would expect for the low price paid.</li>
            <li>It cut my facial hair easily on first glide, and even got hair that I had missed with my rotary.</li>
            <li>Better than the ones Norelco usually includes with its shavers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In terms of cleanup, the F3-3900B takes longer to clean than other electric razors I have used.</li>
            <li>While he can talk for hours about the nuances of  strategy game or the performance of the latest graphics card he is not much interested in basic appliances, even when they are for his own use.  </li>
            <li>It shave was ok, but left my face with a black residue that needed washing  off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s little louder than the rotary shavers, but, wow, it sure makes short work of a couple of day&#x27;s beard growth.</li>
            <li>It is clear that Remington cut corners to keep the price around $20.</li>
            <li>It was a bit much for a 16 year old, and so I got my son a basic rechargeable rotary and thought this was a complement, or would provide him the opportunity to decide which style</li>
            <li>Then, while I was using the trimmer, the whole thing fell apart in my hands and dropped a couple of tiny shards of plastic, which used to be the hinges, onto the floor.</li>
            <li>This inexpensive model just doesn&#x27;t work on my husband&#x27;s rather soft beard.</li>
            <li>The head pivots and flexes to get every nook and cranny on my aging old face.</li>
            <li>wanted an old micro screen shaver and got this one instead.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It does not come with a charging dock but plugs directly into the wall.  </li>
            <li>I shared this razor with a male friend who doesn&#x27;t shave very often, and should.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to do several passes to get a decent shave.  </li>
            <li>After using it everyday for two weeks it just does not do as good of a job as my usual Gillette Pro Glide manual razor.</li>
            <li>It works, but it doesn&#x27;t shave as close to the skin as other Remingtons, has a low battery life, and is time-consuming to clean.</li>
            <li>have had other, more expensive, Remington shavers that were fine.</li>
            <li>That is very basic.his price, it&#x27;s a close call, because you really do get a solid reliable product for the price, but other things aside, they should have included a cleaning brush.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll only run into trouble if the stubble is a few days old, but as long as you shave daily, getting hairs caught up shouldn&#x27;t be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s lightweight and comfortable to hold, build quality seems ok</li>
            <li>and I discovered that the price of a replacement screen from Remington is about the same as the price of a new shaver, so a bought an aftermarket screen for about $10, which lasted longer.</li>
            <li>With more expensive models, you get rubber grips, cleaning solutions, but if none of that matters to you, this is a capable shaver.</li>
            <li>This unit works, but it&#x27;s very loud and the foils heat up quite a bit within a short period of time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a major disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to other people shopping for a teen, or just for an economical razor.  </li>
            <li>Whether my hair was short 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, or long 3 day wanna-be-beard, I just couldn&#x27;t get this razor to really work well</li>
            <li>evaluate this product, I tried it with a normal days growth, and then also went a couple of days without shaving and tried it again, in both cases comparing it to my much more expensive (4x) Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li>There is barely any power</li>
            <li>It barely cut anything.  </li>
            <li>This razor definitely takes some time getting used to if you&#x27;re used to the old fashioned way.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve gotten by with only having to shave once in the morning.</li>
            <li>BARELY WORKS.</li>
            <li>Also, it did not remotely work on my beard at all.  </li>
            <li>It barely shortened it and pinched my skin twice in the process.  </li>
            <li>Amazon has many poor product photos.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There is nothing wrong with Remingtons - he has loved them as much as his Norelco in years past.  </li>
            <li>I have coarse and dense facial hair, and this razor couldn&#x27;t clear out the hair anymore.  </li>
            <li>He also gave it back the next day and let me hear how loud it is.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s good for sensitive skin like mine, but the low power and having to charge it often makes this model a bad choice for me.</li>
            <li>There are two separate blade heads instead of a double head which makes it twice as hard to clean.</li>
            <li>At this price, it&#x27;s a close call, because you really do get a solid reliable product for the price, but other things aside, they should have included a cleaning brush.</li>
            <li>Remington doesn&#x27;t claim it has such a coating, but I wonder whether adding such a feature would be worth a few bucks to consumers.  </li>
            <li>The only downside is how loud it is compared to more expensive models, possibly double the noise level.</li>
            <li>but it a little unwieldy with the large head.  </li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Not the best.</li>
            <li> What I like best about this shaver is that it has a flexible head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best used to compliment a manual razor but shouldn&#x27;t be used on</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the best shaver for the money.</li>
            <li> This was the best price.</li>
            <li> This Remington is not the best one they have built</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not the best razor on the market.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> but the plastic isn&#x27;t the best quality.  </li>
            <li> GREAT shaver for the money!</li>
            <li> very good for the price</li>
            <li> Worked great for a week.</li>
            <li> A really great trimmer.</li>
            <li> was no9t happy.</li>
            <li> It will work great on light/medium and non-dense beards.    </li>
            <li> This is a great low-cost shaver.</li>
            <li> My own experience with the brand has been wonderful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do yourself a favor and save up for something around $130 for a good shaver.  </li>
            <li> It is not rubberized for a good grip.</li>
            <li> but this is a good one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is an all plastic design given the price point, it can be a good shaver for travel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had good luck with Remington electric shavers, so it was no surprise when the Remington F3-3900B met my expectations.</li>
            <li> For an inexpensive shaver, it does a surprisingly good job.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think any electric shaver can do as good a job as a manual razor.  </li>
            <li> The product seemed to be good, but according to him the packaging made it seem as if it was used.</li>
            <li> Good value for the money.</li>
            <li> But if you are looking for a good electric razor</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s true for all foil shavers, they work best with firmer skin.</li>
            <li> If you love Remington, just choose a nicer model!</li>
            <li> (I think my wife&#x27;s just glad he&#x27;s shaving!)  </li>
            <li> This Remington F3-3900B shaver was impressive on first use.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> It pivots nicely as you go, too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been too thrilled with any electric razor for shaving my legs</li>
            <li> Nothing spectacular.  </li>
            <li> it is handy for cleaning out the trimmings that get stuck in the cutter blocks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found it especially useful at the jaw and chin.</li>
            <li> Charging time is good as well as being able to use it plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> husband routinely uses a high end foil razor made by Panasonic with which he is very happy (well to the extent that he musters enthusiasm for anything utilitarian).  </li>
            <li> This was a very cheaply made shaver.</li>
            <li> The power button feels like very cheap plastic</li>
            <li> well the hubby likes to keep an electric shaver around for quick touch ups and this one looked like a good bet.  </li>
            <li> This razor is okay.</li>
            <li> Was better than the one I was replacing</li>
            <li> It cut just OK.</li>
            <li> Complain is more like it.  </li>
            <li> Okay, I get it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you will find a better razor at this price.</li>
            <li> His beard is, at most, medium in texture.</li>
            <li> He was so glad to get this inexpensive Remington because he wanted to have a spare to keep in his car.</li>
            <li> The razor is made mostly of plastic, has a two foil head, and a popup trimmer.</li>
            <li> I was really impressed with the REMINGTON F5-5800A and initially thought the REMINGTON F3-3900B RECHARGEABLE FOIL WITH PIVOT AND FLEX TECHNOLOGY would shave just as close to the skin.</li>
            <li> I already have an electric shaver that I love</li>
            <li> So far so good as the saying goes as this has been good to me.</li>
            <li> but also just SOUNDS like it has a ton more oomph.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the best for very coarse hair or for people with softer skin.</li>
            <li> and it worked ok.  </li>
            <li> my instinct would not be to grab this one, there are others that are much better, the quality of this one just doesn&#x27;t seem to be up there.</li>
            <li> Overall an excellent entry-level electric razor that provides as close a shave as electric shavers costing many times more.</li>
            <li> I guess I did at their age, too), and while the pivot head isn&#x27;t as useful as the advertising might suggest, it does a good job.  </li>
            <li> top of the line in my book.</li>
            <li> ok.  </li>
            <li> After trying to put the screen back into position the razor seemed to work okay, but he wasn&#x27;t very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Works ok.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason I like an electric shaver is to avoid shaving off the top of a raised mole on my face.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Shaves ok.</li>
            <li> and he liked the weight of it- on the light side.  </li>
            <li> No matter how many times he passed it over his face</li>
            <li> I suggest spending more money for one of the better models.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay deal</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> for many years (until the rechargeable battery died) which had been described by a well known consumer&#x27;s magazine as \\&quot;the Mercedes of women&#x27;s razors\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> For the price I do not believe you can do better.</li>
            <li> If it came with a cleaning brush, charging dock and a better charge indicator it would be a 5 star product.  </li>
            <li> He also thought it clogged more easily than others he has used.  </li>
            <li> For an electric razor it does a good job shaving, not as close an a manual, but good enough in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Medium-light is probably more accurate.</li>
            <li> The top of the shaver tends to block light from reaching what I&#x27;m trying to trim.</li>
            <li> In my experience it was an accurate description, delivering a shave almost as close as a blade safely and comfortably.  </li>
            <li> Now, I can&#x27;t say for sure that the F3 isn&#x27;t 100% better, but it would have to be to be worth owning</li>
            <li> I must give a thumbs up to Amazon, returning it was easy.</li>
            <li> The on/off switch is the size of your thumb and switches easily.  </li>
            <li> head is easily flexible.</li>
            <li> The head protector doesn&#x27;t go on or come of easily.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic mowed through the beard easily giving a fine shave.</li>
            <li> As a result, he’s mostly going to use this for off-cycle touch-ups of his scruff and not as a replacement for a full shave with a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit noisy and not as comfortable as the rotary style shavers, but works well and charges very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Previously, I owned a Braun 3612 which for the price did an excellent job in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> that being said, even with the best electric shavers, you can&#x27;t get all the hairs removed, which usually requires the old manual blade shaver, but for a quick shave when you&#x27;re in a hurry or just need something for your travel bag, then this is ideal.</li>
            <li> This razor is light weight, and is made really cheap.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really recommend Remington brand shavers at all to be honest.</li>
            <li> The plastics, power button, pivot head, and head cover feel cheap.</li>
            <li> This model is so cheap</li>
            <li> /&gt;It just seems cheap to me, who is admittedly not an expert on electric shavers.  </li>
            <li> For the price and my needs, the F3 fit the bill and performs about the way I figured it would.</li>
            <li> Light weight&lt;</li>
            <li> It is not rinse-able, but it is fairly easy to clean with the included comb.  </li>
            <li> I have dense, coarse hair, and this Remington dida great job of clearing it out.  </li>
            <li> charging light does nothing except that it glows when you are charging.</li>
            <li> If I find after recharging that the light does go off when fully charged, I&#x27;ll update this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In all actuality, this shaver feels quite cheap in your hand and frankly does not give you that close of a shave.</li>
            <li> B00188BQXI Remington WDF-3600 Smooth &amp; Silky Women&#x27;s Shaver]]</li>
            <li> The cheap Remington foil shavers are marginal.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is wider than most shavers, which is useful for a clean cut.</li>
            <li> The first two times it worked to clear my beard, but after that it stopped working great.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s price will make it accessible for those on a budget.</li>
            <li> I have fine blonde hair, I thought this would be good to keep around in case</li>
            <li> This razor is an entry level basic foil shaver which does a good job on medium to fine hair.</li>
            <li> The cut was clean.</li>
            <li> My face appears rosy and clean after I shave with this Remington.</li>
            <li> (I use it, though, to clean up areas of my face not covered by my trim beard, so do not need</li>
            <li> Finally last year I was able to once again order the razor linked above, and found that it still was the best of what was available for women, at that point having tried them all (or very close to it)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Actually works really good god</li>
            <li> It is rechargeable and does a good enough job on the shave.</li>
            <li> Overall, good value for the money.</li>
            <li> The battery holds a good charge that allows for several shaves before needing recharged.</li>
            <li> It lasts 30 minutes on a full charge.</li>
            <li> charge time for a full charge.</li>
            <li> The Remington F3-3900B is definitely not a bad electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> For a basic shaver, it&#x27;s a good deal, although I&#x27;d recommend this one more for traveling rather than using it as your main shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In many ways it’s effectively the same foil shaver as that old model, just with a more ergonomic handle and rechargeable battery.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And, most importantly, it goes back on easily.</li>
            <li> For that, one is better off purchasing something of a better quality, such as the REMINGTON F5-5800A RECHARGEABLE FOIL WITH INTERCEPTOR SHAVING TECHNOLOGY.</li>
            <li> Works well, but foil seemed to wear too quickly.  </li>
            <li> It cost four times more, but was ten times better.</li>
            <li> But this one is barely adequate.</li>
            <li> The pivot function is nice and not all electric razors have that, but the overall cheap feel of the product doesn&#x27;t give the user confidence in the pivoting motion.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy another Remington product until they have improved their quality and made reasonably priced parts easily available (or include 3 or 4 replacement screens with the original purchase).</li>
            <li> On normal growth it did OK, but required a lot of going over spots trying to get stray whiskers.</li>
            <li> He said it was a pretty \\&quot;light weight\\&quot; shaver.</li>
            <li> Actually works better than the one i originally had!</li>
            <li> After the first shave the blades don&#x27;t cut as clean?</li>
            <li> It fit well in his rather large hand</li>
            <li> Do this three (3) times THEN install the new cutters you had the foresight to get with the original purchase!.</li>
            <li> stars for build: mechanically sound, quality blade but very plastic</li>
            <li> Economical and practical.</li>
            <li> I expected a good product from Remington and this one is.</li>
            <li> And I am not a beginner I have used electric most of my adult life - Remington</li>
            <li> I am in the unusual position of being able to compare it to most of what is on the market, because when I came back to Amazon to purchase a replacement I discovered that for some reason they would not ship it to Hawaii</li>
            <li> /&gt;It worked right out of the &amp;#34;box.&amp;#34; And it shaves quite closely for an electric shaver.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This new model does not appear to be as strong or cut as close.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, mainly plastic, and has a two foil head and a popup trimmer.</li>
            <li> It took much longer to get a clean shave with the Remington.</li>
            <li> Great Shaver makes me clean and neat, has a long run time and totally rocks</li>
            <li> The handle is comfortable and easy to hold in various positions.</li>
            <li> You could get by with it, but I, personally, would much rather pay more, be done quicker, and enjoy a nicer shave.</li>
            <li> For that, one is better off purchasing something of a better quality, such as the REMINGTON F5-5800A RECHARGEABLE FOIL WITH INTERCEPTOR SHAVING TECHNOLOGY.ons, has a low battery life, and is time-consuming to clean.</li>
            <li> This is a good little shaver, economically priced.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The top pops off easily to clean the loose hair out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d also pay a few extra bucks if the case sported a snazzy racing stripe or pretty colored balloons or something, so maybe I&#x27;m not the best judge of this sort of thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, I guess he isn&#x27;t going to use it very much</li>
            <li> This sits towards the lower end of their line, but like other Remingtons, is reliable, produces a safe, close and comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> I have had foil shavers before and have never had to run through the same spots as many times as this</li>
            <li> But remember this unit is not expensive.</li>
            <li> After opening the razor from the box, I was quite surprised at how light the razor is.</li>
            <li> After just the first use, I noticed that the razor did not give as close a shave as the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I have used the razor more than once a day and, therefore, have occasionally had to charge it 2-3 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so these were my first 2 electric razors.</li>
            <li> This is my first time my family has used a foil type shaver.</li>
            <li> $23.62, which is the price today on Amazon, this would be an inexpensive shaver if it were worth that much, but it&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After first use it did not work as well</li>
            <li> F3 keeps its charge pretty well.  </li>
            <li> However, I was looking for something that was quicker than shaving with a razor but not expensive.  </li>
            <li> so a higher end shaver is what he uses for every day.  </li>
            <li> He also really likes the pop-up trimmer!</li>
            <li> I would not expect it to hold up under daily use for more than 6 months to a year.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The foil section doesn’t get hot (measured 90 degrees F with infrared temp gage).&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> So, if you have light facial hair, with thin hairs, this razor is excellent.</li>
            <li> It cuts really well on light/medium beards, the head tilts back and forth to allow for face contours, it grips well, and it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li> While you won&#x27;t need to replace foils and cutters often, be sure to grab yourself one when its on sale for future use.    </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s an LED light to signal charging and charge complete.  </li>
            <li> When I first used it, I charged it for 24 hours plus, as recommended in the instructions.</li>
            <li> (Course, maybe it needed to be charged quite a bit more than 24 hours initially?).</li>
            <li> shaving quality is about the same, too: it gets most of the hair but tends to leave some small patches here and there; it takes multiple passes over the same area to get most of the hair; it’s most effective on shorter whiskers than longer; and, ultimately, the stubble seems to reappear more quickly than when he shaves with a blade.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes several days&#x27; worth of passes to get all of the stubble, and even then it doesn&#x27;t leave a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> I finally turned to Amazon and found this razor, it meets all my expectations, which are, simply, a compact, rechargeable razor, at a good price, that does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Coming from a DA307 that I&#x27;ve been using for the last ten or so years, this model seems much more cheaply made.</li>
            <li> one is not as good as past models.</li>
            <li> and After 8-10 total rounds on my face your maybe half done, especially fine hairs.</li>
            <li> all the new inprovements only make it better.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re Asian like me, this shaver will work fine for you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For a super smooth shave, I do usually finish with a quick pass of a disposable razor.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;o</li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard being Italian, but this shaver does a great job.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not about to spend even the seemingly reasonable $20 to find out.</li>
            <li> The foil microscreen shaver does an acceptable job, no complaints with that feature, but the pop-out trimmer is very sub-par.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very noisy and  We received this razor to test; if we had paid for it, it would have been returned after one try.</li>
            <li> It gets VERY close to my skin without tearing it up and leaving me wounded.</li>
            <li> I have a different Remington electric razor that was targeted towards females that not only works really great (over two years later!)</li>
            <li> Absolute junk.</li>
            <li> But, it gets the job done and does it really well.</li>
            <li> And there is no indicator to tell you how much charge is left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was cheap enough that I decided to cut my loss and toss it.  </li>
            <li> But, to tide me over, I pulled out a 10 year old travel shaver (Shave Man) from the back of my closet and tested it to see if it still worked; it did a better job than the Remington ever did, so added the charger to my collection of unused AC adapters and deposited the Remington where it should have been all along, the trash.</li>
            <li> far as facial hair, my son said it&#x27;s ok as well.  </li>
            <li> But if you have a lot of facial hair, with coarse and dense hair, this razor won&#x27;t be effective anymore.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed with the razor, which my son is using, was that it was very loud.  </li>
            <li> As many of the other posts I bought this as a cheaper way to shave 2-3 times a week.</li>
            <li> After recently being reintroduced to the quality of the Remington brand, I was excited to test and try the REMINGTON F3-3900B RECHARGEABLE FOIL WITH PIVOT AND FLEX TECHNOLOGY.</li>
            <li> I still think my other is better</li>
            <li> After a week can&#x27;t get the same clean cut as before.</li>
            <li> charge time is fast, you can also use it with the cord, and it is a decent size, so not quite as clunky as others if you are traveling and space</li>
            <li> The twin foil design with pivot and flex technology allows the shaving surface to glide over the face and give a clean shave without having to go over those problem areas several times.</li>
            <li> a full shave).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is certainly reasonable for this quality of a shaver (currently just under $24 at Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess they didn&#x27;t put their usual product design team on this one, however, because I just asked him for an honest opinion about the shaver</li>
            <li> Overall, not a bad value for the price.</li>
            <li> *&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At $47.24, which would be double the price on Amazon today, this would be a somewhat inexpensive shaver if it were worth that much, but it&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems to hold a charge for a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> I used an older version of their women&#x27;s [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> and so I purchased something else locally, found it unsatisfactory, came back and bought another and another (many of which I reviewed at the time)</li>
            <li> His opinion of this shaver is that it’s just ok: if Remington still uses the slogan “as close as a blade or your money back” then he’d ask for his money back.</li>
            <li> Also included is a double sided comb with short and long bristles, and it&#x27;s a really good comb.</li>
            <li> It even sounds tinier and high pitched when using.</li>
            <li> Either way I highly recommend this rechargeable razor.</li>
            <li> It was listed new for us, and it came in a open damaged box, and it had hair in it, and looked like a returned open box item that was used for sure.</li>
            <li> While more expensive units will incorporate rubber grips, this model is all plastic, but the textured plastic still allows good drip with dry hands.</li>
            <li> My husband normally uses a Norelco that costs about $70 on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I normally use Norelco rotary shavers.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t cut the more bristly white and grey hairs leaving a patchy appearance to the shave and necessitating the additional use of another razor.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know for sure, but I think it can only be used as a dry shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only positive is that it does hold a charge really well.</li>
            <li> ; that this razor features and it charges quickly and runs long.  </li>
            <li> Either that or my skin just needed something new to stimulate the circulation.</li>
            <li> The battery of the F3-3900B isn&#x27;t as strong as other Remingtons, either: if the razor if fully charged you will get between 6-12 shaves before you have to completely charge the razor again.</li>
            <li> It is hopeless on more than a few days&#x27; growth -- at least of my own personal beard -- and on a one-day growth it still takes a really large number of passes.  </li>
            <li> But even after the 24 hour period plus a few hours, the light never went off, that is to indicate a full charge, so as far as I can tell, so far at least, I won&#x27;t be able to tell when it is done charging.</li>
            <li> at $11.81, which would be half the price, this would be a very inexpensive shaver if it were worth that much, but it&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Remington is also much harder to clean and has a weaker trimmer.</li>
            <li> My only problem is there is no low battery light.</li>
            <li> I never liked the offset shape, it sort of forces itself into a position in which it doesn&#x27;t shave all that well; a straight handle would have been more maneuverable.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re used to a manual wet shave it will not be a satisfying experience as you will have to make several passes to get at all the</li>
            <li> I am frankly surprised because the women&#x27;s razor comes with those things and more, but Remington makes quite a variety for men and just a few for women.  </li>
            <li> He has never needed to shave daily, though he normally does simply to look neat and clean.  </li>
            <li> The charger is quick and the battery lasts for at least five full shaves.</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for more then a couple of uses and the power is always so low, I have to keep shaving over the same area several times.  </li>
            <li> In this case, you get an inexpensive shaver that delivers exactly what you would expect for the low price paid.</li>
            <li> It cut my facial hair easily on first glide, and even got hair that I had missed with my rotary.</li>
            <li> Better than the ones Norelco usually includes with its shavers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In terms of cleanup, the F3-3900B takes longer to clean than other electric razors I have used.</li>
            <li> While he can talk for hours about the nuances of  strategy game or the performance of the latest graphics card he is not much interested in basic appliances, even when they are for his own use.  </li>
            <li> It shave was ok, but left my face with a black residue that needed washing  off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s little louder than the rotary shavers, but, wow, it sure makes short work of a couple of day&#x27;s beard growth.</li>
            <li> It is clear that Remington cut corners to keep the price around $20.</li>
            <li> It was a bit much for a 16 year old, and so I got my son a basic rechargeable rotary and thought this was a complement, or would provide him the opportunity to decide which style</li>
            <li> Then, while I was using the trimmer, the whole thing fell apart in my hands and dropped a couple of tiny shards of plastic, which used to be the hinges, onto the floor.</li>
            <li> This inexpensive model just doesn&#x27;t work on my husband&#x27;s rather soft beard.</li>
            <li> The head pivots and flexes to get every nook and cranny on my aging old face.</li>
            <li> wanted an old micro screen shaver and got this one instead.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It does not come with a charging dock but plugs directly into the wall.  </li>
            <li> I shared this razor with a male friend who doesn&#x27;t shave very often, and should.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to do several passes to get a decent shave.  </li>
            <li> After using it everyday for two weeks it just does not do as good of a job as my usual Gillette Pro Glide manual razor.</li>
            <li> It works, but it doesn&#x27;t shave as close to the skin as other Remingtons, has a low battery life, and is time-consuming to clean.</li>
            <li> have had other, more expensive, Remington shavers that were fine.</li>
            <li> That is very basic.his price, it&#x27;s a close call, because you really do get a solid reliable product for the price, but other things aside, they should have included a cleaning brush.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll only run into trouble if the stubble is a few days old, but as long as you shave daily, getting hairs caught up shouldn&#x27;t be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s lightweight and comfortable to hold, build quality seems ok</li>
            <li> and I discovered that the price of a replacement screen from Remington is about the same as the price of a new shaver, so a bought an aftermarket screen for about $10, which lasted longer.</li>
            <li> With more expensive models, you get rubber grips, cleaning solutions, but if none of that matters to you, this is a capable shaver.</li>
            <li> This unit works, but it&#x27;s very loud and the foils heat up quite a bit within a short period of time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a major disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to other people shopping for a teen, or just for an economical razor.  </li>
            <li> Whether my hair was short 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, or long 3 day wanna-be-beard, I just couldn&#x27;t get this razor to really work well</li>
            <li> evaluate this product, I tried it with a normal days growth, and then also went a couple of days without shaving and tried it again, in both cases comparing it to my much more expensive (4x) Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li> There is barely any power</li>
            <li> It barely cut anything.  </li>
            <li> This razor definitely takes some time getting used to if you&#x27;re used to the old fashioned way.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve gotten by with only having to shave once in the morning.</li>
            <li> BARELY WORKS.</li>
            <li> Also, it did not remotely work on my beard at all.  </li>
            <li> It barely shortened it and pinched my skin twice in the process.  </li>
            <li> Amazon has many poor product photos.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There is nothing wrong with Remingtons - he has loved them as much as his Norelco in years past.  </li>
            <li> I have coarse and dense facial hair, and this razor couldn&#x27;t clear out the hair anymore.  </li>
            <li> He also gave it back the next day and let me hear how loud it is.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s good for sensitive skin like mine, but the low power and having to charge it often makes this model a bad choice for me.</li>
            <li> There are two separate blade heads instead of a double head which makes it twice as hard to clean.</li>
            <li> At this price, it&#x27;s a close call, because you really do get a solid reliable product for the price, but other things aside, they should have included a cleaning brush.</li>
            <li> Remington doesn&#x27;t claim it has such a coating, but I wonder whether adding such a feature would be worth a few bucks to consumers.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is how loud it is compared to more expensive models, possibly double the noise level.</li>
            <li> but it a little unwieldy with the large head.  </li>
            <li> The foil screen is holding up well so far - I&#x27;ve had other shavers in the past where they had to be replaced excessively, but this one seems to be working better.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint would be the power button is a little too easy to accidentally bump on and off while shaving.</li>
            <li> It is very clear that it uses a weaker battery and has less power than the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> I have their hair trimmers and many other of their products and have rarely been disappointed.    </li>
            <li> Less than 6 months after I bought it, the screen developed a hole</li>
            <li> This is only a dry shaver, and the hair has to be cleaned off with a brush.</li>
            <li> I remembered that I may not give possession of Vine products to anyone, so I had to take back my offer, for which I would subtract 1 star, but it&#x27;s too late because I already subtracted the whole four I may subtract for the reasons above.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I remembered that I may not give possession of Vine products to anyone, so I had to take back my offer, for which I would subtract 1 star, but it&#x27;s too late because I already subtracted the whole four I may subtract for the reasons</li>
            <li> So I used it with no trimmer for a while longer; no great loss since I have a beard trimmer sitting right next to it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little on the loud side when compared to my several-years-old electric</li>
            <li> Unless your needs are similar to mine, then not really.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take long to charge either.</li>
            <li> The back includes a 1\\&quot; wide shaper/trimmer for sideburn or beard shaping.    </li>
            <li> : The power cord is 6 ft long and teh power block on</li>
            <li> When I saw the brand &amp;#34;Remington&amp;#34; I expected a solid and functional product.</li>
            <li> The charging indicator tells you that it is charging bu not how long until it is fully charged, and it does not come with a cleaning brush.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had reinforcement of a lesson I learned a long time ago</li>
            <li> It gets the job done as long as the hairs aren&#x27;t too long.  </li>
            <li> Not as quiet as other shavers</li>
            <li> Hard to beat the price for a decent electric shaver.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t hold charge very long</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit takes around 16 hours to charge and you get about 30 minutes of use which seems sort of ridiculous with modern battery technology.</li>
            <li> I purchased the F3 to replace an older Remington DA-307 microscreen shaver with pop-out trimmer that I have used for at least eight years.  </li>
            <li> As a middle-aged Greek American man I have a heavy beard that sometimes requires two shaves a day.</li>
            <li> It gets closer to the skin than my old Braun electric shaver did, but not as close as Remingtons usually do.</li>
            <li> For example, just last week I was nearly late for dinner at the White House because I relied on this shaver to shave extra close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Remington Electric shavers for the last two decades and noticed the quality kept getting worse over the years as I replaced an older Remington Shaver for a newer model.  </li>
            <li> In the past, I&#x27;ve always used a regular razor with shaving cream because I couldn&#x27;t find an electric razor that would give me a close enough shave.</li>
            <li> I previously was using the Remington 4790 for a few years,and I had a similar Remington prior to that.</li>
            <li> The longevity of the flex screen is not really an issue for an inexpensive shaver.</li>
            <li> Unlike the F5-5800A, you aren&#x27;t supposed to wash the blades under water (water severely dulls the blades).</li>
            <li> To me, there&#x27;s absolutely no reason to spend close to $100 on a shaver when you don&#x27;t shave that much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The foil area of the head is 1.75\\&quot; wide.  </li>
            <li> Some required 4 or 5 passes, some were not rechargeable or didn&#x27;t hold a charge, some were not very close, and some chafed.  </li>
            <li> After using it a a few times, once nearly disastrously, I have concluded that it in not only inexpensive, it is cheap.  </li>
            <li> The other model appeared to work once I figured out the rotation speed, and how to stretch my face skin to &#x27;help it&#x27;, it had three circular blades.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He said it didn&#x27;t pinch like some other razors he&#x27;s had.</li>
            <li> would say it is hard to go wrong for this price, but for my own experience with poor quality razors when I could not get a Remington.  </li>
            <li> shaver is amazingly light (weighed in at 5.85 oz)!&lt;br /&gt;The closeness of the shave isn’t bad, it’s not as close as a disposable razor, but there is no skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;In fact, to me this shaver is not worth one penny.  </li>
            <li> These things are what took it down to 4 stars.  </li>
            <li> FOr me, they sem to &#x27;pinch/bite&#x27; less.</li>
            <li> The previous model took less time to charge,so that is a regression.</li>
            <li> I think it must have some hidden exfoliation factor.</li>
            <li> One of the razor heads had a slight dent in it.</li>
            <li> (This is less of an issue for my son).  </li>
            <li> I got this shaver for my husband since the battery in his previous shaver died.</li>
            <li> previous shaver was a Norelco rotary</li>
            <li> The product photo appears bluish, but it is black.  </li>
            <li> No good precision and battery doesnt last at all.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s end-of-life after almost a decade with little maintenance and upkeep.  </li>
            <li> It is a little on the louder side.  </li>
            <li> little brush that comes with</li>
            <li> It also tends to leave a few hairs almost untouched.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shave is close, but not completely smooth.</li>
            <li> When it arrived he said he had came inside a plain cardboard box with no packaging.</li>
            <li> and he told me the good, the bad, and the ugly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this was a defective model.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> , this was no better or worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is lacking in small ways.  </li>
            <li> But he said he also didn&#x27;t get as close a shave as he usually does.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s annoying because you have to spend so very much time getting a close shave.  </li>
            <li> on button is slippery and hard to get a grip on.</li>
            <li> You do not have to press hard to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> In fact, pressing too hard can cause a razor burn</li>
            <li> The flip-up sideburn trimmer doesn&#x27;t work hardly at all</li>
            <li> He also reports that the cover over the blades is a bit hard to get on and off.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product because I had high expectations for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it at least 15 times already and have not found the need to recharge it yet.</li>
            <li> I hoped it would inspire him to use it at least a couple of times a week.</li>
            <li> too slow.  </li>

            <li> stars for usability (losing some for the lack of charging dock, poor charging indicator and missing cleaning brush)&lt;br</li>
            <li> What is wrong is that you get what you pay for - and in this case, less than you pay for.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Braun that costs $120, and I realize it&#x27;s unfair to compare that to a unit that costs 80% less, but still.  </li>
            <li> When I go to Walmart or any other terrible &#x27;Box Store&#x27; looking for a razor I can&#x27;t find one, anymore, for less than $50.00 that has a rechargeable battery.</li>
            <li> Not happy !</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, we&#x27;re just not impressed with it and have stopped using this all together.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it got to</li>
            <li> (that&#x27;s also relatively expensive to maintain).  </li>
            <li> When the shaver begins to loos its cutting &#x27;edge&#x27;, remove the screen, remove each of the cutter discs.</li>
            <li> It was impossible.</li>
            <li> We cleaned the razor we got, and my son used it, and it gave him a bad rash.</li>
            <li> It grabbed and pulled whiskers painfully, and could not do the job.</li>
            <li> (I also add some Remington lubricant to the blades after cleaning them with the brush).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I have been disappointed with the REMINGTON F3-3900B RECHARGEABLE FOIL WITH PIVOT AND FLEX TECHNOLOGY.</li>
            <li> disappointed in one way or another by each of the.  </li>
            <li> You have to go over the area a TON of times before something happens - so incredibly annoying.    </li>
            <li> And it is annoying.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this electric razor.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product.  </li>
            <li> I have been using electric razors for 25 years and this is the worst I&#x27;ve ever used even compared to battery-powered razors.</li>
            <li> Without a doubt the worst razor I have ever had - it fears stubble while it broadcast a &amp;#34;close&amp;#34; shave.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> After the first shave the blades don&#x27;t cut as clean?</li>
            <li> I have no issue with this shaver. I&#x27;ve used it at least 15 times already and have not found the need to recharge it yet. For the price it gets the job done. If you&#x27;re Asian like me, this shaver will work fine for you.</li>
            <li> Shaver works well.  My only problem is there is no low battery light.</li>
            <li> I have lived with an F2, which is almost the same model but without the pivoting head, and I have come to loath it. I never liked the offset shape, it sort of forces itself into a position in which it doesn&#x27;t shave all that well; a straight handle would have been more maneuverable. Less than 6 months after I bought it, the screen developed a hole and I discovered that the price of a replacement screen from Remington is about the same as the price of a new shaver, so a bought an aftermarket screen for about $10, which lasted longer. Then, while I was using the trimmer, the whole thing fell apart in my hands and dropped a couple of tiny shards of plastic, which used to be the hinges, onto the floor. So I used it with no trimmer for a while longer; no great loss since I have a beard trimmer sitting right next to it. Finally, the replacement foil started failing again, so I set about finding another one. But, to tide me over, I pulled out a 10 year old travel shaver (Shave Man) from the back of my closet and tested it to see if it still worked; it did a better job than the Remington ever did, so added the charger to my collection of unused AC adapters and deposited the Remington where it should have been all along, the trash. Now, I can&#x27;t say for sure that the F3 isn&#x27;t 100% better, but it would have to be to be worth owning and I&#x27;m not about to spend even the seemingly reasonable $20 to find out. I won&#x27;t buy another Remington product until they have improved their quality and made reasonably priced parts easily available (or include 3 or 4 replacement screens with the original purchase).</li>
            <li> This razor is okay. Not the best. It was listed new for us, and it came in a open damaged box, and it had hair in it, and looked like a returned open box item that was used for sure. That upset us. This razor is light weight, and is made really cheap. It doesn&#x27;t look like it would last. We cleaned the razor we got, and my son used it, and it gave him a bad rash.</li>
            <li> Coming from a DA307 that I&#x27;ve been using for the last ten or so years, this model seems much more cheaply made. There are two separate blade heads instead of a double head which makes it twice as hard to clean. It even sounds tinier and high pitched when using. It does shave my face about as well, so there is that. I just worry about longevity as I had all of my 307&#x27;s for multiple years each.</li>
            <li> Was better than the one I was replacing</li>
            <li> This unit works, but it&#x27;s very loud and the foils heat up quite a bit within a short period of time.  I also find the battery life isn&#x27;t all that good.&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and save up for something around $130 for a good shaver.  I don&#x27;t really recommend Remington brand shavers at all to be honest.</li>
            <li> I prefer the pivot/flex shavers over the rotary units. FOr me, they sem to &#x27;pinch/bite&#x27; less. If you purchase this unit do yourself a favor and PURCHASE an extra, replacement screen/cutter kit! The longevity of the flex screen is not really an issue for an inexpensive shaver. When the shaver begins to loos its cutting &#x27;edge&#x27;, remove the screen, remove each of the cutter discs. Using tweezers, rotate the disc assembly 1/4 turn on its mounted shaft then replace in razor. Do this three (3) times THEN install the new cutters you had the foresight to get with the original purchase!.</li>
            <li> No good precision and battery doesnt last at all.</li>
            <li> Actually works really good god i made this purchase.</li>
            <li> It would not hold a charge so I returned it. It cut just OK. I bought a different model to replace it. Does not cut well.</li>
            <li> I previously was using the Remington 4790 for a few years,and I had a similar Remington prior to that.This new model does not appear to be as strong or cut as close.The previous model took less time to charge,so that is a regression.I also preferred the method of producing the trim blade on the earlier model.Things should not be changed just for the sake of change,especially if it is a step or 2 backwards.</li>
            <li> Economical and practical.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product.  There is barely any power and it takes forever to shave.  I have been using electric razors for 25 years and this is the worst I&#x27;ve ever used even compared to battery-powered razors.</li>
            <li> It shave was ok, but left my face with a black residue that needed washing  off.</li>
            <li> I expected a good product from Remington and this one is.</li>
            <li> Without a doubt the worst razor I have ever had - it fears stubble while it broadcast a &amp;#34;close&amp;#34; shave.  The similarity to a close shave is that it is electric and you don&#x27;t need shaving cream.  And I am not a beginner I have used electric most of my adult life - Remington comes in last and I should learn every once in awhile I buy one - and why, they are indeed cheaper than replacement blades.  BUT you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> As many of the other posts I bought this as a cheaper way to shave 2-3 times a week. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on but it basically does not shave, I read the manual ( I am in my 50s so I have did this before) and used the angle they wanted and After 8-10 total rounds on my face your maybe half done, especially fine hairs. Not happy !</li>
            <li> The foil microscreen shaver does an acceptable job, no complaints with that feature, but the pop-out trimmer is very sub-par.  It not only is &amp;#34;weak&amp;#34; in performance, but the trimmer arm doesn&#x27;t stay in place when you&#x27;re using in an &#x27;upward&#x27; direction, so I have to use a finger edge or tip to hold it in extended position when shaving &#x27;upward&#x27;.  i.e. it only stays in place when using in a downward direction.  I like to use in both directions.  I purchased the F3 to replace an older Remington DA-307 microscreen shaver with pop-out trimmer that I have used for at least eight years.  The pop-out trimmer on the aging DA-307 still works as well as the trimmer of the F3 and I don&#x27;t need to hold it in place.  So I&#x27;m using both shavers now; the foil shaver on the F3 and the pop-out trimmer on the DA-307 which I think is unacceptable.</li>
            <li> very good for the price</li>
            <li> My husband has owned foil shavers before.  He doesn&#x27;t like the Remington F3900-B.  Complain is more like it.  From the beginning, all I heard was him grumbling about how it hurt, how it sometimes pulled instead of cut, how it&#x27;s not a close shave.  Okay, I get it.  He doesn&#x27;t like it.  Three stars, he says.  I&#x27;m guessing he&#x27;s being generous.</li>
            <li> This was a very cheaply made shaver. It is not constructed well. I have had foil shavers before and have never had to run through the same spots as many times as this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The on button is slippery and hard to get a grip on. It is not rubberized for a good grip. I also tried the trimmer and it just keeps snagging on my husband&#x27;s mustache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, we&#x27;re just not impressed with it and have stopped using this all together.</li>
            <li> It is clear that Remington cut corners to keep the price around $20. The plastics, power button, pivot head, and head cover feel cheap. But remember this unit is not expensive. For an electric razor it does a good job shaving, not as close an a manual, but good enough in my opinion. I don&#x27;t think you will find a better razor at this price.</li>
            <li> My husband normally uses a Norelco that costs about $70 on Amazon. His beard is, at most, medium in texture. Medium-light is probably more accurate. He has never needed to shave daily, though he normally does simply to look neat and clean.  He was so glad to get this inexpensive Remington because he wanted to have a spare to keep in his car. (He often forgets to shave until he&#x27;s on the road.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, he tried this razor with three days&#x27; growth - maybe a quarter of an inch of beard.  It was impossible. It just rode over the stubble.  He used his Norelco then, 24 hours later, tried the Remington on the short stubble. It barely cut anything.  He tried it with two days&#x27; stubble, but the third time wasn&#x27;t a charm. It&#x27;s also very noisy and  We received this razor to test; if we had paid for it, it would have been returned after one try. It&#x27;s a major disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing wrong with Remingtons - he has loved them as much as his Norelco in years past.  What is wrong is that you get what you pay for - and in this case, less than you pay for.  This inexpensive model just doesn&#x27;t work on my husband&#x27;s rather soft beard. If you love Remington, just choose a nicer model!</li>
            <li> Worked great for a week. The cut was clean. After a week can&#x27;t get the same clean cut as before.</li>
            <li> He tested it out in from of me and was bleeding in minutes.  Also the trim piece that pops up blocks his mirror view so he cant see what he&#x27;s doing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Remington Electric shavers for the last two decades and noticed the quality kept getting worse over the years as I replaced an older Remington Shaver for a newer model.  This model is so cheap, it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for more then a couple of uses and the power is always so low, I have to keep shaving over the same area several times.  And you have to charge it to use it, as it doesn&#x27;t work when plugged in when the battery is low. I like the pivot idea and it&#x27;s good for sensitive skin like mine, but the low power and having to charge it often makes this model a bad choice for me.</li>
            <li> After recently being reintroduced to the quality of the Remington brand, I was excited to test and try the REMINGTON F3-3900B RECHARGEABLE FOIL WITH PIVOT AND FLEX TECHNOLOGY. After opening the razor from the box, I was quite surprised at how light the razor is. The razor is made mostly of plastic, has a two foil head, and a popup trimmer. What I like best about this shaver is that it has a flexible head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to test the REMINGTON F3-3900B RECHARGEABLE FOIL WITH PIVOT AND FLEX TECHNOLOGY, I have used it almost daily for well over a month. After just the first use, I noticed that the razor did not give as close a shave as the [[ASIN:B00BB5YHEI Remington F5-5800 Rechargeable Foil with Interceptor Shaving Technology]]I have been using. I was really impressed with the REMINGTON F5-5800A and initially thought the REMINGTON F3-3900B RECHARGEABLE FOIL WITH PIVOT AND FLEX TECHNOLOGY would shave just as close to the skin. It does not. It gets closer to the skin than my old Braun electric shaver did, but not as close as Remingtons usually do. The battery of the F3-3900B isn&#x27;t as strong as other Remingtons, either: if the razor if fully charged you will get between 6-12 shaves before you have to completely charge the razor again. There have been several times I have used the razor more than once a day and, therefore, have occasionally had to charge it 2-3 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of cleanup, the F3-3900B takes longer to clean than other electric razors I have used. Unlike the F5-5800A, you aren&#x27;t supposed to wash the blades under water (water severely dulls the blades). Instead, (according to the instructions) one cleans the razor solely with the cleaning brush that is included (I also add some Remington lubricant to the blades after cleaning them with the brush).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I have been disappointed with the REMINGTON F3-3900B RECHARGEABLE FOIL WITH PIVOT AND FLEX TECHNOLOGY. It works, but it doesn&#x27;t shave as close to the skin as other Remingtons, has a low battery life, and is time-consuming to clean. Recommended as a back-up, emergency, or on-the-go travel shaver, but not as a regular daily shaver. For that, one is better off purchasing something of a better quality, such as the REMINGTON F5-5800A RECHARGEABLE FOIL WITH INTERCEPTOR SHAVING TECHNOLOGY.ons, has a low battery life, and is time-consuming to clean. Recommended as a back-up, emergency, or on-the-go travel shaver, but not as a regular daily shaver.

            <li> This razor definitely takes some time getting used to if you&#x27;re used to the old fashioned way. It takes several days&#x27; worth of passes to get all of the stubble, and even then it doesn&#x27;t leave a smooth finish. It&#x27;s best used to compliment a manual razor but shouldn&#x27;t be used on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> As a middle-aged Greek American man I have a heavy beard that sometimes requires two shaves a day. In the past, I&#x27;ve always used a regular razor with shaving cream because I couldn&#x27;t find an electric razor that would give me a close enough shave. Until now. This Remington Rechargeable electric razor rocks! It gets VERY close to my skin without tearing it up and leaving me wounded. No nicks or scrapes whatsoever. The head pivots and flexes to get every nook and cranny on my aging old face. So far, I&#x27;ve gotten by with only having to shave once in the morning. No re-do in the afternoon or evening. An added bonus is that it seems to improve the tone and quality of my skin. My face appears rosy and clean after I shave with this Remington. I think it must have some hidden exfoliation factor. Either that or my skin just needed something new to stimulate the circulation. Either way I highly recommend this rechargeable razor. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my results.</li>
            <li> I already have an electric shaver that I love but I decided to try this out. So far so good as the saying goes as this has been good to me. I know others have had some complaints but I like it. It is rechargeable and does a good enough job on the shave. I still think my other is better but this is a good one.</li>
            <li> In my husbands words..  &amp;#34;I tried this one along with a different type at the same time, alternating sides of my face. I&#x27;ve used a razor for 20+ years so these were my first 2 electric razors. The other model appeared to work once I figured out the rotation speed, and how to stretch my face skin to &#x27;help it&#x27;, it had three circular blades.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;This one just doesn&#x27;t work. Whether my hair was short 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, or long 3 day wanna-be-beard, I just couldn&#x27;t get this razor to really work well, It WAS nicer feeling on the corners of my cheek/chin... but that&#x27;s probably because it wasn&#x27;t doing anything. I tried on my chest as well for body building pictures: same result. I&#x27;m not sure if this was a defective model. The side-burn trimmer, however, did work fine.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> BARELY WORKS. I have fine blonde hair, I thought this would be good to keep around in case I notice I missed a spot on my legs while wearing a sundress etc. You have to go over the area a TON of times before something happens - so incredibly annoying.    I have a different Remington electric razor that was targeted towards females that not only works really great (over two years later!) but also just SOUNDS like it has a ton more oomph.    Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> One month and 5 days after purchase one of the foils broke. I can&#x27;t return it to amazon because it is over 30 days and remington warranty does not cover foils. This is a piece of junk, DO NOT BUY</li>
            <li> This razor is an entry level basic foil shaver which does a good job on medium to fine hair. It&#x27;s not the best for very coarse hair or for people with softer skin. But that&#x27;s true for all foil shavers, they work best with firmer skin. This is only a dry shaver, and the hair has to be cleaned off with a brush. So if you&#x27;re used to a manual wet shave it will not be a satisfying experience as you will have to make several passes to get at all the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is an all plastic design given the price point, it can be a good shaver for travel.</li>
            <li> This item appeared to be used.  Instruction manual was ripped, and it was packed in an amazon generic box; nothing from remington.  Foil screen was dented and had a crease.  I must give a thumbs up to Amazon, returning it was easy.</li>
            <li> A really great trimmer. I compared this one to the $40 one I had from before. This one leads to a cleaner cut.</li>
            <li> This is my first time my family has used a foil type shaver. It&#x27;s little louder than the rotary shavers, but, wow, it sure makes short work of a couple of day&#x27;s beard growth. It just devours hair! It pivots nicely as you go, too. The top pops off easily to clean the loose hair out. And, most importantly, it goes back on easily.The trimmer is wider than most shavers, which is useful for a clean cut. The top of the shaver tends to block light from reaching what I&#x27;m trying to trim. It hold a charge for about three days before having to be recharged, which is acceptable, but could be longer. Overall, good value for the money.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed with the razor, which my son is using, was that it was very loud.  My son plugged it in to give it a try, and we both made the same comment about it being rather noisy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried it on my legs as I don&#x27;t have facial hair...and it worked ok.  I&#x27;ve never been too thrilled with any electric razor for shaving my legs, this was no better or worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as facial hair, my son said it&#x27;s ok as well.  Nothing spectacular.  I have noticed that he&#x27;s not getting as close of a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge time is fast, you can also use it with the cord, and it is a decent size, so not quite as clunky as others if you are traveling and space limited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were to buy another razor my instinct would not be to grab this one, there are others that are much better, the quality of this one just doesn&#x27;t seem to be up there.</li>
            <li> *&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At $47.24, which would be double the price on Amazon today, this would be a somewhat inexpensive shaver if it were worth that much, but it&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At $23.62, which is the price today on Amazon, this would be an inexpensive shaver if it were worth that much, but it&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even at $11.81, which would be half the price, this would be a very inexpensive shaver if it were worth that much, but it&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, to me this shaver is not worth one penny.  After using it a a few times, once nearly disastrously, I have concluded that it in not only inexpensive, it is cheap.  And it is annoying.  And it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for even 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It just seems cheap to me, who is admittedly not an expert on electric shavers.  I&#x27;ve been using a Braun that costs $120, and I realize it&#x27;s unfair to compare that to a unit that costs 80% less, but still.  For example, the outside of the case is simple plastic with no rubberized coating.  Remington doesn&#x27;t claim it has such a coating, but I wonder whether adding such a feature would be worth a few bucks to consumers.  I&#x27;d also pay a few extra bucks if the case sported a snazzy racing stripe or pretty colored balloons or something, so maybe I&#x27;m not the best judge of this sort of thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s annoying because you have to spend so very much time getting a close shave.  It is hopeless on more than a few days&#x27; growth -- at least of my own personal beard -- and on a one-day growth it still takes a really large number of passes.  For example, just last week I was nearly late for dinner at the White House because I relied on this shaver to shave extra close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And part of the reason is that the Remington F3-3900B Rechargeable Foil with Pivot and Flex Technology ran out of battery, which is when I switched back to my Braun and got the job done tout de suite.  I brought the Remington with me, and at dinner Michelle discussed it with me at length.  Later I asked whether she wanted to try it out for awhile, and she allowed as how she did, but just as I was handing it to her I remembered that I may not give possession of Vine products to anyone, so I had to take back my offer, for which I would subtract 1 star, but it&#x27;s too late because I already subtracted the whole four I may subtract for the reasons above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*sked whether she wanted to try it out for awhile, and she allowed as how she did, but just as I was handing it to her I remembered that I may not give possession of Vine products to anyone, so I had to take back my offer, for which I would subtract 1 star, but it&#x27;s too late because I already subtracted the whole four I may subtract for the reasons above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t quite cut as close as I would like, esp. when I&#x27;m doing my head.</li>
            <li> Great Shaver makes me clean and neat, has a long run time and totally rocks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had good luck with Remington electric shavers, so it was no surprise when the Remington F3-3900B met my expectations. The twin foil design with pivot and flex technology allows the shaving surface to glide over the face and give a clean shave without having to go over those problem areas several times. The battery holds a good charge that allows for several shaves before needing recharged. The handle is comfortable and easy to hold in various positions. My only complaint would be the power button is a little too easy to accidentally bump on and off while shaving. Overall an excellent entry-level electric razor that provides as close a shave as electric shavers costing many times more.</li>
            <li> After first use it did not work as well</li>
            <li> For an inexpensive shaver, it does a surprisingly good job.  It&#x27;s a bit noisy and not as comfortable as the rotary style shavers, but works well and charges very quickly.  My teenage son has been using this for several weeks (both sons say they prefer the foil-style to the rotary ones, and I guess I did at their age, too), and while the pivot head isn&#x27;t as useful as the advertising might suggest, it does a good job.  (I think my wife&#x27;s just glad he&#x27;s shaving!)  The foil screen is holding up well so far - I&#x27;ve had other shavers in the past where they had to be replaced excessively, but this one seems to be working better.  Overall, not a bad value for the price.</li>
            <li> the shaver I received was not the shaver that was pictured.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted an old micro screen shaver and got this one instead.&lt;br /&gt;I was no9t happy.</li>
            <li> Received product as described.  Works well, but foil seemed to wear too quickly.  Now need replacement foil because of hole in existing foil.</li>
            <li> HI,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best shaver for the money. I have a heavy beard being Italian, but this shaver does a great job.</li>
            <li> the remington line are all i evered used since i was 16. now at 68 i still find it to be my only shaver. all the new inprovements only make it better.  top of the line in my book.</li>
            <li> Got it as a gift for someone, haven&#x27;t heard any complaints!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like shaving so I shave maybe twice a week.  Previously, I owned a Braun 3612 which for the price did an excellent job in my opinion.  Unfortunately, it got to it&#x27;s end-of-life after almost a decade with little maintenance and upkeep.  I bought the Remington F3 as a replacement because it was about the same price as my Braun.  To me, there&#x27;s absolutely no reason to spend close to $100 on a shaver when you don&#x27;t shave that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The F3 keeps its charge pretty well.  It fits in the hand ok.  It is a little on the louder side.  The power button feels like very cheap plastic so I wonder how durable it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to do several passes to get a decent shave.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a close shave by any measure, but it does what I need it to do.  It also tends to leave a few hairs almost untouched.  I don&#x27;t know for sure, but I think it can only be used as a dry shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think any electric shaver can do as good a job as a manual razor.  However, I was looking for something that was quicker than shaving with a razor but not expensive.  In that sense, the F3 met my expectations.  Would I recommend it?  Unless your needs are similar to mine, then not really.  You&#x27;re better off getting a manual razor and replacing blades often or purchasing an expensive model (that&#x27;s also relatively expensive to maintain).  For the price and my needs, the F3 fit the bill and performs about the way I figured it would.</li>
            <li> Garbage. Doesn&#x27;t shave. Cannot get this thing to cut the hair on my face. Absolute junk.</li>
            <li> I had this mailed to my elderly father. When it arrived he said he had came inside a plain cardboard box with no packaging. One of the razor heads had a slight dent in it. After trying to put the screen back into position the razor seemed to work okay, but he wasn&#x27;t very happy with it. The product seemed to be good, but according to him the packaging made it seem as if it was used.</li>
            <li> When I go to Walmart or any other terrible &#x27;Box Store&#x27; looking for a razor I can&#x27;t find one, anymore, for less than $50.00 that has a rechargeable battery. And I&#x27;m not going to get one that runs on batteries. I finally turned to Amazon and found this razor, it meets all my expectations, which are, simply, a compact, rechargeable razor, at a good price, that does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Done.</li>
            <li> I got this Remington for my husband to use as a travel razor. I don&#x27;t like him taking his $200.00 razor on motorcycle trips and this razor fits the bill for him to use while on the road.  He states that you have to make NUMEROUS passes at different angles to get a closer shave and that he wouldn&#x27;t use this shaver for his every day shaving.  Sometimes my husband shaves two times a day so a higher end shaver is what he uses for every day.  He does like the &amp;#34;pivot and flex&amp;#34; that this razor features and it charges quickly and runs long.  He also really likes the pop-up trimmer!</li>
            <li> too slow.  doesn&#x27;t hold charge very long</li>
            <li> I have used The Remington F3-3900 series for years.  This was the best price.</li>
            <li> Works ok. Good value for the money.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. In this case, you get an inexpensive shaver that delivers exactly what you would expect for the low price paid. It&#x27;s light, mainly plastic, and has a two foil head and a popup trimmer. It has a 30 minute run time after an overnight charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To evaluate this product, I tried it with a normal days growth, and then also went a couple of days without shaving and tried it again, in both cases comparing it to my much more expensive (4x) Panasonic shaver. On normal growth it did OK, but required a lot of going over spots trying to get stray whiskers. It is very clear that it uses a weaker battery and has less power than the Panasonic.  It took much longer to get a clean shave with the Remington. On the several days growth, the Remington was not up to the task. It grabbed and pulled whiskers painfully, and could not do the job. I eventually gave up.  The Panasonic mowed through the beard easily giving a fine shave. It cost four times more, but was ten times better. The Remington is also much harder to clean and has a weaker trimmer. It does come with a cleaning brush (and charger, of course) that helped somewhat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The build quality of this Remington is also \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; as you would expect. I would not expect it to hold up under daily use for more than 6 months to a year.  Of course, at the very low price being asked, you can just buy another, but you are still stuck with the lower performance in any case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had other, more expensive, Remington shavers that were fine. But this one is barely adequate. You could get by with it, but I, personally, would much rather pay more, be done quicker, and enjoy a nicer shave. So 3 stars from me, \\&quot;it&#x27;s okay\\&quot; for the price paid.</li>
            <li> My husband tried out this shaver and had these comments:&lt;br /&gt;The reason I like an electric shaver is to avoid shaving off the top of a raised mole on my face.&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is amazingly light (weighed in at 5.85 oz)!&lt;br /&gt;The closeness of the shave isn’t bad, it’s not as close as a disposable razor, but there is no skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;It did give me a couple of nicks over a two week time period.&lt;br /&gt;The foil section doesn’t get hot (measured 90 degrees F with infrared temp gage).&lt;br /&gt;The little brush that comes with it is handy for cleaning out the trimmings that get stuck in the cutter blocks.&lt;br /&gt;Sideburn trimmer pops out of the back and works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a super smooth shave, I do usually finish with a quick pass of a disposable razor.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;o Light weight&lt;br /&gt;o Worldwide voltage for 240 volt and 120 volt&lt;br /&gt;o Includes cover to protect the foil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;o Not washable&lt;br /&gt;o Not as quiet as other shavers</li>
            <li> Item: Remington F3-3900B Rechargeable Foil with Pivot and Flex Technology  UPDATE#2 (Feb 2015): I moved the rating from 5 stars to 4 stars.  After using it only eight times, the shaver no longer cuts hair at all. I have coarse and dense facial hair, and this razor couldn&#x27;t clear out the hair anymore.  So, if you have light facial hair, with thin hairs, this razor is excellent. But if you have a lot of facial hair, with coarse and dense hair, this razor won&#x27;t be effective anymore. My rotary shaver has no problem clearing my facial hair.     UPDATE (Dec 2014): This shaver is not for coarse hair and dense beards. If you have a dense. The first two times it worked to clear my beard, but after that it stopped working great.It will work great on light/medium and non-dense beards.    This is a great low-cost shaver. It cuts really well on light/medium beards, the head tilts back and forth to allow for face contours, it grips well, and it&#x27;s easy to clean. It is not rinse-able, but it is fairly easy to clean with the included comb.  It lasts 30 minutes on a full charge. It doesn&#x27;t take long to charge either. The only downside is how loud it is compared to more expensive models, possibly double the noise level. But, it gets the job done and does it really well. With more expensive models, you get rubber grips, cleaning solutions, but if none of that matters to you, this is a capable shaver. While you won&#x27;t need to replace foils and cutters often, be sure to grab yourself one when its on sale for future use.    I normally use Norelco rotary shavers. This Remington F3-3900B shaver was impressive on first use. It cut my facial hair easily on first glide, and even got hair that I had missed with my rotary. I do experience some pulling with rotary shavers, but I did not experience any with this Remington foil. The head can rock back and forth to adjust to the contours of your face. I found it especially useful at the jaw and chin. I have dense, coarse hair, and this Remington dida great job of clearing it out.  I also have to shave twice a week or every four days.    Details: Shaver is 6\\&quot; H x 2.5\\&quot; W (at head) and 2\\&quot; W (at grip) x 1.25\\&quot; D (thick). The foil area of the head is 1.75\\&quot; wide.  Build is all plastic. While more expensive units will incorporate rubber grips, this model is all plastic, but the textured plastic still allows good drip with dry hands. The on/off switch is the size of your thumb and switches easily.  There&#x27;s an LED light to signal charging and charge complete.  The back includes a 1\\&quot; wide shaper/trimmer for sideburn or beard shaping.    Accessories: The power cord is 6 ft long and teh power block on there is 2\\&quot;H x 1.5\\&quot; W x 1\\&quot; D.  There&#x27;s a cover for the shaver head, but I can&#x27;t seem to keep it on. It doesn&#x27;t lock into place. Also included is a double sided comb with short and long bristles, and it&#x27;s a really good comb. Better than the ones Norelco usually includes with its shavers.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. Shaves ok.</li>
            <li> This is a good little shaver, economically priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked right out of the &amp;#34;box.&amp;#34; And it shaves quite closely for an electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head is easily flexible. You do not have to press hard to get a close shave. In fact, pressing too hard can cause a razor burn (so I do not recommend you do that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to hold a charge for a decent amount of time. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a couple weeks and haven&#x27;t had to charge it (I use it, though, to clean up areas of my face not covered by my trim beard, so do not need a full shave).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is certainly reasonable for this quality of a shaver (currently just under $24 at Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reasons for 4 stars instead of 5:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging light does nothing except that it glows when you are charging. When I first used it, I charged it for 24 hours plus, as recommended in the instructions. But even after the 24 hour period plus a few hours, the light never went off, that is to indicate a full charge, so as far as I can tell, so far at least, I won&#x27;t be able to tell when it is done charging. (Course, maybe it needed to be charged quite a bit more than 24 hours initially?). If I find after recharging that the light does go off when fully charged, I&#x27;ll update this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little on the loud side when compared to my several-years-old electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long charge time for a full charge. The instructions say 16 hours. And there is no indicator to tell you how much charge is left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mustache and sideburns trimmer seems rather weak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, Recommended. Hard to beat the price for a decent electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Hmm- well the hubby likes to keep an electric shaver around for quick touch ups and this one looked like a good bet.  It fit well in his rather large hand and he liked the weight of it- on the light side.  Charging time is good as well as being able to use it plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately it just doesn&#x27;t work that well.  No matter how many times he passed it over his face it didn&#x27;t cut the more bristly white and grey hairs leaving a patchy appearance to the shave and necessitating the additional use of another razor.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this electric razor. After using it everyday for two weeks it just does not do as good of a job as my usual Gillette Pro Glide manual razor. After using it I still notice hairs on my face that it just won&#x27;t cut. The only positive is that it does hold a charge really well. But if you are looking for a good electric razor I suggest spending more money for one of the better models.</li>
            <li> This Remington is not the best one they have built but it&#x27;s price will make it accessible for those on a budget. It&#x27;s shave is close, but not completely smooth. The plastic body feels lightweight and might not survive a fall into the tub. It has a clipper for sideburns and comes with a tiny cleaning brush. The charger is quick and the battery lasts for at least five full shaves. It&#x27;s an okay deal but it&#x27;s not the best razor on the market.</li>
            <li> Works okay but it a little unwieldy with the large head.  The head protector doesn&#x27;t go on or come of easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.Wish Remington would have a corded model at this price. If they did, I&#x27;d give this 5 stars.</li>
            <li> When I saw the brand &amp;#34;Remington&amp;#34; I expected a solid and functional product. In all actuality, this shaver feels quite cheap in your hand and frankly does not give you that close of a shave. The flip-up sideburn trimmer doesn&#x27;t work hardly at all and it was only a matter of a few days before I was back with my straight razors.  The pivot function is nice and not all electric razors have that, but the overall cheap feel of the product doesn&#x27;t give the user confidence in the pivoting motion. I was disappointed with this product because I had high expectations for it.</li>
            <li> I got the Remington F3 foil shaver for my son who is just at the point of needing a razor.  My own experience with the brand has been wonderful. I used an older version of their women&#x27;s [[ASIN:B00188BQXI Remington WDF-3600 Smooth &amp; Silky Women&#x27;s Shaver]] for many years (until the rechargeable battery died) which had been described by a well known consumer&#x27;s magazine as \\&quot;the Mercedes of women&#x27;s razors\\&quot;.  In my experience it was an accurate description, delivering a shave almost as close as a blade safely and comfortably.  I am in the unusual position of being able to compare it to most of what is on the market, because when I came back to Amazon to purchase a replacement I discovered that for some reason they would not ship it to Hawaii and so I purchased something else locally, found it unsatisfactory, came back and bought another and another (many of which I reviewed at the time) disappointed in one way or another by each of the.  Finally last year I was able to once again order the razor linked above, and found that it still was the best of what was available for women, at that point having tried them all (or very close to it)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that said, when my son needed a razor I bought him a basic rotary based on my experience with the brand.  While he can talk for hours about the nuances of  strategy game or the performance of the latest graphics card he is not much interested in basic appliances, even when they are for his own use.  He needed something reliable and I didn&#x27;t want him using something which I thought would be unsafe in any way.  For me it was a simple choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband routinely uses a high end foil razor made by Panasonic with which he is very happy (well to the extent that he musters enthusiasm for anything utilitarian).  It was a bit much for a 16 year old, and so I got my son a basic rechargeable rotary and thought this was a complement, or would provide him the opportunity to decide which style he preferred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His comment on it&#x27;s performance was that he finds the foil better/ easier to use for sideburns but prefers the rotary overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband commented that like the [[ASIN:B00BB5YHEI Remington F5-5800 Rechargeable Foil with Interceptor Shaving Technology]] this is lacking in small ways.  It does not come with a charging dock but plugs directly into the wall.  The charging indicator tells you that it is charging bu not how long until it is fully charged, and it does not come with a cleaning brush.  He also thought it clogged more easily than others he has used.  (This is less of an issue for my son).  These things are what took it down to 4 stars.  I am frankly surprised because the women&#x27;s razor comes with those things and more, but Remington makes quite a variety for men and just a few for women.  This sits towards the lower end of their line, but like other Remingtons, is reliable, produces a safe, close and comfortable shave.  I would recommend this to other people shopping for a teen, or just for an economical razor.  For the price I do not believe you can do better. (My husband&#x27;s preferred razor costs several times as much.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In brief, I would rate this&lt;br /&gt;5 stars for reliability&lt;br /&gt;5 stars for comfort and safety&lt;br /&gt;4 stars for build: mechanically sound, quality blade but very plastic shell.&lt;br /&gt;3 stars for usability (losing some for the lack of charging dock, poor charging indicator and missing cleaning brush)&lt;br /&gt;5 stars for value: a solid and reliable product at a value price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say it is hard to go wrong for this price, but for my own experience with poor quality razors when I could not get a Remington.  Some required 4 or 5 passes, some were not rechargeable or didn&#x27;t hold a charge, some were not very close, and some chafed.  This razor performs as one would expect from a company almost synonymous with razors.  If it came with a cleaning brush, charging dock and a better charge indicator it would be a 5 star product.  At this price, it&#x27;s a close call, because you really do get a solid reliable product for the price, but other things aside, they should have included a cleaning brush. That is very basic.his price, it&#x27;s a close call, because you really do get a solid reliable product for the price, but other things aside, they should have included a cleaning brush. That is very basic.</li>
            <li> I shared this razor with a male friend who doesn&#x27;t shave very often, and should. I hoped it would inspire him to use it at least a couple of times a week. It&#x27;s a Remington, after all! I have their hair trimmers and many other of their products and have rarely been disappointed.    I guess they didn&#x27;t put their usual product design team on this one, however, because I just asked him for an honest opinion about the shaver and he told me the good, the bad, and the ugly. He said it didn&#x27;t pinch like some other razors he&#x27;s had. But he said he also didn&#x27;t get as close a shave as he usually does. He said it was a pretty \\&quot;light weight\\&quot; shaver. He also gave it back the next day and let me hear how loud it is. Yikes.    So, I guess he isn&#x27;t going to use it very much and I&#x27;ve had reinforcement of a lesson I learned a long time ago: you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I got this shaver for my husband since the battery in his previous shaver died. His opinion of this shaver is that it’s just ok: if Remington still uses the slogan “as close as a blade or your money back” then he’d ask for his money back. As a result, he’s mostly going to use this for off-cycle touch-ups of his scruff and not as a replacement for a full shave with a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His previous shaver was a Norelco rotary but he has also had a Remington foil shaver before as well, although that was 20 or 25 years ago. In many ways it’s effectively the same foil shaver as that old model, just with a more ergonomic handle and rechargeable battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaving quality is about the same, too: it gets most of the hair but tends to leave some small patches here and there; it takes multiple passes over the same area to get most of the hair; it’s most effective on shorter whiskers than longer; and, ultimately, the stubble seems to reappear more quickly than when he shaves with a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit takes around 16 hours to charge and you get about 30 minutes of use which seems sort of ridiculous with modern battery technology. He also reports that the cover over the blades is a bit hard to get on and off.</li>
            <li> Amazon has many poor product photos.  The product photo appears bluish, but it is black.  Also, it did not remotely work on my beard at all.  It barely shortened it and pinched my skin twice in the process.  It was cheap enough that I decided to cut my loss and toss it.  I bought a Braun instead, but it&#x27;s TBD if it will match it&#x27;s photo either.</li>
            <li> Gret shaver. Actually works better than the one i originally had! Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> The Remington F3-3900B is definitely not a bad electric shaver.  It gets the job done as long as the hairs aren&#x27;t too long.  You&#x27;ll only run into trouble if the stubble is a few days old, but as long as you shave daily, getting hairs caught up shouldn&#x27;t be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s lightweight and comfortable to hold, build quality seems ok but the plastic isn&#x27;t the best quality.  For a basic shaver, it&#x27;s a good deal, although I&#x27;d recommend this one more for traveling rather than using it as your main shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, even with the best electric shavers, you can&#x27;t get all the hairs removed, which usually requires the old manual blade shaver, but for a quick shave when you&#x27;re in a hurry or just need something for your travel bag, then this is ideal.</li>

            <li> The cheap Remington foil shavers are marginal. I&#x27;ve had a number of them over the years.&lt;br /&gt;This one is not as good as past models. Has a tendency to nick if you press too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In retrospect, I would have purchased another razor.</li>
