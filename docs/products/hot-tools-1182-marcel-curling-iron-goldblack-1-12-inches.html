            <li>Best iron I have ever used and won&#x27;t be my last!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a fantastic iron!  </li>
            <li>The first one lasted for years, so it was certainly a good value.  </li>
            <li>but it stays hot, which is good.  </li>
            <li>It gives me great large curls and it heats up fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S SO EASY TO USE IT</li>
            <li>Love love love, gets hot quick, stays on till I am done with it!</li>
            <li>Pricing was good though and product was new in package.</li>
            <li>Probably would be fine with some practice.</li>
            <li>The iron was fine.</li>
            <li>This is a great tool and love the flexibility in styling and would recommend to others with medium to long hair.</li>
            <li>This one might work for you if you have fine hair.</li>
            <li>but in time you will be able to quickly style your hair (this is even faster than using my wand).</li>
            <li>love this - gets very hot;  recommend</li>
            <li>Huge, marcel barrel</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a great Youtube video of a girl demonstrating how to properly hold and use the marcel curling iron.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s good for professional use or those that know how to use these kinds of irons.</li>
            <li>It makes curling your hair super easy.</li>
            <li>Does a great job with big full curls</li>
            <li>It takes some getting used to and maybe even a couple of Youtube videos to learn how to not burn yourself, but once you learn how to use this baby its totally worth it!</li>
            <li>It gets SUPER hot, so I&#x27;m glad it has adjustment.  </li>
            <li>the rolling handle makes is so easy to do your own back of head hair with out trying to use 2 mirrors and backwards!!  </li>
            <li>It is easy on hair (for a hot appliance.  </li>
            <li>The iron itself heats up quickly and you can adjust the temperature.</li>
            <li>that is why it heats up so quickly.  </li>
            <li>It can get very hot, and with no end you may burn your fingers.  </li>
            <li>I returned it and ordered a normal clamp ceramic one that I like better.</li>
            <li>It has a temp adjustment so it can get very hot for stubborn hair.  </li>
            <li>At first I put off using it because the reverse handle was intimidating!</li>
            <li>I did burn myself once on my forearm, but I still think it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>I love this iron to make soft waves in my hair.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I was expecting it to be composed like a regular curling iron.</li>
            <li>You will get a more natural curl with this, and in my opinion once you are used to its operation it is faster than a spring iron.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other ones that were better and lasted me more than one day without any sprays.  </li>
            <li>It takes practice to get it right</li>
            <li>It works great with my thick hair, and makes amazing curls that last.</li>
            <li>This iron gets VERY hot, which is great if you have thick hair like I do.  </li>
            <li>This iron heats up so fast and recovers quickly during use.  </li>
            <li>Love the various temperature settings as well.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Fast and efficient shipping, quality product!</li>
            <li>Come on people, this is Hot Tools.  </li>
            <li>Great Iron is very heavy!</li>
            <li>The 1 1/2&amp;#34; gives nice big curls that look natural and stay in all day.</li>
            <li>Granted, my last iron lasted for 4 years before the spring lost its hold, and I loved everything else about that thing, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money on a replacement that would have the same spring problem.  </li>
            <li>I can curl my long hair in about 10 minutes and am always pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I really like it; the large size, temperature control and ease of handeling.</li>
            <li>It heats evenly and quickly, and it will keep the heat (no annoying fluctuations you may experience with other irons).  </li>
            <li>I really like this curling iron.</li>
            <li>Also, it heats up extremely fast,</li>
            <li>I am much safer with rod clamp.  </li>
            <li>I knew that it was different then other curling irons, but it is good when you want to roll the curling iron through your hair.  </li>
            <li>Because I was so sure it was going to work, I might try a smaller size to see if its just me or if its defective, but i definitely won&#x27;t throw away the packaging this time!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and expected, and the product got to my house quickly.</li>
            <li>If you have never used a Marcel Curling iron it is highly recommended, you can learn how by watching you-tube videos.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a marcel grip curling iron, I highly recommend this product...</li>
            <li>so hardly no waiting if you forgot to turn it on.</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;ve finally found a routine that creates the the right type of curl and stays.</li>
            <li>I still need them so I have to purchase new ones, but not online in stores</li>
            <li>Be careful at high settings as it really can get hot.</li>
            <li>I owned the exact one, which finally died after over 10 years of use.</li>
            <li>This is my second Hot Tools marcel grip curling iron.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll look like your hair was done professionally!</li>
            <li>I love this one, even when I didn&#x27;t realize when I bought it that actually is a Marcel, which can be more difficult to use than a spring curling iron.</li>
            <li>i love the rotating handle on this and the thick barrel.</li>
            <li>Takes a little time to get used to the unique handle, but it does just what I need.</li>
            <li>My hair usually will curl on a medium to low heat after just touching the iron.</li>
            <li>The extra pole thing on top is a bit hard to use, but I guess it will just take and practice</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying a new one to change the size only.</li>
            <li>They last pretty long if you take care of them.</li>
            <li>I have previously owned the Hot Tools Professional Spring Irons, and the springs tend to start squeaking and then lose their hold.  </li>
            <li>Gives me big soft curls and makes my hair look shinier.</li>
            <li>Or proceed with caution and practice using it without heat a few times first.</li>
            <li>I returned it, and as usual Amazon made it right by refunding me.</li>
            <li>This product works well for a stylist but using it single handed on my own hair is difficult.</li>

            <li> I still need them so I have to purchase new ones, but not online in stores</li>
            <li> Be careful at high settings as it really can get hot.</li>
            <li> I owned the exact one, which finally died after over 10 years of use.</li>
            <li> This is my second Hot Tools marcel grip curling iron.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll look like your hair was done professionally!</li>
            <li> I love this one, even when I didn&#x27;t realize when I bought it that actually is a Marcel, which can be more difficult to use than a spring curling iron.</li>
            <li> i love the rotating handle on this and the thick barrel.</li>
            <li> Takes a little time to get used to the unique handle, but it does just what I need.</li>
            <li> My hair usually will curl on a medium to low heat after just touching the iron.</li>
            <li> The extra pole thing on top is a bit hard to use, but I guess it will just take and practice</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying a new one to change the size only.</li>
            <li> They last pretty long if you take care of them.</li>
            <li> I have previously owned the Hot Tools Professional Spring Irons, and the springs tend to start squeaking and then lose their hold.  </li>
            <li> Gives me big soft curls and makes my hair look shinier.</li>
            <li> Or proceed with caution and practice using it without heat a few times first.</li>
            <li> I returned it, and as usual Amazon made it right by refunding me.</li>
            <li> This product works well for a stylist but using it single handed on my own hair is difficult.</li>
            <li> My hair actually prefers this to my ~$120.00 ceramic flat iron).  </li>
            <li> It takes a little while to heat up completely</li>
            <li> I have long layers</li>
            <li> It did take me some time to get used to the clamp mechanism as I am not a professional.</li>
            <li> Just pick up a normal curling iron and save yourself the trouble!</li>
            <li> Even ordered a second one half inch smaller.</li>
            <li> It took a little bit to get the hang of using the marcel, but now that I do, I will never go back to using a regular curling iron.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy and doesn&#x27;t clasp like a typical curler and is awkward, burned my hand first use because there is no place to grab with your free hand.</li>
            <li> Also, after reading reviews, I expected the marcel wand to be much harder to use than it actually was.  </li>
            <li> Even at the lowest setting its still too hot and my hair has never looked worse because of it.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to find and was glad to find on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little big and bulky to handle</li>
            <li> There was no spring in the handle and unless you work as a professional it would be hard to use this iron.  </li>
            <li> I have straight, thick, asian hair and its really hard to set a curl without using a ton of hairspray</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional, but learned to use the marcel grip because it seems to leave less \\&quot;crimps\\&quot; in the hair from the pressure of the clamp.</li>
            <li> I purchased four other sizes here on Amazon</li>
            <li> My hair uncurls once I get to the other side of my head.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t recommend a brand other than these guys when it comes to curling irons.  </li>
            <li> have let a few other people try with no success, it not professional in my opinion</li>
            <li> This curling iron was hard to maneuver in the beginning because it allowed you to rotate the handle and also the way you open up the curler</li>
            <li> The box I received looked like it was previous opened</li>
            <li> I have used Hot Tool for a long time if you use a Marcel Iron you will not be disappointed</li>
            <li> It works as a straightener for my hair with a little curl at the ends.  </li>
            <li> When I tried to use it, I had a lot of  trouble</li>
            <li> in mind, this is a Marcel Iron, so no easy little clip with a spring.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the curling iron, only because I did not realize it was for professional use.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is defective but it doesn&#x27;t curl my hair at all.</li>
            <li> I used to burn my thumb when in a hurry with small clip on clamps.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, its a very heavy and unwieldy tool</li>
            <li> The Marcel grip is not for everyone and hard to find at retail beauty supply stores.  </li>
            <li> Hard to use with no clamp.</li>
            <li> This product has lasted me at least 10 years.  </li>
            <li> The handle part is very hard to work with.  </li>
            <li> I dont recommend using on it&#x27;s highest setting, it will be very hard on the hair.  </li>
            <li> Very heavy and difficult to use.</li>
            <li> It is a little awkward to handle.</li>
            <li> On complaint it that it is difficult to hold.</li>
            <li> I received my curling iron and when I take it out of the box it was broken.  </li>
            <li> Have no clue how this works poorly boxed no instructions</li>
            <li> you may be use to, and you may find this to be hard or a pain to use, so remember when ordering!!</li>
            <li> I ordered the wrong size.  </li>
            <li> and if you&#x27;re not used to it you may find it extremely difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> very disappointed and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> very difficult to operate</li>
            <li> Do they ever make a bad curling iron?  </li>
            <li> I know I must be the exception  given the ratings, but I hate this styler.</li>
            <li> I found this to be annoying.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Hate the ones with the clips!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this curling iron! It took a little bit to get the hang of using the marcel, but now that I do, I will never go back to using a regular curling iron. It holds the curl all day and takes a shorter amount of time to style my hair.</li>
            <li> This curling iron works well, it&#x27;s good for professional use or those that know how to use these kinds of irons. I purchased four other sizes here on Amazon and I love all of them!</li>
            <li> This was way bigger than I thought, but it has served my hair styling well! I have long layers and I love to just curl the ends for volume. Good good stuff. Adjustable heat for different types of hair.</li>
            <li> I knew that it was different then other curling irons, but it is good when you want to roll the curling iron through your hair.  I did burn myself once on my forearm, but I still think it&#x27;s worth it.  I hope to become more proficient with it over time.</li>
            <li> Great curling iron.  The Marcel grip is not for everyone and hard to find at retail beauty supply stores.  I&#x27;m not a professional, but learned to use the marcel grip because it seems to leave less \\&quot;crimps\\&quot; in the hair from the pressure of the clamp. I owned the exact one, which finally died after over 10 years of use. They last pretty long if you take care of them. Love the various temperature settings as well. Be careful at high settings as it really can get hot.</li>
            <li> Great Iron is very heavy! Gives your arm quite the work out but results are great!</li>
            <li> This has a grip and handle not like a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; rolling iron you may be use to, and you may find this to be hard or a pain to use, so remember when ordering!! I love this grip and clamp style and the rolling handle makes is so easy to do your own back of head hair with out trying to use 2 mirrors and backwards!!  Love love love, gets hot quick, stays on till I am done with it! Wish they had a lock for the open bar part so it didnt flop around when in travel.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron. It gives me great large curls and it heats up fairly quickly. It did take me some time to get used to the clamp mechanism as I am not a professional. Also, it took a while to remember to avoid touching the tip *ouch* If you&#x27;re like me where you need to have plastic on the tip to help with curls, I suggest you avoid. Or proceed with caution and practice using it without heat a few times first.</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 of these irons and they both stopped working in a very short time. very disappointed and a waste of money. I still need them so I have to purchase new ones, but not online in stores</li>
            <li> I have used Hot Tool for a long time if you use a Marcel Iron you will not be disappointed</li>
            <li> I have about 4 curling irons and this is my favorite one in terms of style, ease of use and how well it holds my curls. I have straight, thick, asian hair and its really hard to set a curl without using a ton of hairspray but i&#x27;ve finally found a routine that creates the the right type of curl and stays. This curling iron was hard to maneuver in the beginning because it allowed you to rotate the handle and also the way you open up the curler but now i find that it is very easy to use - although my friends are still intimidated by it.</li>
            <li> The iron heats up as advertised. I like the turning ability. I think it is about technique..to get that perfect curl. This one helps you with technique. On complaint it that it is difficult to hold.</li>
            <li> This product works well for a stylist but using it single handed on my own hair is difficult. It&#x27;s heavy and doesn&#x27;t clasp like a typical curler and is awkward, burned my hand first use because there is no place to grab with your free hand. Probably would be fine with some practice. Pricing was good though and product was new in package.</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome, takes time to get use to, but I&#x27;m starting to get the flow of the rotating handles</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and she can make her hair look so great when she uses this tool.</li>
            <li> best curling iron I&#x27;ve ever used!!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  Huge, marcel barrel, Hot Tools is a great brand, always trust them and their irons.</li>
            <li> This is a great salon quality curling iron. I love the curls or waves you can make. If you have never used a Marcel Curling iron it is highly recommended, you can learn how by watching you-tube videos. The barrel I purchased was 1 1/2 in. and it is perfect for big bouncy curls. The iron itself heats up quickly and you can adjust the temperature.</li>
            <li> Very heavy and difficult to use. I had to return it.</li>
            <li> Hard to use with no clamp.</li>
            <li> The handle part is very hard to work with.  It twists as I am trying to curl my hair.  I should have listened to the reviewers who said that it takes some practice and getting used to.  I don&#x27;t want to spend the time trying to work with it.  You need a lot of patience.  Just pick up a normal curling iron and save yourself the trouble!</li>
            <li> I ordered the wrong size.  The iron was fine.</li>
            <li> I DIDN&#x27;T KNOW HOW TO DO THE CURLS BEFORE NOW I&#x27;M PRO WITH IT IT&#x27;S SO EASY TO USE IT</li>
            <li> This curling iron is a great product if you know what you&#x27;re doing with it.  It takes practice to get it right and if you&#x27;re not used to it you may find it extremely difficult to use.  It can get very hot, and with no end you may burn your fingers.  If used correctly its a great product.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my hairdresser and I am happy when finished styling. It is a little awkward to handle.</li>
            <li> The box I received looked like it was previous opened and there was markings on the iron. When I tried to use it, I had a lot of  trouble and I wasn&#x27;t found of the gold plating. I returned it and ordered a normal clamp ceramic one that I like better.</li>
            <li> I know I must be the exception  given the ratings, but I hate this styler. Even at the lowest setting its still too hot and my hair has never looked worse because of it. In my opinion, its a very heavy and unwieldy tool and although I&#x27;ve been told I &#x27;will learn how to use it with practice&#x27;, I haven&#x27;t....even after watching a dozen You Tube videos!  I&#x27;m pitching this thing to the curb!</li>
            <li> I wish I had found this curling iron sooner.  This is a great tool and love the flexibility in styling and would recommend to others with medium to long hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this curling iron. At first I put off using it because the reverse handle was intimidating! But just look up &amp;#34;marcel curling iron&amp;#34; on youtube and there are good tutorials. You basically hold the grip and then use your pinkie/ring finger to push up on the wand. The 1 1/2&amp;#34; gives nice big curls that look natural and stay in all day. I can curl my long hair in about 10 minutes and am always pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I love this iron to make soft waves in my hair. It&#x27;s a little big and bulky to handle but that&#x27;s what comes with a 1.5 inch barrel.</li>
            <li> This tool is wonderful! It is easy to use, has a swivel cord and does a great job with my hair which if very full.</li>
            <li> i love the rotating handle on this and the thick barrel. Gives me big soft curls and makes my hair look shinier. i use this item multiple times a week and have owned it for a year now. Has a locking mechanism on the handle so the handle doesn&#x27;t have to swivel if you don&#x27;t want it to.</li>
            <li> Fabulous and does it&#x27;s job!</li>
            <li> This is my second Hot Tools marcel grip curling iron.  The first one lasted for years, so it was certainly a good value.  This iron gets VERY hot, which is great if you have thick hair like I do.  If you are looking for a marcel grip curling iron, I highly recommend this product...it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and expected, and the product got to my house quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m asian and my hair is medium in thickness.  My hair uncurls once I get to the other side of my head.  I&#x27;ve used other ones that were better and lasted me more than one day without any sprays.  This one might work for you if you have fine hair.</li>
            <li> My stylist told me about the Marcel curling iron. It takes some getting used to and maybe even a couple of Youtube videos to learn how to not burn yourself, but once you learn how to use this baby its totally worth it! The curls last for days...you&#x27;ll look like your hair was done professionally!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re used to using a Marcel curling iron, this one works great.  It gets SUPER hot, so I&#x27;m glad it has adjustment.  Also, it heats up extremely fast, so hardly no waiting if you forgot to turn it on.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended it to me and I am in love with it now. It makes curling your hair super easy. I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> To be honest, I was expecting it to be composed like a regular curling iron. The extra pole thing on top is a bit hard to use, but I guess it will just take and practice</li>
            <li> After looking around for an iron forever, I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase.  It takes a little while to heat up completely but it stays hot, which is good.  Also, after reading reviews, I expected the marcel wand to be much harder to use than it actually was.  There&#x27;s a great Youtube video of a girl demonstrating how to properly hold and use the marcel curling iron.  After watching that video I&#x27;ve been able to use the wand with no problems.  Love this iron!</li>
            <li> I received my curling iron and when I take it out of the box it was broken.  I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I really like it; the large size, temperature control and ease of handeling. Even ordered a second one half inch smaller.</li>
            <li> would tell anyone to buy it!  It was a quick ship and was a great price.  I would tell you make sure your getting a spring loaded if that is what you need.</li>
            <li> Fast and efficient shipping, quality product! Would do business again. Used it the day it came in the mail, created beautiful curls! I am a licensed hair stylist and will be using this iron on a regular basis for years</li>
            <li> This is a great curling iron if you are looking to create a beachy hair look.  If you haven&#x27;t used a marcel curler before, it will take a bit to get used to but in time you will be able to quickly style your hair (this is even faster than using my wand).</li>
            <li> love this - gets very hot;  recommend</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;d just me but i&#x27;ve used it 12+ times and I still can&#x27;t seem to get the hang of it and have to wear a heat glove... But the purpose of curling it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is defective but it doesn&#x27;t curl my hair at all. I set it to the hottest temperature ( which totally scares me) hold it on my hair for 20 seconds and the curl falls our within 5 seconds, with hair spray, it makes no sense! My hair usually will curl on a medium to low heat after just touching the iron. I threw away all of the packaging Because I was so sure it was going to work, I might try a smaller size to see if its just me or if its defective, but i definitely won&#x27;t throw away the packaging this time!</li>
            <li> Best curling iron I own!! Hate the ones with the clips!!</li>
            <li> The easiest curler I have ever had, once got used to rod instead of clip to hold clamp I like it better I used to burn my thumb when in a hurry with small clip on clamps.  I am much safer with rod clamp.  Does a great job with big full curls</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a pro and I trained myself to use the Marcel handle. I used to break 1 curing iron with a month with a spring. This product has lasted me at least 10 years.  I&#x27;m buying a new one to change the size only. LOVE!</li>
            <li> Works great. Takes a little time to get used to the unique handle, but it does just what I need.</li>
            <li> I thought this sounded like a good idea.  I watched the videos and thought I could do it.  I am not a person to take a lot of time with my hair.  I found this to be annoying.</li>
            <li> I love this one, even when I didn&#x27;t realize when I bought it that actually is a Marcel, which can be more difficult to use than a spring curling iron. It works great with my thick hair, and makes amazing curls that last. Love it!</li>
            <li> My wife was a hairdresser and salon owner. She used this same product and still does at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She would Recommend it!</li>
            <li> Takes a bit to learn how to use this tool - but once you do, you are going to love it. Great quality product. Happy with the seller.</li>
            <li> very difficult to operate have let a few other people try with no success, it not professional in my opinion</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the curling iron, only because I did not realize it was for professional use.  There was no spring in the handle and unless you work as a professional it would be hard to use this iron.  I returned it, and as usual Amazon made it right by refunding me.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Very difficult to find and was glad to find on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This iron is great, it come in a spring handle as well, I happen to prefer a Marcel.  This iron heats up so fast and recovers quickly during use.  It has a temp adjustment so it can get very hot for stubborn hair.  I dont recommend using on it&#x27;s highest setting, it will be very hard on the hair.  If you take care of this iron and don&#x27;t leave it on for hours at a time, it will last you for years.  Oh, and another thing, the heat element runs thru the entire length of the barrel, that is why it heats up so quickly.  Best iron I have ever used and won&#x27;t be my last!</li>
            <li> Works terrific! I owned a 1/2&amp;#34; model for years. As my hair got longer I wanted bigger curls. It works as a straightener for my hair with a little curl at the ends.  Can&#x27;t wait to buy the 1&amp;#34; model soon.</li>
            <li> Have no clue how this works poorly boxed no instructions</li>
            <li> Come on people, this is Hot Tools.  Do they ever make a bad curling iron?  Seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This iron is amazing! It heats evenly and quickly, and it will keep the heat (no annoying fluctuations you may experience with other irons).  It is easy on hair (for a hot appliance.  My hair actually prefers this to my ~$120.00 ceramic flat iron).  It is beautifully, and intelligently designed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind, this is a Marcel Iron, so no easy little clip with a spring.  You will get a more natural curl with this, and in my opinion once you are used to its operation it is faster than a spring iron.  I have previously owned the Hot Tools Professional Spring Irons, and the springs tend to start squeaking and then lose their hold.  Granted, my last iron lasted for 4 years before the spring lost its hold, and I loved everything else about that thing, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money on a replacement that would have the same spring problem.  The marcel iron has no spring, thus, no problem!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fantastic iron!  I couldn&#x27;t recommend a brand other than these guys when it comes to curling irons.  Just be aware of the difference between marcel and spring, and then choose what&#x27;s best for you.</li>
