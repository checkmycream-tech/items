    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>decided to heat this up with a candle warmer instead of the gigi wax warmer and both items were wonderful!</li>
            <li>Best waxing scent.   </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling moisturize and the best part is that there isn&#x27;t any bumps or irritation.</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t used to creme wax, it may take a bit of trial and error to get it to work perfectly with your hair.  </li>
            <li>Gigi products are wonderful.</li>
            <li>Its amazing !!</li>
            <li>smells great though.</li>
            <li>I was fearing that sting feeling after pulling the muslin each time but experienced none of that.  </li>

            <li>Smells amazing and does a great job removing hair.</li>
            <li>Worked after a fashion, not as good as the all-purpose honee variety.  </li>
            <li>it smells good</li>
            <li>and it works good</li>
            <li>This wax is too good.</li>
            <li>i loved it.</li>
            <li>It also has a not so good chocolate smell .</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Cr&amp;egrave;me wax is so much better!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>This wax smells great exactly chocolaty and also works great.</li>
            <li>Fits perfectly in my GiGi wax warmer and works very well with cloth wax strips.</li>
            <li>As for cleaning up Sure Clean is a great wax remover product that makes cleaning wax a breeze.</li>
            <li>It was very mild, smells great and easy to yes.  </li>
            <li>This wax is one of the best waxes I&#x27;ve used being a professional Waxer.</li>
            <li>Is the best and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>you can see it better</li>
            <li>and therefore you apply the muslim strip again, or maybe it is just a better formulation.</li>
            <li>Either way, I think it&#x27;s a better product</li>
            <li>and it has worked better for me than Azulene or Honee.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of milk chocolate.</li>
            <li>one of the best produts that you can use in a beauty salon, the only problem that is bery expensibe to bring to my country</li>
            <li>In love with my chocolate wax.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this wax.</li>
            <li>After reading the Pros and Cons below glad I made the investment.  </li>
            <li>i just love this milk chocolate wax.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s not horrible either.</li>
            <li>This smells like Chocolate and leaves a nice clean wax.  </li>
            <li>The smell is good and is gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>To echo the other comments, it smells absolutely delicious.</li>
            <li>other than that loved it!!!</li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t seem to come off as easily.</li>
            <li>its easy to do wax at home.i liked it very much.</li>
            <li>Its normal to feel sticky after any strip wax so keeping oil around for after is always a good idea.</li>
            <li>It also did not pull the hair out at the root unless it was fine textured.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and this wax is great for my bikini area.</li>
            <li>Its easy to apply and easy to clean as well.</li>
            <li>Very good wax... works as expected</li>
            <li>And God forbid, don&#x27;t forget the epilation oil - if you do, you end up with huge \\&quot;burn\\&quot; marks when you try to do the waxing.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin smooth and the smell; to die for.  </li>
            <li>Very regal and works effectively.</li>
            <li>It also leaves my skin smooth and smelling nice.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>The clean up is why I would not bother keeping this for even fine hair removal.</li>
            <li>It is also a huge pain to clean off of muslin strips so you can re-use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still trying to figure out how to clean it up</li>
            <li>but I like knowing that the wax is clean and not contaminated by salons/spas</li>
            <li>I independently wax my upper lip, legs and underarms and this wax was awesome.  </li>
            <li>this is my new favorite.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>exactly* right.  </li>
            <li>You need to know the right temp to keep it and techniques on applying it.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>This one keeps it very neat and clean.</li>
            <li>All my clients are very pleased with the results and minimal pain.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Being that it is a cr&amp;eacute;me wax, it&#x27;s very very gentle.</li>
            <li>It did smell and look like hot fudge.</li>
            <li>Recommended to anyone who wants a quality wax!</li>
            <li>i will go back to the all purpose honey, i love that stuff.</li>
            <li>but overall I love this product and will be using it from here on out.</li>
            <li>It really takes some practice, so don&#x27;t be discouraged!  </li>
            <li>This really does smell like chocolate!</li>
            <li>I personally think hard wax works best</li>
            <li>I bought this for the chocolate scent and positive reviews to try a cr√®me wax.</li>
            <li>For what was left, it was easily wiped off with some baby oil.  </li>
            <li>I certainly recommend the pre-epilation powder to use with it.  </li>
            <li>I have very course hair and super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It smells so delicious and goes on much smoother than the all purpose honey wax which just left a big mess.</li>
            <li>Baby oil is a good product to use for removal from your skin (if you scrub hard).  </li>
            <li>Very efficient is one application, hair is gone and no bumps or redness.  </li>
            <li>(As gentle as a wax can be, anyways.)</li>
            <li>There wasn&#x27;t that much excess residue on my skin.  </li>
            <li>its way better than other types...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thicker than most other waxes</li>
            <li>after waxing with this mind you I am very new to waxing i still had a lot to pluck out.</li>
            <li>I just tried this wax out for the first time on my legs and like it because it hurt far less than any other time I&#x27;ve gotten my legs waxed and it smells great.</li>
            <li>This wax needs to be on the medium to high setting of my gigi warmer.</li>
            <li>The smell is actually very relaxing, which is a definite plus, and it&#x27;s very gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li>I did use gigi prep powder before waxing clean dry legs.</li>
            <li>A must buy product if you are tired of wasting money at the salon good for all types of waxing.</li>
            <li>Love the smell, but it is definitely stickier than any other wax I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Oh wow!  </li>
            <li>I think it does a good job at getting most hairs, a few strays are left behind but this is normal.</li>
            <li>It was practically painless to use, which really surprised me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I thought that one was far messier than this milk chocolate wax.  </li>
            <li>I tried it, its very sticky and cleaning up is a big mess, it took me 2hours to clean .</li>
            <li>It has to be very warm to spread thin enough to be used properly.</li>
            <li>I made a huge mistake of not reading the reviews and used it without epilation powder/oil suggested by other users and now I have a big burn mark on my upper lip.</li>
            <li>Super messy.</li>
            <li>I have thick facial hair, but am able to get it with this wax once I got the hang of it.  </li>
            <li>I originally got my GiGi waxing kit with the Brazilian Body Hard Wax.  </li>
            <li>Hard to clean.</li>
            <li>Hard to clean up.</li>
            <li>I liked the scent, but it was an extremely messy wax compared to the all purpose gigi hard wax.</li>
            <li>On the flip side and for the same reason, it&#x27;s pretty messy, but that&#x27;s just cr&amp;eacute;me waxes in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And if you put too much on your skin, nothing will happen when you apply the muslim strip; it just makes a big mess.  </li>

            <li> I originally got my GiGi waxing kit with the Brazilian Body Hard Wax.  </li>
            <li> Hard to clean.</li>
            <li> Hard to clean up.</li>
            <li> I liked the scent, but it was an extremely messy wax compared to the all purpose gigi hard wax.</li>
            <li> On the flip side and for the same reason, it&#x27;s pretty messy, but that&#x27;s just cr&amp;eacute;me waxes in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And if you put too much on your skin, nothing will happen when you apply the muslim strip; it just makes a big mess.  </li>
            <li> I usually see a professional to get a Brazilian, but even the products they use aren&#x27;t sensitive enough.  </li>
            <li> It left a sticky, hard to clean up mess.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how much epilation powder would have helped though.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is edible but will give a Darwin award to the first person that tries.</li>
            <li> Its very sticky and hard.</li>
            <li> However, it does not take off as much hair as GiGi&#x27;s hard wax.</li>
            <li> wax is completely spilled out and its waste to buy it in amazon.</li>
            <li> It is also very messy and hard to clean.</li>
            <li> The clean up off the body was easy with some sesame oil but drops on the tile were horrible to get up.</li>
            <li> This is a professional type wax so it would be hard for just anyone to use.</li>
            <li> Overall, I don&#x27;t recommend this product, and I&#x27;ll be going back to the hard wax.</li>
            <li> but it is more painful</li>
            <li> It does get everywhere though, so be careful.</li>
            <li> only gave it four stars because I&#x27;m not sure how long it will take for the growth to return compared to other times I have waxed.  </li>
            <li> Unlike the hard wax, if you drip a bit of this stuff, it&#x27;s VERY messy and hard to clean up.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend covering the floor/surface underneath you with paper because baby oil is not going to suffice for other surfaces.  </li>
            <li> Repetitive waxing on the same area should not be done as it causes bruises.</li>
            <li> it gets all the hair and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like a lot of other waxes</li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t that waxy after smell that you get with the Honee wax and you walk around wondering if other people smell it too.  </li>
            <li> Its sticky, very messy and does not waxes properly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used multiple gigi waxes...hemp, honee, brazillian hard, etc...</li>
            <li> It is less painful but the mess and clean up is not worth it.</li>
            <li> It distracts you so may be thats why less pain.</li>
            <li> When I received it , it was already half spilled out.</li>
            <li> some reason this wax also helps to hurt less when waxing.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I find it less sticky and easier to use.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not a professional I would stick to using hard wax.</li>
            <li> but it is a sticky mess.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really sticky and hard to get off even with the wax off!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is a little too sticky / stringy for my liking.</li>
            <li> A little bit fell onto my floor</li>
            <li> If you put jeans on after waxing--even if you shower afterwards--there&#x27;s always trace bits of wax left behind</li>
            <li> I‚Äôm giving it 4 stars as my tin leaks 2-3 drops in wax warmer, cleaning is messy every time I use.</li>
            <li> Its a wax so of course it will be messy if you rush and don&#x27;t pay attention.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste ur money</li>
            <li> The chocolate smell is nice, and I don&#x27;t puff up too terribly with it.  </li>
            <li> previous comments have indicated, it is quite sticky and hard to remove from fingers, etc.  </li>
            <li> I had to follow-up very little with tweezers.</li>
            <li> it really wasn&#x27;t painful</li>
            <li> No more smelly waxy smell during a waxing session.</li>
            <li> Its usually easier for people to use.</li>
            <li> I usually make sugar wax at home, but wanted to give this a shot.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Painless</li>
            <li> This product is very messy.</li>
            <li> (did not have to use it with the all purpose hard wax)</li>
            <li> This wax wasn&#x27;t hard on the skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pretty hard to get it off it</li>
            <li> I have been using this wax for years and have nothing negative to say about it..</li>
            <li> Less painful and in my opinion less messy.</li>
            <li> It also leaves behind a lot of brown residue, both on my skin and on the wax warmer.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave behind residue like the honee wax.</li>
            <li> but it was less painful and not sticky at all like how wax sticks to you body and hands.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used about 1/2 the jar at this point; 3 miserable and painful waxing sessions later.  </li>
            <li> Its absolutely impossible to remove it if it will stick to your skin..Don&#x27;t even think about it if you have sensitive/soft skin.</li>
            <li> Awful product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> wax is completely spilled out and its waste to buy it in amazon.</li>
            <li> I just tried this wax out for the first time on my legs and like it because it hurt far less than any other time I&#x27;ve gotten my legs waxed and it smells great. It was practically painless to use, which really surprised me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As previous comments have indicated, it is quite sticky and hard to remove from fingers, etc.  Baby oil is a good product to use for removal from your skin (if you scrub hard).  I would recommend covering the floor/surface underneath you with paper because baby oil is not going to suffice for other surfaces.  It is also a huge pain to clean off of muslin strips so you can re-use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only gave it four stars because I&#x27;m not sure how long it will take for the growth to return compared to other times I have waxed.  If it lasts longer, I&#x27;ll come back to upgrade the rating.</li>
            <li> I applied this wax 2 days back.My skin is still looking like burnt.Its very sticky and hard.Its absolutely impossible to remove it if it will stick to your skin..Don&#x27;t even think about it if you have sensitive/soft skin.</li>
            <li> Worked after a fashion, not as good as the all-purpose honee variety.  It tended to resist being picked up by the strips unless I got the timing *exactly* right.  It did smell and look like hot fudge.</li>
            <li> This product did not remove any hair even after multiple applications.  It left a sticky, hard to clean up mess.Would not recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I&#x27;ve had one pro chocolate wax and then decided to give this a try at home...I was not disappointed. To echo the other comments, it smells absolutely delicious. I&#x27;ve used multiple gigi waxes...hemp, honee, brazillian hard, etc...this is my new favorite. hands down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being that it is a cr&amp;eacute;me wax, it&#x27;s very very gentle. I have very course hair and super sensitive skin and this one was very kind to my skin. On the flip side and for the same reason, it&#x27;s pretty messy, but that&#x27;s just cr&amp;eacute;me waxes in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to heat this up with a candle warmer instead of the gigi wax warmer and both items were wonderful! Link to the warmer I bought:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003IT5K0U/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1</li>
            <li> I love this product!! No more smelly waxy smell during a waxing session. Leaves skin smooth and the smell; to die for.  Best waxing scent.   Very efficient is one application, hair is gone and no bumps or redness.  A must buy product if you are tired of wasting money at the salon good for all types of waxing.</li>
            <li> Super messy. Need waxing strips</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the All Purpose Honee wax, Azulene Wax, and now this Chocolate Creme wax. This is my favorite so far. I haven&#x27;t shaved in years and have done waxing myself at home on my legs and underarms. When I went to a pro for a bikini wax, this was the wax she was using, so I thought I&#x27;d order it next time I needed wax. I can see why the pros use it. It comes off cleaner than honee or azulene wax. If you put jeans on after waxing--even if you shower afterwards--there&#x27;s always trace bits of wax left behind and you end up with bits of blue fabric on your legs. I didn&#x27;t find that with this wax. Maybe it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s brown on your skin you can see it better and therefore you apply the muslim strip again, or maybe it is just a better formulation. Either way, I think it&#x27;s a better product and it has worked better for me than Azulene or Honee. I also like that the cocoa has anti-inflammatory properties.</li>
            <li> I use the all purpose honey wax but tried this cream wax this time. Its amazing !! I don&#x27;t know why but it was less painful and not sticky at all like how wax sticks to you body and hands. This one keeps it very neat and clean. I love the smell of milk chocolate. It distracts you so may be thats why less pain. I would recommend using it.</li>
            <li> Came to me all leaking!</li>
            <li> This product is very messy. When I received it , it was already half spilled out. Hard to clean. When waxing you have to use it with the cloth to remove hairs. It is less painful but the mess and clean up is not worth it. Next time I would stick to my regulAr honey wax</li>
            <li> one of the best produts that you can use in a beauty salon, the only problem that is bery expensibe to bring to my country</li>
            <li> Smells great and our clients love it! Very regal and works effectively. Recommended to anyone who wants a quality wax!</li>
            <li> This stuff is a little too sticky / stringy for my liking. smells great though. i will go back to the all purpose honey, i love that stuff.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and does a great job removing hair. Not sure if it is edible but will give a Darwin award to the first person that tries.</li>
            <li> after waxing with this mind you I am very new to waxing i still had a lot to pluck out. it really wasn&#x27;t painful that&#x27;s a plus but it is a sticky mess.</li>
            <li> This wax smells great exactly chocolaty and also works great. Repetitive waxing on the same area should not be done as it causes bruises. I‚Äôm giving it 4 stars as my tin leaks 2-3 drops in wax warmer, cleaning is messy every time I use.</li>
            <li> This wax is one of the best waxes I&#x27;ve used being a professional Waxer. All my clients are very pleased with the results and minimal pain. This is a professional type wax so it would be hard for just anyone to use. You need to know the right temp to keep it and techniques on applying it. As for cleaning up Sure Clean is a great wax remover product that makes cleaning wax a breeze. Its normal to feel sticky after any strip wax so keeping oil around for after is always a good idea. If you&#x27;re not a professional I would stick to using hard wax. Its usually easier for people to use.</li>
            <li> I like this wax it smells good and it works good but the hair your waxing needs to be on the longer side for this to work. I personally think hard wax works best but it is more painful so I guess it&#x27;s your call.</li>
            <li> In love with my chocolate wax. Is the best and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the chocolate scent and positive reviews to try a cr√®me wax. Used it once and its going strait the trash. I liked the scent, but it was an extremely messy wax compared to the all purpose gigi hard wax. It also did not pull the hair out at the root unless it was fine textured. This wax needs to be on the medium to high setting of my gigi warmer. It has to be very warm to spread thin enough to be used properly. I did use gigi prep powder before waxing clean dry legs. I HAD to use the gigi cooling lotion after this product. My legs were irritated. (did not have to use it with the all purpose hard wax) The clean up off the body was easy with some sesame oil but drops on the tile were horrible to get up. The clean up is why I would not bother keeping this for even fine hair removal.</li>
            <li> Awful product. Its sticky, very messy and does not waxes properly</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this wax. However, it does not take off as much hair as GiGi&#x27;s hard wax. It also leaves behind a lot of brown residue, both on my skin and on the wax warmer. Hard to clean up.</li>
            <li> this is the only wax I buy anymore. its way better than other types... and it smells like chocolate to boot! Works for all areas!</li>
            <li> Very good wax... works as expected</li>
            <li> I have been using this wax for years and have nothing negative to say about it.. it gets the job done, I use it on face, underarms, bikini, and have also done my husbands chest with it.. it gets all the hair and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like a lot of other waxes do.. I also like that is has a nice chocolate smell!</li>
            <li> After reading the Pros and Cons below glad I made the investment.  I independently wax my upper lip, legs and underarms and this wax was awesome.  I was fearing that sting feeling after pulling the muslin each time but experienced none of that.  It was very mild, smells great and easy to yes.  Its a wax so of course it will be messy if you rush and don&#x27;t pay attention.  There wasn&#x27;t that waxy after smell that you get with the Honee wax and you walk around wondering if other people smell it too.  This smells like Chocolate and leaves a nice clean wax.  I had to follow-up very little with tweezers. A little bit fell onto my floor and I&#x27;m still trying to figure out how to clean it up but overall I love this product and will be using it from here on out.</li>
            <li> This wax is too good. i loved it. its easy to do wax at home.i liked it very much.</li>
            <li> I originally got my GiGi waxing kit with the Brazilian Body Hard Wax.  After it ran out, I got the chocolate creme wax next - I figured it would take some experimentation to get it right and I&#x27;ve used about 1/2 the jar at this point; 3 miserable and painful waxing sessions later.  Unlike the hard wax, if you drip a bit of this stuff, it&#x27;s VERY messy and hard to clean up.  And if you put too much on your skin, nothing will happen when you apply the muslim strip; it just makes a big mess.  And God forbid, don&#x27;t forget the epilation oil - if you do, you end up with huge \\&quot;burn\\&quot; marks when you try to do the waxing.  Overall, I don&#x27;t recommend this product, and I&#x27;ll be going back to the hard wax.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and this wax is great for my bikini area. I usually see a professional to get a Brazilian, but even the products they use aren&#x27;t sensitive enough.  I experience almost no irritation when I use this wax.</li>
            <li> Gigi Milk Chocolate Creme Wax, Milk Chocolate, 14 Ounce awful don&#x27;t waste ur money, I haven&#x27;t used it xxxx xxxxxxxx</li>
            <li> i just love this milk chocolate wax. From the scent to the texture. Its easy to apply and easy to clean as well. It leaves my skin feeling moisturize and the best part is that there isn&#x27;t any bumps or irritation.</li>
            <li> Cr&amp;egrave;me wax is so much better! Less painful and in my opinion less messy. Makes my bathroom smell like chocolate! Fits perfectly in my GiGi wax warmer and works very well with cloth wax strips. I&#x27;m not a pro at waxing but using cr&amp;egrave;me wax is a lot easier to handle as compared to the honey wax. The cr&amp;egrave;me wax is less harsh on my skin and easier to clean off. If you are thinking about purchasing a wax warmer and wax  my advise is, do it. Salons and Spas are great but I like knowing that the wax is clean and not contaminated by salons/spas double dipping on multiple people. Do your own waxing!</li>
            <li> This is the gentlest Gigi was that is out there. I use it for almost everywhere on my body and it doesn&#x27;t pull off the skin. It also leaves my skin smooth and smelling nice.&lt;br /&gt;For some reason this wax also helps to hurt less when waxing.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t used to creme wax, it may take a bit of trial and error to get it to work perfectly with your hair.  I have thick facial hair, but am able to get it with this wax once I got the hang of it.  It really takes some practice, so don&#x27;t be discouraged!  The chocolate smell is nice, and I don&#x27;t puff up too terribly with it.  I certainly recommend the pre-epilation powder to use with it.  It makes it so you don&#x27;t rip your skin off.  &#x3D;)  It does get everywhere though, so be careful.</li>
            <li> This really does smell like chocolate! The smell is actually very relaxing, which is a definite plus, and it&#x27;s very gentle on your skin. (As gentle as a wax can be, anyways.)</li>
            <li> Love the smell, but it is definitely stickier than any other wax I&#x27;ve ever used. And it doesn&#x27;t seem to come off as easily. But it&#x27;s not horrible either. Gigi products are wonderful.</li>
            <li> I tried it, its very sticky and cleaning up is a big mess, it took me 2hours to clean . Do not use it unless you have wax heater.</li>
            <li> I made a huge mistake of not reading the reviews and used it without epilation powder/oil suggested by other users and now I have a big burn mark on my upper lip. I am not sure how much epilation powder would have helped though. I am never going to use it on my face. It&#x27;s thicker than most other waxes and I didn&#x27;t find it spreadable. It is also very messy and hard to clean. I do not recommend this wax, especially if you are not used to waxing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really sticky and hard to get off even with the wax off!!! The smell is good and is gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> This wax is runny and does not work as well as the regular wax. It also has a not so good chocolate smell .</li>
            <li> I prefer the chocolate creme wax over the honee wax. I find it less sticky and easier to use. It doesn&#x27;t leave behind residue like the honee wax.</li>
            <li> Oh wow!  I love this product!  I used to use the creme wax before and I thought that one was far messier than this milk chocolate wax.  This wax wasn&#x27;t hard on the skin and I felt that it cleared more hairs out - none left behind!  There wasn&#x27;t that much excess residue on my skin.  For what was left, it was easily wiped off with some baby oil.  I&#x27;m definitely going to continue to use this chocolate wax!</li>
            <li> I bought this after a friend recommended that chocolate wax removes tan. I usually make sugar wax at home, but wanted to give this a shot.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Painless&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Pretty hard to get it off it the strip doesn&#x27;t pull it. There were couple places on my foot where the wax didn&#x27;t come off with the strip and it was a nightmare getting it out.&lt;br /&gt;I used this on my face too and it peeled off skin. I&#x27;d never use it on face again.&lt;br /&gt;Takes a lot of time to heat.&lt;br /&gt;I feel the hair that is growing back is coarse.</li>
            <li> Once you melt this wax you get the urge to eat it. It smells so delicious and goes on much smoother than the all purpose honey wax which just left a big mess. I think it does a good job at getting most hairs, a few strays are left behind but this is normal. I will be repurchasing this again.</li>
            <li> Removes majority of the in-growth also!!!! you are advised to take care while pulling out the strips, it might peel the skin sometimes. other than that loved it!!!</li>
