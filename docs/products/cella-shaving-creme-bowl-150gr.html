            <li>I love this smell, to me its better then Truefitt and Hill 1805 which is one of the best shaving creams on the market.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shave is great and smooth!</li>
            <li>Good scent and gives a nicely lubricated shave.  </li>
            <li>Lathers up very quickly to a smooth consistency and excellent smell, though it is a softer smell (almond or cherry) that may not be everyone&#x27;s favorite.</li>
            <li>feels phenomenal!</li>
            <li>This is easily in my top five for shave soaps and a staple in my arsenal of soaps!</li>
            <li>If you like amaretto/marzipan, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>

            <li>when lathered in a bowl with a nice brush it creates a wonderful smelling and great performing foam that is slick and luxurious and, combined with your favorite razor, provides an excellent shaving experience.</li>
            <li>I had heard so many good things about Cella Shaving Cream (aroma, lather, razor glide...)</li>
            <li>It lathers well and provides a nice shave.  </li>
            <li>Tallow soaps however are not that way, I&#x27;ve always liked my soaps on the wetter side</li>
            <li>Nice foam and smell.</li>
            <li>Kind of molded or rotted.</li>
            <li>but the lather is definitely nice IMO</li>
            <li>Honestly don&#x27;t remember why anymore.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s in a nice bowl</li>
            <li>A real great smelling (Almond Smell) shaving soap that really protects your face</li>
            <li>so you get a nice close shave.</li>
            <li>It has a light smell and gives a good shave but not as good as &amp;#34;the others&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>That is one nice thing about this</li>
            <li>It smells like Marzipan and honestly Anything from Kiss</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;The legendary soap&amp;#34; &amp;#34;The classic soap&amp;#34; &amp;#34;The timeless tallow</li>
            <li>It lathers very easily and the almond scent is nice too, makes me think of maraschino cherries.</li>
            <li>Smells like Dr. Pepper and provides great cushion and a comfortable slickness that makes shaving enjoyable.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not in love with the fragrance, but it is a top performer and a good value for the price.</li>
            <li>it is very easy to load the creme onto the brush.</li>
            <li>Also lathers very easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice soap, it just isn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
            <li>performance is excellent... leaves your skin soft.  </li>
            <li>Cella has earned a good reputation and by my using it, I now will pass its reputation on to another fortunate user.&lt;br</li>
            <li>provides a good rich lather.  </li>
            <li>the scent is very light.</li>
            <li>the shave is very smooth.</li>
            <li>my blade glides very smooth</li>
            <li>Fantastic lather and great scent (very light sweet almond).  </li>
            <li>great soft soap; rich, smooth and lubricating; nice marzipan (cherry almond) fragrance; great price point too.  </li>
            <li>It truly doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.</li>
            <li>I love every aspect of this shave soap.</li>
            <li>Provides good cushion and good glide, the tallow based soap leaves your face feeling protected and soft.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>There are others I like more-</li>
            <li>Try using dis tilled water and this really makes a great lather.  </li>
            <li>I would say this product is top notch.</li>
            <li>but my boar works better with it.</li>
            <li>This stuff is outstanding.</li>
            <li>I love the product.  </li>
            <li>It is one of the better soaps IMO.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad that I started off with it.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell, love how it goes on, and how it works.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic smell and nice lather.</li>
            <li>Nice smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>This may be my favorite shave soap of all that I have tried.</li>
            <li>However, almond is not my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite croaps.</li>
            <li>If your into that scent your going to love this creme.</li>
            <li>That said, it is my favorite.</li>
            <li>then most people it&#x27;s just what works with me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that when I get better with my technique this problem will go away.</li>
            <li>Has a light citrus &amp; rose scent.</li>
            <li>I feel like i get a better shave with this stuff.</li>
            <li>It was okay.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have too many complaints when I was using it, but when I finished the bowl</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Again, love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love the almond aroma</li>
            <li>Having said that, I think the soap version is a bit better</li>
            <li>I love the smell of marzipan</li>
            <li>So, it&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>Love the almond scent.  </li>
            <li>What more could I ask for?</li>
            <li>Also it tends to stay slimy on top even if you leave the lid cracked.  </li>
            <li>Love the scent....</li>
            <li>I use make three passes with a DE safety razor and am quite impressed with how the lather holds up through the last pass.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love the almond scent.</li>
            <li>As for performance the slip and cushion are top of the line.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to load on my brush and just as easy to build into a lather.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff and not very expensive.  </li>
            <li>This is a very nice shaving soap-not really a cream.  </li>
            <li>Great performance classic cherry almond scent</li>
            <li>Nice n sweet and</li>
            <li>This is pretty darn good stuff but not 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>But most importantly it doesn&#x27;t work as well as most others in terms of glide, and cushioning, and closeness, ease of lathering and how it leaves your face afterwards - just not as conditioned.</li>
            <li>very nice scent and mixture that goes on smooth, lathers well, and is not irritating, too invasive or overpowering.</li>
            <li>Fine product, but not in my top 10.  </li>
            <li>If you know a wet shaver this is one of the best gifts you can give.</li>
            <li>PRobably read somewhere that it was popular and the price was right.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorites to use, the creamy foam is rich and I just love the almond scent it gives off.</li>
            <li>- this cream foams up very quick and easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to lather.</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t worry if you are someone who prefers very mild smelling creams.</li>
            <li>but it does not melt easily on skin</li>
            <li>The size and bowl also travels easily.  </li>
            <li>Easy to lather.  </li>
            <li>Awesome soap, a lot better than the proraso green tub.  </li>
            <li>Very mild.  </li>
            <li>Very mild scent.  </li>
            <li>This is the best hands down.</li>
            <li>It creates a nice lather, and the smell is subtle but wonderful.  </li>
            <li>This has quickly become my favorite shaving creme.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy having it in the shave cream rotation.</li>
            <li>I would say like a light almond oil.</li>
            <li>Soap has a nice aroma and shaves very well.  </li>
            <li>A fantastic value.</li>
            <li>It lathers up well and helps me get a smooth, close shave.</li>
            <li>Smooth.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a tallow based soap and while I enjoy it the stuff can be finicky with water.</li>
            <li>really enjoy this soap</li>
            <li>I still got that cheap soapy smell in my nose .I</li>
            <li>Close and comfortable shave</li>
            <li>The KMF can be had cheaply if you buy it in quantity here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>If you are trying to find a good inexpensive soap look at Taylor of old bond street</li>
            <li>Thank you to Cella or continuing to make such a fine product for us to enjoy!!!</li>
            <li>A fantastic sweet almond &amp; cherry scent and easy to lather.</li>
            <li>I use 10 different soaps on a rotating basis and this one fit very nicely into the rotation.  </li>
            <li>Very nice razor not too aggressive for an open comb.</li>
            <li>The almond/marzipan scent is a little strong (but still delicious) when sniffed directly out of the pot, but moderates nicely once you add water and start lathering.  </li>
            <li>I have used it for a few weeks now with excellent results; shaves that are both quick and smooth.</li>
            <li>Creamy rich lather, I like it.  </li>
            <li>It lathered immediately and richly.</li>
            <li>Honestly I was expecting a little more from this given the many fine reviews.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s great for traveling, has a fantastic almond smell, and does not leave your face oily or caked with residue unlike other shaving soaps/gels/creams.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve tried different soaps and want just a good fresh soap that lathers easy and gives you protecting, you can grab this one.</li>
            <li>Nice cream / soap, good lather, it does dry rather fast.  </li>
            <li>I use this soap for those special shaves</li>
            <li>Lots of protection, this is right up there with Tabac in my book!</li>
            <li>it means that it actually makes your skin feel good after shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is cheap, and well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It consistently makes great lather, sometimes a bit thin but always does a good job at lubricating the razor.</li>
            <li>other great tallow based Shaving creme</li>
            <li>The Plastic bowl leaves much to be desired, and I&#x27;m not completely taken by the almond smell, but the shaving cream performs beautifully.</li>
            <li>Scent dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>For some reason I actually put off buying Cella but the reviews for this product are not only excellent on Amazon but around the internet as well.</li>
            <li>I have used more than 40 different soaps and this one is definitely the most appreciated amongs experienced shavers.</li>
            <li>And the odor after you shave is quite mild</li>
            <li>First, it smells like cheap marzipan - didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>I have a new favorite shave soap.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to give this a try if you haven&#x27;t everyone&#x27;s face and skin are different and works very week for me and the price is very good and one jar has lasted me a year.</li>
            <li>Why subject your face to a toxic cocktail every day when you can get coconut oil, tallow, stearic acid, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium carbonate and a great almond scent?</li>
            <li>The lather is nice slick giving my razor a nice glide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However if you do work with it and give it a chance I&#x27;m positive you will enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Has an amazing scent of Italian amaretto.</li>
            <li>The smell is light almond and really isn&#x27;t overpowering by any means.  </li>
            <li>Within the wetshaving community Cella is a consistently popular item that represents some of the better aspects of the Italian soft soaps.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found them to compliment the noted razors with Gillette Silver Blue blades nicely.</li>
            <li>It is tallow based, which is somewhat rare in a mass produced shaving soap.</li>
            <li>There are better scented shave soaps, better packaged and more expensive, but none better in use.</li>
            <li>this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>Beautiful rich lather with a subtle almond scent.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other soap&#x27;s proroso tobs Mitchells wool fat and many others</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t had as much success getting a good lather as some of the other soaps I have; perhaps my technique just doesn&#x27;t work as well with this soap.</li>
            <li>If nothing else, this bowl of soap is lasting longer than the Proraso, which I attribute partly to my increased skill in learning how to shave like this, but more to the fact that the Cella really lathers wonderfully with a small amount.</li>
            <li>Of course, the price is good too compared to other high-quality soaps.</li>
            <li>just feel right now</li>
            <li>Face/beard lubrication was great with no nicks or raw regions.  </li>
            <li>Slick, great cushion.</li>
            <li>Really slick and provides great cushion.</li>
            <li>Thrilled with this Italian classic!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nowhere near as strong as the Proraso.</li>
            <li>Does better with a stiff brush, but ok with badger also.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While more expensive than most canned aerosol creams, 150 grams of Cella will last a great deal longer, whilst the luxury and performance pays for itself in user enjoyment.</li>
            <li>this is one of my top 5 favorite shave soaps easily, just behind Mama Bear and Trumpers Coconut.</li>
            <li>If you are just starting out this is a good choice, due to the fact that it lathers easily.</li>
            <li>Actually this product seems more to be somewhere between a cream and a soap.</li>
            <li>With a double edge razor, your face winds up feeling smooth and soft, and most of the time using a aftershave balm after a shave with this soap is a luxury, not a necessity (use one anyway, your face will thank you).</li>
            <li>Reasonably price also!  </li>
            <li>This is my first experience with shaving soap</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used Cella shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>stop reading and ignore the absolutely asinine 1 to 2 star reviews and get this soap!</li>
            <li>While my favorite shave soap is Arko; Cella is one of only three shave soaps that I use (Arko, Cella, MWF).  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like it at first</li>
            <li>So just starting out requires learning a new technique to be effective.  </li>
            <li>- it is very cheap and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>but neither the performance nor the aroma is good enough to make a place in my regular rotation.  </li>
            <li>Produces a good slick lather.  </li>
            <li>Lathers up very easily and forms a thick, smooth lather.</li>
            <li>Final rinse removed the residual easily without that chemically feel I sometimes get with Proraso.    </li>
            <li>The Brush will have enough soap from the face lather for 3 passes easily.    </li>
            <li>The scent is pure almond - marzipan, and it does get cloying after a while, but the scent and the creaminess remind you of a creamy dessert instead of a shave</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a soft soap cream, which makes it easy to load up with even a soft brush.</li>
            <li>Even with minimal effort and a sup par brush I was able to get a soft, slick and cushioning light lather that smells amazing.</li>
            <li>The little plastic case is kind of neat.</li>
            <li>It is hard to work into a good lather and it smells like piss.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good &amp;#34;creme&amp;#34; but it can be hard to lather if you don&#x27;t show some patience with it.</li>
            <li>I have been using Cella for a few months and think it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>The smell is very comparable to almond oil.</li>
            <li>Not over powerful and natural.  </li>
            <li>Works very well and is recommended.  </li>
            <li>It really softens the beard hairs and makes shaving very pleasurable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I don&#x27;t find that it provides as much lather or protection as say Proraso does, though it is decent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really benefits from the stiffness of a boar hair</li>
            <li>I started wet shaving about a year ago and went through many shaving creams and shaving products.</li>
            <li>so the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It lathers very well, too.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>My Face is MUCH MUCH</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t like Prosaro all that much).</li>
            <li>The almond scent is subtle and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;creme&amp;#34; is more of a soft soap as well, it needs a lot of back bone and if your using a badger haired brush you will have to spend some time loading it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say Italian soaps are known for is easy to produce lather that is of high quality.</li>
            <li>The lather is a 8 out of 10 the scent is 8 out of 10 very light and not very overpowering classic almond scent</li>
            <li>One great thing, is you can buy the 1Kg block of Cella and have extra to give to friends or just to last a long time.  </li>
            <li>I am fairly new to wet shaving but love this product.  </li>
            <li>This cream works easily into a thick rich lather it doesn&#x27;t matter if your lathering straight on your face or in a mug/bowl.</li>
            <li>This uses up more product than I&#x27;ve normally used in other bowl-contained creams.</li>
            <li>As far as soaps go, I prefer proraso green tube, TOBS Jermyn st, and Van der Hagen deluxe soaps.</li>
            <li>Decent soap</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It easily lasts to get the job done, but if you are super slow, you might need to whip it up again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it is well worth the price, especially for the quality.</li>
            <li>, It works up to nice thick lather which keeps your whiskers standing at attention</li>
            <li>would buy this again since it feels nice and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling tight and dry, but with so many other soaps to try it will be a while before I come around again.</li>
            <li>High quality shaving soap , the almond scent is a tad strong but it goes away after shaving ,lathers up nicely and  this jar will last you a very very long time , been using it for a few weeks now and barely made a dent on it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a rich, slightly bitter almond scent.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone looking for a new shave cream.</li>
            <li>very smooth and slick.</li>
            <li>Seriously, this stuff smells amazing.</li>
            <li>My only real complaints is the shape of the container makes it had to really load up a brush.</li>
            <li>The scent of Cella is a pleasant amaretto, but it is subtle enough that it won&#x27;t clash with any post shave products one would want to</li>
            <li>Many soaps will work with just about anything, a little water or a lot they typically do not mind either way.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Very solid performer but not worth the effort given some of the other great alternatives.  </li>
            <li>This will stay high on my list of \\&quot;bang for the buck\\&quot; creams along with Taylor of Old Bond Street Avocado.</li>
            <li>When it comes to tallow based soaps they are very sensitive to water.</li>
            <li>This soap is very sensitive to water tho</li>
            <li>The smell of this soap is great, But the soap is kinda between a soft and a hard soap, When you load up your brush it will get chunks of the soap stuck in the bristles, it either needs to be softer or harder.</li>
            <li>Really is a hard cream and more difficult to lather than creams like Taylor of Bond Street but works great.  </li>
            <li>When I first started going back to basics to shave I went with Proraso.</li>
            <li>First of all, calling Cella a &amp;#34;Shaving Creme&amp;#34; is misleading--although it is soft, it is definitely a soap.  </li>
            <li>I tried this \\&quot;cream\\&quot; (hard as a soap) hoping this would be my new favorite.</li>
            <li>Otherwise I have only positive things to say about this</li>
            <li>This is my go to shave soap I put hot water in the container fill the sink with warm water wet my face and brush shake water off brush poor water out of container and mix right up rinse out red container and face lather.</li>
            <li>Lathers up with a little bit of effort but very well worth it.</li>
            <li>, many people are complimenting the little red tub</li>
            <li>I just want to make that clear</li>
            <li>Does not irritate sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li>So far, I have used it for three or four shaves.  </li>
            <li>soft scent washes off when your done shaving</li>
            <li>This stuff goes toe to toe with Proraso and other fine Italian Soaps.  </li>
            <li>Not very slick.</li>
            <li>i have been using it every day for 8 or 9 months and the container is still half full</li>
            <li>Classic Italian tallow based shave soap with the marzipan scent.</li>
            <li>Last a long time and is totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone who likes trying out different creams and soaps.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used TOBS (Sensitive Skin) and Proraso (red, green, and blue), and Cella seems to be better at noticeably softening my whiskers.</li>
            <li>The jar is to small to fit your brush in the build a lather.</li>
            <li>Great scent but very faint.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re new to traditional shaving, give this a shot, you will not regret it.</li>
            <li>Because of this it was a little hard to lather at first, but probably my favorite cream</li>
            <li>This cream tends to dry fast</li>
            <li>Easy to build thick lather.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t why people are gaga for this soap because it didn&#x27;t lather properly and was NOT slick.</li>
            <li>While many call it a soap it is actually a very hard cream.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your face dry and not feeling as clean as other products.</li>
            <li>So when I finally did use it I was still surprised by how well performing this product is.</li>
            <li>The Soap is very soft, you just need a little water on your brush and this soap will lather very well.  </li>
            <li>Does not dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>The AOS is clearly the most expensive.</li>
            <li>but if your new to shaving just take your time with it and be aware if you have hard water</li>
            <li>I know people who are the exact opposite tho ultimately it comes down to what works for you.</li>
            <li>It dries out faster on my face, it has less glide and more tack than my other soaps, and it doesn&#x27;t soften the hair as well as my other soaps.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new not to wet shaves, but shaving with a safety razor.  </li>

            <li> but the lather is definitely nice IMO</li>
            <li> Honestly don&#x27;t remember why anymore.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s in a nice bowl</li>
            <li> A real great smelling (Almond Smell) shaving soap that really protects your face</li>
            <li> so you get a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> It has a light smell and gives a good shave but not as good as &amp;#34;the others&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> That is one nice thing about this</li>
            <li> It smells like Marzipan and honestly Anything from Kiss</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;The legendary soap&amp;#34; &amp;#34;The classic soap&amp;#34; &amp;#34;The timeless tallow</li>
            <li> It lathers very easily and the almond scent is nice too, makes me think of maraschino cherries.</li>
            <li> Smells like Dr. Pepper and provides great cushion and a comfortable slickness that makes shaving enjoyable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not in love with the fragrance, but it is a top performer and a good value for the price.</li>
            <li> it is very easy to load the creme onto the brush.</li>
            <li> Also lathers very easily.</li>

            <li> performance is excellent... leaves your skin soft.  </li>
            <li> Cella has earned a good reputation and by my using it, I now will pass its reputation on to another fortunate user.&lt;br</li>

            <li> my blade glides very smooth</li>
            <li> Fantastic lather and great scent (very light sweet almond).  </li>
            <li> great soft soap; rich, smooth and lubricating; nice marzipan (cherry almond) fragrance; great price point too.  </li>
            <li> It truly doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.</li>
            <li> I love every aspect of this shave soap.</li>
            <li> Provides good cushion and good glide, the tallow based soap leaves your face feeling protected and soft.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> There are others I like more-</li>
            <li> Try using dis tilled water and this really makes a great lather.  </li>
            <li> I would say this product is top notch.</li>
            <li> but my boar works better with it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is outstanding.</li>
            <li> I love the product.  </li>
            <li> It is one of the better soaps IMO.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad that I started off with it.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell, love how it goes on, and how it works.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic smell and nice lather.</li>
            <li> Nice smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> This may be my favorite shave soap of all that I have tried.</li>
            <li> However, almond is not my favorite scent.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite croaps.</li>
            <li> If your into that scent your going to love this creme.</li>
            <li> That said, it is my favorite.</li>
            <li> then most people it&#x27;s just what works with me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that when I get better with my technique this problem will go away.</li>
            <li> Has a light citrus &amp; rose scent.</li>
            <li> I feel like i get a better shave with this stuff.</li>
            <li> It was okay.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have too many complaints when I was using it, but when I finished the bowl</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Again, love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love the almond aroma</li>
            <li> Having said that, I think the soap version is a bit better</li>
            <li> I love the smell of marzipan</li>
            <li> So, it&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li> Love the almond scent.  </li>
            <li> What more could I ask for?</li>
            <li> Also it tends to stay slimy on top even if you leave the lid cracked.  </li>
            <li> Love the scent....</li>
            <li> I use make three passes with a DE safety razor and am quite impressed with how the lather holds up through the last pass.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love the almond scent.</li>
            <li> As for performance the slip and cushion are top of the line.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to load on my brush and just as easy to build into a lather.  </li>
            <li> Great stuff and not very expensive.  </li>
            <li> This is a very nice shaving soap-not really a cream.  </li>
            <li> Great performance classic cherry almond scent</li>
            <li> Nice n sweet and</li>
            <li> This is pretty darn good stuff but not 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> But most importantly it doesn&#x27;t work as well as most others in terms of glide, and cushioning, and closeness, ease of lathering and how it leaves your face afterwards - just not as conditioned.</li>
            <li> very nice scent and mixture that goes on smooth, lathers well, and is not irritating, too invasive or overpowering.</li>
            <li> Fine product, but not in my top 10.  </li>
            <li> If you know a wet shaver this is one of the best gifts you can give.</li>
            <li> PRobably read somewhere that it was popular and the price was right.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorites to use, the creamy foam is rich and I just love the almond scent it gives off.</li>
            <li> - this cream foams up very quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Easy to lather.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t worry if you are someone who prefers very mild smelling creams.</li>
            <li> but it does not melt easily on skin</li>
            <li> The size and bowl also travels easily.  </li>
            <li> Easy to lather.  </li>
            <li> Awesome soap, a lot better than the proraso green tub.  </li>
            <li> Very mild.  </li>
            <li> Very mild scent.  </li>
            <li> This is the best hands down.</li>
            <li> It creates a nice lather, and the smell is subtle but wonderful.  </li>
            <li> This has quickly become my favorite shaving creme.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy having it in the shave cream rotation.</li>
            <li> I would say like a light almond oil.</li>
            <li> Soap has a nice aroma and shaves very well.  </li>
            <li> A fantastic value.</li>
            <li> It lathers up well and helps me get a smooth, close shave.</li>
            <li> Smooth.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tallow based soap and while I enjoy it the stuff can be finicky with water.</li>
            <li> really enjoy this soap</li>
            <li> I still got that cheap soapy smell in my nose .I</li>
            <li> Close and comfortable shave</li>
            <li> The KMF can be had cheaply if you buy it in quantity here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> If you are trying to find a good inexpensive soap look at Taylor of old bond street</li>
            <li> Thank you to Cella or continuing to make such a fine product for us to enjoy!!!</li>
            <li> A fantastic sweet almond &amp; cherry scent and easy to lather.</li>
            <li> I use 10 different soaps on a rotating basis and this one fit very nicely into the rotation.  </li>
            <li> Very nice razor not too aggressive for an open comb.</li>
            <li> The almond/marzipan scent is a little strong (but still delicious) when sniffed directly out of the pot, but moderates nicely once you add water and start lathering.  </li>
            <li> I have used it for a few weeks now with excellent results; shaves that are both quick and smooth.</li>
            <li> Creamy rich lather, I like it.  </li>
            <li> It lathered immediately and richly.</li>
            <li> Honestly I was expecting a little more from this given the many fine reviews.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s great for traveling, has a fantastic almond smell, and does not leave your face oily or caked with residue unlike other shaving soaps/gels/creams.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve tried different soaps and want just a good fresh soap that lathers easy and gives you protecting, you can grab this one.</li>
            <li> Nice cream / soap, good lather, it does dry rather fast.  </li>
            <li> I use this soap for those special shaves</li>
            <li> Lots of protection, this is right up there with Tabac in my book!</li>
            <li> it means that it actually makes your skin feel good after shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is cheap, and well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It consistently makes great lather, sometimes a bit thin but always does a good job at lubricating the razor.</li>
            <li> other great tallow based Shaving creme</li>
            <li> The Plastic bowl leaves much to be desired, and I&#x27;m not completely taken by the almond smell, but the shaving cream performs beautifully.</li>
            <li> Scent dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> For some reason I actually put off buying Cella but the reviews for this product are not only excellent on Amazon but around the internet as well.</li>
            <li> I have used more than 40 different soaps and this one is definitely the most appreciated amongs experienced shavers.</li>
            <li> And the odor after you shave is quite mild</li>
            <li> First, it smells like cheap marzipan - didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I have a new favorite shave soap.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend to give this a try if you haven&#x27;t everyone&#x27;s face and skin are different and works very week for me and the price is very good and one jar has lasted me a year.</li>
            <li> Why subject your face to a toxic cocktail every day when you can get coconut oil, tallow, stearic acid, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium carbonate and a great almond scent?</li>
            <li> The lather is nice slick giving my razor a nice glide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However if you do work with it and give it a chance I&#x27;m positive you will enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Has an amazing scent of Italian amaretto.</li>
            <li> The smell is light almond and really isn&#x27;t overpowering by any means.  </li>
            <li> Within the wetshaving community Cella is a consistently popular item that represents some of the better aspects of the Italian soft soaps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found them to compliment the noted razors with Gillette Silver Blue blades nicely.</li>
            <li> It is tallow based, which is somewhat rare in a mass produced shaving soap.</li>
            <li> There are better scented shave soaps, better packaged and more expensive, but none better in use.</li>
            <li> this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> Beautiful rich lather with a subtle almond scent.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other soap&#x27;s proroso tobs Mitchells wool fat and many others</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t had as much success getting a good lather as some of the other soaps I have; perhaps my technique just doesn&#x27;t work as well with this soap.</li>
            <li> If nothing else, this bowl of soap is lasting longer than the Proraso, which I attribute partly to my increased skill in learning how to shave like this, but more to the fact that the Cella really lathers wonderfully with a small amount.</li>
            <li> Of course, the price is good too compared to other high-quality soaps.</li>
            <li> just feel right now</li>
            <li> Face/beard lubrication was great with no nicks or raw regions.  </li>
            <li> Slick, great cushion.</li>
            <li> Really slick and provides great cushion.</li>
            <li> Thrilled with this Italian classic!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nowhere near as strong as the Proraso.</li>
            <li> Does better with a stiff brush, but ok with badger also.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While more expensive than most canned aerosol creams, 150 grams of Cella will last a great deal longer, whilst the luxury and performance pays for itself in user enjoyment.</li>
            <li> this is one of my top 5 favorite shave soaps easily, just behind Mama Bear and Trumpers Coconut.</li>
            <li> If you are just starting out this is a good choice, due to the fact that it lathers easily.</li>
            <li> Actually this product seems more to be somewhere between a cream and a soap.</li>
            <li> With a double edge razor, your face winds up feeling smooth and soft, and most of the time using a aftershave balm after a shave with this soap is a luxury, not a necessity (use one anyway, your face will thank you).</li>
            <li> Reasonably price also!  </li>
            <li> This is my first experience with shaving soap</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used Cella shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> stop reading and ignore the absolutely asinine 1 to 2 star reviews and get this soap!</li>
            <li> While my favorite shave soap is Arko; Cella is one of only three shave soaps that I use (Arko, Cella, MWF).  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it at first</li>
            <li> So just starting out requires learning a new technique to be effective.  </li>
            <li> - it is very cheap and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> but neither the performance nor the aroma is good enough to make a place in my regular rotation.  </li>
            <li> Produces a good slick lather.  </li>
            <li> Lathers up very easily and forms a thick, smooth lather.</li>
            <li> Final rinse removed the residual easily without that chemically feel I sometimes get with Proraso.    </li>
            <li> The Brush will have enough soap from the face lather for 3 passes easily.    </li>
            <li> The scent is pure almond - marzipan, and it does get cloying after a while, but the scent and the creaminess remind you of a creamy dessert instead of a shave</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a soft soap cream, which makes it easy to load up with even a soft brush.</li>
            <li> Even with minimal effort and a sup par brush I was able to get a soft, slick and cushioning light lather that smells amazing.</li>
            <li> The little plastic case is kind of neat.</li>
            <li> It is hard to work into a good lather and it smells like piss.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good &amp;#34;creme&amp;#34; but it can be hard to lather if you don&#x27;t show some patience with it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Cella for a few months and think it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> The smell is very comparable to almond oil.</li>
            <li> Not over powerful and natural.  </li>
            <li> Works very well and is recommended.  </li>
            <li> It really softens the beard hairs and makes shaving very pleasurable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I don&#x27;t find that it provides as much lather or protection as say Proraso does, though it is decent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really benefits from the stiffness of a boar hair</li>
            <li> I started wet shaving about a year ago and went through many shaving creams and shaving products.</li>
            <li> so the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It lathers very well, too.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My Face is MUCH MUCH</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t like Prosaro all that much).</li>
            <li> The almond scent is subtle and pleasant.  </li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;creme&amp;#34; is more of a soft soap as well, it needs a lot of back bone and if your using a badger haired brush you will have to spend some time loading it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say Italian soaps are known for is easy to produce lather that is of high quality.</li>
            <li> The lather is a 8 out of 10 the scent is 8 out of 10 very light and not very overpowering classic almond scent</li>
            <li> One great thing, is you can buy the 1Kg block of Cella and have extra to give to friends or just to last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I am fairly new to wet shaving but love this product.  </li>
            <li> This cream works easily into a thick rich lather it doesn&#x27;t matter if your lathering straight on your face or in a mug/bowl.</li>
            <li> This uses up more product than I&#x27;ve normally used in other bowl-contained creams.</li>
            <li> As far as soaps go, I prefer proraso green tube, TOBS Jermyn st, and Van der Hagen deluxe soaps.</li>
            <li> Decent soap</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It easily lasts to get the job done, but if you are super slow, you might need to whip it up again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it is well worth the price, especially for the quality.</li>
            <li> , It works up to nice thick lather which keeps your whiskers standing at attention</li>
            <li> would buy this again since it feels nice and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling tight and dry, but with so many other soaps to try it will be a while before I come around again.</li>
            <li> High quality shaving soap , the almond scent is a tad strong but it goes away after shaving ,lathers up nicely and  this jar will last you a very very long time , been using it for a few weeks now and barely made a dent on it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a rich, slightly bitter almond scent.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone looking for a new shave cream.</li>
            <li> very smooth and slick.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this stuff smells amazing.</li>
            <li> My only real complaints is the shape of the container makes it had to really load up a brush.</li>
            <li> The scent of Cella is a pleasant amaretto, but it is subtle enough that it won&#x27;t clash with any post shave products one would want to</li>
            <li> Many soaps will work with just about anything, a little water or a lot they typically do not mind either way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very solid performer but not worth the effort given some of the other great alternatives.  </li>
            <li> This will stay high on my list of \\&quot;bang for the buck\\&quot; creams along with Taylor of Old Bond Street Avocado.</li>
            <li> When it comes to tallow based soaps they are very sensitive to water.</li>
            <li> This soap is very sensitive to water tho</li>
            <li> The smell of this soap is great, But the soap is kinda between a soft and a hard soap, When you load up your brush it will get chunks of the soap stuck in the bristles, it either needs to be softer or harder.</li>
            <li> Really is a hard cream and more difficult to lather than creams like Taylor of Bond Street but works great.  </li>
            <li> When I first started going back to basics to shave I went with Proraso.</li>
            <li> First of all, calling Cella a &amp;#34;Shaving Creme&amp;#34; is misleading--although it is soft, it is definitely a soap.  </li>
            <li> I tried this \\&quot;cream\\&quot; (hard as a soap) hoping this would be my new favorite.</li>
            <li> Otherwise I have only positive things to say about this</li>
            <li> This is my go to shave soap I put hot water in the container fill the sink with warm water wet my face and brush shake water off brush poor water out of container and mix right up rinse out red container and face lather.</li>
            <li> Lathers up with a little bit of effort but very well worth it.</li>
            <li> , many people are complimenting the little red tub</li>
            <li> I just want to make that clear</li>
            <li> Does not irritate sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li> So far, I have used it for three or four shaves.  </li>
            <li> soft scent washes off when your done shaving</li>
            <li> This stuff goes toe to toe with Proraso and other fine Italian Soaps.  </li>
            <li> Not very slick.</li>
            <li> i have been using it every day for 8 or 9 months and the container is still half full</li>
            <li> Classic Italian tallow based shave soap with the marzipan scent.</li>
            <li> Last a long time and is totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone who likes trying out different creams and soaps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used TOBS (Sensitive Skin) and Proraso (red, green, and blue), and Cella seems to be better at noticeably softening my whiskers.</li>
            <li> The jar is to small to fit your brush in the build a lather.</li>
            <li> Great scent but very faint.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to traditional shaving, give this a shot, you will not regret it.</li>
            <li> Because of this it was a little hard to lather at first, but probably my favorite cream</li>
            <li> This cream tends to dry fast</li>
            <li> Easy to build thick lather.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t why people are gaga for this soap because it didn&#x27;t lather properly and was NOT slick.</li>
            <li> While many call it a soap it is actually a very hard cream.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your face dry and not feeling as clean as other products.</li>
            <li> So when I finally did use it I was still surprised by how well performing this product is.</li>
            <li> The Soap is very soft, you just need a little water on your brush and this soap will lather very well.  </li>
            <li> Does not dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> The AOS is clearly the most expensive.</li>
            <li> but if your new to shaving just take your time with it and be aware if you have hard water</li>
            <li> I know people who are the exact opposite tho ultimately it comes down to what works for you.</li>
            <li> It dries out faster on my face, it has less glide and more tack than my other soaps, and it doesn&#x27;t soften the hair as well as my other soaps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new not to wet shaves, but shaving with a safety razor.  </li>
            <li> My first shaving soap so hard to determine the quality</li>
            <li> Not sure you could use this every day without the whole jar melting.  </li>
            <li> just start with slow circles, and increase speed slowly enough that large bubbles don&#x27;t form.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smells marzipan-y too (a positive for some and a negative for others, go figure).</li>
            <li> It is easy to generate a thick lather and my brush will hold enough for at least three passes.  </li>
            <li> To me, the Cella doesn&#x27;t have much of an odor, at least not one I pay attention to anymore.</li>
            <li> There is no need to wet the cream prior to loading your brush</li>
            <li> Reason why it&#x27;s been around a long time because it works.</li>
            <li> The lather is so rich, thick and slick...</li>
            <li> Then when you get enough courage look at some of the other ingredients.</li>
            <li> I alternate with other items just to give my nose some variety over time, but this stuff is always on the shelf as an option.  </li>
            <li> The slight down side is that the foam does not last as long as some other more expensive creams I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Kiss My Face, Art of Shaving, and newly rediscovered Van Der Hagen Luxury, not Deluxe or Select.</li>
            <li> Typical Italian almond scent.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is a little different.  </li>
            <li> Its just a little red tub guys come on.</li>
            <li> It is not as soft as a cream and not as hard as a soap.</li>
            <li> It is in between a hard and soft soap.</li>
            <li> Also it stinks like cheap washing powder.</li>
            <li> I actually look forward to shaving with this everyday.</li>
            <li> Heritage soap that needs to be in every wet shaver&#x27;s rotation.</li>
            <li> It also works well for face lathering, rub it over your stubble and use the wet brush on your face.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this for people just coming into wet shaving or veterans</li>
            <li> takes a little practice to get it right, but it is a ritual I can get behind.  </li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of it with your brush you will find that it lathers very well, leaving a thick protective slick layer of cream on your face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to like this soap, but it doesn&#x27;t perform as well as my other soaps with my merkur 180 or my muhle r41.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try other soaps, but I think I will keep with Cella.</li>
            <li> I just hope the folks at Cella  will forgive me for trying other brands.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I may try some other brands at some point just to keep testing waters, I&#x27;m content with this.</li>
            <li> Like other reviews have said, sort of smells like cherry and almonds.</li>
            <li> I like to mix a dallop of this with other soaps.  </li>
            <li> but this is so subtle that it&#x27;s barely there.  </li>
            <li> The only negative is the scent - the almond smell seems a bit off to me.</li>
            <li> not sickly sweet like marzipan.</li>
            <li> with a hit of cherry(very little).</li>
            <li> It turned very dark brown.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Scent: The smell of the cream isn&#x27;t bad but there are distinct cherry notes.</li>
            <li> Plus for all of this naturalness one 5.4 oz container lasts me 6 months (and I use it everyday).</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have trouble working up a lather -</li>
            <li> I also use Proraso green pre-shave, as well.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know how much I really  disliked using the Proraso till I started with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Slick and cushiony, the blade just glides across your face and you don&#x27;t even realize that the razor is working until you look down and see all the stubble in the sink.</li>
            <li> It provides very poor lubrication compared to proraso or taylor of old bond.</li>
            <li> Smells like cherries, can barely detect a faint almond smell in the background.  </li>
            <li> Some people have no trouble but for others it can be difficult, the soap does not like hard water.</li>
            <li> that I was rather anxious to get a bowl.</li>
            <li> small note</li>
            <li> However, tallow creates a wonderfully thick, creamy, and slick lather that also conditions the skin and locks in moisture.</li>
            <li> After three tries (all with the same results), I have to say that I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> Lots of lather even in hard water and the scent makes me want to taste it.</li>
            <li> Consistency is as a hard soap, so people looking for &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; style should look elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably stick with hard soap.</li>
            <li> (yeah, it&#x27;s hard).</li>
            <li> Unlike others who rave about the lather I can&#x27;t seem to get a thick creamy lather no matter how hard I try.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and creamy providing thickness for protection and slickness for comfort.</li>
            <li> but you have to do it slowly over time and not all at</li>
            <li> Cella whips up a creamy thick lather effortlessly.  </li>
            <li> The lather is thick, retains slickness and lasts quite a while.  </li>
            <li> From a practical point of view that seems to mean that you should use a stiffer brush with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very slick.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not good at describing smells, but it is a lighter smell, not like the &amp;#34;woods&amp;#34; type</li>
            <li> Although I do find it some what difficult to load up my brush with how small the tub is.</li>
            <li> is confused.</li>
            <li> The cream is very slick and the scent of cherry and almond almost makes you want to eat it !  </li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Terrible product, poor lather and poorer scent, in this case you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re thinking about trying this, just do it you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rank it with Van Der Hagen (which I like).</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I had heard so many good things about Cella Shaving Cream (aroma, lather, razor glide...) that I was rather anxious to get a bowl. After three tries (all with the same results), I have to say that I&#x27;m disappointed. The lather is close to non-existent unless you work the brush furiously and copiously around the bowl. This uses up more product than I&#x27;ve normally used in other bowl-contained creams. The shave itself was fair at best. The almond fragrance is pleasant, if fleeting.</li>
            <li> The smell of this soap is great, But the soap is kinda between a soft and a hard soap, When you load up your brush it will get chunks of the soap stuck in the bristles, it either needs to be softer or harder. The jar is to small to fit your brush in the build a lather. I would not buy this soap again.</li>
            <li> Do some research on just one of the ingredients in the shaving cream or gel you are now using. Then when you get enough courage look at some of the other ingredients. Why subject your face to a toxic cocktail every day when you can get coconut oil, tallow, stearic acid, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium carbonate and a great almond scent? Plus for all of this naturalness one 5.4 oz container lasts me 6 months (and I use it everyday). It truly doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.</li>
            <li> I love every aspect of this shave soap. The scent, the price, the feel. I actually look forward to shaving with this everyday.</li>
            <li> Easy to build thick lather. Great scent but very faint.</li>
            <li> Actually this product seems more to be somewhere between a cream and a soap. It has a wonderful almond/marzipan like smell and when lathered in a bowl with a nice brush it creates a wonderful smelling and great performing foam that is slick and luxurious and, combined with your favorite razor, provides an excellent shaving experience. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes trying out different creams and soaps. This will be definitely be a regular part of my rotation.</li>
            <li> I have been using Cella for a few months and think it&#x27;s amazing. If you know a wet shaver this is one of the best gifts you can give.</li>
            <li> Have had a couple shaves since finding Cella under the tree.  While many call it a soap it is actually a very hard cream.  There is no need to wet the cream prior to loading your brush but it does take longer to load than a simple dip like you would do with a softer cream.  It is easy to generate a thick lather and my brush will hold enough for at least three passes.  The almond scent is subtle and pleasant.  Face/beard lubrication was great with no nicks or raw regions.  Final rinse removed the residual easily without that chemically feel I sometimes get with Proraso.    This will stay high on my list of \\&quot;bang for the buck\\&quot; creams along with Taylor of Old Bond Street Avocado.</li>
            <li> Classic Italian tallow based shave soap with the marzipan scent. Once you get the hang of it with your brush you will find that it lathers very well, leaving a thick protective slick layer of cream on your face. Provides good cushion and good glide, the tallow based soap leaves your face feeling protected and soft.</li>
            <li> Wonderful stuff. Slick and cushiony, the blade just glides across your face and you don&#x27;t even realize that the razor is working until you look down and see all the stubble in the sink. With a double edge razor, your face winds up feeling smooth and soft, and most of the time using a aftershave balm after a shave with this soap is a luxury, not a necessity (use one anyway, your face will thank you).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to like this soap, but it doesn&#x27;t perform as well as my other soaps with my merkur 180 or my muhle r41.  It dries out faster on my face, it has less glide and more tack than my other soaps, and it doesn&#x27;t soften the hair as well as my other soaps. The smell is very comparable to almond oil. I didn&#x27;t have trouble working up a lather - just start with slow circles, and increase speed slowly enough that large bubbles don&#x27;t form. As far as soaps go, I prefer proraso green tube, TOBS Jermyn st, and Van der Hagen deluxe soaps. I&#x27;ve found them to compliment the noted razors with Gillette Silver Blue blades nicely. I also use Proraso green pre-shave, as well. It&#x27;s a nice soap, it just isn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
            <li> Very impressed with this cream. Lots of lather even in hard water and the scent makes me want to taste it. Lots of protection, this is right up there with Tabac in my book!</li>
            <li> Very good product.  provides a good rich lather.  Not the thickest I have created, but still very good.  It has a great almond smell.  Not over powerful and natural.  I enjoy having it in the shave cream rotation.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. What more could you ask for? Traditional Italian quality. Lathers up with a little bit of effort but very well worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice shaving soap-not really a cream.  Works very well and is recommended.  Reasonably price also!  Good scent and gives a nicely lubricated shave.  There are others I like more-but I do like this soap.</li>
            <li> If I could eat this stuff, I would.  Great almond scent, and the lather is like whipped cream.  I could easily be happy shaving the rest of my life with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Really is a hard cream and more difficult to lather than creams like Taylor of Bond Street but works great.  Try using dis tilled water and this really makes a great lather.  Reason why it&#x27;s been around a long time because it works.</li>
            <li> This is a great shave \\&quot;soap\\&quot;. It is not as soft as a cream and not as hard as a soap. Some people have termed it \\&quot;croap\\&quot;. Has an amazing scent of Italian amaretto. Great price also. One of the best shave products out there.</li>
            <li> I would say this product is top notch. you need a good boar brush to lather it up. I tried with my silver tip but my boar works better with it. the scent is very light. I would say like a light almond oil. with a hit of cherry(very little).</li>
            <li> I love this!! it&#x27;s like shaving with a pillow! feels phenomenal!</li>
            <li> Decent soap but I traded it on the forums because the scent just was&#x27;nt for me.</li>
            <li> Smells really amazing!</li>
            <li> Great product, very reasonably priced, smells great, I almost want to eat it. Lathers up very easily and forms a thick, smooth lather. Does not dry out your skin. Does not irritate sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li> This stuff is outstanding. Great smell, slickness and cushion. This is easily in my top five for shave soaps and a staple in my arsenal of soaps!</li>
            <li> I had read some good reviews regarding Cella shaving soap.  I ordered from Amazon and received it two days later.  I love the product.  Soap has a nice aroma and shaves very well.  I had researched several different soaps and had decided I wanted to try this.  I use 10 different soaps on a rotating basis and this one fit very nicely into the rotation.  I am fairly new to wet shaving but love this product.  It is one of the better soaps IMO.</li>
            <li> Wonderful lather-ability, great protection. Love it. This product definitely stays in my rotation.</li>
            <li> I must say this stuff is some of the best Shave Soap out there.  The Soap is very soft, you just need a little water on your brush and this soap will lather very well.  This stuff goes toe to toe with Proraso and other fine Italian Soaps.  One great thing, is you can buy the 1Kg block of Cella and have extra to give to friends or just to last a long time.  The smell is light almond and really isn&#x27;t overpowering by any means.  It really softens the beard hairs and makes shaving very pleasurable.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason why this soap carries the \\&quot;Cella is Bella\\&quot; slogan.  This is my first experience with shaving soap and I&#x27;m glad that I started off with it.  I swish my brush around about a hundred times in it and then lather it up.  I love the smell, love how it goes on, and how it works.  I&#x27;ll try other soaps, but I think I will keep with Cella.</li>
            <li> The Plastic bowl leaves much to be desired, and I&#x27;m not completely taken by the almond smell, but the shaving cream performs beautifully.</li>
            <li> Creamy rich lather, I like it.  Fragrance is a little different.  Works great with Simpson chubby 2</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  Smells like Dr. Pepper and provides great cushion and a comfortable slickness that makes shaving enjoyable.  Of course, the price is good too compared to other high-quality soaps.</li>
            <li> This one is definitely a &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; and not a soap.  From a practical point of view that seems to mean that you should use a stiffer brush with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On your face it means that it actually makes your skin feel good after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I don&#x27;t find that it provides as much lather or protection as say Proraso does, though it is decent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells marzipan-y too (a positive for some and a negative for others, go figure).</li>
            <li> A fantastic sweet almond &amp; cherry scent and easy to lather. Very good cushion, slickness and protection. A fantastic value.</li>
            <li> I like this product. It lathers up well and helps me get a smooth, close shave. The only negative is the scent - the almond smell seems a bit off to me. All in all, I like it but will probably try something else for my next buy.</li>
            <li> Smells like almond and cherries yummy. Not very slick.</li>
            <li> Do not like this product. It is hard to work into a good lather and it smells like piss. It leaves your face dry and not feeling as clean as other products. If you are trying to find a good inexpensive soap look at Taylor of old bond street</li>
            <li> Easiest creme to lather in my experience.  Gave me a beautiful 3 pass with a badger brush.  Loved it.  Smooth.  BBS.&lt;br /&gt;Smells so nice--cherry almond.&lt;br /&gt;Lady digs, so I dig.</li>
            <li> Cella is a great shaving soap. The scent is a pronounced almond with a hint of cherry to it. It is tallow based, which is somewhat rare in a mass produced shaving soap. However, tallow creates a wonderfully thick, creamy, and slick lather that also conditions the skin and locks in moisture. Some do report a bit of a burn with this, but I did not have an issue. I am guessing that has to do with the fragrance oils used. My only real complaints is the shape of the container makes it had to really load up a brush.</li>
            <li> Fantastic smell and nice lather.</li>
            <li> Good price, great shaving cream/soap! Thrilled with this Italian classic! Lathers well with a brush (&amp; bowl). Pleasant scent. One of my favorites.</li>
            <li> Fantastic scent. Slick, great cushion. Heritage soap that needs to be in every wet shaver&#x27;s rotation.</li>
            <li> I am choosing 5 stars partly because of the price. It is cheap, and well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Smell - I personally like the smell of this quite a bit. I&#x27;m not good at describing smells, but it is a lighter smell, not like the &amp;#34;woods&amp;#34; type smells.&lt;br /&gt;*Price - it is very cheap and it lasts a long time. It is definitely something to consider if you are looking for a different cream and do not want to spend a lot of money.&lt;br /&gt;*Foam - this cream foams up very quick and easy. The slight down side is that the foam does not last as long as some other more expensive creams I&#x27;ve used. It easily lasts to get the job done, but if you are super slow, you might need to whip it up again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a great cream at a great price.</li>
            <li> Great soap great smell MUST BUY</li>
            <li> Smells great, works well.</li>
            <li> Very nice...it&#x27;s a pleasure to use</li>
            <li> Nice smooth shave.  Scent dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> This is the first shave cream I&#x27;ve ever bought, it smells excellent and lathers up nicely.  I just hope the folks at Cella  will forgive me for trying other brands.</li>
            <li> This may be my favorite shave soap of all that I have tried. If you like amaretto/marzipan, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> great soft soap; rich, smooth and lubricating; nice marzipan (cherry almond) fragrance; great price point too.  performance is excellent... leaves your skin soft.  it&#x27;s my daily bread (when it comes to shaving soap) although there I have others, but with different fragrances and prices.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. The scent is awesome and provides a great lather. If you&#x27;re thinking about trying this, just do it you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magnificent.  I&#x27;m a client for life...if you&#x27;ve never shave with a bristle brush and shave soap, you owe it to yourself to try it.  takes a little practice to get it right, but it is a ritual I can get behind.  Very pleased!!</li>
            <li> Terrible product, poor lather and poorer scent, in this case you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used Cella shaving cream.  So far, I have used it for three or four shaves.  It lathers well and provides a nice shave.  However, almond is not my favorite scent.</li>
            <li> Great product, easy to lather, excellent protection. Great scent. This is one of my favorite croaps. If you are just starting out this is a good choice, due to the fact that it lathers easily.</li>
            <li> Yuck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almond smell.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaving cream, I&#x27;d give a 4.5 out of 5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lather: With my badger brush the it is very easy to load the creme onto the brush. This cream works easily into a thick rich lather it doesn&#x27;t matter if your lathering straight on your face or in a mug/bowl. The lather is nice slick giving my razor a nice glide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent: The smell of the cream isn&#x27;t bad but there are distinct cherry notes. If your into that scent your going to love this creme. I am indifferent to scent and that is where this creme looses a mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Value: It&#x27;s a great deal for the quality, I paid 11.50 for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used TOBS (Sensitive Skin) and Proraso (red, green, and blue), and Cella seems to be better at noticeably softening my whiskers. It lathers very easily and the almond scent is nice too, makes me think of maraschino cherries.</li>
            <li> Gave a good lather, did the job.</li>
            <li> There are better scented shave soaps, better packaged and more expensive, but none better in use. It&#x27;s thick and creamy providing thickness for protection and slickness for comfort. It&#x27;s a soft soap cream, which makes it easy to load up with even a soft brush. The scent is pure almond - marzipan, and it does get cloying after a while, but the scent and the creaminess remind you of a creamy dessert instead of a shave soap.&lt;br /&gt;This shave soap will spoil you. I&#x27;ve tried dozens of shave soaps and this is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> First of all, calling Cella a &amp;#34;Shaving Creme&amp;#34; is misleading--although it is soft, it is definitely a soap.  That said, it is my favorite. It consistently makes great lather, sometimes a bit thin but always does a good job at lubricating the razor. The smell is incredible, an almond scent but not sickly sweet like marzipan. It&#x27;s a rich, slightly bitter almond scent. Nothing else smells like it.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, but use it like a shave soap.  Load your brush from the red container and lather up in a mug.  It also works well for face lathering, rub it over your stubble and use the wet brush on your face.  The Brush will have enough soap from the face lather for 3 passes easily.    this is one of my top 5 favorite shave soaps easily, just behind Mama Bear and Trumpers Coconut.</li>
            <li> smells great. good price. my go to cream</li>
            <li> A fairly well known &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; in the shaving community. It&#x27;s a good &amp;#34;creme&amp;#34; but it can be hard to lather if you don&#x27;t show some patience with it. Some people have no trouble but for others it can be difficult, the soap does not like hard water. It&#x27;s a tallow based soap and while I enjoy it the stuff can be finicky with water. When it comes to tallow based soaps they are very sensitive to water. For each drop of water you add to it consider it 10. This &amp;#34;creme&amp;#34; is more of a soft soap as well, it needs a lot of back bone and if your using a badger haired brush you will have to spend some time loading it. I fully recommend a boar hair brush if you want to use this soap. It really benefits from the stiffness of a boar hair brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this soap but it takes some practice to get use to. Many soaps will work with just about anything, a little water or a lot they typically do not mind either way. Tallow soaps however are not that way, I&#x27;ve always liked my soaps on the wetter side then most people it&#x27;s just what works with me. I know people who are the exact opposite tho ultimately it comes down to what works for you. This soap is very sensitive to water tho and I know I&#x27;m repeating myself I just want to make that clear because if you try and lather this up with a lot of water in your brush you will not get any type of lather. You can add water to it as you build the lather but you have to do it slowly over time and not all at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoy this soap but if your new to shaving just take your time with it and be aware if you have hard water you may have some difficulty with the soap. However if you do work with it and give it a chance I&#x27;m positive you will enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Nice foam and smell. Last a long time and is totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> High quality shaving soap , the almond scent is a tad strong but it goes away after shaving ,lathers up nicely and  this jar will last you a very very long time , been using it for a few weeks now and barely made a dent on it</li>
            <li> I started wet shaving about a year ago and went through many shaving creams and shaving products. For some reason I actually put off buying Cella but the reviews for this product are not only excellent on Amazon but around the internet as well. So when I finally did use it I was still surprised by how well performing this product is. Even with minimal effort and a sup par brush I was able to get a soft, slick and cushioning light lather that smells amazing. I love this smell, to me its better then Truefitt and Hill 1805 which is one of the best shaving creams on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is excellent for a top notch product with a great performance and longevity I would recommend this for people just coming into wet shaving or veterans alike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One small note, many people are complimenting the little red tub it comes in. Its just a little red tub guys come on. That&#x27;s kinda like saying that the cereal box is great at holding cereal. Although I do find it some what difficult to load up my brush with how small the tub is. Otherwise I have only positive things to say about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So stop reading and ignore the absolutely asinine 1 to 2 star reviews and get this soap!</li>
            <li> Very nice razor not too aggressive for an open comb. I would recommend this razor even for a beginner.</li>
            <li> Nice cream / soap, good lather, it does dry rather fast.  I&#x27;m new not to wet shaves, but shaving with a safety razor.  So just starting out requires learning a new technique to be effective.  This cream tends to dry fast will i&#x27;m doing that so I have to reapply it.  I&#x27;m sure that when I get better with my technique this problem will go away.</li>
            <li> Great performance classic cherry almond scent</li>
            <li> Just received this soap, and shaved with it. The soap performes literally like regular hand soap. It smells like hand soap, lethers like hand soap, feels like hand soap. It doesn&#x27;t protect your skin like ,for instance, glycerin soap.  My face is burning . I didn&#x27;t feel any moisturizers in it. I still got that cheap soapy smell in my nose .I just feel right now like I threw 12 bucks in a window...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: the soap got spoiled. It turned very dark brown. Kind of molded or rotted. Also it stinks like cheap washing powder. I forgot to mention the jar is tiny...</li>
            <li> My first shaving soap so hard to determine the quality but the lather is definitely nice IMO</li>
            <li> smells great and helps me get a close shave</li>
            <li> Best smelling and lathering shave soap on the market!  I have used more than 40 different soaps and this one is definitely the most appreciated amongs experienced shavers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no expert when it comes to shaving. I&#x27;ve been DE shaving for about 4 months now. This is my second soap after I finally finished my Col Conk recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer this over the Conk. very smooth and slick. Easy to lather. I face lather in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again since it feels nice and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling tight and dry, but with so many other soaps to try it will be a while before I come around again.</li>
            <li> Has a light citrus &amp; rose scent. Performs well.</li>
            <li> Creamy and luxurious, the best shave ever!</li>
            <li> Good price on my brand</li>
            <li> I feel like i get a better shave with this stuff. Very awesome.</li>
            <li> very nice scent and mixture that goes on smooth, lathers well, and is not irritating, too invasive or overpowering. i have been using it every day for 8 or 9 months and the container is still half full so it is well worth the price, especially for the quality. i will buy it again.</li>
            <li> When I first started going back to basics to shave I went with Proraso. Honestly don&#x27;t remember why anymore. PRobably read somewhere that it was popular and the price was right. It was okay. I didn&#x27;t have too many complaints when I was using it, but when I finished the bowl I had I wanted to try something different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Cella. If nothing else, this bowl of soap is lasting longer than the Proraso, which I attribute partly to my increased skill in learning how to shave like this, but more to the fact that the Cella really lathers wonderfully with a small amount. To me, the Cella doesn&#x27;t have much of an odor, at least not one I pay attention to anymore. It&#x27;s nowhere near as strong as the Proraso. I&#x27;ve also found that this cleans nicer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I may try some other brands at some point just to keep testing waters, I&#x27;m content with this. Didn&#x27;t know how much I really  disliked using the Proraso till I started with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Smells very good. Nice n sweet and the shave is very smooth. Lathers up well with just a tiny dime - sized dollop. Seriously, this stuff smells amazing. And the odor after you shave is quite mild so don&#x27;t worry if you are someone who prefers very mild smelling creams. This one container should you quite a while too so the price is reasonable. Again, love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is the best hands down. Great luxurious lather f my husbands face AND for my legs!! Love the almond aroma</li>
            <li> for razor burn this is one of the best products I have ever tried.  Having said that, I think the soap version is a bit better but it does not melt easily on skin</li>
            <li> Good lather.  Very slick.  Smells good.  Check it out.  Nothing to lose.</li>
            <li> Good buy, great cream.. Thanks</li>
            <li> Great stuff and not very expensive.  The almond/marzipan scent is a little strong (but still delicious) when sniffed directly out of the pot, but moderates nicely once you add water and start lathering.  I alternate with other items just to give my nose some variety over time, but this stuff is always on the shelf as an option.  It lathers very well, too.  The size and bowl also travels easily.  For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> While my favorite shave soap is Arko; Cella is one of only three shave soaps that I use (Arko, Cella, MWF).  Great scent and lathers up just dandy.  Good shave too!</li>
            <li> This is some great shaving creme. It ranks up their with Tabac, and other great tallow based Shaving creme soaps.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s in a nice bowl that&#x27;s great for traveling, has a fantastic almond smell, and does not leave your face oily or caked with residue unlike other shaving soaps/gels/creams. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Everybody should own a tub of Cella! This had a great smell, But oh the lather!  Cella whips up a creamy thick lather effortlessly.  If you&#x27;re new to traditional shaving, give this a shot, you will not regret it. This leaves your skin feeling conditioned after the shave.</li>
            <li> This is a best buy for all you fellas.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful shaving cream!  It creates a nice lather, and the smell is subtle but wonderful.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a new shave cream.</li>
            <li> Cella has earned a good reputation and by my using it, I now will pass its reputation on to another fortunate user.&lt;br /&gt;The soft scent washes off when your done shaving and I&#x27;ve no skin reactions to date from this creme.</li>
            <li> Makes a nice lather and the scent is not over powering, Does a very nice job and i will buy again</li>
            <li> This is my go to shave soap I put hot water in the container fill the sink with warm water wet my face and brush shake water off brush poor water out of container and mix right up rinse out red container and face lather. I have tried many other soap&#x27;s proroso tobs Mitchells wool fat and many others this is by far my favorite. The lather is a 8 out of 10 the scent is 8 out of 10 very light and not very overpowering classic almond scent the slickness is 9 out of 10 my blade glides very smooth the protection is 10 out of 10 I get the fewest nicks and weepers with this soap. It is in between a hard and soft soap. I highly recommend to give this a try if you haven&#x27;t everyone&#x27;s face and skin are different and works very week for me and the price is very good and one jar has lasted me a year. I use a best badger brush Gillette fat boy with persona med prep blades.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I decided to purchase.  Unlike others who rave about the lather I can&#x27;t seem to get a thick creamy lather no matter how hard I try.  I love the smell of marzipan but this is so subtle that it&#x27;s barely there.  So, it&#x27;s ok.  I doubt that I&#x27;ll order it again.  Time to go back to TOBS almond, that stuff rocks!</li>
            <li> Works well.  Easy to lather.  Smells like cherries, can barely detect a faint almond smell in the background.  I&#x27;m not in love with the fragrance, but it is a top performer and a good value for the price.</li>
            <li> What can I say? But it&#x27;s cella! Since 1899 works great and smells like marzipan.</li>
            <li> Close and comfortable shave</li>
            <li> This is some of the finest shaving soap you will use.  It works great by itself and in combination with another soap or cream.  Get some.</li>
            <li> Awesome soap, a lot better than the proraso green tub.  Really slick and provides great cushion.</li>
            <li> By now I must have tried about 2 dozen shaving creams, soaps and even a stick. I&#x27;ve tried all the big names including T&amp;H, Trumper, TOOBS, AOS, etc... When it comes to my face literally price was no object. I tried this \\&quot;cream\\&quot; (hard as a soap) hoping this would be my new favorite. It ain&#x27;t. First, it smells like cheap marzipan - didn&#x27;t like it. Next, it may be the last of the beef tallow products - it just sounds yucky. But most importantly it doesn&#x27;t work as well as most others in terms of glide, and cushioning, and closeness, ease of lathering and how it leaves your face afterwards - just not as conditioned. I have 3 I rate at the top of the best:Kiss My Face, Art of Shaving, and newly rediscovered Van Der Hagen Luxury, not Deluxe or Select. The AOS is clearly the most expensive. The VDH is 4.95 for a soap puck. The KMF can be had cheaply if you buy it in quantity here on Amazon. If I had to name just one - I would have to say the KMF in Lime.</li>
            <li> Within the wetshaving community Cella is a consistently popular item that represents some of the better aspects of the Italian soft soaps. The scent of Cella is a pleasant amaretto, but it is subtle enough that it won&#x27;t clash with any post shave products one would want to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I&#x27;d say Italian soaps are known for is easy to produce lather that is of high quality. Slickness, thickness, support, all of these will be at the forefront with Cella. I recommend using an omega boar brush and face lathering this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While more expensive than most canned aerosol creams, 150 grams of Cella will last a great deal longer, whilst the luxury and performance pays for itself in user enjoyment.</li>
            <li> Love the almond scent.  Very mild.  Produces a good slick lather.  Does better with a stiff brush, but ok with badger also.</li>
            <li> A real great smelling (Almond Smell) shaving soap that really protects your face, It works up to nice thick lather which keeps your whiskers standing at attention so you get a nice close shave. I think I found a keeper.</li>
            <li> This is pretty darn good stuff but not 5 stars.  It has a light smell and gives a good shave but not as good as &amp;#34;the others&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Fine product, but not in my top 10.  Honestly I was expecting a little more from this given the many fine reviews.  I found that it gives a good shave and lathers well but neither the performance nor the aroma is good enough to make a place in my regular rotation.  Consistency is as a hard soap, so people looking for &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; style should look elsewhere.  (This was a plus for me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very solid performer but not worth the effort given some of the other great alternatives.  I&#x27;d rank it with Van Der Hagen (which I like).</li>
            <li> The cream is very slick and the scent of cherry and almond almost makes you want to eat it !  It gives a great shave with nice post shave qualities.</li>
            <li> Beautiful rich lather with a subtle almond scent. What more could I ask for?</li>
            <li> This product arrived on time specified. What a terrific smelling and lathering soap. And the razor just glides across your face. I use this soap for those special shaves</li>
            <li> Shaves good, smells a bit girly.  Also it tends to stay slimy on top even if you leave the lid cracked.  Not sure you could use this every day without the whole jar melting.  I&#x27;ll probably stick with hard soap.</li>
            <li> This is a soap that always works great every time you use it. If you&#x27;ve tried different soaps and want just a good fresh soap that lathers easy and gives you protecting, you can grab this one. It&#x27;s a performer. Always has been and always will.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;The legendary soap&amp;#34; &amp;#34;The classic soap&amp;#34; &amp;#34;The timeless tallow soap&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whoever calls this stuff class or legendary or timeless is confused. It provides very poor lubrication compared to proraso or taylor of old bond. It does not even smell strongly enough to last through a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will not order again. Will not even use it up. The little plastic case is kind of neat. That is one nice thing about this</li>
            <li> Excellent slickness, great price. Like other reviews have said, sort of smells like cherry and almonds. I didn&#x27;t like it at first but I got used to it. Also lathers very easily.</li>
            <li> This has quickly become my favorite shaving creme.  Love the scent....almond with a hint of cherry (I think!).  It&#x27;s very easy to load on my brush and just as easy to build into a lather.  The lather is thick, retains slickness and lasts quite a while.  I use make three passes with a DE safety razor and am quite impressed with how the lather holds up through the last pass.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorites to use, the creamy foam is rich and I just love the almond scent it gives off.</li>
            <li> Slickest, smoothest shave soap I have used.  Fantastic lather and great scent (very light sweet almond).  I have a new favorite shave soap.</li>
            <li> A solid soap but I haven&#x27;t had as much success getting a good lather as some of the other soaps I have; perhaps my technique just doesn&#x27;t work as well with this soap.</li>
            <li> FYI this is NOT a CREAM, it&#x27;s a soap (yeah, it&#x27;s hard). It smells like Marzipan and honestly Anything from Kiss My Face is MUCH MUCH better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t why people are gaga for this soap because it didn&#x27;t lather properly and was NOT slick. Honestly, it is OK at best. I prefer Prosaro over this (I don&#x27;t like Prosaro all that much).</li>
            <li> Great lather, slickness and cushion. Typical Italian almond scent.</li>
            <li> Love it. Cant beat the almond/cherry smell. Shave is great and smooth!</li>
            <li> This product ranks can&#x27;t compare with Truefitt &amp; Hill and Trumper.  The cream performs well and lathers well and is fgood fro the summer.  Not a fan of the almond smell.</li>
            <li> Makes a wonderful lather and smooth shaving.  The fragrance smells awesome also.  I like to mix a dallop of this with other soaps.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Lathers up very quickly to a smooth consistency and excellent smell, though it is a softer smell (almond or cherry) that may not be everyone&#x27;s favorite. I have used it for a few weeks now with excellent results; shaves that are both quick and smooth.</li>
            <li> I was in Merz Apothecary in Chicago for another item and saw Cella Shaving Soap on the shelf. Merz is the brick-and-mortar for Smallflower. I had read good reviews about Cella so I picked some up. It was only $8.00 plus tax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap gave a great shave. It lathered immediately and richly. My results were perfect. No nicks and a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cella will now be a permanent part of my rotation. The lather, the almond scent, the ease of application, the slickness and, of course, the shave itself. 5 stars all the way.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaving soap</li>
            <li> This cream is a &amp;#34;hard cream&amp;#34; which I&#x27;m not used to. Because of this it was a little hard to lather at first, but probably my favorite cream after I figured it out. I love the almond scent.</li>
            <li> Works good.  Very mild scent.  Personally I like the creams like Proraso or TOBS.</li>
            <li> When I use this soap it brings me back to when I was a kid and my mother was making cookies at Christmas. As for performance the slip and cushion are top of the line. Try some, it&#x27;s a treat.</li>
            <li> This shave cream is incredible!!! I am adding this product to my quarterly shave basket. The lather is so rich, thick and slick... I used a Simpsons&#x27; DUKE #3 in Best Badger and my first experiences that i have had have been absolutely fantastic!!! Thank you to Cella or continuing to make such a fine product for us to enjoy!!!</li>
