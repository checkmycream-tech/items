            <li>It&#x27;s not aggresive, doesn&#x27;t provoque any allergie/reaction at all, and it&#x27;s outstandingly enduring, which I love the most.</li>

            <li>If u get i little money bit more, i could recomend Pure by Boss and Aqua de Gio By Giorgi Armani, wood and citric.</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s very, very light to the point of almost disappearing after only a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe I got knock-off, but I am wondering if it&#x27;s not an old, or out of date bottle...</li>
            <li>Antonio Banderas cologne has a way of making you &amp;#34;smell like a million bucks&amp;#34; without having to actually pay that much.</li>
            <li>reminds me of a lighter bvlgari with a unique heavy smell to it</li>

            <li> Without a doubt. By now I&#x27;ve tried ALL of Antonio&#x27;s EDT&#x27;s but Mediterraneo is my favorite. It is light but still strong enough to stand out. Very nice. Men don&#x27;t hesitate, women it&#x27;s the PERFECT fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this kind before and people love it!  Hard to find in stores anymore too, so I was happy to find it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Una delicia de perfume, aroma muy veraniego y masculino, me encanta como queda impregnado por horas en mi ropa. A las mujeres les fascina.</li>
            <li> I started using this cologne while I was living in Spain, about 6 years ago, and it became my partner ever since. I love it&#x27;s scent which matches perfectly my skin. It&#x27;s not aggresive, doesn&#x27;t provoque any allergie/reaction at all, and it&#x27;s outstandingly enduring, which I love the most.</li>
            <li> reminds me of a lighter bvlgari with a unique heavy smell to it</li>
            <li> Price good, deliveried on time, good package, smell good. I live in Venezuela, i am a office worker and believe me when say woman like it (the eau de Toilette). For exmaple, when i take the elevator i can see women face. If u get i little money bit more, i could recomend Pure by Boss and Aqua de Gio By Giorgi Armani, wood and citric. Saludos from Venezuela!!</li>
            <li> Excellent store. Everything was as expected with product and product deliver on time. Everything perfect buying from them and I would buy with them again.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s very good. I haven&#x27;t nothing to complain because it smells very good. Every body ask me where I bought it.</li>
            <li> Su aroma no perdura ni una hora,</li>
            <li> i rate it a five because it smells great and lasts, and to make it better it does not have a strong aroma.</li>

            <li> Thnaks, I received this 3 days ago</li>
            <li> Really like the fragrance, but after spraying it on my skin it&#x27;s very, very light to the point of almost disappearing after only a few minutes. (and yes - I do know how to wear cologne.) I don&#x27;t believe I got knock-off, but I am wondering if it&#x27;s not an old, or out of date bottle...</li>
            <li> Antonio Banderas cologne has a way of making you &amp;#34;smell like a million bucks&amp;#34; without having to actually pay that much.</li>
