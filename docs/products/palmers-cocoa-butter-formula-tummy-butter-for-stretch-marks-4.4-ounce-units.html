            <li>The Palmers Cocoa Butter for stretch marks is absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>and it was successful.</li>

            <li>Amazon&#x27;s recommendation is very good, very good product, I very like to use it, it brings me a very good enjoyment</li>
            <li>Besides, it smells good.</li>
            <li>Initially I loved it.</li>
            <li>I was told by a friend that she loved this product</li>
            <li>Might be good for ocassional moisturizing but</li>
            <li>I loved the product.</li>
            <li>I loved the product.</li>
            <li>Loved this during my pregnancy and afterward</li>
            <li>This product is good.</li>
            <li>and she think it is good.</li>
            <li>Even after a good scrub shower, you can still feel the stuff in your skin.</li>
            <li>The price is really good.</li>
            <li>I chose this because coco butter is wonderful if your pregnant.</li>
            <li>This cream never ceases to amaze me, my friends, wife and sisters have used it and is really a good buy, as man is can recommend those husbands love their wives and want to see in them a beautiful figure even after pregnancy, and also as a man recommended them to those wives who want to look good, when they finish the pregnancyI can assure you that you will be satisfied with the results that you will get</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>worked great:-)</li>
            <li>I love this tummy butter!</li>
            <li>It has helped with itchiness for sure!</li>
            <li>At first the the product seemed great!</li>
            <li>It is amazing.  </li>
            <li>The relief it brought was amazing though.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been working amazing on my tummy, to prevent the stretch marks on my pregnancy</li>
            <li>While this cream may be effective at preventing and/or minimizing stretch marks, I cannot use it because it makes my skin feel like it is coated with oil.  </li>
            <li>and they faded nicely.</li>
            <li>But even if you do develop stretch marks, this stuff keeps your skin feeling so hydrated that it won&#x27;t hurt or feel itchy, which is really nice.    </li>
            <li>I really think it helps and the smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I purchased some onon my own.</li>
            <li>and I liked these, but</li>
            <li>I liked the product.</li>
            <li>It felt kind of oily, but that made me feel like it lasted and didn&#x27;t go away.</li>
            <li>good cream, strong hydrating properties</li>
            <li>:)  Not to mention a fantastic price point!!  </li>
            <li>I love cocoa butter during my pregnancies, and when I found this, I was thrilled.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice and the texture is OK.</li>
            <li>, it makes me more confident and makes me feel more refreshen!</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!  </li>
            <li>Great product,I used it on my first pregnancy</li>
            <li>This belly butter has kind of a strong scent</li>
            <li>I know that stretch marks are mostly genetic</li>
            <li>but I do believe that how hydrated you keep your body and skin does help with recovery and making your skin more able to handle the growing of pregnancy.</li>
            <li>and I thought \\&quot;Okay, maybe it was the combo of the Palmers and my over-the-belly pants that created the itchy rashy maddness\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Best thing I recommend is to apply regular lotion, wait about 5 minutes and then apply the butter - it seems to absorb much better and faster.</li>
            <li>I love cocoa ，</li>
            <li>I applied a lot more of it than I did when I started using it.</li>
            <li>sure if it works for the stretch marks, because I had to stop using it</li>
            <li>I bought it anyway, as I typically am okay with most lotions and beauty products.</li>
            <li>I went with a Burt&#x27;s Bees tummy butter and love it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who asks :)</li>
            <li>Hope someone else has better luck than I do...</li>
            <li>This was an okay butter.</li>
            <li>I just read that eating 2 avocados a week can aid in moisture delivered to the skin as well as having many benefits for baby.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>Also use post baby as you tummy shrinks to keep it moisturized and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>Nice light scent and texture....</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>no stretch marks after gaining  40lbs love it</li>
            <li>Love love love this product.</li>
            <li>Although I love the smell of the products, not recommended by me.  </li>
            <li>and they prescribed an oitment ok&#x27;d for me.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell, texture &amp; I&#x27;m glad I haven&#x27;t broke out from this like a lot of reviews I&#x27;ve read on it had.</li>
            <li>and it does work better that work.</li>
            <li>My favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>I have used many products from Palmer&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>My practitioner recommended trying a product with fewer, more pronounce-able ingredients.</li>
            <li>I use on my face and neck, love it</li>
            <li>I love the Palmers Cocoa Butter lotion, so thought I would give this a try.  </li>
            <li>there is no way this product is safe.  </li>
            <li>Stretch marks mostly has to do with genetics.</li>
            <li>I also use Burts Bees Tummy Butter, Palmers Stretch mark balm and coconut oil &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I love the Palmer&#x27; s Cocoa butter lotion.</li>
            <li>I have tried many things for stretch marks and this one product did the trick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update this when I&#x27;m done for sure.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also making sure</li>
            <li>it goes on smooth and you don&#x27;t need all that much.smells nice too.</li>
            <li>I applied the tummy butter and then put baby oil on top...</li>
            <li>I FELT THE NEED TO SCRATCH AND TRY MANY ITEMS UNTIL I SEEN THIS ONE ON AMAZON, I GAVE IT A SHOT AND</li>
            <li>MY SKIN LOOKED HEALTHY AND</li>
            <li>AND YOU WILL BE PLEASED;}.</li>
            <li>I think it smells good, but it is kind of a strong smell at first</li>
            <li>I am terrified of getting stretch marks and so far so good!  </li>
            <li>so far so good!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice product to have, it isn&#x27;t a miracle cream or anything special.  </li>
            <li>For the first two days I loved it.</li>
            <li>Works well -- doesn&#x27;t feel pleasant on at first -- but seems to relieve the itching associated with pregnant skin stretching.</li>
            <li>I love it！It is not expansive but useful!</li>
            <li>Several women who experienced this also tried the Organic version of this product and reported it was much better.</li>
            <li>I loved this for my first pregnancy and gave it as gifts to pregnant friends.</li>
            <li>Amazing, it really works!</li>
            <li>It was pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend - very good, high quality product!</li>
            <li>This is the best thing for a dry and itchy pregnant tummy.  </li>
            <li>I really love this cream for my wife&#x27;s pregnant tummy.  </li>
            <li>This product is a MUST for any pregnant lady!</li>
            <li>If you are pregnant, this stuff is your go to!</li>
            <li>I noticed a huge difference since then.</li>
            <li>My daughter is in the last trimester and ran out, so she asked for another package of this great product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll be honest, during my two pregnancies, I didn&#x27;t watch my weight and workout as much as I should have.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect such a great results.</li>
            <li>I think this does feel thicker and more absorbed by the skin than the lotion.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product!!!</li>
            <li>This is very useful for me.</li>
            <li>This is very useful for me.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve lost the baby weight and some, my skin is beautiful, firm and healthy looking like pre-baby.</li>
            <li>Absorbs fairly quickly, but has a strong smell.</li>
            <li>When I first started using it, I would rub the top of it and then rub my belly.</li>
            <li>it！It is not expansive but useful!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad amazon had it because I couldn&#x27;t find it in Walmart stores ;)</li>
            <li>I bought this product for stretch marks originally.</li>
            <li>It is nice and thick, lasts for hours before I reapply, AND smells great.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells great, and lasts a while for what&#x27;s in the tiny tub… However, new users and people who have been using for a while - beware… Many moms to be are getting rashes from this butter.</li>
            <li>The texture is rich and nice, the scent is soft and nurturing, and it leaves the belly feeling relaxed and pampered.</li>
            <li>More than anything, I just flat out feel better &amp; that is worth way more to me than cosmetic appearance.  </li>
            <li>This stuff smells amazing and makes you so soft.</li>
            <li>I was very liberal with the amount I applied, making sure my belly and hips were liberally coated.</li>
            <li>I have since learned that getting stretch marks is more determined by genetics and how much your skin can stand to stretch.</li>
            <li>I ended up throwing away 3 full containers of it because I had bought the 3 pack.</li>
            <li>Even if it does not change anything for my skin it still is a very nice product and can be used on rough spots on elbows or feet too.</li>
            <li>I started using this product from day 1 when I found out I was pregnant.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my pregnant wife to prevent stretch marks</li>
            <li>When I was 20 weeks pregnant, I started noticing stretch marks on my belly, so I went and bought this.</li>
            <li>I am about 5 months pregnant.  </li>
            <li>I was pregnant; I believe in prevention.</li>
            <li>A friend of mine purchased this for me as a gift when she learned that I was pregnant.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to ALL off my pregnant friends.  </li>
            <li>So now I&#x27;m pregnant with baby #2</li>
            <li>My wife loves this product, she goes through this stuff rather quickly</li>
            <li>Super yummy smell too.</li>
            <li>14 weeks pregnant and been using it since I found I was pregnant.</li>
            <li>So when I found out I was pregnant, I didn&#x27;t hesitate to buy this product and use it all over my body.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten in contact with my OB and they have me on cortizone cream and benadryl at night time, but being 7 months pregnant</li>
            <li>I will say this, the feel of this butter is SUPER greasy and grainy.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any problems using Plamers cocoa butter lotion while pregnant until now.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any new stretch marks since I&#x27;ve been pregnant so far so good.</li>
            <li>This cream was recommended in a magazine I read, but it caused my whole belly to rash!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised so many people swear by this stuff.</li>
            <li>Good quality, it was as we expected and we can recommend it.</li>
            <li>It will stain your clothes from the oils, so I wore a tank top directly over it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth using.  </li>
            <li>but it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>It takes a while to apply correctly, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I got this when stretch marks started to show on my belly 6 years ago when I was pregnant with my first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product since first finding out I was pregnant.  </li>
            <li>I started applying this right when I found out</li>
            <li>right after you get out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only 6 months pregnant and my stretch marks didn&#x27;t show until I was 8 months with my firstborn, but I love the feeling this butter leaves.</li>
            <li>I used this product consistently when I was pregnant with y first child and it worked well to keep my tummy moisiturized and soothed.  </li>
            <li>Still using the stuff on my butt and hips until it runs out, but I could just use my good old cocoa butter and have only one product cluttering up my bathroom counter, not two.     </li>
            <li>Really helped to relieve my super itchy pregnancy skin on my belly.</li>
            <li>This stuff is super sticky and the stickiness doesn&#x27;t fade away much.</li>
            <li>My whole body feels itchy when pregnant</li>
            <li>But other than that I was very satisfied with the outcome.</li>
            <li>The tummy butter smells good, not overwhelming just a mild lavender and cocoa butter scent.</li>
            <li>exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>… pregnancy makes your skin EXTRA sensitive… you&#x27;re better off getting something hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin and bought the product because it&#x27;s paraben free and hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li>Funny</li>
            <li>it only caused this reaction on my breasts and not my belly, however I applied more to them then my belly, and</li>
            <li>I had hoped that I could beat genetics and get through my first pregnancy without stretch marks, so I tried Tummy Butter.  </li>
            <li>It also acted as a great moisturizer for the stretching belly because it is so thick.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I was so pleased with how dramatically my stretch marks are fading that I let the rash heal and tried applying it ONCE a day instead of several, this is working for me</li>
            <li>i first put the cocoa butter for stretch marks on first</li>
            <li>I used this product for the first time on Christmas Eve morning and again on Christmas day-</li>
            <li>I apply the massage lotion first then the tummy butter after.</li>
            <li>Not a thin lotion!</li>
            <li>They each have said it&#x27;s very soothing!</li>
            <li>I see my stretch marks slowly going away and its great for my eczema.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for pregnant women and people who are just suffering from stretch marks because of fast growth or weight gain!</li>
            <li>Also, it is kind of fun to rub it on, since it is a little bit sticky.</li>
            <li>It was my first pregnancy and a did have one or two very faded stretch marks on my breast from puberty.</li>
            <li>the skin on my breasts is much more stretched out than my stomach.</li>
            <li>I am 6 months pregnant and have been using this twice a day since 5 weeks, and so far no stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I bought this body butter because the book \\&quot;What to expect when your expecting\\&quot; recommended it.. and the price was very decent.</li>
            <li>I love Tummy Butter, used it through out both of my pregnancies and never had a single stretch mark.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to apply a large quantity to feel the hydrating power of this product.</li>
            <li>I have large muscular quadriceps.  </li>
            <li>Normally I do not have sensitive skin, and have never had this kind of reaction from a skincare product.</li>
            <li>Currently 37 weeks pregnant with no stretch marks!</li>
            <li>Very good product, has been using it for past 2 months (went through half of the box) and apply on my pregnant belly and hips.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb into my skin very well, leaving an oily, greasy residue that lasts 12+ hours.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li>so I can slather it on as much as I want.</li>
            <li>We, as a family, really recommend this product.</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>very good，I like it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard people say that the tummy butter doesn&#x27;t really work for them</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>You can oil and lotion and grease yourself up as much as you want but if the stretch marks are coming, they won&#x27;t be stopped.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Behaves much like how you would expect cocoa butter to work.</li>
            <li>I used the tummy butter again for one day to see if it was really the tummy butter and the bumps and itchiness returned.</li>
            <li>and I noticed that the lavender smell really bothered me</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very oily...</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>really helps..</li>
            <li>Nothing much to write about here</li>
            <li>it really didn&#x27;t help my stretchmarks.</li>
            <li>I switched to Belly Balm sold at Whole Foods and have been much happier.</li>
            <li>It is very greasy but I like that it keeps my skin hydrated.</li>
            <li>Used this during pregnancy &amp; absolutely no stretch marks at all ...kept skin nice &amp; soft...</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t prevent my stretch marks, but I loved that the formula is thick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good moisturizer, but too thick.</li>
            <li>I loved this product when I first started using it - pleasant subtle scent, soaked into my skin quickly, left skin hydrated all day (I.E. no need to take over the handicapped stall at work to reapply half way through the day!).     </li>
            <li>I really love this product, I use it along with the cocao lotion for stretch marks just as suggested in other reviews.</li>
            <li>After a week I began to itch around the top of my breasts, but thought it was just due to my skin stretching.  </li>
            <li>I can see the skin on my belly is softer and more elastic, comparing to other parts and visibly healthier.</li>
            <li>Like many of the other reviewers on here, I used the Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter and broke out in a rash.</li>
            <li>I have DRY skin and am eight months pregnant but still have no stretch marks!</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, test it first and don’t buy the thee pack like I did</li>
            <li>but I am thankful I was able to avoid dark ones all over belly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That would be the only complaint I would have, but it makes the wife happy which makes my life just that much easier.</li>
            <li>and I did not get one new stretch mark!</li>
            <li>She used it during our previous child and she was pleased that she did not receive stretch marks.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently 6 months pregnant and haven&#x27;t had a stretch mark rear</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently 9 months pregnant (with no stretch marks) and have been using this butter for over 10 months.</li>
            <li>I used this when I was pregnant with my fourth child.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product to use when I was only five weeks pregnant.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this for my wife when she was 9 months pregnant - and after delivering our baby, she&#x27;s used this product daily.  </li>
            <li>Decent cocoa butter sent.</li>
            <li>This worked quickly on my stretch marks and they were fading after 2 days, but after a week&#x27;s use, i got rashes on all the places i applied it (arms and inner thighs).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost nine month pregnant and use Palmer&#x27;s twice a day all over my belly and back</li>
            <li>Im still dealing with the rash but its only been a day, im using the oitment (cortisteroid) sparingly as it does not have any results being tested on  pregnant women although the ER doc approved it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pregnant with my second baby.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a present for my friend when she told me she was pregnant.</li>
            <li>I am going to continue to use it, because I definitely think it is helping to keep my super moisturized.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m back for more on my second pregnancy.</li>
            <li>I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO EVERY PREGNANT WOMAN, I STARTED USING THIS PRODUCT IN MY SECOND TRIMESTER</li>
            <li>I usually put normal lotion on first and then use this on top of it as I read one of the ladies from the reviews did that</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>One more day, and I got little bumps all over the belly</li>
            <li>Although I had to wait for the package a little longer than normally (about 3 weeks), I love the product and the way they packed it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not from the normal stretching of skin during pregnancy because I am not even 6 weeks yet...</li>
            <li>so we&#x27;ll know for sure if it worked in a few months.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because I wanted a nice thick balm for my growing belly.</li>
            <li>I googled it and it seems many pregnant women have broken out in rashes as well from it.</li>
            <li>I came on here and read the other reviews and the people who got rashes sound just like mine.</li>
            <li>I am 6 months pregnant and do not have a single stretch mark yet, those on the breast I has start to fade after I have been using this product.</li>
            <li>Just know that if you have skin that is genetically not built to stretch and bounce back, there are most likely stretch marks in your future.</li>
            <li>I also recommend using your regular lotion first (if you NEVER use lotion-</li>
            <li>Pretty basic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why... maybe the skin there is more sensitive?</li>
            <li>By the next day it was a full blown rash all over my entire belly and on my breasts!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pregnant now but had very little stretch marks from my first pregnancy</li>
            <li>so my skin is not usually that sensitive, but this butter has shown me otherwise-</li>
            <li>I will be big during winter when dry skin is a huge issue.</li>
            <li>The consistency is very thick and it takes time to warm it up and soften it up in your hands</li>
            <li>If you have a sensitive skin like mine, I would suggest to steer clear from this product.</li>
            <li>My old marks didn&#x27;t re-stretch either.    </li>
            <li>I read all the reviews when I developed one after a MONTH of using it, and figured that couldn&#x27;t be it because these women had just used it twice and broke out… until I stopped using it for 4 days and switched to bio-oil</li>
            <li>My breasts were covered in stretch marks early in pregnancy</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t developed any stretch marks yet.  </li>
            <li>I would just bring the lotion into the restroom at work and apply it during the day frequently.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and doesn&#x27;t get itchy at night.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not fading my stretch marks as much as it was when I was applying it 3+ times daily.</li>
            <li>Well, my rash took two weeks to go away completely.</li>
            <li>If you tend to have sensitive skin, don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li>Stick to natural forms or buy natural cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>I was a fan of palmer&#x27;s tummy butter which they produced in 2010, for some reason this product has completely different smell, which I do not like so much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this in combination with the massage lotion as recommended and so far no stretch marks...</li>
            <li>It prevents stretch marks and it also gets rid of old scars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and it was a very irritable area in my 3rd trimester.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what you find off the shelf in store, without the hassle of finding which stores have it (more difficult than you&#x27;d think).</li>
            <li>went back to a more expensive product, but well worth it.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much it keeps your belly moisturizer for so long!</li>
            <li>Now, granted, nutrition actually plays a huge part in preventing stretch marks and if you are missing some things in your diet nothing is going to prevent stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I got this from the local Motherhood and loved it but thought it was rather difficult to use.</li>
            <li>recommend using this am and pm during the first trimester then am, mid-day and pm (at a minimum) for the second trimester and finally 5-8 times a day in the final trimester.</li>
            <li>However, this product has been great at lasting a long time and relieving the uncomfortable feeling of the stretching.</li>
            <li>Overall this product may be fine for some people, but if your skin has ever been the least bit sensitive, I would stick to organic!</li>
            <li>Palermo is very oily and long lasting.</li>
            <li>It took ten days to clear up</li>
            <li>When you start to itch from your belly growing so much just get a big slather of this on and massage into skin, for as long as it takes.  </li>
            <li>I also developed some itchy bumps when I applied it to areas where my skin was in close contact with my clothing, especially the elastic in my underwear.</li>
            <li>I found if I avoided those areas I had no trouble, but obviously it does have something in it that may irritate some women.     </li>
            <li>I definitely do not have \\&quot;Sensitive Skin\\&quot; by any means.</li>
            <li>AND I BARELY HAVE ANY STRETCHMARKS.</li>
            <li>Although you might want to apply it only when you have some time to let it dry off, because it really is \\&quot;butter\\&quot;, like grease.</li>
            <li>I was just exhausted and craving rich food!</li>
            <li>but the next day I was noticing small red bumps on my pregnant belly and was noticing an itch as well.</li>
            <li>It definitely moisturizes and stays in skin all day for at least 4 or 5 hours after applying before my skin ever gets itchy again and many other products I have tried barely last an hour or two before my sides and tummy are itching again.</li>
            <li>I figured the itchiness was due to normal skin-stretching</li>
            <li>About half way through my newly purchased jar, I started feeling small bumps on my right and left sides of my belly and they were itchy.</li>

            <li> Besides, it smells good.</li>
            <li> Initially I loved it.</li>
            <li> I was told by a friend that she loved this product</li>
            <li> Might be good for ocassional moisturizing but</li>
            <li> I loved the product.</li>
            <li> I loved the product.</li>
            <li> Loved this during my pregnancy and afterward</li>
            <li> This product is good.</li>
            <li> and she think it is good.</li>
            <li> Even after a good scrub shower, you can still feel the stuff in your skin.</li>
            <li> The price is really good.</li>

            <li> I love this tummy butter!</li>
            <li> It has helped with itchiness for sure!</li>
            <li> At first the the product seemed great!</li>
            <li> It is amazing.  </li>
            <li> The relief it brought was amazing though.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been working amazing on my tummy, to prevent the stretch marks on my pregnancy</li>
            <li> While this cream may be effective at preventing and/or minimizing stretch marks, I cannot use it because it makes my skin feel like it is coated with oil.  </li>
            <li> and they faded nicely.</li>
            <li> But even if you do develop stretch marks, this stuff keeps your skin feeling so hydrated that it won&#x27;t hurt or feel itchy, which is really nice.    </li>
            <li> I really think it helps and the smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I purchased some onon my own.</li>
            <li> and I liked these, but</li>
            <li> I liked the product.</li>
            <li> It felt kind of oily, but that made me feel like it lasted and didn&#x27;t go away.</li>
            <li> good cream, strong hydrating properties</li>
            <li> :)  Not to mention a fantastic price point!!  </li>
            <li> I love cocoa butter during my pregnancies, and when I found this, I was thrilled.  </li>
            <li> It smells nice and the texture is OK.</li>
            <li> , it makes me more confident and makes me feel more refreshen!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!  </li>
            <li> Great product,I used it on my first pregnancy</li>
            <li> This belly butter has kind of a strong scent</li>
            <li> I know that stretch marks are mostly genetic</li>
            <li> but I do believe that how hydrated you keep your body and skin does help with recovery and making your skin more able to handle the growing of pregnancy.</li>
            <li> and I thought \\&quot;Okay, maybe it was the combo of the Palmers and my over-the-belly pants that created the itchy rashy maddness\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Best thing I recommend is to apply regular lotion, wait about 5 minutes and then apply the butter - it seems to absorb much better and faster.</li>
            <li> I love cocoa ，</li>
            <li> I applied a lot more of it than I did when I started using it.</li>
            <li> sure if it works for the stretch marks, because I had to stop using it</li>
            <li> I bought it anyway, as I typically am okay with most lotions and beauty products.</li>
            <li> I went with a Burt&#x27;s Bees tummy butter and love it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who asks :)</li>
            <li> Hope someone else has better luck than I do...</li>
            <li> This was an okay butter.</li>
            <li> I just read that eating 2 avocados a week can aid in moisture delivered to the skin as well as having many benefits for baby.</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> Also use post baby as you tummy shrinks to keep it moisturized and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> Nice light scent and texture....</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> no stretch marks after gaining  40lbs love it</li>
            <li> Love love love this product.</li>
            <li> Although I love the smell of the products, not recommended by me.  </li>
            <li> and they prescribed an oitment ok&#x27;d for me.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell, texture &amp; I&#x27;m glad I haven&#x27;t broke out from this like a lot of reviews I&#x27;ve read on it had.</li>
            <li> and it does work better that work.</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion.</li>
            <li> I have used many products from Palmer&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> My practitioner recommended trying a product with fewer, more pronounce-able ingredients.</li>
            <li> I use on my face and neck, love it</li>
            <li> I love the Palmers Cocoa Butter lotion, so thought I would give this a try.  </li>
            <li> there is no way this product is safe.  </li>
            <li> Stretch marks mostly has to do with genetics.</li>
            <li> I also use Burts Bees Tummy Butter, Palmers Stretch mark balm and coconut oil &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I love the Palmer&#x27; s Cocoa butter lotion.</li>
            <li> I have tried many things for stretch marks and this one product did the trick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update this when I&#x27;m done for sure.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also making sure</li>
            <li> it goes on smooth and you don&#x27;t need all that much.smells nice too.</li>
            <li> I applied the tummy butter and then put baby oil on top...</li>
            <li> I FELT THE NEED TO SCRATCH AND TRY MANY ITEMS UNTIL I SEEN THIS ONE ON AMAZON, I GAVE IT A SHOT AND</li>
            <li> MY SKIN LOOKED HEALTHY AND</li>
            <li> AND YOU WILL BE PLEASED;}.</li>
            <li> I think it smells good, but it is kind of a strong smell at first</li>
            <li> I am terrified of getting stretch marks and so far so good!  </li>
            <li> so far so good!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice product to have, it isn&#x27;t a miracle cream or anything special.  </li>
            <li> For the first two days I loved it.</li>
            <li> Works well -- doesn&#x27;t feel pleasant on at first -- but seems to relieve the itching associated with pregnant skin stretching.</li>
            <li> I love it！It is not expansive but useful!</li>
            <li> Several women who experienced this also tried the Organic version of this product and reported it was much better.</li>
            <li> I loved this for my first pregnancy and gave it as gifts to pregnant friends.</li>
            <li> Amazing, it really works!</li>
            <li> It was pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend - very good, high quality product!</li>
            <li> This is the best thing for a dry and itchy pregnant tummy.  </li>
            <li> I really love this cream for my wife&#x27;s pregnant tummy.  </li>
            <li> This product is a MUST for any pregnant lady!</li>
            <li> If you are pregnant, this stuff is your go to!</li>
            <li> I noticed a huge difference since then.</li>
            <li> My daughter is in the last trimester and ran out, so she asked for another package of this great product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll be honest, during my two pregnancies, I didn&#x27;t watch my weight and workout as much as I should have.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect such a great results.</li>
            <li> I think this does feel thicker and more absorbed by the skin than the lotion.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product!!!</li>
            <li> This is very useful for me.</li>
            <li> This is very useful for me.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve lost the baby weight and some, my skin is beautiful, firm and healthy looking like pre-baby.</li>
            <li> Absorbs fairly quickly, but has a strong smell.</li>
            <li> When I first started using it, I would rub the top of it and then rub my belly.</li>
            <li> it！It is not expansive but useful!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad amazon had it because I couldn&#x27;t find it in Walmart stores ;)</li>
            <li> I bought this product for stretch marks originally.</li>
            <li> It is nice and thick, lasts for hours before I reapply, AND smells great.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great, and lasts a while for what&#x27;s in the tiny tub… However, new users and people who have been using for a while - beware… Many moms to be are getting rashes from this butter.</li>
            <li> The texture is rich and nice, the scent is soft and nurturing, and it leaves the belly feeling relaxed and pampered.</li>
            <li> More than anything, I just flat out feel better &amp; that is worth way more to me than cosmetic appearance.  </li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing and makes you so soft.</li>
            <li> I was very liberal with the amount I applied, making sure my belly and hips were liberally coated.</li>
            <li> I have since learned that getting stretch marks is more determined by genetics and how much your skin can stand to stretch.</li>
            <li> I ended up throwing away 3 full containers of it because I had bought the 3 pack.</li>
            <li> Even if it does not change anything for my skin it still is a very nice product and can be used on rough spots on elbows or feet too.</li>
            <li> I started using this product from day 1 when I found out I was pregnant.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my pregnant wife to prevent stretch marks</li>
            <li> When I was 20 weeks pregnant, I started noticing stretch marks on my belly, so I went and bought this.</li>
            <li> I am about 5 months pregnant.  </li>
            <li> I was pregnant; I believe in prevention.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine purchased this for me as a gift when she learned that I was pregnant.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to ALL off my pregnant friends.  </li>
            <li> So now I&#x27;m pregnant with baby #2</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product, she goes through this stuff rather quickly</li>
            <li> Super yummy smell too.</li>
            <li> 14 weeks pregnant and been using it since I found I was pregnant.</li>
            <li> So when I found out I was pregnant, I didn&#x27;t hesitate to buy this product and use it all over my body.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten in contact with my OB and they have me on cortizone cream and benadryl at night time, but being 7 months pregnant</li>
            <li> I will say this, the feel of this butter is SUPER greasy and grainy.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any problems using Plamers cocoa butter lotion while pregnant until now.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any new stretch marks since I&#x27;ve been pregnant so far so good.</li>
            <li> This cream was recommended in a magazine I read, but it caused my whole belly to rash!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised so many people swear by this stuff.</li>
            <li> Good quality, it was as we expected and we can recommend it.</li>
            <li> It will stain your clothes from the oils, so I wore a tank top directly over it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth using.  </li>
            <li> but it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> It takes a while to apply correctly, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I got this when stretch marks started to show on my belly 6 years ago when I was pregnant with my first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product since first finding out I was pregnant.  </li>
            <li> I started applying this right when I found out</li>
            <li> right after you get out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 6 months pregnant and my stretch marks didn&#x27;t show until I was 8 months with my firstborn, but I love the feeling this butter leaves.</li>
            <li> I used this product consistently when I was pregnant with y first child and it worked well to keep my tummy moisiturized and soothed.  </li>
            <li> Still using the stuff on my butt and hips until it runs out, but I could just use my good old cocoa butter and have only one product cluttering up my bathroom counter, not two.     </li>
            <li> Really helped to relieve my super itchy pregnancy skin on my belly.</li>
            <li> This stuff is super sticky and the stickiness doesn&#x27;t fade away much.</li>
            <li> My whole body feels itchy when pregnant</li>
            <li> But other than that I was very satisfied with the outcome.</li>
            <li> The tummy butter smells good, not overwhelming just a mild lavender and cocoa butter scent.</li>
            <li> exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> … pregnancy makes your skin EXTRA sensitive… you&#x27;re better off getting something hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin and bought the product because it&#x27;s paraben free and hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li> Funny</li>
            <li> it only caused this reaction on my breasts and not my belly, however I applied more to them then my belly, and</li>
            <li> I had hoped that I could beat genetics and get through my first pregnancy without stretch marks, so I tried Tummy Butter.  </li>
            <li> It also acted as a great moisturizer for the stretching belly because it is so thick.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I was so pleased with how dramatically my stretch marks are fading that I let the rash heal and tried applying it ONCE a day instead of several, this is working for me</li>
            <li> i first put the cocoa butter for stretch marks on first</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time on Christmas Eve morning and again on Christmas day-</li>
            <li> I apply the massage lotion first then the tummy butter after.</li>
            <li> Not a thin lotion!</li>
            <li> They each have said it&#x27;s very soothing!</li>
            <li> I see my stretch marks slowly going away and its great for my eczema.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for pregnant women and people who are just suffering from stretch marks because of fast growth or weight gain!</li>
            <li> Also, it is kind of fun to rub it on, since it is a little bit sticky.</li>
            <li> It was my first pregnancy and a did have one or two very faded stretch marks on my breast from puberty.</li>
            <li> the skin on my breasts is much more stretched out than my stomach.</li>
            <li> I am 6 months pregnant and have been using this twice a day since 5 weeks, and so far no stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I bought this body butter because the book \\&quot;What to expect when your expecting\\&quot; recommended it.. and the price was very decent.</li>
            <li> I love Tummy Butter, used it through out both of my pregnancies and never had a single stretch mark.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to apply a large quantity to feel the hydrating power of this product.</li>
            <li> I have large muscular quadriceps.  </li>
            <li> Normally I do not have sensitive skin, and have never had this kind of reaction from a skincare product.</li>
            <li> Currently 37 weeks pregnant with no stretch marks!</li>
            <li> Very good product, has been using it for past 2 months (went through half of the box) and apply on my pregnant belly and hips.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb into my skin very well, leaving an oily, greasy residue that lasts 12+ hours.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li> so I can slather it on as much as I want.</li>
            <li> We, as a family, really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> fast shipping.</li>
            <li> very good，I like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard people say that the tummy butter doesn&#x27;t really work for them</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> You can oil and lotion and grease yourself up as much as you want but if the stretch marks are coming, they won&#x27;t be stopped.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Behaves much like how you would expect cocoa butter to work.</li>
            <li> I used the tummy butter again for one day to see if it was really the tummy butter and the bumps and itchiness returned.</li>
            <li> and I noticed that the lavender smell really bothered me</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very oily...</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> really helps..</li>
            <li> Nothing much to write about here</li>
            <li> it really didn&#x27;t help my stretchmarks.</li>
            <li> I switched to Belly Balm sold at Whole Foods and have been much happier.</li>
            <li> It is very greasy but I like that it keeps my skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> Used this during pregnancy &amp; absolutely no stretch marks at all ...kept skin nice &amp; soft...</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t prevent my stretch marks, but I loved that the formula is thick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good moisturizer, but too thick.</li>
            <li> I loved this product when I first started using it - pleasant subtle scent, soaked into my skin quickly, left skin hydrated all day (I.E. no need to take over the handicapped stall at work to reapply half way through the day!).     </li>
            <li> I really love this product, I use it along with the cocao lotion for stretch marks just as suggested in other reviews.</li>
            <li> After a week I began to itch around the top of my breasts, but thought it was just due to my skin stretching.  </li>
            <li> I can see the skin on my belly is softer and more elastic, comparing to other parts and visibly healthier.</li>
            <li> Like many of the other reviewers on here, I used the Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter and broke out in a rash.</li>
            <li> I have DRY skin and am eight months pregnant but still have no stretch marks!</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, test it first and don’t buy the thee pack like I did</li>
            <li> but I am thankful I was able to avoid dark ones all over belly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That would be the only complaint I would have, but it makes the wife happy which makes my life just that much easier.</li>
            <li> and I did not get one new stretch mark!</li>
            <li> She used it during our previous child and she was pleased that she did not receive stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently 6 months pregnant and haven&#x27;t had a stretch mark rear</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently 9 months pregnant (with no stretch marks) and have been using this butter for over 10 months.</li>
            <li> I used this when I was pregnant with my fourth child.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to use when I was only five weeks pregnant.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife when she was 9 months pregnant - and after delivering our baby, she&#x27;s used this product daily.  </li>
            <li> Decent cocoa butter sent.</li>
            <li> This worked quickly on my stretch marks and they were fading after 2 days, but after a week&#x27;s use, i got rashes on all the places i applied it (arms and inner thighs).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost nine month pregnant and use Palmer&#x27;s twice a day all over my belly and back</li>
            <li> Im still dealing with the rash but its only been a day, im using the oitment (cortisteroid) sparingly as it does not have any results being tested on  pregnant women although the ER doc approved it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pregnant with my second baby.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a present for my friend when she told me she was pregnant.</li>
            <li> I am going to continue to use it, because I definitely think it is helping to keep my super moisturized.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m back for more on my second pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO EVERY PREGNANT WOMAN, I STARTED USING THIS PRODUCT IN MY SECOND TRIMESTER</li>
            <li> I usually put normal lotion on first and then use this on top of it as I read one of the ladies from the reviews did that</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> One more day, and I got little bumps all over the belly</li>
            <li> Although I had to wait for the package a little longer than normally (about 3 weeks), I love the product and the way they packed it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not from the normal stretching of skin during pregnancy because I am not even 6 weeks yet...</li>
            <li> so we&#x27;ll know for sure if it worked in a few months.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because I wanted a nice thick balm for my growing belly.</li>
            <li> I googled it and it seems many pregnant women have broken out in rashes as well from it.</li>
            <li> I came on here and read the other reviews and the people who got rashes sound just like mine.</li>
            <li> I am 6 months pregnant and do not have a single stretch mark yet, those on the breast I has start to fade after I have been using this product.</li>
            <li> Just know that if you have skin that is genetically not built to stretch and bounce back, there are most likely stretch marks in your future.</li>
            <li> I also recommend using your regular lotion first (if you NEVER use lotion-</li>
            <li> Pretty basic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why... maybe the skin there is more sensitive?</li>
            <li> By the next day it was a full blown rash all over my entire belly and on my breasts!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pregnant now but had very little stretch marks from my first pregnancy</li>
            <li> so my skin is not usually that sensitive, but this butter has shown me otherwise-</li>
            <li> I will be big during winter when dry skin is a huge issue.</li>
            <li> The consistency is very thick and it takes time to warm it up and soften it up in your hands</li>
            <li> If you have a sensitive skin like mine, I would suggest to steer clear from this product.</li>
            <li> My old marks didn&#x27;t re-stretch either.    </li>
            <li> I read all the reviews when I developed one after a MONTH of using it, and figured that couldn&#x27;t be it because these women had just used it twice and broke out… until I stopped using it for 4 days and switched to bio-oil</li>
            <li> My breasts were covered in stretch marks early in pregnancy</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t developed any stretch marks yet.  </li>
            <li> I would just bring the lotion into the restroom at work and apply it during the day frequently.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and doesn&#x27;t get itchy at night.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not fading my stretch marks as much as it was when I was applying it 3+ times daily.</li>
            <li> Well, my rash took two weeks to go away completely.</li>
            <li> If you tend to have sensitive skin, don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> Stick to natural forms or buy natural cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> I was a fan of palmer&#x27;s tummy butter which they produced in 2010, for some reason this product has completely different smell, which I do not like so much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this in combination with the massage lotion as recommended and so far no stretch marks...</li>
            <li> It prevents stretch marks and it also gets rid of old scars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it was a very irritable area in my 3rd trimester.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what you find off the shelf in store, without the hassle of finding which stores have it (more difficult than you&#x27;d think).</li>
            <li> went back to a more expensive product, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much it keeps your belly moisturizer for so long!</li>
            <li> Now, granted, nutrition actually plays a huge part in preventing stretch marks and if you are missing some things in your diet nothing is going to prevent stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I got this from the local Motherhood and loved it but thought it was rather difficult to use.</li>
            <li> recommend using this am and pm during the first trimester then am, mid-day and pm (at a minimum) for the second trimester and finally 5-8 times a day in the final trimester.</li>
            <li> However, this product has been great at lasting a long time and relieving the uncomfortable feeling of the stretching.</li>
            <li> Overall this product may be fine for some people, but if your skin has ever been the least bit sensitive, I would stick to organic!</li>
            <li> Palermo is very oily and long lasting.</li>
            <li> It took ten days to clear up</li>
            <li> When you start to itch from your belly growing so much just get a big slather of this on and massage into skin, for as long as it takes.  </li>
            <li> I also developed some itchy bumps when I applied it to areas where my skin was in close contact with my clothing, especially the elastic in my underwear.</li>
            <li> I found if I avoided those areas I had no trouble, but obviously it does have something in it that may irritate some women.     </li>
            <li> I definitely do not have \\&quot;Sensitive Skin\\&quot; by any means.</li>
            <li> AND I BARELY HAVE ANY STRETCHMARKS.</li>
            <li> Although you might want to apply it only when you have some time to let it dry off, because it really is \\&quot;butter\\&quot;, like grease.</li>
            <li> I was just exhausted and craving rich food!</li>
            <li> but the next day I was noticing small red bumps on my pregnant belly and was noticing an itch as well.</li>
            <li> It definitely moisturizes and stays in skin all day for at least 4 or 5 hours after applying before my skin ever gets itchy again and many other products I have tried barely last an hour or two before my sides and tummy are itching again.</li>
            <li> I figured the itchiness was due to normal skin-stretching</li>
            <li> About half way through my newly purchased jar, I started feeling small bumps on my right and left sides of my belly and they were itchy.</li>
            <li> Within a couple days I noticed a slight rash on my hands and since this was the only new product I had started recently, I knew it was the culprit</li>
            <li> I do NOT use it for pregnancy reasons, I have bad stretch marks on my inner thighs that I am very self conscious about and after using the Palmers Cocoa Butter for 3 days applying it everyday morning, lunch, and evening or even more my stretch marks</li>
            <li> The long and the short of it is that I went to 40 weeks 3 days with my daughter</li>
            <li> It is pretty thick and needs to be warmed up in your hands.</li>
            <li> ~It&#x27;s very goodIt&#x27;s very good~~sadsa sad aas</li>
            <li> I reverted back to my old cocoa butter and the rash went away after a few days</li>
            <li> so you have to walk around topless for a long time while it soaks in.</li>
            <li> now she is at the end of her pregnancy and her stomach has stretched out and is making her itchy.</li>
            <li> With moderation, it doesn&#x27;t take long for it to absorb at all.  </li>
            <li> This is my fave because it is thick and really moisturizes my growing belly.</li>
            <li> I never got itchy or dry as long as I used it twice a day.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference, so I went crazy and started buying anything and everything I could for stretch marks (baby oil, vitamin E, Save my Skin by Pure Romance, etc.) and would apply them all to my stomach.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t do a thing and actually made my belly extremely itchy and</li>
            <li> I broke out on my abdomen with occasional little red bumps.</li>
            <li> I suggest twice a day, once after your shower, and the other on the opposite end of the day.</li>
            <li> How could the company continue releasing a product that creates so many bad bodily reactions?</li>
            <li> Pregnancy makes your skin so dry and itchy and this worked well.</li>
            <li> If you have really dry skin, keep a container with you.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t get a single one on my belly until my ninth month.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t get one single mark during both my pregnancies.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 32 weeks+5 days and haven&#x27;t gotten a single stretch mark.</li>
            <li> I never got a single strech mark until the day I gave birth and</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly after warming between the palms for a few seconds but can be difficult to get out of the jar at first because it is very thick almost solid.</li>
            <li> I am normally not allergic to anything, so it does not happen to me often.</li>
            <li> Only down side it</li>
            <li> I used it for both of my previous pregnancies and never got a pregnancy related stretch mark.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have one single stretch mark!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I think it worked because I gained a loooottt of weight but didnt have a single stretch mark!</li>
            <li> Very oily, and very hard product.  </li>
            <li> I had gotten some pretty painful stretch marks with my other pregnancies although they did not cover the whole belly</li>
            <li> It is quite greasy-not matter how little you use-and I haven&#x27;t noticed a change in my skin, nor stretch marks since starting application of this</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a few weeks ago, up until I received it, I had been using regular palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter cream instead of this tummy butter formula.</li>
            <li> The pink lines I had went away.</li>
            <li> After using it for a couple of days, my skin started feeling rough.</li>
            <li> I went back to Motherhood and was given the tip to use the hairdryer on it for a few seconds to heat up the \\&quot;butter\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how many people have had such terrible reactions like mine--</li>
            <li> After using this product a few days, I broke out in a bumpy red rash all over the parts I used it on.</li>
            <li> and I only got a few stretch marks around my navel.</li>
            <li> And if you are like me and religiously apply to the belly at least 2 times or more a day you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> I used this and a few other products for preventing stretch marks during my pregnancy on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> When I started using it the second time, I scraped it out of the container with my nails and rubbed my stomach down for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I learned that a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I am due in 3 weeks and still have not gotten any stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I find myself wanting to use other things than spending the 30-45 minutes this requires.</li>
            <li> Other women in my family do have stretch marks, and I believe this cream made the difference for me.</li>
            <li> Ive never gotten a rash like other ladies.</li>
            <li> I still use it for other scars on my body.</li>
            <li> Whats worse is that after using it for about two weeks i got a new stretch mark in a day.</li>
            <li> This and Bio Oil, used together, are my holy grail in getting through pregnancies with minimal stretch marks and less skin itchiness as the belly</li>
            <li> this butter, I will say, it&#x27;s better to apply during the winter weather because it stays like a film over the skin, the skin does not absorb it completely, wich during the summer produces a terrible sensation.</li>
            <li> I only have one small stretch mark from my previous pregnancy (and I used this every day 2-3 times a day during that)</li>
            <li> Other then the fact that it is hard and sticky this stuff is just gross feeling on your skin.</li>
            <li> Its hard enough to avoid itching when you have a growing belly.</li>
            <li> The discomfort is not worth it to me and the stickiness grossed out my husband when he touched my belly.</li>
            <li> If you have ever had the opertunity to feel your skin burning and stretching apart its not fun.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife during pregnancy and her only complaint was it was oily.</li>
            <li> I love how its an oil base instead of a lotion.</li>
            <li> I gave the product another shot (with the over-the-belly band rolled down) and</li>
            <li> A coworker told me to start from day one, said she used regular moisturizer but saw a couple of stretch marks, then she started the cocoa butter and no more marks appeared!</li>
            <li> I used this and a few other Palmer&#x27;s stretch mark prevention products all through my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> Lierac is less oily and fluidy.</li>
            <li> Does this reduced the look of stretch marks if u are not pregnant?</li>
            <li> It seemed that a slight rash was forming</li>
            <li> Less than a week into using the product my stomach and hips broke out into a rash that lasted over a week.</li>
            <li> Used one and a half tins in about six weeks.</li>
            <li> It also helped to fade away previous stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not pregnant but used this butter while working on losing weight.</li>
            <li> Half way through a twin pregnancy</li>
            <li> I also feel like this has made my previous stretch marks (from puberty) less noticeable, but perhaps that&#x27;s in my head!</li>
            <li> The lavender smell is a little funky too.</li>
            <li> I like the product but its a little greasy</li>
            <li> I am not allergic to anything and have  not had any trouble with any other products in the past.</li>
            <li> I am now due any day, &amp; have aquired very few stretch marks throughout the pregnancy.  </li>
            <li> I bought this a few months ago-</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, what a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Was used heavily throughout pregnancy.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re in trouble).  </li>
            <li> Wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted the money on three jars of this stuff.</li>
            <li> But, I still like to lube up my belly a few times a day to prevent the skin from getting itchy while it stretches.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a bit thick and greasy, but I think that&#x27;s a small price to pay to avoid having LIFE LONG stretch marks on your body.</li>
            <li> It kept my belly hydrated and soft for the first two days, then I woke up with a HORRIBLE rash all over my hips, lower stomach, and the tops of my thigs where I was also applying it.</li>
            <li> Other people say it is too thick, well, it is thick - and it&#x27;s supposed to be.</li>
            <li> I am in so much pain from how badly my skin itches-</li>
            <li> I am not sure what ingredient is causing the rash</li>
            <li> Bought this and after a few months, everything cleared up!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this four stars though because I&#x27;m not entirely sure if it was this stuff or my weight loss that I should credit for my loss of stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I even had small hives from it.</li>
            <li> I can see some small stretch marks showing up but it seems like it helps.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ve been using this product once a day usually, twice sometimes.</li>
            <li> My breasts and stomach broke out in a terrible rash that lasted more than a month.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it with my current pregnancy and I&amp;#34;m loaded with them halfway through unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I usually buy Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s Mama Bee, but Target was sold out</li>
            <li> FYI, I did get random red bumps on my stomach from time to time</li>
            <li> NO MORE DISCOMFORT.</li>
            <li> NO MORE DISCOMFORT, I MADE A COMMITMENT TO USE THIS PRODUCT AFTER I HAD MY BABY</li>
            <li> I then read on some other websites that it is a very common problem.  </li>
            <li> Thick heavy butter!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to put on a bra.</li>
            <li> the infuriating rash came back.</li>
            <li> do not scratch, put on lotion to avoid stressing your delicate skin.</li>
            <li> Too late.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a thick cream for preventing stretch marks during pregnancy.</li>
            <li> , I of course hate having to take any medication that isn&#x27;t absolutely a must....</li>
            <li> however my wife had some serious allergy reaction and had to stop using this cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as thick but at least it absorbs!</li>
            <li> I also use a few products at once because im weird.</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s extremely thick!  </li>
            <li> Very thick.</li>
            <li> yes, it&#x27;s very thick.</li>
            <li> This product is very thick and greasy.</li>
            <li> VERY thick feel to it.  </li>
            <li> It has been a few days since I have used the product and the rash is still terribly itchy and red.</li>
            <li> Whats worse they claim the product is \\&quot;hypoallergenic\\</li>
            <li> I continued to use it and the bumps weren&#x27;t going way and the itchiness was getting worse...</li>
            <li> and I am getting a bit tired of it since it is being used all that time.  </li>
            <li> The consistency of this product is very hard making it difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> Then, about a week after I started using Palmers, I developed this horrible itchy rash all over my belly!</li>
            <li> This product did soften the appearance of my stretch marks, but after a week of use I developed a horrible rash everywhere</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick like and sticks to anything your body touches (including your clothes)!</li>
            <li> Because I did not do a control study on my belly, I cannot claim that it was useless, thus the 2 stars for fairness.</li>
            <li> plus it&#x27;s not too expensive</li>
            <li> My breasts broke out into a terrible, red, unbearably itchy rash.</li>
            <li> I only used Palmers lotion then and still got the worst stretch marks</li>
            <li> Difficult to apply because it´s difficult to take the butter on my fingers before the application.</li>
            <li> It was in the middle of summer and trying to cover it up was very annoying.</li>
            <li> My entire stomach and the backs of my hands and fingers broke out in a horrible rash even though I was no longer applying the product.  </li>
            <li> so the prescibed medicine help alleveate the random skin irritations.</li>
            <li> Now i am afraid to use it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ugly head as of yet.  </li>
            <li> Bad rash!...</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed and very unhappy to have had to walk around with a rash on my breasts.</li>
            <li> my stretch marks became very painful and inflamed.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Very, very disappointed in this product and would never ever recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was miserable.</li>
            <li> and it made me break out in the worst itchiest rash on my tummy.</li>
            <li> and this was awful.</li>
            <li> insane--</li>
            <li> Hate to break it to women but there is no miracle cream!</li>
            <li> it looks like a horrible heat rash and itches beyond belief!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My daughter is in the last trimester and ran out, so she asked for another package of this great product.</li>
            <li> I started using this product from day 1 when I found out I was pregnant. Applied twice per day. Now in my 38th week, the stretch marks have appeared. Guess maybe it is genetics that decides who gets stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I am 3 months and just started to use. This stuff smells amazing and makes you so soft. I know that stretch marks are mostly genetic but I do believe that how hydrated you keep your body and skin does help with recovery and making your skin more able to handle the growing of pregnancy. Even if it does not change anything for my skin it still is a very nice product and can be used on rough spots on elbows or feet too.</li>
            <li> I got this when stretch marks started to show on my belly 6 years ago when I was pregnant with my first. Used it religiously. Still ended up with tons of stretch marks. Because I did not do a control study on my belly, I cannot claim that it was useless, thus the 2 stars for fairness.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t prevent my stretch marks, but I loved that the formula is thick. I had bought the lotion in the bottle before and had to shake to get the last of the lotion out. With this container you&#x27;ll have no problem getting every last bit out.</li>
            <li> While this cream may be effective at preventing and/or minimizing stretch marks, I cannot use it because it makes my skin feel like it is coated with oil.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb into my skin very well, leaving an oily, greasy residue that lasts 12+ hours.  When I put it on in the evening, during my shower the next morning the water beads up on my skin like I am coated in RainX.</li>
            <li> I loved this product when I first started using it - pleasant subtle scent, soaked into my skin quickly, left skin hydrated all day (I.E. no need to take over the handicapped stall at work to reapply half way through the day!).     Then, about a week after I started using Palmers, I developed this horrible itchy rash all over my belly! I had been using the cream on my hips and butt as well, no rash there, but the itchy belly was maddening! I reverted back to my old cocoa butter and the rash went away after a few days and I thought \\&quot;Okay, maybe it was the combo of the Palmers and my over-the-belly pants that created the itchy rashy maddness\\&quot;. I gave the product another shot (with the over-the-belly band rolled down) and the infuriating rash came back. Still using the stuff on my butt and hips until it runs out, but I could just use my good old cocoa butter and have only one product cluttering up my bathroom counter, not two.     Very, very disappointed in this product and would never ever recommend it. Would give zero stars if I could.</li>
            <li> I used it during MY pregnancy, but it didn&#x27;t help... I have lots of stretch marks after the delivery. I won&#x27;t recomend this creme to anyone for stretch marks prevention.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product. I am not sure what ingredient is causing the rash but I also ended up with red bumps on my belly just after 3 days into using this cream. If you have a sensitive skin like mine, I would suggest to steer clear from this product. Instead I have been applying extra virgin coconut oil on my belly and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> This cream never ceases to amaze me, my friends, wife and sisters have used it and is really a good buy, as man is can recommend those husbands love their wives and want to see in them a beautiful figure even after pregnancy, and also as a man recommended them to those wives who want to look good, when they finish the pregnancyI can assure you that you will be satisfied with the results that you will get</li>
            <li> Amazing, it really works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product since first finding out I was pregnant.  I use it religiously on my belly, chest, sides, and legs.  I&#x27;m currently 6 months pregnant and haven&#x27;t had a stretch mark rear it&#x27;s ugly head as of yet.  I also feel like this has made my previous stretch marks (from puberty) less noticeable, but perhaps that&#x27;s in my head!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a few weeks ago, up until I received it, I had been using regular palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter cream instead of this tummy butter formula. The tummy butter smells good, not overwhelming just a mild lavender and cocoa butter scent. It goes on smoothly after warming between the palms for a few seconds but can be difficult to get out of the jar at first because it is very thick almost solid. It definitely moisturizes and stays in skin all day for at least 4 or 5 hours after applying before my skin ever gets itchy again and many other products I have tried barely last an hour or two before my sides and tummy are itching again. I have DRY skin and am eight months pregnant but still have no stretch marks! I definitely recommend this tummy butter plus it&#x27;s not too expensive so I can slather it on as much as I want.</li>
            <li> This is the best deal ever!!!!  I&#x27;m currently 9 months pregnant (with no stretch marks) and have been using this butter for over 10 months. Other people say it is too thick, well, it is thick - and it&#x27;s supposed to be. Best thing I recommend is to apply regular lotion, wait about 5 minutes and then apply the butter - it seems to absorb much better and faster. This is the best product and to buy 3 jars for this price is awesome!</li>
            <li> I really love this cream for my wife&#x27;s pregnant tummy.  You don&#x27;t need to apply a large quantity to feel the hydrating power of this product. Although you might want to apply it only when you have some time to let it dry off, because it really is \\&quot;butter\\&quot;, like grease. I&#x27;ve seen it work on the stretch marks, by reducing the redness and the severity of them. Also, it is kind of fun to rub it on, since it is a little bit sticky. We&#x27;ve also discovered it is NOT only for the tummy, since it works on the botox and thigs. We, as a family, really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> exactly as described.  fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking it would help prevent dryness and stretch marks. Instead all I got was a massive  itchy rash all over my belly. Whats worse they claim the product is \\&quot;hypoallergenic\\&quot; (it says so on the label). I would not recommend this product to no one.</li>
            <li> I love cocoa ，very good，I like it.</li>
            <li> I used this when I was pregnant with my fourth child. I had gotten some pretty painful stretch marks with my other pregnancies although they did not cover the whole belly and they faded nicely. I applied Tummy Butter religiously twice a day starting at about 16 weeks. I was very liberal with the amount I applied, making sure my belly and hips were liberally coated. I went through 2 containers during that pregnancy and I used it afterwards to prevent my skin from feeling itchy while recovering. The long and the short of it is that I went to 40 weeks 3 days with my daughter and I did not get one new stretch mark! Not one. My old marks didn&#x27;t re-stretch either.    Now, granted, nutrition actually plays a huge part in preventing stretch marks and if you are missing some things in your diet nothing is going to prevent stretch marks. But even if you do develop stretch marks, this stuff keeps your skin feeling so hydrated that it won&#x27;t hurt or feel itchy, which is really nice.    I also developed some itchy bumps when I applied it to areas where my skin was in close contact with my clothing, especially the elastic in my underwear. I found if I avoided those areas I had no trouble, but obviously it does have something in it that may irritate some women.     I&#x27;m expecting again and I would not dare try to get through this pregnancy without a supply of Palmer&#x27;s belly butter!</li>
            <li> I had stretch marks on my stomach, sides, and around my thighs. Bought this and after a few months, everything cleared up! It was pretty amazing. I&#x27;m giving this four stars though because I&#x27;m not entirely sure if it was this stuff or my weight loss that I should credit for my loss of stretch marks.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best! I use it along with Palmers stretch mark cream. I am due in 3 weeks and still have not gotten any stretch marks. It is nice and thick, lasts for hours before I reapply, AND smells great. It is however greasy, I don&#x27;t mind that at all because its doing its job, but if you don&#x27;t like that feeling I would recommend the cream. Before purchasing online I bought one tub in the store for $7, so this was a great buy! And if you are like me and religiously apply to the belly at least 2 times or more a day you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> This tummy butter + the skin oil is so wonderful, it makes me more confident and makes me feel more refreshen!</li>
            <li> I bought it for my pregnant wife to prevent stretch marks and it was successful. We used it with lierac. Lierac is less oily and fluidy. Palermo is very oily and long lasting. Besides, it smells good.</li>
            <li> I love this tummy butter! When I was 20 weeks pregnant, I started noticing stretch marks on my belly, so I went and bought this. I started using it and I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference, so I went crazy and started buying anything and everything I could for stretch marks (baby oil, vitamin E, Save my Skin by Pure Romance, etc.) and would apply them all to my stomach. 3 weeks later, I started to get a rash. I used Aveeno 1% hydrocortisone anti-itch cream with Vitamin E and Aloe for about a week and the rash went away. From then on I only used 1 product (I think I over did it with all the creams and that&#x27;s what caused the rash). I stuck with this tummy butter, the only thing is I applied a lot more of it than I did when I started using it. When I first started using it, I would rub the top of it and then rub my belly. That didn&#x27;t feel like enough to me. When I started using it the second time, I scraped it out of the container with my nails and rubbed my stomach down for a few minutes. I noticed a huge difference since then. The pink lines I had went away. I&#x27;ve heard people say that the tummy butter doesn&#x27;t really work for them, I just think they&#x27;re not applying enough of it. Yes, it&#x27;s a bit thick and greasy, but I think that&#x27;s a small price to pay to avoid having LIFE LONG stretch marks on your body.</li>
            <li> The consistency of this product is very hard making it difficult to apply. I had to get the Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula Massage Cream.  Plus the smell made me nauseous.</li>
            <li> I have large muscular quadriceps.  Therefore, I wear hiking skirts to give my legs room to move without the binding pants cause me.  At the same time, my legs rub together a lot and can develop severe chafing on trail.  This product is what I use instead of Vaseline because it does not stain and is not petroleum based.  It works very well.</li>
            <li> This cream was recommended in a magazine I read, but it caused my whole belly to rash!!  went back to a more expensive product, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> Great product,I used it on my first pregnancy and I&#x27;m on my second pregnancy and no stretch marks.</li>
            <li> After using it for a couple of days, my skin started feeling rough. One more day, and I got little bumps all over the belly&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if it works for the stretch marks, because I had to stop using it&lt;br /&gt;Note. I am normally not allergic to anything, so it does not happen to me often. If you have sensitive skin, test it first and don’t buy the thee pack like I did</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice product to have, it isn&#x27;t a miracle cream or anything special.  It kept me hydrated throughout my last pregnancy.</li>
            <li> Prior to buying this product, I had read some reviews on Amazon. I saw that one person had an allergic reaction to it and ended up with a rash all over her stomach. I bought it anyway, as I typically am okay with most lotions and beauty products. Within 2 days, I had the same reaction. I then read on some other websites that it is a very common problem.  Several women who experienced this also tried the Organic version of this product and reported it was much better. I went with a Burt&#x27;s Bees tummy butter and love it.</li>
            <li> I got this from the local Motherhood and loved it but thought it was rather difficult to use. I went back to Motherhood and was given the tip to use the hairdryer on it for a few seconds to heat up the \\&quot;butter\\&quot;. Every since that day I&#x27;ve used it after my showers. I&#x27;m only 6 months pregnant and my stretch marks didn&#x27;t show until I was 8 months with my firstborn, but I love the feeling this butter leaves. (That&#x27;s my only reason for giving it a 4 star.) It has helped with itchiness for sure! Every person is different but I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who asks :)</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great, and lasts a while for what&#x27;s in the tiny tub… However, new users and people who have been using for a while - beware… Many moms to be are getting rashes from this butter. I read all the reviews when I developed one after a MONTH of using it, and figured that couldn&#x27;t be it because these women had just used it twice and broke out… until I stopped using it for 4 days and switched to bio-oil… rash is gone… This stuff is getting tossed.&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, this isn&#x27;t the case for everyone… but beware of the possibility. Don&#x27;t freak out if you see a rash, I was convinced I had PUPPPS… pregnancy makes your skin EXTRA sensitive… you&#x27;re better off getting something hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to use when I was only five weeks pregnant.  Immediately I broke out into a rash anywhere I had put the lotion.  It took ten days to clear up and I will be using a different product going forward.  I am not allergic to anything and have  not had any trouble with any other products in the past.</li>
            <li> Very oily, and very hard product.  I have to scrape it out with my fingernail.</li>
            <li> Used this during pregnancy &amp; absolutely no stretch marks at all ...kept skin nice &amp; soft... Will use it even after the baby</li>
            <li> I am about 5 months pregnant.  Although the product arrived on time and not damaged, I must admit that I&#x27;m not entirely fond of it.  It is quite greasy-not matter how little you use-and I haven&#x27;t noticed a change in my skin, nor stretch marks since starting application of this butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would probably not purchase again, unless the product suddenly starts working.  I bought this a few months ago-still haven&#x27;t seen any changes whatsoever.  Hope someone else has better luck than I do...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Hannah</li>
            <li> Too greasy and I got skin reaction from it. I would recommend the cream instead of this presentation easier to apply</li>
            <li> I was given this belly butter as a gift in my third trimester of my pregnancy. It was my first pregnancy and a did have one or two very faded stretch marks on my breast from puberty. I used this and a few other products for preventing stretch marks during my pregnancy on a daily basis. I have since learned that getting stretch marks is more determined by genetics and how much your skin can stand to stretch. You can oil and lotion and grease yourself up as much as you want but if the stretch marks are coming, they won&#x27;t be stopped. This belly butter has kind of a strong scent but I like the way it smells.  It is pretty thick and needs to be warmed up in your hands. Can leave your skin greasy feeling but it did not bother me. Really helped to relieve my super itchy pregnancy skin on my belly. The entire tub lasted for maybe two month for me. I applied it to my breasts, belly, hips, and bottom. It did not, however, prevent stretch marks. My breasts were covered in stretch marks early in pregnancy but I didn&#x27;t get a single one on my belly until my ninth month. Then one day I woke up and my belly was covered in them. I will not tell anyone to not use anything like this during pregnancy. Just know that if you have skin that is genetically not built to stretch and bounce back, there are most likely stretch marks in your future.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife when she was 9 months pregnant - and after delivering our baby, she&#x27;s used this product daily.  I would highly recommend - very good, high quality product!</li>
            <li> I really love this product, I use it along with the cocao lotion for stretch marks just as suggested in other reviews. Yes it is greasy, but is not this is what to expect from the cocao butter! I am 6 months pregnant and do not have a single stretch mark yet, those on the breast I has start to fade after I have been using this product. Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Does this reduced the look of stretch marks if u are not pregnant? Got them from weight loss.. please help!!</li>
            <li> I wanted a thick cream for preventing stretch marks during pregnancy. This stuff is super sticky and the stickiness doesn&#x27;t fade away much. The lavender smell is a little funky too. I&#x27;m surprised so many people swear by this stuff. The discomfort is not worth it to me and the stickiness grossed out my husband when he touched my belly. I&#x27;ve started using Gold Bond with shea. It&#x27;s not as thick but at least it absorbs!</li>
            <li> This was an okay butter. Decent cocoa butter sent. Behaves much like how you would expect cocoa butter to work.</li>
            <li> I bought this tummy butter because i could not find the Palmers stretch mark cream thinking that since this was owned by the same company, it should work the same. This worked quickly on my stretch marks and they were fading after 2 days, but after a week&#x27;s use, i got rashes on all the places i applied it (arms and inner thighs). I wouldnt reccomend to anyone and wished that i read the reviews online before.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I wanted a nice thick balm for my growing belly. I do not have sensitive skin and bought the product because it&#x27;s paraben free and hypoallergenic. Initially I loved it. The smell is non-offensive, which is ultra-important when you have morning sickness around the clock. It kept my belly hydrated and soft for the first two days, then I woke up with a HORRIBLE rash all over my hips, lower stomach, and the tops of my thigs where I was also applying it. I came on here and read the other reviews and the people who got rashes sound just like mine. I haven&#x27;t put it on in two weeks and I still have the rash. How could the company continue releasing a product that creates so many bad bodily reactions? Now I have to search for another belly balm and I don&#x27;t even know where to start. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, what a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Is being used, hoping for the effect</li>
            <li> I like the product but its a little greasy so you have to walk around topless for a long time while it soaks in. I find myself wanting to use other things than spending the 30-45 minutes this requires.</li>
            <li> This product is a MUST for any pregnant lady! I&#x27;m almost nine month pregnant and use Palmer&#x27;s twice a day all over my belly and back and I haven&#x27;t developed any stretch marks yet.  I can&#x27;t recommend it enough.  If I could give it 6 stars, I would because it&#x27;s so great.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing for a dry and itchy pregnant tummy.  It is greasy, but it soothes the itch that comes with my pregnancies.  I have used this through 3 pregnancies and swear by it.</li>
            <li> I used the organic version. I started applying this right when I found out I was pregnant; I believe in prevention. I have used 4 tubs for the belly, hips and d&amp;eacute;colletage area. Now at 37 weeks along I - knock on wood - have no stretch marks. (Nutrition and hydration play a big part, as does genetics.) I have not had itching belly at all. I plan on using the Palmer&#x27;s Q-10 formula post pregnancy for the tightening and firming benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I just read that eating 2 avocados a week can aid in moisture delivered to the skin as well as having many benefits for baby.</li>
            <li> Was used heavily throughout pregnancy. No stretch marks, no skin reactions, helped with itching a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended over the lotions and creams.</li>
            <li> Good quality, it was as we expected and we can recommend it. I will buy again if we need anothe one.</li>
            <li> Great great product. I used throughout my entire pregnancy and no stretchmarks. Don&#x27;t waste your time with cocoa butter cream go straight and use this cream.</li>
            <li> I used it but my strench marks continue growing!</li>
            <li> I am terrified of getting stretch marks and so far so good!  I really think it helps and the smells wonderful.  Only down side it that it&#x27;s extremely thick!  You have to put it on before bed or it makes your cloths stick to you.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine purchased this for me as a gift when she learned that I was pregnant. I used out and thought out was great... I didn&#x27;t mind the greasy feeling of it. I purchased some onon my own. About half way through my newly purchased jar, I started feeling small bumps on my right and left sides of my belly and they were itchy. I figured the itchiness was due to normal skin-stretching and I wasn&#x27;t that concerned. I continued to use it and the bumps weren&#x27;t going way and the itchiness was getting worse... It seemed that a slight rash was forming so I stopped using it for two days to see if my skin would improve and it did. I used the tummy butter again for one day to see if it was really the tummy butter and the bumps and itchiness returned.</li>
            <li> I love it！It is not expansive but useful! I love it！It is not expansive but useful! but too smelly for me!</li>
            <li> I used it throughout my pregnancy on my belly breast and waist morning and night and I don&#x27;t have one single stretch mark!</li>
            <li> This and Bio Oil, used together, are my holy grail in getting through pregnancies with minimal stretch marks and less skin itchiness as the belly grows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be honest, during my two pregnancies, I didn&#x27;t watch my weight and workout as much as I should have. I was just exhausted and craving rich food! I ended up gaining 40 pounds each time. Now that I&#x27;ve lost the baby weight and some, my skin is beautiful, firm and healthy looking like pre-baby. I do have white/flesh toned stretch marks on my hips but I am thankful I was able to avoid dark ones all over belly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using this am and pm during the first trimester then am, mid-day and pm (at a minimum) for the second trimester and finally 5-8 times a day in the final trimester. I would just bring the lotion into the restroom at work and apply it during the day frequently. The moment you feel itchiness on your belly do not scratch, put on lotion to avoid stressing your delicate skin. Also use post baby as you tummy shrinks to keep it moisturized and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> Before I bought this product I read the reviews and saw a couple women complaining about breaking out in a rash. I disregarded the reviews thinking it must just be them and ordered the product. Less than a week into using the product my stomach and hips broke out into a rash that lasted over a week. I was miserable. Its hard enough to avoid itching when you have a growing belly. I ended up throwing away 3 full containers of it because I had bought the 3 pack.</li>
            <li> At first the the product seemed great! Nice light scent and texture....until I used it for a second time. My breasts broke out into a terrible, red, unbearably itchy rash. I even had small hives from it. Funny it only caused this reaction on my breasts and not my belly, however I applied more to them then my belly, and the skin on my breasts is much more stretched out than my stomach. It has been a few days since I have used the product and the rash is still terribly itchy and red. It&#x27;s hard to put on a bra. Normally I do not have sensitive skin, and have never had this kind of reaction from a skincare product.</li>
            <li> Very thick. I can only use it at bedtime. I can see some small stretch marks showing up but it seems like it helps. I am also &amp;#34;all baby&amp;#34; so my belly is bearing the brunt of this 30 lb weight gain! My skin feels soft and doesn&#x27;t get itchy at night. Used one and a half tins in about six weeks.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!  I&#x27;m stretch mark prone and I didn&#x27;t get one single mark during both my pregnancies.  I recommend this to ALL off my pregnant friends.  It is amazing.  I used it twice a day.  It will stain your clothes from the oils, so I wore a tank top directly over it.</li>
            <li> I was told by a friend that she loved this product and she never got stretch marks during her pregnancy. I bought a package of three and I liked these, but I didn&#x27;t like how greasy it made my skin and I noticed that the lavender smell really bothered me so I discontinued using it. I did switch to Palmer&#x27;s stretch mark lotion that&#x27;s in a pump bottle and use it twice a day and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Yes! it&#x27;s very oily...yes, it&#x27;s very thick. If you can get over that and focus on the goal- it&#x27;s worth using.  You have to put it on all over your tummy, sides, chest.... right after you get out of the shower.  I also recommend using your regular lotion first (if you NEVER use lotion- you&#x27;re in trouble).  Do this after EVERY shower. You also have to continue to use it after the baby is born...as you can get stretch marks as you lose weight.  I used it for months after.  I am on baby #3 and I have ZERO stretch marks...and I owe it all to this product.</li>
            <li> Although I had to wait for the package a little longer than normally (about 3 weeks), I love the product and the way they packed it. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Absorbs fairly quickly, but has a strong smell.</li>
            <li> The Best thing I bought in all my pregnancy! I have no stretch marks at all</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cocoa butter. Pretty basic.</li>
            <li> I used this product consistently when I was pregnant with y first child and it worked well to keep my tummy moisiturized and soothed.  Pregnancy makes your skin so dry and itchy and this worked well. So now I&#x27;m pregnant with baby #2 and I&#x27;ve been using this from my 3rd month. so far so good!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product, she goes through this stuff rather quickly now she is at the end of her pregnancy and her stomach has stretched out and is making her itchy. She used it during our previous child and she was pleased that she did not receive stretch marks.  I think it smells good, but it is kind of a strong smell at first and I am getting a bit tired of it since it is being used all that time.  That would be the only complaint I would have, but it makes the wife happy which makes my life just that much easier.</li>
            <li> I used this and a few other Palmer&#x27;s stretch mark prevention products all through my pregnancy. I gained a lot if weight and had a big belly, but did not get any stretch marks. No stretch marks!!! Other women in my family do have stretch marks, and I believe this cream made the difference for me. The key is being diligent about applying it every night.</li>
            <li> Great n works for me! Used w 3 pregnancies!</li>
            <li> Works well -- doesn&#x27;t feel pleasant on at first -- but seems to relieve the itching associated with pregnant skin stretching. I only have one small stretch mark from my previous pregnancy (and I used this every day 2-3 times a day during that) -- so hopefully this will help prevent them the second time around.</li>
            <li> really helps.. keeps moisturize .. skin wont get itchy ...</li>
            <li> I had hoped that I could beat genetics and get through my first pregnancy without stretch marks, so I tried Tummy Butter.  Although I ended up with a lot of stretch marks, they did not appear until 9 months.  It also acted as a great moisturizer for the stretching belly because it is so thick.  I never got itchy or dry as long as I used it twice a day.  It also helped to fade away previous stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I love Tummy Butter, used it through out both of my pregnancies and never had a single stretch mark. Super yummy smell too.</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s recommendation is very good, very good product, I very like to use it, it brings me a very good enjoyment</li>
            <li> no stretch marks after gaining  40lbs love it</li>
            <li> Used this twice a day when I was pregant and didn&#x27;t get 1 stretch mark! Boom!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not pregnant but used this butter while working on losing weight. Results are stunning!!!! I had some stretch marks (tiny ones) on my lower back and after several months of using this product they are GONE!!!! I didn&#x27;t expect such a great results. Since then I always keep a jar of this butter and occasuanly use it to prevent any stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product. I&#x27;m pregnant now but had very little stretch marks from my first pregnancy I haven&#x27;t seen any new stretch marks since I&#x27;ve been pregnant so far so good. 14 weeks pregnant and been using it since I found I was pregnant.</li>
            <li> I used it from 6-9 month pregnancy, stretch marks still showed up. Also gave me rash on the thighs that got in contact with my big belly which was covered by this product.  Might be good for ocassional moisturizing but frankly, preventing stretch marks is a myth</li>
            <li> Although I love the smell of the products, not recommended by me.  I bought the Palmer Tummy Butter and the Palmer Oil and spread it after showers on tummy and breast area.  After a week I began to itch around the top of my breasts, but thought it was just due to my skin stretching.  Then it was unbearable where I got a rash on my tummy.  After a week of bearing it, I finally called my OB and they said to take benedryl, i took it one night and it did not help.  I finally ended up going to the ER and they prescribed an oitment ok&#x27;d for me.  Im still dealing with the rash but its only been a day, im using the oitment (cortisteroid) sparingly as it does not have any results being tested on  pregnant women although the ER doc approved it.  I would not use these products.  I will buy some Mother&#x27;s friend and see how that works!</li>
            <li> Bad rash!...and it&#x27;s not from the normal stretching of skin during pregnancy because I am not even 6 weeks yet...I will not be using this product anymore</li>
            <li> I love the smell, texture &amp; I&#x27;m glad I haven&#x27;t broke out from this like a lot of reviews I&#x27;ve read on it had. I use it almost every night especially after a shower. You don&#x27;t need much it keeps your belly moisturizer for so long! I hope it continues to work the rest of my pregnancy ;) I&#x27;m glad amazon had it because I couldn&#x27;t find it in Walmart stores ;)</li>
            <li> I have heard some complaints about a greasy feeling after using this product, but for me, it was a welcomed relief.  I learned that a little goes a long way.  With moderation, it doesn&#x27;t take long for it to absorb at all.  The relief it brought was amazing though.  I am now due any day, &amp; have aquired very few stretch marks throughout the pregnancy.  What I do have, was obtained prior to using this product.  More than anything, I just flat out feel better &amp; that is worth way more to me than cosmetic appearance.  The cosmetic portion just happens to be a bonus feature.  :)  Not to mention a fantastic price point!!  Very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for stretch marks originally. it didn&#x27;t do a thing and actually made my belly extremely itchy and my stretch marks became very painful and inflamed.&lt;br /&gt; I stored it in the cabinet and when my son was born we used it on him after his baths. He loves the stuff and smells like cookies after we apply it.</li>
            <li> I tried using regular lotions for when my belly gets itchy as it gets bigger but the effect of the lotion is very short and the itchiness comes back shortly after. However, this product has been great at lasting a long time and relieving the uncomfortable feeling of the stretching. I usually put normal lotion on first and then use this on top of it as I read one of the ladies from the reviews did that and it does work better that work.</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion. I us it daily for my hands. Ever since regular use, My hands have stopped cracking and severely drying out.</li>
            <li> If you are pregnant, this stuff is your go to! I am 6 months pregnant and have been using this twice a day since 5 weeks, and so far no stretch marks. It feels great on your skin and does not stain or leave an oily residue on your clothes.</li>
            <li> I loved the product. This is very useful for me. I loved the product. This is very useful for me. I liked the product. I recommend to all, because the product and quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good and I like it!</li>
            <li> Loved this during my pregnancy and afterward</li>
            <li> I love cocoa butter during my pregnancies, and when I found this, I was thrilled.  I think this does feel thicker and more absorbed by the skin than the lotion.  I would recomend!</li>
            <li> I just recently bought this since I have found out I&#x27;m pregnant with my second baby. I only used Palmers lotion then and still got the worst stretch marks so I want to hopefully not get anymore so I tried this tummy butter and it made me break out in the worst itchiest rash on my tummy. I think I&#x27;ll be switching to Burts Bees. I only used it for 4 days before I noticed the rash and have stopped for about 3 days and I am still working on getting rid of it.</li>
            <li> This product is great! I used it both pregnancy and did not get any stretch marks. I recommend to start using the product no later than your 12th week of pregnancy. My son was 6lb 8 oz, and I am 35 weeks with my daughter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what you find off the shelf in store, without the hassle of finding which stores have it (more difficult than you&#x27;d think).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good moisturizer, but too thick. Difficult to apply because it´s difficult to take the butter on my fingers before the application.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a present for my friend when she told me she was pregnant. I used it throughout my pregnancy and it was such a treat! The texture is rich and nice, the scent is soft and nurturing, and it leaves the belly feeling relaxed and pampered. It was also very nice to have my husband &amp;#34;bonding&amp;#34; with the belly if he applied it.&lt;br /&gt;I think it worked because I gained a loooottt of weight but didnt have a single stretch mark! A coworker told me to start from day one, said she used regular moisturizer but saw a couple of stretch marks, then she started the cocoa butter and no more marks appeared!</li>
            <li> good cream, strong hydrating properties however my wife had some serious allergy reaction and had to stop using this cream.</li>
            <li> this butter, I will say, it&#x27;s better to apply during the winter weather because it stays like a film over the skin, the skin does not absorb it completely, wich during the summer produces a terrible sensation. It smells nice and the texture is OK.</li>
            <li> This product did soften the appearance of my stretch marks, but after a week of use I developed a horrible rash everywhere I was applying it.  I was so pleased with how dramatically my stretch marks are fading that I let the rash heal and tried applying it ONCE a day instead of several, this is working for me, I&#x27;m not getting a rash but it&#x27;s not fading my stretch marks as much as it was when I was applying it 3+ times daily.</li>
            <li> I have used many products from Palmer&#x27;s.  So when I found out I was pregnant, I didn&#x27;t hesitate to buy this product and use it all over my body.  Yes, on the back it does say some will get a rash.  Well, my rash took two weeks to go away completely.</li>
            <li> Yes I hear it all the time, genetics. My mother had them so then I should get them as well. Well, I&#x27;ve been using this product once a day usually, twice sometimes. I&#x27;m 32 weeks+5 days and haven&#x27;t gotten a single stretch mark. Let&#x27;s see how it continues to hold up and at the end of my pregnancy I will provide an update.</li>
            <li> Nothing much to write about here it really didn&#x27;t help my stretchmarks. It helped to moisturize and keep the skin supple that&#x27;s basically it .</li>
            <li> This product is good. My friend have used it and she think it is good. I hope it will do its work for me.</li>
            <li> Other then the fact that it is hard and sticky this stuff is just gross feeling on your skin. Whats worse is that after using it for about two weeks i got a new stretch mark in a day. If you have ever had the opertunity to feel your skin burning and stretching apart its not fun.</li>
            <li> Very good product, has been using it for past 2 months (went through half of the box) and apply on my pregnant belly and hips. The consistency is very thick and it takes time to warm it up and soften it up in your hands but it is totally worth it. I can see the skin on my belly is softer and more elastic, comparing to other parts and visibly healthier. Even after a good scrub shower, you can still feel the stuff in your skin. Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have 4 out of 5, since I do not know yet it if will reduce/prevent strech marks. Will update in 4 months.</li>
            <li> If you tend to have sensitive skin, don&#x27;t buy this product. I broke out on my abdomen with occasional little red bumps. My practitioner recommended trying a product with fewer, more pronounce-able ingredients. I switched to Belly Balm sold at Whole Foods and have been much happier. Wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted the money on three jars of this stuff.</li>
            <li> I bought this body butter because the book \\&quot;What to expect when your expecting\\&quot; recommended it.. and the price was very decent. After using it for a day.. My breasts and stomach broke out in a terrible rash that lasted more than a month. I am not one to get any types of rashes or allergic reactions to anything. I definitely do not have \\&quot;Sensitive Skin\\&quot; by any means. I was very disappointed and very unhappy to have had to walk around with a rash on my breasts. It was in the middle of summer and trying to cover it up was very annoying. Save your money and buy burtsbees instead</li>
            <li> I used it for both of my previous pregnancies and never got a pregnancy related stretch mark. I didn&#x27;t use it with my current pregnancy and I&amp;#34;m loaded with them halfway through unfortunately. So it does seem to work. It also relieves the itching associated with the stretching skin. I&#x27;m going to start using it daily as i use to. I suggest twice a day, once after your shower, and the other on the opposite end of the day. If you have really dry skin, keep a container with you. It takes a while to apply correctly, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I use on my face and neck, love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good~It&#x27;s very good~It&#x27;s very good~It&#x27;s very good~It&#x27;s very good~It&#x27;s very good~It&#x27;s very good~It&#x27;s very good~It&#x27;s very good~It&#x27;s very good~It&#x27;s very good~It&#x27;s very good~It&#x27;s very good~It&#x27;s very goodIt&#x27;s very good~~sadsa sad aas</li>
            <li> i first put the cocoa butter for stretch marks on first then i put this on, just like it says on the can.. i still got stretch marks underneath my breasts and on my butt. i know that everyones skin is different and i wasnt expecting a miracle to happen. I will continue to use it to maybe help to fade them but who knows.</li>
            <li> I tried this in conjunction with Palmers cocoa butter lotion and this was awful. It&#x27;s very thick like and sticks to anything your body touches (including your clothes)! I don&#x27;t recommend this at all. The cocoa butter lotion, however, I do recommend!</li>
            <li> I love the Palmers Cocoa Butter lotion, so thought I would give this a try.  Within a couple days I noticed a slight rash on my hands and since this was the only new product I had started recently, I knew it was the culprit and I stopped immediately.  Too late.  My entire stomach and the backs of my hands and fingers broke out in a horrible rash even though I was no longer applying the product.  Even with Benadryl and cortisone the itch is insane-- my hands feel like they are on fire.  I wish I had read the reviews before buying!!  I was surprised how many people have had such terrible reactions like mine-- there is no way this product is safe.  DO NOT BUY IT!!</li>
            <li> Hate to break it to women but there is no miracle cream! Stretch marks mostly has to do with genetics. But, I still like to lube up my belly a few times a day to prevent the skin from getting itchy while it stretches. This is my fave because it is thick and really moisturizes my growing belly. Ive never gotten a rash like other ladies. No stretch marks during either of my pregnancies. But again, genetics. I also use a few products at once because im weird. I also use Burts Bees Tummy Butter, Palmers Stretch mark balm and coconut oil &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Like many of the other reviewers on here, I used the Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter and broke out in a rash. I usually buy Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s Mama Bee, but Target was sold out so I tried Palmer&#x27;s. For the first two days I loved it. It felt kind of oily, but that made me feel like it lasted and didn&#x27;t go away. However, on the third day, the rash occurred. I used it on my stomach, hips, and breasts, and the only place that broke out in rash was the tops of my breasts. I&#x27;m not sure why... maybe the skin there is more sensitive? Overall this product may be fine for some people, but if your skin has ever been the least bit sensitive, I would stick to organic!</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time on Christmas Eve morning and again on Christmas day- but the next day I was noticing small red bumps on my pregnant belly and was noticing an itch as well. By the next day it was a full blown rash all over my entire belly and on my breasts!!  I am in so much pain from how badly my skin itches- it looks like a horrible heat rash and itches beyond belief! I&#x27;ve gotten in contact with my OB and they have me on cortizone cream and benadryl at night time, but being 7 months pregnant, I of course hate having to take any medication that isn&#x27;t absolutely a must....and in this case, it is!!! I have an olive skin tone so my skin is not usually that sensitive, but this butter has shown me otherwise- I would NOT recommend....</li>
            <li> I chose this because coco butter is wonderful if your pregnant. I love how its an oil base instead of a lotion. I would recommend this to any women who is going threw pregnancy and or have scares.</li>
            <li> I love the Palmer&#x27; s Cocoa butter lotion. This is to oily for my preference. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> The price is really good. But i am itchy all over my belly aftet applying it. Now i am afraid to use it.</li>
            <li> Half way through a twin pregnancy so we&#x27;ll know for sure if it worked in a few months.  This product is literally like butter.  I find that if I scrape it with my thumb and then rub between my hands like crazy to warm it up it gets creamier.  I&#x27;m using along with Palmers massage cream</li>
            <li> After using this product a few days, I broke out in a bumpy red rash all over the parts I used it on. I googled it and it seems many pregnant women have broken out in rashes as well from it. Stick to natural forms or buy natural cocoa butter. Dont take a chance with this, Im sitting here trying not to scratch the clusters of bumps that are all over my stomach, back and legs.</li>
            <li> This was one recommendation of one of my girlfriends and until now that I am in my 8th month I can say it has work perfectly</li>
            <li> The Palmers Cocoa Butter for stretch marks is absolutely amazing! I am 16 I do NOT use it for pregnancy reasons, I have bad stretch marks on my inner thighs that I am very self conscious about and after using the Palmers Cocoa Butter for 3 days applying it everyday morning, lunch, and evening or even more my stretch marks have definitely faded! I have tried many things for stretch marks and this one product did the trick. I highly recommend it for pregnant women and people who are just suffering from stretch marks because of fast growth or weight gain!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife during pregnancy and her only complaint was it was oily. Great deal on this product</li>
            <li> I was a fan of palmer&#x27;s tummy butter which they produced in 2010, for some reason this product has completely different smell, which I do not like so much. It just acceptable.</li>
            <li> This product is very thick and greasy. I am going to continue to use it, because I definitely think it is helping to keep my super moisturized.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this in combination with the massage lotion as recommended and so far no stretch marks... but I&#x27;m only 21 weeks.  I&#x27;ll update this when I&#x27;m done for sure.  I will say this, the feel of this butter is SUPER greasy and grainy.  It doesn&#x27;t feel great and your tummy feels sticky / slimy when you are finished putting it on. VERY thick feel to it.  That being said, if I can get through this pregnancy without stretch marks, I&#x27;ll put up with the icky-factor.</li>
            <li> I apply this daily after showers. I apply the massage lotion first then the tummy butter after. It is very greasy but I like that it keeps my skin hydrated. Did not have any skin reactions or problems with this product. Currently 37 weeks pregnant with no stretch marks!</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff because I have always heard the ol&#x27;wives tale that cocoa butter will help to prevent strech marks.  WORKED PERFECTLY!  I religiously applied this after every shower then as I got close to looking as a house I applied twice then three times a day and ANY time my stomach felt itchy.  I never strached my stomach and was always applying the stuff.  I never got a single strech mark until the day I gave birth and the strech marks appeared on my pelvis (where I never applied the stuff).  I&#x27;m on my second pregnancy now and repeating.. I&#x27;m also making sure I watch my diet and excersise because I&#x27;ve read you will blow up faster the second time around.  (fingers crossed!!!)  FYI, I did get random red bumps on my stomach from time to time but I ask the doctor to prescibe a steriod enduced cream to help soothe the irritated spots.  My whole body feels itchy when pregnant so the prescibed medicine help alleveate the random skin irritations.</li>
            <li> After a 3 day use of this with the Palmers Massage Lotion for stretch marks I broke out with a rash on my belly. I didn&#x27;t have any problems using Plamers cocoa butter lotion while pregnant until now. I&#x27;m 32 weeks and the tummy butter may have caused polymorphic eruption of pregnancy or possible yeast infection. Will never use again!</li>
            <li> I really like this product!!! It&#x27;s been working amazing on my tummy, to prevent the stretch marks on my pregnancy</li>
            <li> I have 5 daughters with a set of twins in that bunch.  I have faithfully used this product during my entire pregnancies and even after.  When you start to itch from your belly growing so much just get a big slather of this on and massage into skin, for as long as it takes.  Do not use nails ever!  With all of my girls, I do not have one stretch mark!  This moisturizes and takes out the itch.</li>
            <li> I loved this for my first pregnancy and gave it as gifts to pregnant friends. Now I&#x27;m back for more on my second pregnancy. I will be big during winter when dry skin is a huge issue. I slather this on before bed, put a shirt over and absorb. I&#x27;ve never had any issues with staining or grease on sheets or clothes. I feel like it does it&#x27;s job. Not a thin lotion! Thick heavy butter!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my wife,  I have been rubbing her baby bump with the Palmer&#x27;s, She likes it and it lets me bond with baby. It is awesome to feel Peanut move and kick when I rub the tummy. I have not noticed any stretch marks so it must be working as advertised. I would recommend the Tummy Butter. it goes on smooth and you don&#x27;t need all that much.smells nice too.</li>
            <li> Palmer&#x27;s tummy butter-for stretch marks .  I gave this tummy butter to both of my daughters.  They each have said it&#x27;s very soothing!</li>
            <li> The tummy butter is great. It prevents stretch marks and it also gets rid of old scars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had some scars on my chest that I thought would be there forever. I applied Palmer &#x27;s throughout my pregnancy to my tummy, breast and upper arms twice a day, in the morning and at night. Before I knew it the marks on my breast were gone and I only got a few stretch marks around my navel. You are not supposed to scratch and it was a very irritable area in my 3rd trimester. But other than that I was very satisfied with the outcome. I still use it for other scars on my body. I&#x27;ll give an update on the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extra tip- I applied the tummy butter and then put baby oil on top...worked great:-)</li>
            <li> I see my stretch marks slowly going away and its great for my eczema. You don&#x27;t have to use a lot to moisturize. I&#x27;ve only had to open one of the 3 jars and it&#x27;s been a month and I still have a lot left.</li>
            <li> Works great for scars and wrinkles,  smells good,  i use on face and neck, hands, stomach , legs, i like it</li>
            <li> I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO EVERY PREGNANT WOMAN, I STARTED USING THIS PRODUCT IN MY SECOND TRIMESTER AND NOTICED MY SKIN CHANGED. I FELT THE NEED TO SCRATCH AND TRY MANY ITEMS UNTIL I SEEN THIS ONE ON AMAZON, I GAVE IT A SHOT AND NO MORE DISCOMFORT. MY SKIN LOOKED HEALTHY AND NO MORE DISCOMFORT, I MADE A COMMITMENT TO USE THIS PRODUCT AFTER I HAD MY BABY AND I BARELY HAVE ANY STRETCHMARKS. MUST USE THIS PRODUCT THREE TIMES A DAY AND YOU WILL BE PLEASED;}.</li>
            <li> No stretch marks at 24 weeks! Hopefully it keeps working and I won&#x27;t have any stretch marks at 40 weeks either!</li>
