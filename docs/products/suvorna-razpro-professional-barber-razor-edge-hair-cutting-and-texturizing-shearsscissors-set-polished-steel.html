    <ol>
            <li>This is an excellent shear &amp; scissor set.</li>
            <li>They work perfect for me</li>
            <li>Great shears!</li>
            <li>The quality of the tools are impressive and they feel great in the hand.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my daughter who tells me they work great.</li>
            <li>Great shears.  </li>
            <li>great price,</li>
            <li>They were great.</li>
            <li>these are amazing!</li>
            <li>The presentation, speakes of quality and good looks, and as you use them you</li>
            <li>My daughter loved the gift.</li>
            <li>All around good experience,  Tom</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair with these &amp; sometimes a razor comb, and have learnt the value of using good tools for the job.</li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>but they are nice.  </li>
            <li>Swivel is actually a nice feature...  </li>
            <li>They are nice but the plastic inserts fall out</li>
            <li>For some reason I felt inclined to cut my own hair.  </li>
            <li>Good price,  good product,  fast delivery!  </li>
            <li>And i think these shears are made of a more carbonated steel so they don&#x27;t hold their sharpness as well.</li>
            <li>Will update once I have been able to use them more.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Totally satisfied.</li>
            <li>there still ok, no nicks in the blade or anything breaking.</li>
            <li>Everyone told me I might have to pay up to $600 for a great set of professional shears.</li>
            <li>but once in they fit like a glove, I will need to tighten up</li>
            <li>These are a great set and all I have used for the last 2 years.</li>
            <li>nice scissors but had to send them back, couldn&#x27;t deal with the swinging thumb  exchanged them for another pair</li>
            <li>you know you made the right choice.</li>
            <li>The price was definitely right, and because we&#x27;ve never compared them to $600 shears, I would rate as five stars.</li>
            <li>I am upset that i had to have them sharpened right off the bat.</li>
            <li>But nevertheless, I shouldn&#x27;t have to have them sharpened right out of the box... which, by the way, the case that the shears were shipped in were NOT the case that is displayed in the pictures.</li>
            <li>Not much experience with clippers beyond the 10-20 dollar kind</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the luxury of being able to try out a lot of different shears.</li>
            <li>Really makes it easy to get to the hard to reach areas of one&#x27;s own head.  </li>
            <li>love it, and i recommend this to everyone who needs professional equipment for a low price</li>
            <li>The swiveling thumb hole makes for a very comfortable DIY haircut when you get to the other side of your head.</li>
            <li>the swivel thumbs are way to loose, but should be a easy fix.</li>
            <li>The packaging is nice though the fake leather case has a strong smell to it upon unwrapping.</li>
            <li>Thumb seems down lower than my other ones but work great</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t compare them to the higher end stuff, but these cut effortlessly, cleanly and will clearly last a long time.  </li>
            <li>I do not know what professional scissors are supposed to be like, but these did the trick for me and in the end my hair cut looked normal, and not like I was attacked by a weed-eater.  </li>
            <li>but i think the chromium and zinc in the stainless is high enough that i won&#x27;t have to for a while.</li>
            <li>i notice my hands hurt less since my thumb can move freely.</li>
            <li>Professional here.</li>
            <li>I could tell the shears were NOT sharp at ALL!</li>
            <li>the thinning shear leave straight cut lines easily, not very blended looking.</li>
            <li>fingers a little tight but ok with rubber inserts removed.  </li>
            <li>they are really sharp and the tension adjustment works very well.  </li>
            <li>But they do seem to be much sharper than the other ones I bought.</li>

            <li> I only had a short time to return them not long enough, I only used a couple of times and the cutting on them</li>
            <li> the blades are a little long</li>
            <li> She cuts my hair regularly and these stay sharp!!!</li>
            <li> You usually have to send them off to be sharpened, or make an appointment for weeks in advance to have your local sharpener come by your salon.</li>
            <li> swivel is hard to get used to, feel too big when palming them.</li>
            <li> I can say that as a professional stylist, you can buy a GOOD cutting shear for the same price i paid for these, and you can also pay insane amounts of money for a crappy shear, too.</li>
            <li> I first ordered Suvorna&#x27;s set of blue cutting and texturizing shears which were $79.99, and returned them immediately because the hair would just bend!</li>
            <li> i have had them sharpened twice, and cut hair everyday.</li>
            <li> i use these everyday</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about these shears.</li>

            <li> The finger grips were hard to get in</li>
            <li> Even after tightening the tension screw, it would make that awful (pfffttt) sound when cutting.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used them the past 2.5 years and they&#x27;re still cutting!</li>
            <li> Really not good!!!</li>
            <li> Too expensive for the quality.</li>
            <li> Which is a pain in the butt because it&#x27;s nearly impossible to have an \\&quot;on demand\\&quot; shear sharpener.</li>
            <li> Anyway, the thinning shears were terrible though.</li>

            <li> The presentation, speakes of quality and good looks, and as you use them you you know you made the right choice.</li>
            <li> these are by no means jowells but they are nice.  i&#x27;ve used them the past 2.5 years and they&#x27;re still cutting! i have had them sharpened twice, and cut hair everyday.</li>
            <li> Swivel is actually a nice feature...  fingers a little tight but ok with rubber inserts removed.  Not much experience with clippers beyond the 10-20 dollar kind but these are definitely a step up and then some.</li>
            <li> Everyone told me I might have to pay up to $600 for a great set of professional shears. I bought these for my daughter who tells me they work great. The price was definitely right, and because we&#x27;ve never compared them to $600 shears, I would rate as five stars.</li>
            <li> swivel is hard to get used to, feel too big when palming them. the thinning shear leave straight cut lines easily, not very blended looking. the teeth on thinning shears pulls hair when u carve/thin out the hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved the gift. Great shears.  She cuts my hair regularly and these stay sharp!!! Good price,  good product,  fast delivery!  All around good experience,  Tom</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve finally found a scissor that i like; i didn&#x27;t want to increase my arthritis.  they are really sharp and the tension adjustment works very well.  I haven&#x27;t tried to get them sharpened yet but i think the chromium and zinc in the stainless is high enough that i won&#x27;t have to for a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about these shears. I first ordered Suvorna&#x27;s set of blue cutting and texturizing shears which were $79.99, and returned them immediately because the hair would just bend! Even after tightening the tension screw, it would make that awful (pfffttt) sound when cutting. I could tell the shears were NOT sharp at ALL! I even had a client tell me \\&quot;ow\\&quot; when i tried to blend his haircut with the texturizing shears. So i sent them back and decided to buy these shears to see if maybe i just got a faulty pair. I can say that as a professional stylist, you can buy a GOOD cutting shear for the same price i paid for these, and you can also pay insane amounts of money for a crappy shear, too. I&#x27;ve had the luxury of being able to try out a lot of different shears. And i think these shears are made of a more carbonated steel so they don&#x27;t hold their sharpness as well. But they do seem to be much sharper than the other ones I bought. I am upset that i had to have them sharpened right off the bat. Which is a pain in the butt because it&#x27;s nearly impossible to have an \\&quot;on demand\\&quot; shear sharpener. You usually have to send them off to be sharpened, or make an appointment for weeks in advance to have your local sharpener come by your salon. But nevertheless, I shouldn&#x27;t have to have them sharpened right out of the box... which, by the way, the case that the shears were shipped in were NOT the case that is displayed in the pictures. Anyway, the thinning shears were terrible though. They weren&#x27;t even usable until I had them sharpened. I plan on keeping this set, but I will not be buying Suvorna Shears again.</li>
            <li> Just received them. The finger grips were hard to get in but once in they fit like a glove, I will need to tighten up the swivel thumbs are way to loose, but should be a easy fix. Will update once I have been able to use them more.</li>
            <li> I only had a short time to return them not long enough, I only used a couple of times and the cutting on them I could get the same cut from a $20 pair at Sally&#x27;s.  Really not good!!! Dont waist your time or money!!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent shear &amp; scissor set. The quality of the tools are impressive and they feel great in the hand. The swiveling thumb hole makes for a very comfortable DIY haircut when you get to the other side of your head. I found the finger inserts small at first, till I removed the rubber band lining (you are given 2 pairs of these). The packaging is nice though the fake leather case has a strong smell to it upon unwrapping. I cut my own hair with these &amp; sometimes a razor comb, and have learnt the value of using good tools for the job.</li>
            <li> They work perfect for me</li>
            <li> These are a great set and all I have used for the last 2 years. I keep 2 sets so I can rotate when one needs sharpening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added bonus is a lot of barbers won&#x27;t pick them up because of the swivel thumb. People get stuck in their ways and aren&#x27;t open to innovation.  This means no one touches my shears! I love it.</li>
            <li> They are nice but the plastic inserts fall out and I just don&#x27;t think the value it there.  Too expensive for the quality.</li>
            <li> After considering all of the more expensive stuff, I ended up going with this set because of the swiveling thumb.  Really makes it easy to get to the hard to reach areas of one&#x27;s own head.  I can&#x27;t compare them to the higher end stuff, but these cut effortlessly, cleanly and will clearly last a long time.  Totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> im a hairstylist and these are amazing! i notice my hands hurt less since my thumb can move freely. i use these everyday and i cannot see myself not using them. great price, and ive even dropped them like two or three times and there still ok, no nicks in the blade or anything breaking. the blades are a little long so i cut myself every once in awhile, but so does every stylists. love it, and i recommend this to everyone who needs professional equipment for a low price</li>
            <li> nice scissors but had to send them back, couldn&#x27;t deal with the swinging thumb  exchanged them for another pair</li>
            <li> They were great. Thumb seems down lower than my other ones but work great</li>
            <li> For some reason I felt inclined to cut my own hair.  I do not know what professional scissors are supposed to be like, but these did the trick for me and in the end my hair cut looked normal, and not like I was attacked by a weed-eater.  Score?</li>
            <li> Great shears! Professional here. Love them!</li>
