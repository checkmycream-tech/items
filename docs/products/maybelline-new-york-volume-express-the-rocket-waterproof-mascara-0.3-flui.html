            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>Very nice</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a drugstore-priced amazing mascara, skip the pricey brands and try this one!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest, I kinda like the volume this gives, but it&#x27;s so clumpy!</li>
            <li>A good workhorse mascara.</li>
            <li>Good thing</li>
            <li>I had a coupon, but if Maybelline paid me to take it, it still wouldn&#x27;t be a good value.</li>
            <li>but for the price it is a good option to have in your bag.</li>
            <li>I loved it.  </li>
            <li>However, my mom borrowed it and absolutely loved it, so I let her keep it.</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Either way I love it!</li>
            <li>better than the $30.00 brands; Maybelline keeps going on!</li>
            <li>I love putting it on every day!</li>
            <li>This mascara is amazing.</li>
            <li>of the reason it&#x27;s so amazing is the brush.</li>
            <li>and all was good :)</li>
            <li>nice mascara for the price</li>
            <li>For my sister and she liked it</li>
            <li>By far the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is an ok mascara, great color and staying power, but I don&#x27;t want my lashes sticking together as easily, where I can easily get &#x27;spider&#x27; legs as lashes.</li>
            <li>Love love love this mascara!</li>
            <li>Great Price &amp; Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for glam, this is fast, easy, effective, and beautiful.  </li>
            <li>I love everything</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better mascara from maybelline.</li>
            <li>Lovely volume, no clumping.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do anything magical like give you eyelashes that will hit the inside of the windshield as you drive, but what mascara does?</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump unless you put way too many layers.</li>
            <li>but I think I just need a better makeup remover.</li>
            <li>I have tried many that claim length or thickness</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how many times.</li>
            <li>This mascara is my favorite</li>
            <li>Love this brush and formula as there are NO flakes or clumps.</li>
            <li>still like the L&#x27;Or&amp;eacute;al Voluminous Million Lashes (waterproof) more.</li>
            <li>Probably now my favorite mascara, i went to the beach and wore it all day</li>
            <li>I would recommend this :)</li>
            <li>Love this mascara.</li>
            <li>The Rocket mascara makes my l lashes look longer and more defined.</li>
            <li>Most mascaras irritate my eyes by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>What I liked was that the \\&quot;advanced supersonic brush\\&quot; gave me the thicker and longer lash look</li>
            <li>I think I will start buying this more often.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump and it gives my eyelashes a long flawless look.</li>
            <li>Thickening is minimal at best.  </li>
            <li>The package says it is 6X clump free, contact lens safe and opthamologist tested.  </li>
            <li>And it really is waterproof, so you&#x27;ll need a really good makeup remover to get it off or it won&#x27;t come off.</li>
            <li>Came off easily with my cream cleanser and didn&#x27;t leave my lashes feeling brittle.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily and does not clump.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have to reapply during the day, and wipes off easily with makeup remover.</li>
            <li>This mascara is great, color is good, however I have trouble removing it.</li>
            <li>liked it a lot at first.</li>
            <li>Honestly a lot of high end mascaras burn more than this one does.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on easily and smoothly.</li>
            <li>(The Rocket and Colossal are my favorite mascaras.)</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t clump, and applies smooth and even on all lashes.</li>
            <li>The wand size is just right for reaching most of your lashes with one or two strokes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>maybelline&#x27;s Colossal Volume Express is far superior..</li>
            <li>It does a great job making my lashes look long and full.  </li>
            <li>and that made me super upset.</li>
            <li>It was better then I expected, not as bold as most</li>
            <li>Lasts all day, doesn&#x27;t smudge when I rub my eyes, and it gives my lashes a more natural thickness the day after.</li>
            <li>Adds just the right amount of length without seeming silly/fake.</li>
            <li>I would not have normally gotten mascara from Amazon, but this specific kind was tried and true for me.</li>
            <li>So many people say that it&#x27;s great at volumizing, so that makes me wonder if I&#x27;m just applying it wrong.</li>
            <li>I have always used Estee Lauder mascara until recently when someone recommended Maybelline New York Full &#x27;N Soft Waterproof Mascara which is almost as good as EL and 1/4 of the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>pretty fast.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Most certantly it would last a week if you don&#x27;t want to take off makeup...</li>
            <li>and if you are willing to spend a little more on a fantastic mascar that is waterproof &amp; wil increase volume and length by leaps and bounds then go for Benefit&#x27;s</li>
            <li>First off, I order waterproof so it could help my straight lashes hold a curl</li>
            <li>The tiny brush is so easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li>This mascara is not without clumps but which one really is?</li>
            <li>holds curl and lengthens really well.</li>
            <li>It really brings out your eye lashes and makes them look fuller and stronger.</li>
            <li>This mascara holds the curl and is very waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybelline&#x27;s claims on their packaging are absolutely the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t build very well - gets clumpy</li>
            <li>Thank u so much.</li>
            <li>Really like this mascara.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend it if your are looking for clump-free length.</li>
            <li>Too many other mascaras out</li>
            <li>Love this stuff and hope it doesn&#x27;t get discontinued like Maybelline&#x27;s previous mascaras that I used to use.&lt;br /&gt;(Included</li>
            <li>hope you have a decent eye makeup remover if you make a mistake.</li>
            <li>I chose this particular mascara because of a YouTube review.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It clumped a little, thought it would be better.</li>
            <li>This will give you a little more length.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally write reviews</li>
            <li>This mascara makes my lashes look full and long.  </li>
            <li>I put on about 2-3 coats every day when doing my makeup and my eyelashes look very full but still natural and not flakey like a lot of other girls&#x27; mascaras I see.</li>
            <li>Not to sound like every other review on mascara a, but it leghthens and volumizes without being clumpy and disgusting.&lt;br /&gt;Half</li>
            <li>My eyes are very sensitive.</li>
            <li>Very cautious of makeup in general.</li>
            <li>I have spent the last year buying &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; mascara only to have it clump, smear, or just not be effective.</li>
            <li>This is the first mascara that I&#x27;ve used that claimed to be waterproof and actually was.</li>
            <li>At the end of the day it looked as fresh as when initially applied, and removed easily with her usual non-oily makeup wipes.</li>
            <li>putting your mascara on as normal, then put a little on the top of the tips of the upper lash.  </li>
            <li>It is fantastic and a better bargain than the Maybelline Megaplush waterproof mascara that was really a disappointment.</li>
            <li>This mascara is great in a pinch, but unfortunately it caused my lashes to clump a LOT - to the point that I was only passing over my lashes once and still seeing my lashes clump together.</li>
            <li>and they are still soft.</li>
            <li>I have fairly short and straight lashes and this gives them the length with a bit of a curl and the end.</li>
            <li>My only issue is that it doesn&#x27;t really thickens my eyelashes like it says it should.</li>
            <li>This mascara will give you natural volume without clumping or heaviness.</li>
            <li>The lengthening portion is amazing and seriously makes my eyelashes look like they&#x27;re going for miles!</li>
            <li>I find that the formula is quite heavy and kind of weighs my lashes down.</li>
            <li>I have long fairly thick lashes, but they&#x27;re very straight and light at the end.</li>
            <li>The waterproof formula is a bit tricky to get off however, as it should be, and has barely streaked or melted while I wear it, even while swimming in the pool or at the beach.</li>
            <li>I recently got this mascara and was expecting it to be amazing, and I was definitely wrong.</li>
            <li>This is not dry, not clumpy, and layers well.</li>
            <li>Maybelline is notorious for changing formulations and emilinating product lines, so I hope this particular mascara is here to stay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great length extension and volume, deep dark color, and no clumps---all with waterproof staying power.</li>

            <li> This mascara makes my lashes look full and long.  </li>
            <li> I put on about 2-3 coats every day when doing my makeup and my eyelashes look very full but still natural and not flakey like a lot of other girls&#x27; mascaras I see.</li>
            <li> Not to sound like every other review on mascara a, but it leghthens and volumizes without being clumpy and disgusting.&lt;br /&gt;Half</li>
            <li> My eyes are very sensitive.</li>
            <li> Very cautious of makeup in general.</li>
            <li> I have spent the last year buying &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; mascara only to have it clump, smear, or just not be effective.</li>
            <li> This is the first mascara that I&#x27;ve used that claimed to be waterproof and actually was.</li>
            <li> At the end of the day it looked as fresh as when initially applied, and removed easily with her usual non-oily makeup wipes.</li>
            <li> putting your mascara on as normal, then put a little on the top of the tips of the upper lash.  </li>
            <li> It is fantastic and a better bargain than the Maybelline Megaplush waterproof mascara that was really a disappointment.</li>
            <li> This mascara is great in a pinch, but unfortunately it caused my lashes to clump a LOT - to the point that I was only passing over my lashes once and still seeing my lashes clump together.</li>
            <li> and they are still soft.</li>
            <li> I have fairly short and straight lashes and this gives them the length with a bit of a curl and the end.</li>
            <li> My only issue is that it doesn&#x27;t really thickens my eyelashes like it says it should.</li>
            <li> This mascara will give you natural volume without clumping or heaviness.</li>
            <li> The lengthening portion is amazing and seriously makes my eyelashes look like they&#x27;re going for miles!</li>
            <li> I find that the formula is quite heavy and kind of weighs my lashes down.</li>
            <li> I have long fairly thick lashes, but they&#x27;re very straight and light at the end.</li>
            <li> The waterproof formula is a bit tricky to get off however, as it should be, and has barely streaked or melted while I wear it, even while swimming in the pool or at the beach.</li>
            <li> I recently got this mascara and was expecting it to be amazing, and I was definitely wrong.</li>
            <li> This is not dry, not clumpy, and layers well.</li>
            <li> Maybelline is notorious for changing formulations and emilinating product lines, so I hope this particular mascara is here to stay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great length extension and volume, deep dark color, and no clumps---all with waterproof staying power.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re real mascara (have cried with it on and swam with it without leaks or streaks or clumping or any mess!).</li>
            <li> Water proof and long lasting</li>
            <li> Another trick is to use \\&quot;LaCombe Oscillation Powerbooster\\&quot; (a white lash product) on your lashes, let dry, and then use the mascara as I just stated.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not clumpy if you use a spooly after application like I do, usually two coats and comb it out gently while still wet.</li>
            <li> It volumizes, lengthens, is waterproof, and lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> I wear it all day long, from about 6:00 am to 9:00 pm with no</li>
            <li> I let dry between coats and use a clean/old mascara brush to go over the lashes to remove clumps and separate them.</li>
            <li> and this one is one of only a few that actually do that.</li>
            <li> It does not make my lashes as long or as thick as other mascaras, but rather it gives them a very natural and understated feminine look that I prefer.</li>
            <li> All I wanted was a simple mascara that gave my limp lashes volume and held a curl</li>
            <li> I did have a few tony clumps after the second coat</li>
            <li> but I took an eyelash comb through while they were still wet</li>
            <li> Did not give me the lengthening of the lashes I expected.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I should say that I have naturally long and curled eyelashes, but they&#x27;re on the lighter and thinner side, so this helps make them slightly thicker and slightly longer, and definitely makes them dark.</li>
            <li> but it is very light and makes your eye lashes look long and natural in stead of having all those nasty clumps in the eye lashes.</li>
            <li> update: While is does make really nhice intensively black lashes, it can be difficult to remove all of it, which may cause a buildup or caking after a couple of days of trying to get that last bit off.</li>
            <li> I have been using one of the other Maybelline mascaras for about a year.</li>
            <li> a photo of me wearing it without any other eye makeup after an 8-hour day of classes)</li>
            <li> However, I find that it causes my lashes to be rather clumpy after a few swipes (not allowing it to dry in between).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many methods to remove it, and I hate it.</li>
            <li> The stick part, yanno the part the brisels are on is thick but the brisles themselves are short and plastic.</li>
            <li> This one does a little, but not as much as other drug store mascaras.</li>
            <li> It is in a green tube, think it is the Clump Crusher.</li>
            <li> Messy.</li>
            <li> It makes my eyelashes fall out and break in half!</li>
            <li> It is waterproof and very black.  </li>
            <li> As stated, it was very black.  </li>
            <li> Each time, I look like one of the sad, recently eliminated Bachelorettes crying as they are kicked out of the mansion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bet acetone would work; too bad it can&#x27;t be used there, haha.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda hard to get off</li>
            <li> So if you are looking for durability of mascara, this is almost bullet proof, at least make up cloth removing proof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thick.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lengthen at all, so I get thick, stubby lashes.</li>
            <li> The mascara goes on clumpy and too thick.  </li>
            <li> No offense if you are going for the Kim Kardashian look, but it looks ridiculous on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> very hard to get off.</li>
            <li> I thought I could only get by applying false lashes!!!  </li>
            <li> This mascara is hard core, it is so difficult to take off at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> look which I hate, and that was after only 2 coats.  </li>
            <li> Seriously!</li>
            <li> but instead I got the wrong formula and clumpy lashes.</li>
            <li> , the brush didn&#x27;t work for me and fake looking lashes.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  </li>
            <li> My lashes look almost fake.</li>
            <li> The Rocket stinks.  </li>
            <li> I have always sort of hated mascaras before using that product because they were too thick</li>
            <li> It is not particularly great for volume, but you can always layer with this as a base.</li>
            <li> However, they do mean it when they say waterproof!!!</li>
            <li> but this mascara was so bad I had too.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Too bad.</li>
            <li> horribly disappointed with this mascara.</li>
            <li> and I am terribly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> excellent phone I love everything</li>
            <li> horribly disappointed with this mascara. maybelline&#x27;s Colossal Volume Express is far superior.. and if you are willing to spend a little more on a fantastic mascar that is waterproof &amp; wil increase volume and length by leaps and bounds then go for Benefit&#x27;s they&#x27;re real mascara (have cried with it on and swam with it without leaks or streaks or clumping or any mess!). That is a wayyyyyyyy superior product!</li>
            <li> I recently got this mascara and was expecting it to be amazing, and I was definitely wrong. I don&#x27;t normally write reviews but this mascara was so bad I had too.  First off, I order waterproof so it could help my straight lashes hold a curl and it came to my door a regular washable mascara and that made me super upset. Then, I decided to try it and it did NOT give me volume but it did give me the &#x27;&#x27;spiderey&#x27;&#x27; look which I hate, and that was after only 2 coats.  All I wanted was a simple mascara that gave my limp lashes volume and held a curl but instead I got the wrong formula and clumpy lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, I kinda like the volume this gives, but it&#x27;s so clumpy! Seriously! It drys my eyelashes out and it sticks to them like glue! I can NOT get this off with any product! I&#x27;ve tried so many methods to remove it, and I hate it. It makes my eyelashes fall out and break in half!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better mascara from maybelline. It does not give a lot of volume.</li>
            <li> I have been using one of the other Maybelline mascaras for about a year. Lovely volume, no clumping. It is in a green tube, think it is the Clump Crusher. I have always sort of hated mascaras before using that product because they were too thick, the brush didn&#x27;t work for me and fake looking lashes. No offense if you are going for the Kim Kardashian look, but it looks ridiculous on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I am at local store and decide to upgrade to another product by Maybelline and I am terribly disappointed. Messy. Thick. Cannot control the brush. Once applied, it is on there like glue, so hope you have a decent eye makeup remover if you make a mistake. I did, so I tried again. And again. And again. Each time, I look like one of the sad, recently eliminated Bachelorettes crying as they are kicked out of the mansion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara is going in the makeup drawer where discredited beauty products go to die.</li>
            <li> yep, it&#x27;s mascara.  I thought it was waterproof, it&#x27;s not, but it also doesn&#x27;t claim to be, so that was my mistake.</li>
            <li> Excellent item.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> A good workhorse mascara. This is not dry, not clumpy, and layers well. Doesn&#x27;t do anything magical like give you eyelashes that will hit the inside of the windshield as you drive, but what mascara does?</li>
            <li> , I have always used Maybelline  mascara.  Some I would buy again, but some I would not, this one I would</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome, it works awesome it doesn&#x27;t rub off, it takes a bit of time to get off tho</li>
            <li> This is a great waterproof mascara for a person where &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; does not always work.</li>
            <li> best macara ive used üëç</li>
            <li> Love it!  I&#x27;ll buy again</li>
            <li> Great waterproof mascara! Sweated my tail off doing a workout and then went swimming. It didn&#x27;t budge at all!! Came off easily with my cream cleanser and didn&#x27;t leave my lashes feeling brittle. Gave it 4 stars bc I did have a few tony clumps after the second coat but I took an eyelash comb through while they were still wet and all was good :)</li>
            <li> nice mascara for the price</li>
            <li> This mascara makes my lashes look full and long.  I am in my 30s and I do believe I&#x27;ve finally found the mascara for me.  I chose this particular mascara because of a YouTube review.</li>
            <li> This is the only mascara that will hold my curl! I love it! It doesn&#x27;t clump unless you put way too many layers. It doesn&#x27;t flake and it doesn&#x27;t smudge. It&#x27;s kinda hard to get off but I think I just need a better makeup remover. Either way I love it!</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  I don&#x27;t see any difference in the length AT ALL.  Thickening is minimal at best.  Had to use several applications to see any difference .  I won&#x27;t be buying this one again.  Too many other mascaras out that work to bother with this one.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Water proof and long lasting</li>
            <li> Very cautious of makeup in general. This mascara is not without clumps but which one really is? I let dry between coats and use a clean/old mascara brush to go over the lashes to remove clumps and separate them. Adds just the right amount of length without seeming silly/fake. Lasts all day, doesn&#x27;t smudge when I rub my eyes, and it gives my lashes a more natural thickness the day after.</li>
            <li> liked it a lot at first. holds curl and lengthens really well. however its like cement on your eyelashes. very hard to get off. after about a week or two it made my eyelashes start to fall out. won&#x27;t repurchase</li>
            <li> It not only thickens and lengthens but doesn&#x27;t look clumpy. My eyes pop with this mascara. I have tried many that claim length or thickness and this one is one of only a few that actually do that.</li>
            <li> Maybelline is my go-to brand for mascara. Not so for this stuff. The brush is giant, cumbersome, and fearsome to wield in the eye area! It doesn&#x27;t lengthen at all, so I get thick, stubby lashes. Then the stuff won&#x27;t come off! It&#x27;s like I have glue on my eyes. In trying to get it off my eyelids will even stick together. I bet acetone would work; too bad it can&#x27;t be used there, haha. Good thing I had a coupon, but if Maybelline paid me to take it, it still wouldn&#x27;t be a good value. Going back to the Lash Discovery. Don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s not waterproof. The tiny brush is so easy to maneuver. Best rethink this one, Maybelline!</li>
            <li> It really brings out your eye lashes and makes them look fuller and stronger. I use this almost every day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always gone back to this mascara I don&#x27;t know how many times. For me, I have really short lashes and these just help with it! This mascara is my favorite</li>
            <li> This is a great waterproof. I have long fairly thick lashes, but they&#x27;re very straight and light at the end. This mascara holds the curl and is very waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not clumpy if you use a spooly after application like I do, usually two coats and comb it out gently while still wet. No complaints!</li>
            <li> Great mascara for the price. Love this brush and formula as there are NO flakes or clumps.</li>
            <li> The volume and length I thought I could only get by applying false lashes!!!  No clumping, no flaking, and stays on until YOU decide to remove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used  L&#x27;Oreal Double Lash prior to trying the Rocket.  If you&#x27;re looking for glam, this is fast, easy, effective, and beautiful.  Maybelline&#x27;s claims on their packaging are absolutely the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even had a stranger in a convenience store (he was with his wife) tell me I had the prettiest eyes he&#x27;d ever seen!  Thank you, Maybelline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is now MY mascara.  PLEASE, Maybelline, don&#x27;t remove this from the market!!!</li>
            <li> Like this one....but?  Goes on easily and does not clump. Did not give me the lengthening of the lashes I expected.</li>
            <li> This mascara is amazing. It volumizes, lengthens, is waterproof, and lasts for a long time. It is fantastic and a better bargain than the Maybelline Megaplush waterproof mascara that was really a disappointment. (The Rocket and Colossal are my favorite mascaras.)</li>
            <li> It clumped a little, thought it would be better.</li>
            <li> Love love love this mascara! Granted my eyelashes are on the longer side anyway, but this mascara defines, thickens and lengthens without clumps and they are still soft. Love it!!</li>
            <li> For my sister and she liked it</li>
            <li> Best mascara ever. Not to sound like every other review on mascara a, but it leghthens and volumizes without being clumpy and disgusting.&lt;br /&gt;Half of the reason it&#x27;s so amazing is the brush. The stick part, yanno the part the brisels are on is thick but the brisles themselves are short and plastic. All in all, a perfect mascara wand.&lt;br /&gt;Point driven.</li>
            <li> It does a great job making my lashes look long and full.  I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Great mascara. Builds lashes and makes them thicker and longer. However, they do mean it when they say waterproof!!!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t all that for my Asian lashes...I find that the formula is quite heavy and kind of weighs my lashes down. It also doesn&#x27;t build very well - gets clumpy pretty fast.&lt;br /&gt;I still like the L&#x27;Or&amp;eacute;al Voluminous Million Lashes (waterproof) more.</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every waterproof mascara on the market, from Lancome to Wet and Wild and this beats them all.</li>
            <li> I have always used Estee Lauder mascara until recently when someone recommended Maybelline New York Full &#x27;N Soft Waterproof Mascara which is almost as good as EL and 1/4 of the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The applicator on the Volume Express The Rocket stinks.  The mascara goes on clumpy and too thick.  The mascara itself may be great but I didn&#x27;t bother using another applicator.  Just returned to what works for me instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad.</li>
            <li> Probably now my favorite mascara, i went to the beach and wore it all day and it lasted. I would recommend this :)</li>
            <li> Love this mascara. Doesn&#x27;t clump, and applies smooth and even on all lashes. Don&#x27;t have to reapply during the day, and wipes off easily with makeup remover. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Maybelline Volume Express The Rocket mascara makes my l lashes look longer and more defined. The waterproof formula holds up to water and tears like a champ and doesn&#x27;t flake or smudge. I have fairly short and straight lashes and this gives them the length with a bit of a curl and the end. My go-to waterproof mascara for an affordable price.</li>
            <li> My eyes are very sensitive. Most mascaras irritate my eyes by the end of the day. This one does a little, but not as much as other drug store mascaras. Honestly a lot of high end mascaras burn more than this one does. I like this one and will buy it again knowing that I won&#x27;t cry it all off from my eyes burning.</li>
            <li> better than the $30.00 brands; Maybelline keeps going on!</li>
            <li> I think this is a great mascara! The lengthening portion is amazing and seriously makes my eyelashes look like they&#x27;re going for miles! And it really is waterproof, so you&#x27;ll need a really good makeup remover to get it off or it won&#x27;t come off. My only issue is that it doesn&#x27;t really thickens my eyelashes like it says it should. So many people say that it&#x27;s great at volumizing, so that makes me wonder if I&#x27;m just applying it wrong. Hmm. Anyway, I might try buying another Maybelline mascara for volume and try layering it. But this product is great!</li>
            <li> Current HG waterproof mascara. I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2-3 years now and don&#x27;t plan on discontinuing use unless Maybelline decides to discontinue it like they did for my last two HG mascaras....&lt;br /&gt;I should say that I have naturally long and curled eyelashes, but they&#x27;re on the lighter and thinner side, so this helps make them slightly thicker and slightly longer, and definitely makes them dark. I put on about 2-3 coats every day when doing my makeup and my eyelashes look very full but still natural and not flakey like a lot of other girls&#x27; mascaras I see. The waterproof formula is a bit tricky to get off however, as it should be, and has barely streaked or melted while I wear it, even while swimming in the pool or at the beach. I use Albolene to get it off with the rest of my makeup, and that seems to do the trick. Love this stuff and hope it doesn&#x27;t get discontinued like Maybelline&#x27;s previous mascaras that I used to use.&lt;br /&gt;(Included a photo of me wearing it without any other eye makeup after an 8-hour day of classes)</li>
            <li> I bought this off a recommendation on youtube. I have spent the last year buying &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; mascara only to have it clump, smear, or just not be effective. This stuff works well- probably not the BEST volume  I have ever had but for the price it is a good option to have in your bag.</li>
            <li> This mascara is great, color is good, however I have trouble removing it. LOL So they ask if it last all day? Most certantly it would last a week if you don&#x27;t want to take off makeup...</li>
            <li> I see we have some mixed reviews on Amazon.  I loved it.  It is waterproof and very black.  The package says it is 6X clump free, contact lens safe and opthamologist tested.  What I liked was that the \\&quot;advanced supersonic brush\\&quot; gave me the thicker and longer lash look that I like, without the clumps. As stated, it was very black.  I wear it all day long, from about 6:00 am to 9:00 pm with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try putting your mascara on as normal, then put a little on the top of the tips of the upper lash.  This will give you a little more length.  Another trick is to use \\&quot;LaCombe Oscillation Powerbooster\\&quot; (a white lash product) on your lashes, let dry, and then use the mascara as I just stated.  This LaCombe product is supposed to be like a vitamin shot for your lashes, but it also gives you a fuller, longer look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy lashing...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note update: While is does make really nhice intensively black lashes, it can be difficult to remove all of it, which may cause a buildup or caking after a couple of days of trying to get that last bit off.</li>
            <li> Seeing my teen daughter&#x27;s \\&quot;raccoon eyes\\&quot; provoked me to buy her a range of different mascara to test, and this Rocket brand was the winner of the bunch. Maybelline is notorious for changing formulations and emilinating product lines, so I hope this particular mascara is here to stay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great length extension and volume, deep dark color, and no clumps---all with waterproof staying power. My daughter wore this to an outdoor band practice and it survived sweat, heat, and a brief rain shower: no raccoon eyes. At the end of the day it looked as fresh as when initially applied, and removed easily with her usual non-oily makeup wipes. The wand size is just right for reaching most of your lashes with one or two strokes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a drugstore-priced amazing mascara, skip the pricey brands and try this one!</li>
            <li> Great Price &amp; Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li> This mascara is great in a pinch, but unfortunately it caused my lashes to clump a LOT - to the point that I was only passing over my lashes once and still seeing my lashes clump together. However, my mom borrowed it and absolutely loved it, so I let her keep it. She hasn&#x27;t had any problems with clumping at all.</li>
            <li> It was better then I expected, not as bold as most but it is very light and makes your eye lashes look long and natural in stead of having all those nasty clumps in the eye lashes. Very nice I think I will start buying this more often. Thank u so much.</li>
            <li> This mascara will give you natural volume without clumping or heaviness. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Really like this mascara. It doesn&#x27;t clump and it gives my eyelashes a long flawless look.</li>
            <li> It is waterproof but it doesn&#x27;t provide &amp;#34;wow factor&amp;#34; lashes. It adds color but no fullness or volume. I will wear this when I need a conservative look.</li>
            <li> This mascara is hard core, it is so difficult to take off at the end of the day. So if you are looking for durability of mascara, this is almost bullet proof, at least make up cloth removing proof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on easily and smoothly. However, I find that it causes my lashes to be rather clumpy after a few swipes (not allowing it to dry in between). I almost wish I had a comb for my lashes before it dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is an ok mascara, great color and staying power, but I don&#x27;t want my lashes sticking together as easily, where I can easily get &#x27;spider&#x27; legs as lashes.</li>
            <li> By far the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. My lashes look almost fake. I love putting it on every day!</li>
            <li> This is great! Lots of volume, no clumps!</li>
            <li> This product came in perfect condition. I would not have normally gotten mascara from Amazon, but this specific kind was tried and true for me. I absolutely recommend it if your are looking for clump-free length. It is not particularly great for volume, but you can always layer with this as a base.</li>
            <li> This is the first mascara that I&#x27;ve used that claimed to be waterproof and actually was. I was starting to wonder if one could be found at around this price point, and it could. I cried, wiped my eyes, even took a shower, and it still stuck until I removed it with a towelette. It does not make my lashes as long or as thick as other mascaras, but rather it gives them a very natural and understated feminine look that I prefer. If you are looking for night club eyes look elsewhere.</li>
