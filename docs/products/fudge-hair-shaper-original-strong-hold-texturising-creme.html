            <li>It is usually a pleasant melon smell.</li>
            <li>Oh, it smells good too.  </li>
            <li>It smells so good, you almost want to eat it.  </li>
            <li>Hope you continue to carry Fudge products and the Hair shaper for sure!  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>This stuff brings out I nice glossy shine and gives a bit of manageability.  </li>
            <li>Good price, free shipping, what&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li>This is probably the best Hair Shaper for a nice dry look out there.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I can still buy it</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love fudge shaper.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even sure if they still make it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best thing for short hair.</li>
            <li>Great hold but pliable  Fast shipment.</li>
            <li>I love that it is water soluble, too.</li>
            <li>With luck, it will continue to be available forever!</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and was very excited about the product till I used it.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser likes it so much for her own hair, I got for her one too!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time and recommend it to everyone to style the hair: non-greasy, strong hold and delicious scent - what&#x27;s more to ask for?</li>
            <li>It smells nice, is easy to apply and you don&#x27;t need much to get a really nice style out of it.  </li>
            <li>Seller did fine and delivery was on time</li>
            <li>overall good purchase</li>
            <li>Be sure to really rub it onto your hands because it can clump in your hair.  </li>
            <li>I have tried them all, and this the only wax that gives hold without heaviness - keeps my set in for a long time and has a wonderful scent.</li>
            <li>FAST SHIPPING,GOOD PRICE,&amp;GREAT PRODUCT!!  </li>
            <li>I have thick, but fine hair, and this product styles it great, without making it greasy or sticky, even though it feels that way when you put it on your hands.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works well, smells nice and with several hand swipes through my hair</li>
            <li>It still seems to work and look much the same though, prob not quite as good.</li>
            <li>Everyone bought it cause they liked it, please change it back.</li>
            <li>After trying so many poor quality shapers this one is by far the best, it styles your hair exactly how you want it</li>
            <li>Shampoo and style as normal and use  fudge to seprtate and make your style unique</li>
            <li>and it needs a little help to look good.  </li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>The styling creme should have more fullness to it, I have bought this product many times and this batch does not have the \\&quot;hold\\&quot; as usual.</li>
            <li>I have short hair and have tried many products over the years.</li>
            <li>I have tried many styling products over the years because I keep my hair very short</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s past its best, or its a good fake.</li>
            <li>i look like a straight up pimp</li>
            <li>The price has continued to sneak up over the years, but not by that much.</li>
            <li>I question if it is in fact the real thing?</li>
            <li>It is now like its been whipped and is white rather than the yellow kind of colour.</li>
            <li>Actually, my hairdresser turned me on to Fudge Hair Shaper and the reason why I like it is because it is water soluble and it does not have the thick kind of sticky buildup that most styling products do.  </li>
            <li>The smell, while not particularly strong is honestly amazing.</li>
            <li>It is becoming more and more difficult to find, so I bought two jars which will last me a while.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I&#x27;ve used it the first time, I&#x27;ve grown my hair out, and now that I&#x27;m back to short hair, I&#x27;m so glad it&#x27;s still in production</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;ve used Fudge&#x27;s Hair Shaper product for the better part of a decade, the last three containers I&#x27;ve purchased confirm that Fudge has apparently changed the product&#x27;s formulation.  </li>
            <li>However the most recent order has definitely changed consistency.</li>
            <li>Since the manufacturer has clearly changed the product, they should really change the packaging.  </li>
            <li>Normally I purchase the product from her</li>
            <li>I love this product, but it&#x27;s not available in the US any longer.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t like the new stuff,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve started using this product 10 years ago, in New Zealand.</li>
            <li>and you can get different levels of firmness depending on your hair, highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The old formulation had a moist, gooey consistency.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hold my short hair and is very sticky.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend for you short haired girls and guys who need a product that works but doesn&#x27;t look like you have a product in your hair.  </li>
            <li>This product works really well, just mix it with a little water on the palms of your hands and will hold it really well.</li>
            <li>I have sandy blonde very straight hair, and I am going slightly grey.  </li>
            <li>And as it does not take much to do the job, this jar will last me several months.  </li>
            <li>The texture was different, not smooth and easy to work with, but dry and sticky.</li>
            <li>The new formulation is dry and rubbery to the touch.</li>
            <li>I holds my short hair right where I want it without leaving it sticky or heavy feeling.</li>
            <li>I much prefer the previous formulation over the new formulation, and I&#x27;m pretty annoyed that Fudge would drastically modify its long-standing product without renaming it or changing its packaging to somehow notify consumers.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s one of the few hair products I use; extremely thick, full hair and Fudge works to tame it but also</li>
            <li> This is not greasy or wet</li>
            <li> This product is not the same product that I used in the past.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other products in this category and nothing matches its quality and effectiveness.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser started me using this about 8 years ago and compaired to other products on the market</li>
            <li> I have used Fudge Hair Shaper for many years, and I have never been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> This stuff although expensive, is the real deal when it comes to hair shaping.</li>
            <li> It is also less sticky.</li>
            <li> and I had the product in less than 3 days.</li>
            <li> give it a little lift.  </li>
            <li> so I recommend just little dab will do ya.  </li>
            <li> It also takes very little to accomplish what I want to accomplish with my hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick styling cream</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely difficult to find anywhere.</li>

            <li> Seller did fine and delivery was on time/packaged well, however the contents of the package is a different formula to the one I&#x27;ve used for over 10 years. Either the makers have changed it (quite possible - product still works well), it&#x27;s past its best, or its a good fake.</li>
            <li> The only place I can get this since moving back to the States.</li>
            <li> i look like a straight up pimp</li>
            <li> this is great to provide good hold and shine.&lt;br /&gt;great for fohawks !!!! overall good purchase</li>
            <li> I have been buying this product for 15 years. The product I received from this seller was different. Maybe the formula changed????  The texture was different, not smooth and easy to work with, but dry and sticky. The fragrance was different as well. It is usually a pleasant melon smell. I would need confirmation that the formula changed. But my husband and I do not care for the product we received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe the seller could comment.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product on and off from over 15 years.  It works well, smells nice and with several hand swipes through my hair essentially &#x27;brushes out&#x27;.  The price has continued to sneak up over the years, but not by that much.</li>
            <li> The styling creme should have more fullness to it, I have bought this product many times and this batch does not have the \\&quot;hold\\&quot; as usual. I question if it is in fact the real thing?</li>
            <li> The product is different!  They changed it and I don&#x27;t like the new stuff, and now I&#x27;m stuck with three containers of it.</li>
            <li> This product is not the same product that I used in the past.  It&#x27;s a different color and it doesn&#x27;t hold as well.  Since the manufacturer has clearly changed the product, they should really change the packaging.  It&#x27;s misleading to people who buy it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff !!! Nothing works as well for my hair . I&#x27;m glad I can still buy it</li>
            <li> This product works really well, just mix it with a little water on the palms of your hands and will hold it really well. I have shorter hair, use it often.</li>
            <li> I found this product when I was in Europe this summer.  I bought it but can&#x27;t find it here.  So that I wouldn&#x27;t run out I checked on Amazon.  I love this product.  I have short hair and have tried many products over the years. This is not greasy or wet it just holds your hair and leaves it workable and touchable.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best Hair Shaper for a nice dry look out there.  It smells nice, is easy to apply and you don&#x27;t need much to get a really nice style out of it.  Best suited for shorter hair though.  This is one of the best hair shaping products out there - been using it for 3 years now and love it.  Just try it - you&#x27;ll never use anything else!</li>
            <li> Best hair shaper ever. After trying so many poor quality shapers this one is by far the best, it styles your hair exactly how you want it and you can get different levels of firmness depending on your hair, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have found that I can use for my unruly hair.  If you have hair like mine, go for it.</li>
            <li> It holds indivual twists perfectly.  Shampoo and style as normal and use  fudge to seprtate and make your style unique</li>
            <li> I have been using this Fudge product for 6+ years and I love it. I holds my short hair right where I want it without leaving it sticky or heavy feeling.</li>
            <li> I love fudge shaper. I&#x27;ve been using it for 10 years. It&#x27;s extremely difficult to find anywhere. I&#x27;m not even sure if they still make it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. It&#x27;s te best does the job and then some. I have tried other products in this category and nothing matches its quality and effectiveness. Hope you continue to carry Fudge products and the Hair shaper for sure!  Laura de la Torre Walling</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a long time now. I saw some reviews about being changed but the last lot I got was the same. However the most recent order has definitely changed consistency. It is now like its been whipped and is white rather than the yellow kind of colour. It is also less sticky. It still seems to work and look much the same though, prob not quite as good. I have it 4 because it changed without notice for no reason. Everyone bought it cause they liked it, please change it back.</li>
            <li> I have tried many styling products over the years because I keep my hair very short and it needs a little help to look good.

            <li> Best hair product ever for men. Stays in all week</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using this product 10 years ago, in New Zealand. It&#x27;s the best thing for short hair. I have thick, but fine hair, and this product styles it great, without making it greasy or sticky, even though it feels that way when you put it on your hands.&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve used it the first time, I&#x27;ve grown my hair out, and now that I&#x27;m back to short hair, I&#x27;m so glad it&#x27;s still in production and I can find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have been using Fudge for years. My hair dresser started me using this about 8 years ago and compaired to other products on the market it is the best. Normally I purchase the product from her but she was out so I used Amazon. Amazon came through for me and I had the product in less than 3 days.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but it&#x27;s not available in the US any longer.  Good price, free shipping, what&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> It smells so good, you almost want to eat it.  But I was frantic when my stylist told me she couldn&#x27;t get Fudge thru her supplier any longer.  It&#x27;s one of the few hair products I use; extremely thick, full hair and Fudge works to tame it but also give it a little lift.  It&#x27;s very thick styling cream so I recommend just little dab will do ya.  Be sure to really rub it onto your hands because it can clump in your hair.  And as it does not take much to do the job, this jar will last me several months.  And about the same cost as from my stylist.  Thrilled to have found this on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have sandy blonde very straight hair, and I am going slightly grey.  This stuff brings out I nice glossy shine and gives a bit of manageability.  Folks have asked me about my haircut since I&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for hold. It doesn&#x27;t hold my short hair and is very sticky. I read the reviews and was very excited about the product till I used it.</li>
            <li> FAST SHIPPING,GOOD PRICE,&amp;GREAT PRODUCT!!  WILL BUY FROM AGAIN!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Great hold but pliable  Fast shipment. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> This stuff although expensive, is the real deal when it comes to hair shaping. It really gives you that just tossed out of bed messy look that people like myself rock daily. The smell, while not particularly strong is honestly amazing. I find myself just standing there smelling the jar from time to time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time and recommend it to everyone to style the hair: non-greasy, strong hold and delicious scent - what&#x27;s more to ask for? It is simply GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> I have used Fudge Hair Shaper for many years, and I have never been disappointed.  I love that it is water soluble, too. With luck, it will continue to be available forever!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 10 years, and it turns out they did ideed alter the formula.  It is virtually a completely different product from what it used to be.  The texture is different, and it does not hold as well.  I will not be using this going foward.</li>
            <li> I have tried them all, and this the only wax that gives hold without heaviness - keeps my set in for a long time and has a wonderful scent. Great if want a piecey look as well. My hairdresser likes it so much for her own hair, I got for her one too!</li>
