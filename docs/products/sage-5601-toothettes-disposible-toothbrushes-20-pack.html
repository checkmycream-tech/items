            <li>loved it!</li>
            <li>These toothettes are great.</li>
            <li>Great for the elderly or the frail.</li>
            <li>So, these are indeed good for getting the fuzz off your teeth</li>
            <li>Great - much better than the things you get at Walmart.</li>
            <li>Im guessing they are expecting me to put some in my own ziplock bag?</li>
            <li>amazing specially when travelling or at work!</li>
            <li>(tooth powder is better).</li>
            <li>Toothettes don&#x27;t have a taste, are faster to use and do a better job.</li>
            <li>These are not my favorite.</li>
            <li>they are ok, they need to be longer than they are</li>
            <li>She finds it refreshing, and not as upsetting as a hard-bristled tooth brush.</li>
            <li>Great and fast Service .</li>
            <li>The package I received had a strong sweet-minty scent.  </li>
            <li>How am I suppose to stick these in my purse, pocket or bag for quick on the run use if they arent even sanitary wrapped?!</li>
            <li>Since, I am dealing with 100, 80 to 50 feet of oxygen breathing tubes that go with me almost everywhere in the house, and I just got comfortable, have my book, my shawl on and have place all the Anchie Crystal pouches on the places that hurt</li>
            <li>I dip in natural (tea tree oil-based) mouthwash to clean the teeth and gums of a frail loved one.</li>
            <li>I use it to clean my stoma.  </li>
            <li>Stem is made of paper and falls apart quickly.  </li>
            <li>This just occurred to me--these would be excellent for using with an ill person who can&#x27;t tolerate strong toothpaste taste.</li>
            <li>This item proved useful for brushing my teeth when visiting a country where using the tap water out of the sink was not advised.</li>
            <li>they are priced right</li>
            <li>thank you very much...</li>
            <li>actually like these much better than the toothbrush and toothpaste</li>
            <li>They much easier to deal with than carrying a toothbrush and toothpaste in your purse or briefcase.</li>
            <li>Been there done that, but did not have Anything ready to go.</li>
            <li>Very helpful for patient on chemo</li>
            <li>i highly recommend toothettes dispobisble toothbrushes 20-pack!</li>
            <li>I can see why these might be useful for invalids, but I wanted these for travel -- a way to quickly freshen up after a long day (or night) on a plane.</li>
            <li>I use to love those little finger brush breath fresheners...</li>
            <li>My son hates brushing his teeth with normal toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>Not really a toothbrush more like a big cotton swab with some flavoring</li>
            <li>For that unexpected trip and stay, you need a towel, wash cloth, soap, Toothettes and whatever else.</li>
            <li>Very helpful for getting food out of his  jaw pocket after he eat, but stick/ handle too short.</li>
            <li>The old Oral-B finger brush things use to leave my mouth really minty fresh &amp; at least gave that freshly brushed taste in your mouth.</li>
            <li>I like the individual wraps, sticks are short, and price high for these as samples, but on time.</li>

            <li> I like the individual wraps, sticks are short, and price high for these as samples, but on time.</li>
            <li> Leaving my mouth feeling dry with a dab of dried out old toothpaste flavor.</li>
            <li> These however felt like I was sticking a dry sponge in my mouth with the intention &amp; purpose of soaking up whatever saliva I might have had.</li>
            <li> and I wanted plain, so they were not what I wanted and couldn&#x27;t send them back, so just stuck this time.</li>
            <li> Happened upon these &amp; thought due to the reviews I would try them out.</li>
            <li> Plus a lot bigger in size than I was expecting &amp; worse of all they werent even individually wrapped like the picture!!</li>
            <li> The only reason Im giving two stars is that the product did at least not make my teeth feel like they were covered in food after my lunch out.</li>
            <li> These are neat little disposible toothbrushes</li>
            <li> Waste of $$</li>
            <li> Needed for disabled family member.</li>
            <li> Be advised that these have 5 added ingredients, which pack calls &amp;#34;dentifrice.&amp;#34;  I ordered them thinking they were plain, and I could use on my cat&#x27;s teeth.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately these left a little to be desired.</li>
            <li> Very little sensation of toothpaste, which might appeal to some, but not for me.</li>
            <li> Mine came in one small plastic bag.</li>
            <li> It is a hard sponge -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving them 4 stars instead of 5 though because I was a little disappointed that they don&#x27;t leave any flavor in my mouth like toothpaste or mouthwash</li>
            <li> I need something that has a plastic base that can be reused a few times which Sage products does make and have ordered from them.</li>
            <li> Often, medication creates and unpleasant environment in the mouth and this process takes care of that.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Those were awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My son hates brushing his teeth with normal toothbrushes.  He loves these sponge brushes because of the texture and flavor.</li>
            <li> Was expecting these to not have a flavor, as I was planning to use them on my cat&#x27;s teeth per vet&#x27;s recommendations.  The package I received had a strong sweet-minty scent.  Wish this had been specified in the item description!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t state in advertisement that it had dentin in it and I wanted plain, so they were not what I wanted and couldn&#x27;t send them back, so just stuck this time.</li>
            <li> I can see why these might be useful for invalids, but I wanted these for travel -- a way to quickly freshen up after a long day (or night) on a plane. Very little sensation of toothpaste, which might appeal to some, but not for me. I tried one and didn&#x27;t like it at all. Waste of $$</li>
            <li> These are neat little disposible toothbrushes and I would buy them again. They much easier to deal with than carrying a toothbrush and toothpaste in your purse or briefcase. I&#x27;m giving them 4 stars instead of 5 though because I was a little disappointed that they don&#x27;t leave any flavor in my mouth like toothpaste or mouthwash does. I probably didn&#x27;t read the product description properly.  So, these are indeed good for getting the fuzz off your teeth but I like to follow up with rinsing my mouth and then chewing a piece of gum. This just occurred to me--these would be excellent for using with an ill person who can&#x27;t tolerate strong toothpaste taste.</li>
            <li> Not really a toothbrush more like a big cotton swab with some flavoring</li>
            <li> I have a tendency to get into bed and realize that I forgot to brush my teeth. Since, I am dealing with 100, 80 to 50 feet of oxygen breathing tubes that go with me almost everywhere in the house, and I just got comfortable, have my book, my shawl on and have place all the Anchie Crystal pouches on the places that hurt, I don&#x27;t run to the bathroom. Running is not an option anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So these are wonderful.  You want to have them on hand if you end up in the hospital. For that unexpected trip and stay, you need a towel, wash cloth, soap, Toothettes and whatever else. Been there done that, but did not have Anything ready to go. He who shall remain nameless and is a friend would never be able to gather up what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually like these much better than the toothbrush and toothpaste (tooth powder is better). Toothettes don&#x27;t have a taste, are faster to use and do a better job. If you have dentures, they work on those as well.</li>
            <li> I keep a bag in my bottom desk drawer, so I can freshen my teeth before a meeting. Very handy!</li>
            <li> These toothettes are great. they are individually wrapped. they are the perfect size. they are durable. they are priced right</li>
            <li> I like the individual wraps, sticks are short, and price high for these as samples, but on time.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to having us with us on our upcoming 22 hr. Flight.</li>
            <li> I use it to clean my stoma.  Stem is made of paper and falls apart quickly.  It&#x27;s one use item and that&#x27;s what its made for so its serves its purpose.  I need something that has a plastic base that can be reused a few times which Sage products does make and have ordered from them.</li>
            <li> These are not my favorite. Yes you can scrub your teeth with them and throw it away but no flavor. So you still have yucky overnight travel breath even though your teeth are scrubbed.</li>
            <li> Be advised that these have 5 added ingredients, which pack calls &amp;#34;dentifrice.&amp;#34;  I ordered them thinking they were plain, and I could use on my cat&#x27;s teeth.  Exchange not permitted.  Description should state that these are NOT &amp;#34;untreated&amp;#34; and do have some type of dentifrice added.</li>
            <li> This item proved useful for brushing my teeth when visiting a country where using the tap water out of the sink was not advised.</li>
            <li> Very helpful for patient on chemo</li>
            <li> I use to love those little finger brush breath fresheners...I believe Oral-B use to make them but since they no longer do I went hunting for something else. Happened upon these &amp; thought due to the reviews I would try them out. Unfortunately these left a little to be desired. The old Oral-B finger brush things use to leave my mouth really minty fresh &amp; at least gave that freshly brushed taste in your mouth. These however felt like I was sticking a dry sponge in my mouth with the intention &amp; purpose of soaking up whatever saliva I might have had. Leaving my mouth feeling dry with a dab of dried out old toothpaste flavor. Plus a lot bigger in size than I was expecting &amp; worse of all they werent even individually wrapped like the picture!! How am I suppose to stick these in my purse, pocket or bag for quick on the run use if they arent even sanitary wrapped?! Mine came in one small plastic bag. Im guessing they are expecting me to put some in my own ziplock bag? Anyways I will not be purchasing these again. The only reason Im giving two stars is that the product did at least not make my teeth feel like they were covered in food after my lunch out.</li>
            <li> Great - much better than the things you get at Walmart. But the only problem is these are not individually wrapped.</li>
            <li> Needed for disabled family member. Very helpful for getting food out of his  jaw pocket after he eat, but stick/ handle too short.</li>
            <li> they are ok, they need to be longer than they are</li>
            <li> Those were awful. There was no taste to them at all. I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> loved it! amazing specially when travelling or at work! thank you very much... i highly recommend toothettes dispobisble toothbrushes 20-pack!</li>
            <li> Great for the elderly or the frail. It is a hard sponge - I dip in natural (tea tree oil-based) mouthwash to clean the teeth and gums of a frail loved one. She finds it refreshing, and not as upsetting as a hard-bristled tooth brush. Often, medication creates and unpleasant environment in the mouth and this process takes care of that.</li>
            <li> Great and fast Service . Product just what I wanted</li>
