            <li>This stuff is GOOD.  </li>
            <li>Good item I told friends anout</li>
            <li>doesnt feel good on skin...</li>
            <li>but I think if you find a good moisturizer for you skin</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t recommend a better product!</li>
            <li>Well, after 1 month and 1 week, my face is about 40% better than it was when I started!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s AMAZING.</li>
            <li>but I can honestly say it did help.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s a link to a nice summary including scholarly sources: http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/hydroquinone</li>
            <li>kind of works.. used it every day for a year..</li>
            <li>It is best lightener I have used to date &amp; it was surprisingly gentle on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Of all of the creams I have used to erase my acne scars, this is probably the one that has been the most effective.</li>
            <li>Regarding hydroquinone, reputable research shows it to be safe, effective and not carcinogenic in humans.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Will continue to use it to see if it will work even more</li>
            <li>Will be interesting to see  </li>
            <li>It is okay for the price.</li>
            <li>This product is ok when you put it on</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been 2 weeks till now, and i love this product.</li>
            <li>now it&#x27;s blending with my skin tone a lot better.</li>
            <li>Maybe slightly better</li>
            <li>It does not go on or absorb like ProActiv and is not something I plan to use any more.</li>
            <li>Maybe others will have better results.</li>
            <li>They did lighten up some, they&#x27;re not gone, but hey anything is better than nothing.  </li>
            <li>so bed time is best after I use oil of olay microdermabrasion brush to rid of the daily cream and oils on my skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t look 50 more like 38</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am glad I didn&#x27;t spend a lot on this product.</li>
            <li>It helps lighten the brown spots and helps the tone of my face look more even.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product and I will buy more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased that I have seen results</li>
            <li>but i was better at remembering the one on my cheek than my hands</li>
            <li>most n all over the counter lighten cream.</li>
            <li>Have already ordered more</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the idea of the ingredient in this product (which is banned in Europe)</li>
            <li>but I couldn&#x27;t pass up letting people know how great this product really is.</li>
            <li>I am darker skinned than most people so a lot of skin lighteners don&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>This is actually pretty good stuff.</li>
            <li>Thats pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li>So, pretty good.</li>
            <li>If I could give 1/2 star, that would be more accurate.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried that yet, but it doesn&#x27;t have the cheap emollient waxes in the ingredients list that the Equate does so hopefully the texture is more tolerable.  </li>
            <li>but I was able to fix it by putting a light moisturizer over my face after using it.</li>
            <li>The more consistently I use it the better the results.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge change in my skin, but I love the way it feels - non-greasy and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I used this product for 2 weeks and already noticed a huge change.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I&#x27;ve now found some ProActiv elsewhere and can toss this in the trash.</li>
            <li>Compared to Garnier Light Fairness from India</li>
            <li>too light</li>
            <li>My face has never been so bright and soft.</li>
            <li>far so good.</li>
            <li>My skin is very fair, but I&#x27;ve never had allergic reactions to any other products.  </li>
            <li>I have found that dabbing some pure lemon juice (from real lemons) on my acne spots and scars is much more effective and way cheaper... just wash it off after about 4-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>On a positive note, it does make for a good primer under powder foundation as the powder sticks to it really well</li>
            <li>But overall, my face looked amazingly &#x27;brighter&#x27;!</li>
            <li>Most Equate products are pretty comparable to the name brands they stand in for.</li>
            <li>I am fair and felt self-conscious about it; probably spent $1k or more over the course of the last five years trying to treat it, including microdermabrasian, lasers, and more creams and ointments than I want to admit, with at best limited results.  </li>
            <li>WOW this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work for my fair skin with red spots ..</li>
            <li>To be fair, 2 weeks may not be enough time to assess effectiveness as some products take longer to work.  </li>
            <li>But for price an not a lot of bs additives its not bad.</li>
            <li>I used many other more expensive creams, and surprisingly this one happens to be one of the best.</li>
            <li>I have been using L&#x27;Oreal dark spot serum during the day its blends smooth smells good and is easy to put make up over and</li>
            <li>Package arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I had a tummy tuck scar that was a dark brown color, and this stuff is working great on that.</li>
            <li>but I bought it anyway and to my surprise it actually worked pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Hydroquinone: this carcinogenic chemical is actually banned in most countries- except the US!</li>
            <li>Daily use has not, thus far, provided the elimination of age-sun spots, I am hoping for  Must say tho, this is one of many I have tried and hoped better results for!</li>
            <li>The bottom line the effective ingredigent (2% hrdoquines)is the same n</li>
            <li>Within one week my spot has almost completely faded and I couldn&#x27;t be more thankful.  </li>
            <li>Nothing will remove dark skin spots completely but this does a very good job of fading.</li>
            <li>Probably around week 5 I noticed that the areas that I applied the lightener to were becoming sensitive to the touch.  </li>
            <li>Equate Dark Spot Corrector seems to be every bit as good as Proactiv.</li>
            <li>I have used Clinique&#x27;s Dark spot corrector and skin brightener, which is 5 times the cost, and the Equate worked just as good.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and was quiet happy thinking i finally found the remedy to the two spots on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>I am very fair skinned and had a number of smaller dark spots on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>It came sooner than I thought, and it also did exactly at stated.</li>
            <li>However, with this product I was amazed to see results after the first day.  </li>
            <li>Been 2 doctor many times and had it froze but always came back.</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more.  </li>
            <li>I used it the first night &amp; saw a difference.</li>
            <li>This really works!  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using this product as consistently as I should have.</li>
            <li>I am still on my first tube and probably can go another 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>I really do like how well it&#x27;s working and will recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li>This product is working VERY WELL for me!</li>
            <li>This is my first review ever</li>
            <li>I can easily use it before bed because it does not have a strong scent like the proactive dark spot corrector.</li>
            <li>So far not to excited.</li>
            <li>However, Equate pretty much starts working immediately.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I have certainly noticed the spots beginning to lighten.</li>
            <li>This product permanently darkened my skin in a very noticeable line from my chin to my jaw.</li>
            <li>Now I have permanent (very noticeable) skin discoloration.</li>
            <li>(My negatives are: The packaging was completely crushed upon arrival, the tube was ok though.</li>
            <li>My acne marks has really fade alot.</li>
            <li>I used it for two months straight.</li>
            <li>It seems to work really fast.</li>
            <li>but the area I am using it on  is not worse.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is so waxy you can&#x27;t really rub it in without it balling up.  </li>
            <li>but they were much lighter than before.</li>
            <li>and it is much lighter than before.</li>
            <li>it won&#x27;t be much of a problem.</li>
            <li>This product really worked for me.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t really tell a difference..</li>
            <li>but as I said, I haven&#x27;t been using it much.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe that this whole time I could have used this and not had a problem all summer...</li>
            <li>I wanted to wait a month to give this product a real review.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>In addition to using the product I also am using biotin so far I&#x27;m pleased and ready for the next step when the spots are gone which will be changing or improving the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>i do not see much difference with the spots on my hands</li>
            <li>Darkened areas are already light enough that I don&#x27;t need to use concealer unless I want to look &amp;#34;flawless&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>and I really see no difference.</li>
            <li>The only way I found to spread it around effectively was to dot small amounts over the desired areas then quickly smooth it out.  </li>
            <li>is better than other products I have used.</li>
            <li>I did expect to hve more of the active ingredient  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products that say they can reduce or remove dark spots.  </li>
            <li>This product works great for acne scarring , idk about liver spots but a tiny drop on an old scar clears it up over a few nights</li>
            <li>I was struggling with so many products before I discover Equate Dark Spot Corrector Skin Lightener, and my spots didnt want to go and didnt have any hope to see them removed.</li>
            <li>My face was full of itchy rashes, which prevented me from falling into sleep at night, after using the corretor for only 5 days.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Only gave it 2 stars because it was mild and non-irritating.</li>
            <li>Seems like the older it gets, the smellier and thicker it gets.  </li>
            <li>but I had my hopes set too high.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>Its  nice to find a dark spot remover that actually works.</li>
            <li>I think I had to put it on a new spot for about a week</li>
            <li>it did work on new scare</li>
            <li>I have been using this cream twice a day for the past two weeks, and have noticed a great improvement to the dark spots I had.</li>
            <li>and the small amounts of this stuff that incidentally get on eyebrows while applying to the forehead hold brows in place better than any brow gel.  </li>
            <li>This actually works, but you have to be consistent and results aren&#x27;t immediate.</li>
            <li>After several weeks, the dark spots are mostly gone.  </li>
            <li>I had significant dark spots from &amp;#34;leftover&amp;#34; summer tans over the years.</li>
            <li>I didnt wanna pay too much money for Proactiv&#x27;s same product as Equate says they compare the product with it.</li>
            <li>and i recently started developing age spots on both cheek bones and some assorted spots on my forehead that were really bothering me.</li>
            <li>I was from early teens to</li>
            <li>my early 40 a sun worshiper lived in Hawaii and Florida then use of tanning beds.</li>
            <li>and so far I don&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
            <li>I was so self conscious of it because I like to go without makeup in the summer if I can</li>
            <li>I will do an updated review when and if the spots are completely gone.</li>
            <li>and so far it is holding on.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use nightly and hope to fade spots away completely.</li>
            <li>NOT ON THE OLD ONES</li>
            <li>Not as quickly as I&#x27;d like but after a month dark spots are definitely faded and should be gone in a few more weeks.  </li>
            <li>I will probably be using this cream when I don&#x27;t want to pay $175 for a chemical peel to do the exact same thing in the same amount of time.</li>
            <li>I have some pretty old acne scars that I suspect are never going anywhere, but even with the newer ones (scars and red spots from acne that developed in recent weeks/months), I  noticed no difference after several months of using this cream and had a lot of trouble rubbing it into my skin - fine for the night time, but not during the day.</li>
            <li>I have paid high dollar for products hoping to make this spot disappear and finally ran across this one while walking through Walmart.  </li>
            <li>Even the fresh dark pigmentation didn&#x27;t get corrected.</li>
            <li>Heart palpitations have stopped - things are back to normal.  </li>
            <li>THS PRODUCT ONLY WORKS ON NEW BLEMISHES</li>
            <li>nothing major</li>
            <li>Plus, there is no harsh smell like a similar well-marketed product.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable compared to a lot of other choices.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this twice now, so it is possibly too early to see results.  </li>
            <li>I am nearing the end of a tube of this product and the large dark spot on my face has been reduced to almost invisible.</li>
            <li>No other changes to my daily routines or diet.  </li>
            <li>This worked really well on my dark spot.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed too much of a difference in fading of some dark spots on my face</li>
            <li>It is a long process; so, may be too early to tell.</li>
            <li>works just as good as Proactive and a lot less expensive</li>
            <li>I have one particular spot on my face from acne that always gets really dark when I tan</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I am darker skinned than most people so a lot of skin lighteners don&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> This is actually pretty good stuff.</li>
            <li> Thats pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li> So, pretty good.</li>
            <li> If I could give 1/2 star, that would be more accurate.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried that yet, but it doesn&#x27;t have the cheap emollient waxes in the ingredients list that the Equate does so hopefully the texture is more tolerable.  </li>
            <li> but I was able to fix it by putting a light moisturizer over my face after using it.</li>
            <li> The more consistently I use it the better the results.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge change in my skin, but I love the way it feels - non-greasy and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I used this product for 2 weeks and already noticed a huge change.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I&#x27;ve now found some ProActiv elsewhere and can toss this in the trash.</li>
            <li> Compared to Garnier Light Fairness from India</li>
            <li> too light</li>
            <li> My face has never been so bright and soft.</li>
            <li> far so good.</li>
            <li> My skin is very fair, but I&#x27;ve never had allergic reactions to any other products.  </li>
            <li> I have found that dabbing some pure lemon juice (from real lemons) on my acne spots and scars is much more effective and way cheaper... just wash it off after about 4-10 minutes.</li>
            <li> On a positive note, it does make for a good primer under powder foundation as the powder sticks to it really well</li>
            <li> But overall, my face looked amazingly &#x27;brighter&#x27;!</li>
            <li> Most Equate products are pretty comparable to the name brands they stand in for.</li>
            <li> I am fair and felt self-conscious about it; probably spent $1k or more over the course of the last five years trying to treat it, including microdermabrasian, lasers, and more creams and ointments than I want to admit, with at best limited results.  </li>
            <li> WOW this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for my fair skin with red spots ..</li>
            <li> To be fair, 2 weeks may not be enough time to assess effectiveness as some products take longer to work.  </li>
            <li> But for price an not a lot of bs additives its not bad.</li>
            <li> I used many other more expensive creams, and surprisingly this one happens to be one of the best.</li>
            <li> I have been using L&#x27;Oreal dark spot serum during the day its blends smooth smells good and is easy to put make up over and</li>
            <li> Package arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I had a tummy tuck scar that was a dark brown color, and this stuff is working great on that.</li>
            <li> but I bought it anyway and to my surprise it actually worked pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Hydroquinone: this carcinogenic chemical is actually banned in most countries- except the US!</li>
            <li> Daily use has not, thus far, provided the elimination of age-sun spots, I am hoping for  Must say tho, this is one of many I have tried and hoped better results for!</li>
            <li> The bottom line the effective ingredigent (2% hrdoquines)is the same n</li>
            <li> Within one week my spot has almost completely faded and I couldn&#x27;t be more thankful.  </li>
            <li> Nothing will remove dark skin spots completely but this does a very good job of fading.</li>
            <li> Probably around week 5 I noticed that the areas that I applied the lightener to were becoming sensitive to the touch.  </li>
            <li> Equate Dark Spot Corrector seems to be every bit as good as Proactiv.</li>
            <li> I have used Clinique&#x27;s Dark spot corrector and skin brightener, which is 5 times the cost, and the Equate worked just as good.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and was quiet happy thinking i finally found the remedy to the two spots on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned and had a number of smaller dark spots on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> It came sooner than I thought, and it also did exactly at stated.</li>
            <li> However, with this product I was amazed to see results after the first day.  </li>
            <li> Been 2 doctor many times and had it froze but always came back.</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more.  </li>
            <li> I used it the first night &amp; saw a difference.</li>
            <li> This really works!  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product as consistently as I should have.</li>
            <li> I am still on my first tube and probably can go another 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I really do like how well it&#x27;s working and will recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> This product is working VERY WELL for me!</li>
            <li> This is my first review ever</li>
            <li> I can easily use it before bed because it does not have a strong scent like the proactive dark spot corrector.</li>
            <li> So far not to excited.</li>
            <li> However, Equate pretty much starts working immediately.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for the fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I have certainly noticed the spots beginning to lighten.</li>
            <li> This product permanently darkened my skin in a very noticeable line from my chin to my jaw.</li>
            <li> Now I have permanent (very noticeable) skin discoloration.</li>
            <li> (My negatives are: The packaging was completely crushed upon arrival, the tube was ok though.</li>
            <li> My acne marks has really fade alot.</li>
            <li> I used it for two months straight.</li>
            <li> It seems to work really fast.</li>
            <li> but the area I am using it on  is not worse.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is so waxy you can&#x27;t really rub it in without it balling up.  </li>
            <li> but they were much lighter than before.</li>
            <li> and it is much lighter than before.</li>
            <li> it won&#x27;t be much of a problem.</li>
            <li> This product really worked for me.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t really tell a difference..</li>
            <li> but as I said, I haven&#x27;t been using it much.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that this whole time I could have used this and not had a problem all summer...</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait a month to give this product a real review.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> In addition to using the product I also am using biotin so far I&#x27;m pleased and ready for the next step when the spots are gone which will be changing or improving the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> i do not see much difference with the spots on my hands</li>
            <li> Darkened areas are already light enough that I don&#x27;t need to use concealer unless I want to look &amp;#34;flawless&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> and I really see no difference.</li>
            <li> The only way I found to spread it around effectively was to dot small amounts over the desired areas then quickly smooth it out.  </li>
            <li> is better than other products I have used.</li>
            <li> I did expect to hve more of the active ingredient  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products that say they can reduce or remove dark spots.  </li>
            <li> This product works great for acne scarring , idk about liver spots but a tiny drop on an old scar clears it up over a few nights</li>
            <li> I was struggling with so many products before I discover Equate Dark Spot Corrector Skin Lightener, and my spots didnt want to go and didnt have any hope to see them removed.</li>
            <li> My face was full of itchy rashes, which prevented me from falling into sleep at night, after using the corretor for only 5 days.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Only gave it 2 stars because it was mild and non-irritating.</li>
            <li> Seems like the older it gets, the smellier and thicker it gets.  </li>
            <li> but I had my hopes set too high.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li> Its  nice to find a dark spot remover that actually works.</li>
            <li> I think I had to put it on a new spot for about a week</li>
            <li> it did work on new scare</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream twice a day for the past two weeks, and have noticed a great improvement to the dark spots I had.</li>
            <li> and the small amounts of this stuff that incidentally get on eyebrows while applying to the forehead hold brows in place better than any brow gel.  </li>
            <li> This actually works, but you have to be consistent and results aren&#x27;t immediate.</li>
            <li> After several weeks, the dark spots are mostly gone.  </li>
            <li> I had significant dark spots from &amp;#34;leftover&amp;#34; summer tans over the years.</li>
            <li> I didnt wanna pay too much money for Proactiv&#x27;s same product as Equate says they compare the product with it.</li>
            <li> and i recently started developing age spots on both cheek bones and some assorted spots on my forehead that were really bothering me.</li>
            <li> I was from early teens to</li>
            <li> my early 40 a sun worshiper lived in Hawaii and Florida then use of tanning beds.</li>
            <li> and so far I don&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
            <li> I was so self conscious of it because I like to go without makeup in the summer if I can</li>
            <li> I will do an updated review when and if the spots are completely gone.</li>
            <li> and so far it is holding on.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use nightly and hope to fade spots away completely.</li>
            <li> NOT ON THE OLD ONES</li>
            <li> Not as quickly as I&#x27;d like but after a month dark spots are definitely faded and should be gone in a few more weeks.  </li>
            <li> I will probably be using this cream when I don&#x27;t want to pay $175 for a chemical peel to do the exact same thing in the same amount of time.</li>
            <li> I have some pretty old acne scars that I suspect are never going anywhere, but even with the newer ones (scars and red spots from acne that developed in recent weeks/months), I  noticed no difference after several months of using this cream and had a lot of trouble rubbing it into my skin - fine for the night time, but not during the day.</li>
            <li> I have paid high dollar for products hoping to make this spot disappear and finally ran across this one while walking through Walmart.  </li>
            <li> Even the fresh dark pigmentation didn&#x27;t get corrected.</li>
            <li> Heart palpitations have stopped - things are back to normal.  </li>
            <li> THS PRODUCT ONLY WORKS ON NEW BLEMISHES</li>
            <li> nothing major</li>
            <li> Plus, there is no harsh smell like a similar well-marketed product.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable compared to a lot of other choices.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this twice now, so it is possibly too early to see results.  </li>
            <li> I am nearing the end of a tube of this product and the large dark spot on my face has been reduced to almost invisible.</li>
            <li> No other changes to my daily routines or diet.  </li>
            <li> This worked really well on my dark spot.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed too much of a difference in fading of some dark spots on my face</li>
            <li> It is a long process; so, may be too early to tell.</li>
            <li> works just as good as Proactive and a lot less expensive</li>
            <li> I have one particular spot on my face from acne that always gets really dark when I tan</li>
            <li> I have some acne dark spots on my face that takes forever to vanish,(actually couple yrs it takes), and by that time i start getting new one&#x27;s as i cannot keep my hands off my face.</li>
            <li> Only gave it 1 star as 0 stars is apparently not an option.</li>
            <li> At least though I can use it on certain body parts!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but since I rely on them so much when making purchases, I decided to write one.  </li>
            <li> This product kinda drys out my skin, not sure if it&#x27;s really working</li>
            <li> and as long as I apply it on a regular basis, it works.</li>
            <li> Long story short its going one month</li>
            <li> This dark spot corrector had a very high rating but it nothing for my dark spots.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have much faith in this product, since they seem to usually take so long to show any noticeable improvement.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different products for facial dark spots but did not see results.</li>
            <li> I hope with a few more months they will be gone and I can move on to just maintaining no wrinkles or at least less visible ones</li>
            <li> I was surprised how well it started bleaching my freckles and dark spots on my face!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Ambi for a while and it took me forever to realize that Ambi either doesn&#x27;t work or just takes way too long to.  </li>
            <li> Will continue to use it though to see if it makes any difference after long time use.  </li>
            <li> 2 weeks ago, I ended up in the ER w/ heart palpitations (PVCs - unexplained - every 3-5 minutes 24 hrs a day).  </li>
            <li> Have not seen much of any difference in lightening spots, slow to work.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used every other night for about 3 weeks on the melasma on my upper lip,some of the darker freckles/sun spots, and acne scars that I have and it has made a visable difference.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps it is just my skin type, but I did not see much change in the dark spots I have, seems to have had very little impact.  </li>
            <li> it feel has if it does not have any moisturizer in it because my face was dry.</li>
            <li> So it might cause some people to have dry skin or make their skin even drier</li>
            <li> From last 3 years i been packing my face everyday with makeup which has spoiled my acne further, but i was always too scared to try anything on.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m a white) and it turned some of my skin dark brown.</li>
            <li> I used for over three months regularly, every time before going to bed, I applied it to the affected areas for dark pigmentation and it didn&#x27;t help at all.</li>
            <li> It actually fades dark spots.  </li>
            <li> I did tried a clique dark spot corrector once, which was i think 60 bugs for a ever smaller tube</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a dark spot on my left cheek from sun damage for about 5 years.  </li>
            <li> but I can say that it definitely reduces dark spots, so I keep using it.</li>
            <li> used it on age spots which are very dark as well as old scares that where dark-</li>
            <li> to me, just using the first week i saw a dramatic lightening of a spot on my cheek.</li>
            <li> As a person having dark spots and different color skin due to acne disease during my youth, I wanted to give it a try to sooth my skin and tone it with a color.</li>
            <li> makes my skin breakout in little white pimples</li>
            <li> Do not waste your hard earned money..</li>
            <li> I saw absolutely no results using this product.</li>
            <li> and it was totally crushed with cream everywhere when I opened the package.</li>
            <li> Even though I have only a few minor dark spots, I was seeking a product to lighten them.  </li>
            <li> This product works slower than I expected but it does work.</li>
            <li> Been using it for about a month and spots on my face are diminished but slower than I expected.</li>
            <li> Not really noticing a difference.</li>
            <li> it was not what I expected  </li>
            <li> Then they started getting pink and eventually red over the course of another few days.  </li>
            <li> I wish I just spent the extra few bucks and went with the proactive brand because this one isn&#x27;t working well for me.</li>
            <li> was not strong enough  did not see results  </li>
            <li> and it helped prevent it from getting too dark at the least and lightened old ones.</li>
            <li> I only have one complaint it does  dry up my skin</li>
            <li> Please consider other products so this doesn&#x27;t happen to you too</li>
            <li> I waited a few weeks to review this product because on the package it states it will take that long to see results.</li>
            <li> It is a lightweight product that won&#x27;t interfere with your other skin care items.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure enough yet if this has had a lot of impact.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say I threw it away and at least it was a cheap experiment.</li>
            <li> It made the skin a little pink while it was lightening the dark spot, but that cleared as soon as I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> Product did not work on my dark spot on my face</li>
            <li> but it did help with a dark spot I had on my hand.</li>
            <li> I used this product for about 2 weeks when one day I woke up with dark brown lines where I had rubbed the medicine on the night before</li>
            <li> I bought this product with the hopes of it lightening all my dark spots.</li>
            <li> Noticed some improvement with dark spots</li>
            <li> I had 6 really dark circles that I was so embarrassed about.</li>
            <li> all dark spots faded and skin is even toned.  </li>
            <li> Im dark skin and have dark spots on my hands and face.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Equate Dark Spot Corrector for about six months</li>
            <li> I have dark spots from my acne, I had the dark spot corrector from proactive</li>
            <li> but it is expensive and it make my face really greasy</li>
            <li> I noticed some dark spots forming on my face.  </li>
            <li> I used this product for about 3-4 weeks before I noticed a difference in the look of the dark spots on my face.  </li>
            <li> this product at night equate dark spot corrector.</li>
            <li> It did work for dark spots but he had side effects.</li>
            <li> And I like that they&#x27;re comparing it to the Proactiv Dark Spot Corrector because that was something else I was looking into but didn&#x27;t want to spend the money...</li>
            <li> I would say that dark spots began to lighten within a week.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I have had dark spots on my cheeks for quite some time now</li>
            <li> Didnt get rid of my dark spots at all bottle</li>
            <li> I have olive skin and have had a dark spot under my eye since I was a teenager that looks like a make-up smudge.</li>
            <li> This is an inexpensive product and seems to work well on a dark spot on my face.</li>
            <li> This dark spot corrector is not helpful to remove dark spots.</li>
            <li> No odor, it comes out as a white cream -thick</li>
            <li> The only down side is that the cream is rather thick, but I prefer that to the runnyness of Proactiv as Proactiv nears the end of the tube.</li>
            <li> Thumbs down on the product</li>
            <li> That is not what I was going for, it did seem like the skin was breaking down.  </li>
            <li> It works , didn&#x27;t lighten my acne scars as much as I wanted to but then again my acne scars aren&#x27;t that bad , just try it , everyone is different and it might just work for you !</li>
            <li> I just received it today, I&#x27;m giving 5 stars based on previous reviews.</li>
            <li> They appear lighter, less pigmented, and closer to my skin tone.</li>
            <li> It slightly lightened the spots on my chin</li>
            <li> I have brown skin and my marks were literally black</li>
            <li> Tried rubbing it in and using less</li>
            <li> I have relatively clear skin, but occasionally I get a couple under my lip, and it drives me crazy.</li>
            <li> For less than $13 and with my Prime shipping</li>
            <li> Adding an update 10/13/14 as of today the spots are not gone but substantially less visible.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s been about a month and a half.</li>
            <li> After using it for a little over 2 weeks I noticed a difference,  my dark spot were not all gone</li>
            <li> It was really strange but at least I can still use this product some how.</li>
            <li> I used it for about two months on a few dark spots on my face and it didn&#x27;t help fade them one bit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not using it religiously, but I feel like I should have seen a difference using it at least 2 times a week for the past month and a half.</li>
            <li> This still comes back but at least no more doc appts.</li>
            <li> While it did lighten my melasma a little it didnt fade all of it.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t fade the two age spots on my face, not even a little.</li>
            <li> My husband asked my what the little wounds were on my forehead.  </li>
            <li> I have found all my age spots fading nicely.now its been 6 weeks since i started the loreal and a little over 4 weeks since i started the equate at night</li>
            <li> The dark spots are fading!</li>
            <li> I have tried other products in the past with little to no effect.</li>
            <li> I prefer Proactive Dark Spot Corrector!</li>
            <li> Been using for several weeks at night only.its very thick</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> but now I&#x27;m impatient to see the spots gone.</li>
            <li> However, it didn&#x27;t zap a few brown spots, as I had hoped...</li>
            <li> I wasted my money for a junk product.</li>
            <li> This product has EDTA and several other questionable ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple months and think I see a very slight improvement.  </li>
            <li> and I think it is slowly lightening the dark spots on my face.  </li>
            <li> Not even a little!</li>
            <li> Upon research, I found that the active ingredient in this is banned in almost every other country due to dangerous side effects.</li>
            <li> I just have to do some touch-ups of makeup to work these days, no more concealers and all.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after 2 weeks of twice daily use there&#x27;s no sign of improvement to my melasma spots.  </li>
            <li> I used it for a couple of days and the difference in skin appearance was unbelievable.</li>
            <li> This is the Walmart brand, and usually that doesn&#x27;t matter, but in this case it does.</li>
            <li> have used it for some small spots on my body and noticed that it works well on them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have the worst brown spots on my face (from many years of sun bathing)</li>
            <li> I have freckles and sun spots and they may have lighted a small amount after one month of usage.  </li>
            <li> However, the cream dries out on my face and leaves &amp;#34;flakes&amp;#34; which can be annoying, it looks like dry skin but is actually the dried out cream.</li>
            <li> I had this ugly pimple that left a really dark spot on my chin</li>
            <li> I know it is hard to find things like this that work</li>
            <li> If I have any negative updates after using for about a week I will update my rating.</li>
            <li> Over the next few day they became mildly painful.  </li>
            <li> My acne scars are slowly disappearing from face and even out my skintone.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical when ordering this product, but thought why not to give it a try - $11, not much to loose.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any change in my dark spots after using for a couple months, but I must say I didn&#x27;t expect to as I&#x27;ve tried other products as well with no results. :-(</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical</li>
            <li> Nevertheless it feels disgusting on the skin; you definitely need to put on some other moisturizer over it to dilute the yuckiness.  </li>
            <li> it works just takes a while to see results, ill continue using it, not sure if ull purchase it again</li>
            <li> but very slowly</li>
            <li> This is the worst product I have ever used so far!</li>
            <li> Worthless, didn&#x27;t lighten my dark spots at all!</li>
            <li> and I am sad to say that it did nothing for my two brown spots.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t fail</li>
            <li> Also, it says that it helps improve skin texture, which I was skeptical of, but my skin has improved since using this</li>
            <li> This product feels and looks like toothpaste on your skin, Horrible consistency, totally different than the Proactiv skin lightener.  </li>
            <li> tried it for a week sorry</li>
            <li> sorry it was cheaper at Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> look fake too.</li>
            <li> but these age spots drive me crazy.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I broke out really bad on my hand.</li>
            <li> bad smelling</li>
            <li> I was given steroids as well as corticosteroids and they created some bad brown spots that were worsening over time.</li>
            <li> Have always been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I also hated the texture.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!  </li>
            <li> Also smells terrible</li>
            <li> I now have those awful age spots - ohhhh nooooo.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Product did not work on my dark spot on my face but it did help with a dark spot I had on my hand. It was really strange but at least I can still use this product some how.</li>
            <li> DONT BUYY! DARKENED SKIN. I used this product for about 2 weeks when one day I woke up with dark brown lines where I had rubbed the medicine on the night before (I&#x27;m a white) and it turned some of my skin dark brown. This product permanently darkened my skin in a very noticeable line from my chin to my jaw. Upon research, I found that the active ingredient in this is banned in almost every other country due to dangerous side effects. Now I have permanent (very noticeable) skin discoloration. Please consider other products so this doesn&#x27;t happen to you too</li>
            <li> As a person having dark spots and different color skin due to acne disease during my youth, I wanted to give it a try to sooth my skin and tone it with a color. I didnt wanna pay too much money for Proactiv&#x27;s same product as Equate says they compare the product with it. I used for over three months regularly, every time before going to bed, I applied it to the affected areas for dark pigmentation and it didn&#x27;t help at all. Even the fresh dark pigmentation didn&#x27;t get corrected. I don&#x27;t believe that this product gives what you want.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not seeing any change</li>
            <li> I used it for about two months on a few dark spots on my face and it didn&#x27;t help fade them one bit.</li>
            <li> Thumbs down on the product</li>
            <li> Equate Dark Spot Corrector seems to be every bit as good as Proactiv. It has definitely lightened darkened skin around surgical areas. I&#x27;m hoping it will get rid of it all. The only down side is that the cream is rather thick, but I prefer that to the runnyness of Proactiv as Proactiv nears the end of the tube.</li>
            <li> Good Product. It&#x27;s working for me.</li>
            <li> I just received it today, I&#x27;m giving 5 stars based on previous reviews. If I have any negative updates after using for about a week I will update my rating. (My negatives are: The packaging was completely crushed upon arrival, the tube was ok though. Also, for some reason I thought the tube would be bigger so keep in mind it is 1 fl oz!) No odor, it comes out as a white cream -thick enough to where it won&#x27;t run or drip. It might bleach fabric, so I&#x27;d probably use it only at night when going to sleep.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Not as quickly as I&#x27;d like but after a month dark spots are definitely faded and should be gone in a few more weeks.  In my experience these spots used to take 4-6 months to fade away without using anything.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have much faith in this product, since they seem to usually take so long to show any noticeable improvement. I have been using this cream twice a day for the past two weeks, and have noticed a great improvement to the dark spots I had. They appear lighter, less pigmented, and closer to my skin tone. Of all of the creams I have used to erase my acne scars, this is probably the one that has been the most effective. I will probably be using this cream when I don&#x27;t want to pay $175 for a chemical peel to do the exact same thing in the same amount of time.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge change in my skin, but I love the way it feels - non-greasy and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Gosh! I love this product. It came sooner than I thought, and it also did exactly at stated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple of months and I am sad to say that it did nothing for my two brown spots.</li>
            <li> I tried the Ambi brand with no results trying to lighten my age spots. This seems to contain the same ingredients but this is beginning to work. I have certainly noticed the spots beginning to lighten. I only use it at night. During the day I am using a sunscreen on my face. So far so good!</li>
            <li> I bought this product with the hopes of it lightening all my dark spots. It didn&#x27;t fail but I had my hopes set too high. It slightly lightened the spots on my chin that&#x27;s about it; however, still a good product. I&#x27;d recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> This stuff definitely works.  I&#x27;ve used every other night for about 3 weeks on the melasma on my upper lip,some of the darker freckles/sun spots, and acne scars that I have and it has made a visable difference.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This worked really well on my dark spot. It made the skin a little pink while it was lightening the dark spot, but that cleared as soon as I stopped using it. I was very impressed.</li>
            <li> I have been using  it for about a month and it is finally working at lightening my sun spots.  Will continue to use it to see if it will work even more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review before but after using this product, I want to let everyone know how great it is.  I&#x27;ve tried many products that say they can reduce or remove dark spots.  Have always been disappointed.  However, with this product I was amazed to see results after the first day.  After several weeks, the dark spots are mostly gone.  Just amazing!</li>
            <li> I waited a few weeks to review this product because on the package it states it will take that long to see results. I am showing results in clearing up my acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;So far so good.</li>
            <li> I saw absolutely no results using this product. I regret making this purchase. I know it is hard to find things like this that work so I&#x27;ll just keep searching!</li>
            <li> This is actually pretty good stuff. I just picked it up one night from the pharmacy, always trying to improve my skin, uphill battle. I didn&#x27;t take notes on the results but I can honestly say it did help. I think I had to put it on a new spot for about a week and it helped prevent it from getting too dark at the least and lightened old ones.</li>
            <li> This product works great for acne scarring , idk about liver spots but a tiny drop on an old scar clears it up over a few nights</li>
            <li> My acne marks has really fade alot. I&#x27;ve been using this for almost 3 weeks now &amp; I see a big change in it. My acne scars are slowly disappearing from face and even out my skintone.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that works for me. Been 2 doctor many times and had it froze but always came back. This still comes back but at least no more doc appts. and as long as I apply it on a regular basis, it works.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!  This dark spot corrector had a very high rating but it nothing for my dark spots.  I also hated the texture.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 2 months twice a day and it made no difference.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical when ordering this product, but thought why not to give it a try - $11, not much to loose.  I was surprised how well it started bleaching my freckles and dark spots on my face!  No irritation or redness, I put it on before I go sleep.  Will definitely buy more.  Will be interesting to see  how well it works during the summer.</li>
            <li> While it did lighten my melasma a little it didnt fade all of it.  I used it for two months straight. It is okay for the price.</li>
            <li> This product is ok when you put it on it feel has if it does not have any moisturizer in it because my face was dry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but since I rely on them so much when making purchases, I decided to write one.  This stuff is GOOD.  It actually fades dark spots.  I&#x27;ve been using Ambi for a while and it took me forever to realize that Ambi either doesn&#x27;t work or just takes way too long to.  However, Equate pretty much starts working immediately.  You can see your spots actually fading within a week. Also, it says that it helps improve skin texture, which I was skeptical of, but my skin has improved since using this so I guess I can attribute it to this product.  Will definitely recommend and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I used it the first night &amp; saw a difference. I would buy again. Good item I told friends anout</li>
            <li> It seems to work really fast. I&#x27;m still using it. No end result yet.</li>
            <li> I have some acne dark spots on my face that takes forever to vanish,(actually couple yrs it takes), and by that time i start getting new one&#x27;s as i cannot keep my hands off my face. From last 3 years i been packing my face everyday with makeup which has spoiled my acne further, but i was always too scared to try anything on. I did tried a clique dark spot corrector once, which was i think 60 bugs for a ever smaller tube and it didn&#x27;t helped at all. There was no change I ordered this because i saw the reviews on amazon. So, i figured i can give it a shot. It&#x27;s been 2 weeks till now, and i love this product. My spots are getting lighter i can feel it. I just have to do some touch-ups of makeup to work these days, no more concealers and all. I hope it clears all my spots, i swear i&#x27;ll touch makeup again in my life.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me</li>
            <li> I am nearing the end of a tube of this product and the large dark spot on my face has been reduced to almost invisible. I am very fair skinned and had a number of smaller dark spots on my cheeks. They too are almost gone.  Its  nice to find a dark spot remover that actually works.</li>
            <li> I received this is a bubble envelope and it was totally crushed with cream everywhere when I opened the package.</li>
            <li> Great quality for price</li>
            <li> Daily use has not, thus far, provided the elimination of age-sun spots, I am hoping for  Must say tho, this is one of many I have tried and hoped better results for!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 18 and have some acne. I thought I&#x27;d try this product to help with my acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;This product didn&#x27;t react well with my skin--in fact, it created a red spot wherever I put the cream.&lt;br /&gt;My guess as to why this happened is because I use prescribed acne medication &amp; the combination of these products just don&#x27;t work together.&lt;br /&gt;FYI--I use Zianna and Finacea.</li>
            <li> Noticed some improvement with dark spots nothing major but I will continue.I did expect to hve more of the active ingredient  I can purchase 2% OTC.</li>
            <li> What I like about this is it is not a gel, it is somewhat of a cream.  Plus, there is no harsh smell like a similar well-marketed product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s AMAZING. I broke out really bad on my hand. I had 6 really dark circles that I was so embarrassed about. I used this product for 2 weeks and already noticed a huge change. I have brown skin and my marks were literally black now it&#x27;s blending with my skin tone a lot better.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and was quiet happy thinking i finally found the remedy to the two spots on my cheeks. Long story short its going one month and im still waiting on result</li>
            <li> all dark spots faded and skin is even toned.  Just what I was looking for didn&#x27;t get any rashes from this cream.</li>
            <li> used it on age spots which are very dark as well as old scares that where dark- no change- it did work on new scare</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for my fair skin with red spots .. Also smells terrible</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell yet if it is working but the area I am using it on  is not worse.  Maybe slightly better</li>
            <li> Even though I have only a few minor dark spots, I was seeking a product to lighten them.  I have very fair, Swedish-like complexion and I was hopeful that this product would work for me.  I used it in the AM and PM for 2 weeks and it did nothing.  Needless to say, I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to help me at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a dark spot on my left cheek from sun damage for about 5 years.  I am fair and felt self-conscious about it; probably spent $1k or more over the course of the last five years trying to treat it, including microdermabrasian, lasers, and more creams and ointments than I want to admit, with at best limited results.  I tried this for 10 days and my spot is all but gone.  I can&#x27;t believe it!</li>
            <li> I have not seen any results. Doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything. Use a glycolic peel or lactic acid peel on target areas.</li>
            <li> This product works slower than I expected but it does work. Been using it for about a month and spots on my face are diminished but slower than I expected. However, the cream dries out on my face and leaves &amp;#34;flakes&amp;#34; which can be annoying, it looks like dry skin but is actually the dried out cream. Tried rubbing it in and using less but it doesn&#x27;t matter...I would buy this again</li>
            <li> works just as good as Proactive and a lot less expensive</li>
            <li> Hydroquinone: this carcinogenic chemical is actually banned in most countries- except the US! Why? Besides increasing skin sensitivity, it has been linked to tumor growth! This is not something you want to be rubbing into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Consider: CITY Cosmetics Radiance Illuminator</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for two months and I have not seen a difference. don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> I tried this per the directions and it doesn&#x27;t work for me. It might have worked for others but not me.</li>
            <li> Only gave it 1 star as 0 stars is apparently not an option. Most Equate products are pretty comparable to the name brands they stand in for. Not so with this product, which did not have the same consistency as the ProActiv I&#x27;ve been using for some time. It does not go on or absorb like ProActiv and is not something I plan to use any more. Fortunately, I&#x27;ve now found some ProActiv elsewhere and can toss this in the trash.</li>
            <li> Im dark skin and have dark spots on my hands and face. I was struggling with so many products before I discover Equate Dark Spot Corrector Skin Lightener, and my spots didnt want to go and didnt have any hope to see them removed. But once I tried this product it was like a miracle, everything disappeared!! Im so gladddd to have a skin lighter without spots. It was a very good choice, I do recommend it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any change in my dark spots after using for a couple months, but I must say I didn&#x27;t expect to as I&#x27;ve tried other products as well with no results. :-(</li>
            <li> I have been using the Equate Dark Spot Corrector for about six months and I think it is slowly lightening the dark spots on my face.  Since I can see some improvement, I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so waxy you can&#x27;t really rub it in without it balling up.  The only way I found to spread it around effectively was to dot small amounts over the desired areas then quickly smooth it out.  Nevertheless it feels disgusting on the skin; you definitely need to put on some other moisturizer over it to dilute the yuckiness.  On a positive note, it does make for a good primer under powder foundation as the powder sticks to it really well and the small amounts of this stuff that incidentally get on eyebrows while applying to the forehead hold brows in place better than any brow gel.  Unfortunately, after 2 weeks of twice daily use there&#x27;s no sign of improvement to my melasma spots.  To be fair, 2 weeks may not be enough time to assess effectiveness as some products take longer to work.  However, I can&#x27;t tolerate the feel of this stuff any longer so I&#x27;m shelling out $25 for the Paula&#x27;s Choice hydroquinone gel.  I haven&#x27;t tried that yet, but it doesn&#x27;t have the cheap emollient waxes in the ingredients list that the Equate does so hopefully the texture is more tolerable.  Regarding hydroquinone, reputable research shows it to be safe, effective and not carcinogenic in humans.  Here&#x27;s a link to a nice summary including scholarly sources: http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/hydroquinone</li>
            <li> doesnt feel good on skin...bad smelling</li>
            <li> I threw it away because I it contain materials in it I do not want on my skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered two tubes of this item, used one for over three weeks and have not seen any improvement. This item does not work at all.  Skip it !  Do not waste your hard earned money..</li>
            <li> I have dark spots from my acne, I had the dark spot corrector from proactive but it is expensive and it make my face really greasy, I did not like that because I already have oily skin,  so I decided to look for something else and  while looking around I found this. I was a little skeptical but I bought it anyway and to my surprise it actually worked pretty good.  After using it for a little over 2 weeks I noticed a difference,  my dark spot were not all gone but they were much lighter than before. I had this ugly pimple that left a really dark spot on my chin and it is much lighter than before. I use this twice a day, once in the morning (I&#x27;ll use it with sunscreen if I go out) and  before bedtime.  I can easily use it before bed because it does not have a strong scent like the proactive dark spot corrector. I only have one complaint it does  dry up my skin but I was able to fix it by putting a light moisturizer over my face after using it. So it might cause some people to have dry skin or make their skin even drier but I think if you find a good moisturizer for you skin it won&#x27;t be much of a problem.</li>
            <li> This product feels and looks like toothpaste on your skin, Horrible consistency, totally different than the Proactiv skin lightener.  I used it once, wiped it off my face, and put this in the garbage.</li>
            <li> This cream is really good! I used it for a couple of days and the difference in skin appearance was unbelievable. I used many other more expensive creams, and surprisingly this one happens to be one of the best.</li>
            <li> This product really worked for me.  I have med skin and 53.  I noticed some dark spots forming on my face.  I recently began buying products for lines and wrinkles so I went ahead and purchased this.  The second night I used it I did notice that my biggest spot was lighter.  This really works!  The more consistently I use it the better the results.  This is the only product I will use.  This is the cheapest of them all and for the results I was looking for.  It is no miracle and I know results will vary but I do recommend this to all who are not wanting to look like a leopard.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product. It didn&#x27;t fade the two age spots on my face, not even a little.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it is just my skin type, but I did not see much change in the dark spots I have, seems to have had very little impact.  Maybe others will have better results.</li>
            <li> I used this product for about 3-4 weeks before I noticed a difference in the look of the dark spots on my face.  They did lighten up some, they&#x27;re not gone, but hey anything is better than nothing.  Probably around week 5 I noticed that the areas that I applied the lightener to were becoming sensitive to the touch.  Over the next few day they became mildly painful.  Then they started getting pink and eventually red over the course of another few days.  My husband asked my what the little wounds were on my forehead.  That is not what I was going for, it did seem like the skin was breaking down.  My skin is very fair, but I&#x27;ve never had allergic reactions to any other products.  Needless to say I threw it away and at least it was a cheap experiment.</li>
            <li> Have not seen much of any difference in lightening spots, slow to work.  Compared to Garnier Light Fairness from India this product beats them all and is the best ever.</li>
            <li> Not really noticing a difference. Probably will not order again.</li>
            <li> Am currently using and have no comment</li>
            <li> I have scars from zits under my lip and this product has worked great. It took about 2 weeks to see improvement. I have relatively clear skin, but occasionally I get a couple under my lip, and it drives me crazy. I couldn&#x27;t recommend a better product!</li>
            <li> kind of works.. used it every day for a year.. maybe works?? can&#x27;t really tell a difference..</li>
            <li> I now have those awful age spots - ohhhh nooooo.  BUT I have found this product to help reduce their appearance.</li>
            <li> given as a gift.  never got any feed back</li>
            <li> makes my skin breakout in little white pimples</li>
            <li> This is the worst product I have ever used so far! My face was full of itchy rashes, which prevented me from falling into sleep at night, after using the corretor for only 5 days.&lt;br /&gt;I suggest people should buy brand name cosmetics products instead of non well known products.</li>
            <li> This is the Walmart brand, and usually that doesn&#x27;t matter, but in this case it does. I have some pretty old acne scars that I suspect are never going anywhere, but even with the newer ones (scars and red spots from acne that developed in recent weeks/months), I  noticed no difference after several months of using this cream and had a lot of trouble rubbing it into my skin - fine for the night time, but not during the day. I have found that dabbing some pure lemon juice (from real lemons) on my acne spots and scars is much more effective and way cheaper... just wash it off after about 4-10 minutes. This also clears your skin up! I swear by lemons now!!</li>
            <li> I bought this on Walmart web site for $5.97 but with shipping and tax it came to the same as amazons price.Been using for several weeks at night only.its very thick I find it takes forever to blend in my skin leaving this white coating on my face so bed time is best after I use oil of olay microdermabrasion brush to rid of the daily cream and oils on my skin.I turning 50 in 3 weeks and i recently started developing age spots on both cheek bones and some assorted spots on my forehead that were really bothering me.I was from early teens to my early 40 a sun worshiper lived in Hawaii and Florida then use of tanning beds.I have stopped tanning for about 8 years now.I don&#x27;t look 50 more like 38 but these age spots drive me crazy.I have been using L&#x27;Oreal dark spot serum during the day its blends smooth smells good and is easy to put make up over and this product at night equate dark spot corrector.I have found all my age spots fading nicely.now its been 6 weeks since i started the loreal and a little over 4 weeks since i started the equate at night but I ma seeing a big difference.I hope with a few more months they will be gone and I can move on to just maintaining no wrinkles or at least less visible ones</li>
            <li> I only have been using it for two months and so far I don&#x27;t see any difference. I&#x27;m still going to continue to use it.</li>
            <li> was not strong enough  did not see results  it was not what I expected  tried it for a week sorry</li>
            <li> I was given steroids as well as corticosteroids and they created some bad brown spots that were worsening over time. Now I can already see they are beginning to lighten. Thanks for the fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I do see a difference. but very slowly</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product as consistently as I should have. I haven&#x27;t noticed too much of a difference in fading of some dark spots on my face but as I said, I haven&#x27;t been using it much. It does cause me to break out where I apply it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for some small spots on my body and noticed that it works well on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I didn&#x27;t spend a lot on this product. At least though I can use it on certain body parts!</li>
            <li> I have used it  faithfully morning and evening for over a month and I have noticed no difference.  Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> My wife wasn&#x27;t impressed. It is a long process; so, may be too early to tell.</li>
            <li> This actually works, but you have to be consistent and results aren&#x27;t immediate.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband. Within a week of use he began to have rashes on his face, he stopped using it. It did work for dark spots but he had side effects.</li>
            <li> Applied this product faithfully and saw no difference whatsoever. Waste of money. Only gave it 2 stars because it was mild and non-irritating.</li>
            <li> I got this because over the summer I had some discoloration on the skin above my upper lip from tanning without sunscreen (yikes I know).  I researched remedies for the discoloration online and came across this product.  For less than $13 and with my Prime shipping I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot.  I used it ONE TIME (last night) and the discoloration is ALMOST GONE already.  I can&#x27;t believe that this whole time I could have used this and not had a problem all summer...I was so self conscious of it because I like to go without makeup in the summer if I can and I felt like I couldn&#x27;t because of the darker skin.  WOW this stuff is amazing.  And I like that they&#x27;re comparing it to the Proactiv Dark Spot Corrector because that was something else I was looking into but didn&#x27;t want to spend the money...</li>
            <li> I have tried about 20 different products and nothing worked! I have the worst brown spots on my face (from many years of sun bathing) and I dont want to spend hundreds of dollars for 1 treatment at the Dr.&#x27;s office. I read the reviews on the product and I thought &amp;#34;what the heck, lets add this one to the list&amp;#34;. I wanted to wait a month to give this product a real review. Well, after 1 month and 1 week, my face is about 40% better than it was when I started! It helps lighten the brown spots and helps the tone of my face look more even. I use it every night before bed and I may bump it up to twice a day but I dont want to put makeup over it because its just a tiny bit greasy. I will continue to use this product and I will buy more. I am still on my first tube and probably can go another 3 weeks. Thats pretty good for the price. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I bought this at Wal-Mart instead of on Amazon sorry it was cheaper at Wal-Mart. However I saw results in a week on some areas. The darkest spots are lightening but slower. I attribute this to the darker spots were pimples that I had picked at relentlessly. In two weeks of application the spots have changed from blackish to brown. I&#x27;m pleased that I have seen results but now I&#x27;m impatient to see the spots gone. I will do an updated review when and if the spots are completely gone. Ive changed how I&#x27;m using it as well. Initially I applied it to larger areas which brightened my complexion but now I&#x27;m strategically applying it to the spots only because I don&#x27;t want to lighten or bleach my facial skin too light I&#x27;m a medium complexion African-American woman. I will be grateful when I can stop using concealer.                               Adding an update 10/13/14 as of today the spots are not gone but substantially less visible. To use this product you must be relentless in the use. Also exfoliate and drink plenty of water. In addition to using the product I also am using biotin so far I&#x27;m pleased and ready for the next step when the spots are gone which will be changing or improving the texture of my skin. The quest continues......</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple months and think I see a very slight improvement.  Don&#x27;t buy this expecting miracles.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t see that it is doing what is suppose to do.  Will continue to use it though to see if it makes any difference after long time use.  So far not to excited.</li>
            <li> it works just takes a while to see results, ill continue using it, not sure if ull purchase it again</li>
            <li> This fades spots just as well as the more expensive drug store brands. It is a lightweight product that won&#x27;t interfere with your other skin care items. Nothing will remove dark skin spots completely but this does a very good job of fading.</li>
            <li> The dark spots are fading! working great! I really do like how well it&#x27;s working and will recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son who has some spots caused by Acne and he likes it and so far it is holding on.</li>
            <li> Been using this Product for the last two week. I&#x27;ve already seen a big difference. I use this in conjunction with Roc Daily resurfacing disk, and Olay total effects and C Powder.  My face has never been so bright and soft. I&#x27;ve already stopped wearing foundation.</li>
            <li> I would say that dark spots began to lighten within a week.&lt;br /&gt;This is better than other products I have used.</li>
            <li> I have had dark spots on my cheeks for quite some time now and I can definitely notice them fading away! Awesome! I apply only at night and always wear a sunscreen !</li>
            <li> i am very happy with this product, i had read the reviews and so to me, it was a 50/50 chance i was going to see any difference with my spots.  to me, just using the first week i saw a dramatic lightening of a spot on my cheek. i do not see much difference with the spots on my hands but i was better at remembering the one on my cheek than my hands so i will continue to use this product and yes, i would buy again in a heartbeat!!</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 tubes.  I finished 1 tube.  If I knew I could not return the remaining unopened tubes; I would not have ordered 3</li>
            <li> Like all skin products, it depends on your skin type and this worked for a while but after a month or two, it didn&#x27;t work anymore.</li>
            <li> I started using this product almost every night (only at night) the week before Thanksgiving so it&#x27;s been about a month and a half. I had significant dark spots from &amp;#34;leftover&amp;#34; summer tans over the years. I have tried other products in the past with little to no effect. This product is working VERY WELL for me! Darkened areas are already light enough that I don&#x27;t need to use concealer unless I want to look &amp;#34;flawless&amp;#34;. I will continue to use nightly and hope to fade spots away completely. Yes, it is a toothpaste-like consistency and white in color but who cares when you&#x27;re sleeping? It works for me!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure enough yet if this has had a lot of impact.  I have freckles and sun spots and they may have lighted a small amount after one month of usage.  Seems like the older it gets, the smellier and thicker it gets.  The price is reasonable compared to a lot of other choices.  Wish there was something that was guaranteed to work.</li>
            <li> The bottom line the effective ingredigent (2% hrdoquines)is the same n most n all over the counter lighten cream. Its government regulated. But for price an not a lot of bs additives its not bad.</li>
            <li> Didnt get rid of my dark spots at all bottle look fake too.</li>
            <li> Worthless, didn&#x27;t lighten my dark spots at all!</li>
            <li> For the price, this is a great product. I have used Clinique&#x27;s Dark spot corrector and skin brightener, which is 5 times the cost, and the Equate worked just as good. I definitely saw brighter skin, only after a week of using it, morning and night. However, it didn&#x27;t zap a few brown spots, as I had hoped...that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars. But overall, my face looked amazingly &#x27;brighter&#x27;! Have already ordered more</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love the idea of the ingredient in this product (which is banned in Europe) but I can say that it definitely reduces dark spots, so I keep using it. Reduction is ... around 50%. So, pretty good.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different products for facial dark spots but did not see results. I am seeing visible results with this product. Not instant but it does seem to be working!</li>
            <li> this cream does not rub into my skin at all so I end up having to smear it around the affected area trying to rub it in but it gets onto a way larger area than I wanted it to. also haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my skin. I&#x27;m not using it religiously, but I feel like I should have seen a difference using it at least 2 times a week for the past month and a half. I wish I just spent the extra few bucks and went with the proactive brand because this one isn&#x27;t working well for me.</li>
            <li> This is my first review ever but I couldn&#x27;t pass up letting people know how great this product really is. I have one particular spot on my face from acne that always gets really dark when I tan and it looks almost like a bruise. I have paid high dollar for products hoping to make this spot disappear and finally ran across this one while walking through Walmart.  Within one week my spot has almost completely faded and I couldn&#x27;t be more thankful.  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I have olive skin and have had a dark spot under my eye since I was a teenager that looks like a make-up smudge. This took about 3 weeks until it started to fade it, but it is getting smaller now by the day. I have been using for close to 2 months and am starting to have to look for the mark to put this on!</li>
            <li> I am darker skinned than most people so a lot of skin lighteners don&#x27;t work for me.  This however does.  It is best lightener I have used to date &amp; it was surprisingly gentle on the skin.  Must be all those vitamins it is fortified with.  I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I had a tummy tuck scar that was a dark brown color, and this stuff is working great on that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this twice now, so it is possibly too early to see results.  Package arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> If I could give 1/2 star, that would be more accurate.  The 1/2 is for the price.  I started using the product about 6 weeks ago.  No other changes to my daily routines or diet.  2 weeks ago, I ended up in the ER w/ heart palpitations (PVCs - unexplained - every 3-5 minutes 24 hrs a day).  I am scheduled for a heart monitor and a stress test now.  However, I started thinking about this cream being the only difference in my life, and wondered if it might have something to do w/ it, so I stopped using it.  Heart palpitations have stopped - things are back to normal.  Going to get the heart test anyway to check for damage.  This product has EDTA and several other questionable ingredients.  Use w/ caution.</li>
            <li> It works , didn&#x27;t lighten my acne scars as much as I wanted to but then again my acne scars aren&#x27;t that bad , just try it , everyone is different and it might just work for you ! (:</li>
            <li> it doesnt work. been using it for weeks no change at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and I really see no difference. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> This product kinda drys out my skin, not sure if it&#x27;s really working</li>
            <li> I prefer Proactive Dark Spot Corrector!</li>
            <li> THS PRODUCT ONLY WORKS ON NEW BLEMISHES NOT ON THE OLD ONES</li>
            <li> This is an inexpensive product and seems to work well on a dark spot on my face.</li>
            <li> purchased for teenage grandson and it helped some of the issues he was experiencing.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Used for over a month and no change to my sun spot. None. Not even a little!</li>
            <li> This dark spot corrector is not helpful to remove dark spots. I wasted my money for a junk product.</li>
