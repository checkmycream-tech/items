            <li>, This shampoo is one of the best in the market.</li>
            <li>I subscribed to it and am very happy.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo!  </li>
            <li>so my husband and I are working through them the best we can</li>
            <li>oh my hair and smells very good.</li>
            <li>I am delighted with this shampoo!</li>
            <li>your hair goes through a period where it doesn&#x27;t feel all that great.  </li>
            <li>This is a great shampoo for colored hair.</li>
            <li>This is a great shampoo</li>
            <li>It smells awesome and leaves my hair nice and healthy.</li>
            <li>It IS good on my color-treated hair, though.</li>
            <li>Good buy, it comes in a 3 pack.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to use the rest of them since I&#x27;m the proud owner of 3 bottles, but I won&#x27;t get more.</li>
            <li>My hair felt so smooth and smelled so good that I was hooked!</li>
            <li>First of all, it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>For my hair, which is not colored and is \\&quot;normal\\&quot; but somewhat fine, this shampoo is great.</li>
            <li>I have color treated hair, so chose the Rose and Chamomile Shampoo and Conditioner for Color Treated Hair.   </li>
            <li>- it seems to effectively neutralize chlorine</li>
            <li>This shampoo very volumizing and smells delicious.</li>
            <li>I loved the shampoo, made with essential oils makes it smell soo wonderful!</li>
            <li>I love this particular E.O. shampoo because of the wonderful scent.</li>
            <li>I had tried EO at a hotel, and loved how clean my hair felt afterwards, and the smell was so nice.</li>
            <li>I do think the rose &amp; chamomile is a fragrance that is strong but nice.  </li>
            <li>My daughter who does not have color-treated hair was more pleased with its performance, rating it three stars.</li>
            <li>I am happy with the way it lathers, as many shampoos without SLS don&#x27;t seem to lather very well.</li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t treated, but I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I love EO products and try to use them almost exclusively, when I can afford them.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite organic/natural shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I happen to love it, so I was practically intoxicated with it</li>
            <li>, I know it&#x27;s safe for children.</li>
            <li>My children actually love the smell and the fragrance lasts without being too \\&quot;girly.\\</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>To me it smells more herbal than flowery.</li>
            <li>Add mine to the many reviews that mention the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Well there are better shampoos out there.</li>
            <li>Not a perfumery rose, but a \\&quot;real\\&quot; rose, much like</li>
            <li>so i ordered the EO for color treated hair, it has a strong smell that isnt so wonderful, but it still is a good shampoo, and I like that it is made locally to where I live.</li>
            <li>I use the grapefruit/mint body wash in my morning shower and it gives me a great start to my busy day.</li>
            <li>First I will state that I do not have colored hair, I just LOVE this shampoo anyway!</li>
            <li>Unless you need an uber-moisturizing shampoo or are very particular about what fragrance you want in your shampoo, this product would work well for most people.:)</li>
            <li>A light fragrance that smells like roses.</li>
            <li>I love everything about it, cleans gently smells lovely, but I also appreciate the ingredients or lack there of.  </li>
            <li>My hair smells good all day, is shiny and is soft too.</li>
            <li>&quot; I&#x27;m sure the fragrance may not appeal to some, but I am pretty picky</li>
            <li>I tried it initially because I love EO rose products, so when they came out with the shampoo I had to try it.</li>
            <li>I love EO products - the Chamomile &amp; Honey and Rose shampoos/conditioners seem to work really well on my fine, long, virgin hair (that means I don&#x27;t dye or perm it, ok?</li>
            <li>the only good thing I can say about it is it does make your hair smell nice-- a natural, light scent.</li>
            <li>I love to use the rose shampoo/conditioner after swimming or after a long day</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and, since I know it is natural and doesn&#x27;t have any toxic ingredients in it</li>
            <li>the wild rugosa rose we have on the coast of Maine.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s got a strong scent, but unlike most fruit-y and over-scented hair care products, this is predominantly the natural smell of roses.</li>
            <li>But there&#x27;s enough rose for me to enjoy using it after all.</li>
            <li>Initially I was put off by the chamomile element; I would prefer just rose.</li>
            <li>I have used only the one for color treated hair, Rose and Chamomile</li>
            <li>The shampoo smells nice and tragically, that is the only thing it has going for it.  </li>
            <li>I use numerous EO products with the rose and chamomile scent.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t right for my hair but, being a frugal mom,  </li>
            <li>Very impressed left my hair very soft and even extended me getting a trim for over a month extra than normal</li>
            <li>If your hair is super dry like mine, you may want to choose a more moisturizing formula.</li>
            <li>When used in conjunction with the matching conditioner, or the chamomile and honey conditioner, this shampoo is gentle enough for my fine and damaged hair and keeps it shiny and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Now it is smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>when I first tried this shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also did my own informal hair loss count, and find that I have 90% less hairs in my brush since I began using this product.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product very highly.</li>
            <li>Thanks EO.</li>
            <li>and this shampoo kept my hair very well.</li>
            <li>I did the subscribe and save and got a 3 pack of this for much cheaper than I&#x27;d pay at the store.</li>
            <li>I leaves my hair clean and does not dry it out.  </li>
            <li>It does not strip hair of color and it gently cleans without drying hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It lathers up very well.</li>
            <li>- this shampoo made my fly-away hair look and feel so much nicer.</li>
            <li>It is gentle on the hair and doesn&#x27;t alter your color.</li>
            <li>My hairstylist commented on how well I maintained my dark color, so it really is color safe.</li>
            <li>Rinses clean and you only need to shampoo once.  </li>
            <li>I do highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I always love how EO stuff smells, but this is a little too \\&quot;health food</li>
            <li>, left my hair clean but not dried out, and shinier than it had been.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other natural brands that can be purchased in the stores here in Indiana, but so far haven&#x27;t found anything close to EO&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>It did not leave my hair soft and shiny as described.  </li>
            <li>It cleans and leaves my hair looking and feeling soft.   </li>
            <li>Even my husband thinks it makes his hair feel gross, and his hair is obviously much shorter than mine.</li>
            <li>Once you get past that initial period, though, your hair will start to feel incredibly soft and of course healthy.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it smells - and it leaves a subtle scent sometimes</li>
            <li>It is yummy fruity-flowery, but not too much, and it doesn&#x27;t linger after your hair is dry.</li>
            <li>so much I threw away my other shampoos.</li>
            <li>This was a surprise because I&#x27;ve been a bit unhappy with the lackluster lather of most natural shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I have tried several other brands, but this is the product I will continue to use!</li>
            <li> I use the chamomille/rose body lotion in the evening and sleep like a baby because the smell and feel on the skin is uncomparable to other products.</li>
            <li> It also lathers quite well unlike some other organic/natural shampoos.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a residue, rinses well without making my hair feel stripped and the conditioners don&#x27;t weigh down my hair.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner is also terrific, and I hate using rise out conditioners, but this one is worth the trouble.  </li>
            <li> and  I have few highligths</li>
            <li> I was washing my hair everyday, sometimes twice</li>
            <li> Use them everyday</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to waste it</li>
            <li> Me lazy?  </li>
            <li> This shampoo smells lovely but it coats my hair and makes it feel disgusting.</li>
            <li> it was dull, and lifeless and had ZERO shine.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel dirty and heavy, worse than it feels after several days of not washing at all.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t treat my hair as I expected and the smell was fairly unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> My other EO lotions and shampoos almost smell like expensive perfumes (without the chemical-induced migraines!)</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally thin and a bit wavy/frizzy.  </li>
            <li> has a weird smell</li>
            <li> I have a lot of gray coming in at my roots and color processed ends - not a great combo!</li>
            <li> I was shocked at how drying it was.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s painful.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the performance of this product.  </li>

            <li> Initially I was put off by the chamomile element; I would prefer just rose. But there&#x27;s enough rose for me to enjoy using it after all. The smell is flowery and fruity, so if you like that in a perfume you&#x27;ll like this smell.  When used in conjunction with the matching conditioner, or the chamomile and honey conditioner, this shampoo is gentle enough for my fine and damaged hair and keeps it shiny and smooth.  Overall I like this shampoo a lot and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the performance of this product.  It did not leave my hair soft and shiny as described.  Rather than soothing my scalp, I found I had itchiness and irritation from the dryness.  My hair became unmanageable and frizzy.  I would not recommend this product if your hair is color-treated.  My daughter who does not have color-treated hair was more pleased with its performance, rating it three stars.</li>
            <li> I happened along this product while shopping at a local organic grocery in Sebastopol, CA. Since I had recently learned about the harmful effects of SLS and parabens, I was eager to try it out. I have color treated hair, so chose the Rose and Chamomile Shampoo and Conditioner for Color Treated Hair.   I am happy with the way it lathers, as many shampoos without SLS don&#x27;t seem to lather very well. It cleans and leaves my hair looking and feeling soft.   I also did my own informal hair loss count, and find that I have 90% less hairs in my brush since I began using this product. I would recommend this product very highly. I have tried several other brands, but this is the product I will continue to use!</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for years.  I love everything about it, cleans gently smells lovely, but I also appreciate the ingredients or lack there of.  When the store I shopped at stop carrying the shampoo regularly I turned to amazon.  The conditioner is also terrific, and I hate using rise out conditioners, but this one is worth the trouble.  What? Me lazy?  Ha!  Thanks EO.</li>
            <li> After 1000 of products I have tried for my long, long curly hair and  I have few highligths, This shampoo is one of the best in the market. I have used only the one for color treated hair, Rose and Chamomile and I recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Formula is not what it used to be.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t treated, but I love this shampoo.  I discovered this a number of years ago when I was staying at the beach in Florida.  I was washing my hair everyday, sometimes twice and this shampoo kept my hair very well.</li>
            <li> I love EO products and try to use them almost exclusively, when I can afford them. I did the subscribe and save and got a 3 pack of this for much cheaper than I&#x27;d pay at the store. I always love how EO stuff smells, but this is a little too \\&quot;health food store\\&quot; smelling to me. My other EO lotions and shampoos almost smell like expensive perfumes (without the chemical-induced migraines!) I&#x27;m going to use the rest of them since I&#x27;m the proud owner of 3 bottles, but I won&#x27;t get more. It IS good on my color-treated hair, though.</li>
            <li> E.O. Products don&#x27;t use chemicals like the majority of beauty products out on the market.  If you have been using chemical based products on your hair and switch to products like E.O your hair goes through a period where it doesn&#x27;t feel all that great.  Once you get past that initial period, though, your hair will start to feel incredibly soft and of course healthy.  I love this particular E.O. shampoo because of the wonderful scent. My hair smells good all day, is shiny and is soft too.</li>
            <li> This shampoo feels like silk oh my hair and smells very good. A light fragrance that smells like roses. It doesn&#x27;t strip the color from my hair either.  Good buy, it comes in a 3 pack.</li>
            <li> I love EO products - the Chamomile &amp; Honey and Rose shampoos/conditioners seem to work really well on my fine, long, virgin hair (that means I don&#x27;t dye or perm it, ok? no wisecracks).  It doesn&#x27;t leave a residue, rinses well without making my hair feel stripped and the conditioners don&#x27;t weigh down my hair.  I love the way it smells - and it leaves a subtle scent sometimes that has garnered compliments!    I love to use the rose shampoo/conditioner after swimming or after a long day - it seems to effectively neutralize chlorine and it&#x27;s like a personal aromatherapy session in my shower!    My only complaint is that EO doesn&#x27;t sell this in a bulk size - they sell their lavender shampoo in a bulk size on their website but not the other types of shampoo - I would gladly buy a gallon jug and avoid the multiple small bottles if I could!</li>
            <li> First I will state that I do not have colored hair, I just LOVE this shampoo anyway! I tried it initially because I love EO rose products, so when they came out with the shampoo I had to try it. For my hair, which is not colored and is \\&quot;normal\\&quot; but somewhat fine, this shampoo is great. It smells awesome and leaves my hair nice and healthy. I usually use it with the matching conditioner and with the two together they leave my hair very soft. I do highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I had tried EO at a hotel, and loved how clean my hair felt afterwards, and the smell was so nice. so i ordered the EO for color treated hair, it has a strong smell that isnt so wonderful, but it still is a good shampoo, and I like that it is made locally to where I live.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite organic/natural shampoo.  I leaves my hair clean and does not dry it out.  My hairstylist commented on how well I maintained my dark color, so it really is color safe.</li>
            <li> The shampoo smells nice and tragically, that is the only thing it has going for it.  I was shocked at how drying it was.  I used it twice and threw it out because it was so drying that it damaged my hair.  Don&#x27;t be fooled.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo for colored hair. My red stays red and shiny for weeks! My hair is naturally thin and a bit wavy/frizzy.  Now it is smooth and soft. I use it along with French Lavender leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have used the Protective Shampoo for color treated hair and like it&#x27;s performance.  It does not strip hair of color and it gently cleans without drying hair.  I do think the rose &amp; chamomile is a fragrance that is strong but nice.  I could not continually use it like I can the lavender, though, because the fragrance is so distinctive and not as pleasing/calming as the lavender.</li>
            <li> has a weird smell don&#x27;t love it too expensive would buy again because of smell kinda tingly too not a fan</li>
            <li> I loved the shampoo, made with essential oils makes it smell soo wonderful! I subscribed to it and am very happy. Have already given 2 as gifts..</li>
            <li> Very impressed left my hair very soft and even extended me getting a trim for over a month extra than normal</li>
            <li> I am delighted with this shampoo! First of all, it smells wonderful. Yes, it&#x27;s got a strong scent, but unlike most fruit-y and over-scented hair care products, this is predominantly the natural smell of roses. Not a perfumery rose, but a \\&quot;real\\&quot; rose, much like the wild rugosa rose we have on the coast of Maine. I happen to love it, so I was practically intoxicated with it when I first tried this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lathers up very well. This was a surprise because I&#x27;ve been a bit unhappy with the lackluster lather of most natural shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It rinsed out well, left my hair clean but not dried out, and shinier than it had been. I have a lot of gray coming in at my roots and color processed ends - not a great combo! - this shampoo made my fly-away hair look and feel so much nicer. It&#x27;s a winner! I like it so much I threw away my other shampoos. I kid you not.</li>
            <li> I use numerous EO products with the rose and chamomile scent. I also the the shower gel and lotion. Use them everyday</li>
            <li> I tried this shampoo (plus the conditioner) while visiting a friend in Seattle, WA. My hair felt so smooth and smelled so good that I was hooked! Going back to Indiana, I ordered on-line, adding and trying other products from their line. Now I am hooked on all of them! I use the grapefruit/mint body wash in my morning shower and it gives me a great start to my busy day. I use the chamomille/rose body lotion in the evening and sleep like a baby because the smell and feel on the skin is uncomparable to other products. I have tried many other natural brands that can be purchased in the stores here in Indiana, but so far haven&#x27;t found anything close to EO&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo!  Rinses clean and you only need to shampoo once.  Loads of suds without all the sulfates.....</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t treat my hair as I expected and the smell was fairly unpleasant.  I won&#x27;t reorder.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo but I wouldn&#x27;t limit it to colored-treated hair. If your hair is super dry like mine, you may want to choose a more moisturizing formula. It wasn&#x27;t right for my hair but, being a frugal mom,  I didn&#x27;t want to waste it so instead I used it to wash my kids&#x27; hair. It smells amazing and, since I know it is natural and doesn&#x27;t have any toxic ingredients in it, I know it&#x27;s safe for children. My children actually love the smell and the fragrance lasts without being too \\&quot;girly.\\&quot; I&#x27;m sure the fragrance may not appeal to some, but I am pretty picky and I love it. To me it smells more herbal than flowery. It also lathers quite well unlike some other organic/natural shampoos. Unless you need an uber-moisturizing shampoo or are very particular about what fragrance you want in your shampoo, this product would work well for most people.:)</li>
            <li> This shampoo very volumizing and smells delicious. Leaves my hair radiant!</li>
            <li> My hair definitely did not like this shampoo.  it was dull, and lifeless and had ZERO shine.  I won&#x27;t be buying this again</li>
            <li> Add mine to the many reviews that mention the fragrance. It is yummy fruity-flowery, but not too much, and it doesn&#x27;t linger after your hair is dry. It is gentle on the hair and doesn&#x27;t alter your color. I will buy it again and will try the conditioner as well.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells lovely but it coats my hair and makes it feel disgusting. I actually bought a 3 pack of these so my husband and I are working through them the best we can but it&#x27;s painful. It doesn&#x27;t lather. It makes my hair feel dirty and heavy, worse than it feels after several days of not washing at all. the only good thing I can say about it is it does make your hair smell nice-- a natural, light scent. Even my husband thinks it makes his hair feel gross, and his hair is obviously much shorter than mine. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Well there are better shampoos out there. Strange scent for me. But cleans well</li>
