            <li> the part about the stickiness is false and the part about the oily skin is true also</li>
            <li> because I have dry skin</li>
            <li> that is such a waste of product.....</li>
            <li> The out side was a bit wet when I got it</li>
            <li> I spray it on while my face is still wet and rub it all over it.</li>
            <li> I forgot to mention I got the pink one(moist mist)</li>
            <li> I got the moist mist because I heard the other one smelled like baby powder.</li>
            <li> I have read other reviews about how it&#x27;s sticky and not for people with oily skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times</li>
            <li> Although I think my spritzer is broken which is a shame</li>
            <li> I just discovered TonyMoly products and have went crazy buying them!</li>

            <li> Smells so good omg. I&#x27;ve used it a few times and I&#x27;ve been beyond pleased. No shiny nose (which I really struggle with)</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this item I take it everywhere.</li>
            <li> I adore this packaging and everything from how it looks to how it smells! Although I think my spritzer is broken which is a shame i&#x27;m actually really upset about it. It only works like if i spray 10 times i can get one spritz out and I feel like that is such a waste of product.....</li>
            <li> This smells very pleasant, and it wakes me up. If you&#x27;re sweating your days away in the hot summer, this is a good mist.</li>
            <li> I would like this more if the spray nozzle didn&#x27;t spray in droplets. It smells great, hydrates, and looks adorable, but it doesn&#x27;t spray in a fine mist as others I have come across. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll repurchase.</li>
            <li> Lovely smell and light. Great on my skin and refreshing</li>
            <li> This smells really fruity... in a good way! It hydrates my skin very well.</li>
            <li> So, I have very sensitive skin, and this spray is AMAZING. It literally makes me glow. I don&#x27;t think I have ever loved a skincare product the way I love this one. I keep it in my purse, and take it everywhere with me. One quick spritz, and I&#x27;m refreshed, and glowing.</li>
            <li> I got the moist mist because I heard the other one smelled like baby powder. This smells like fruits or fruit scented highlighters. It smells fine. The out side was a bit wet when I got it and I realized it had leaked a bit. I just tightened jt when I opened it. It is more like a spritz and it dried pretty quickly. I think it is pretty good. Came in quickly as well. Doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or anything. Doesnt make my face run either. Woo</li>
            <li> My product looks different than pictured, but is still the same item. Definitely keeps my face moist and I&#x27;ve used it a few times in the middle of the day as a refresher with good results.</li>
            <li> I got it early and it is wonderful I use it right after I get done washing my face I spray it on while my face is still wet and rub it all over it. I have read other reviews about how it&#x27;s sticky and not for people with oily skin the part about the stickiness is false and the part about the oily skin is true also I forgot to mention I got the pink one(moist mist) because I have dry skin it left my face feeling soft and after I was my face at night I spray some on and leave it on over night and I wake up with even softer skin I recommend this highly for people with dry skin OH I almost forgot this smell is wonderful it smells like sweet grapefruit</li>
            <li> So cute! I love my pocket bunny!!! works really well. The packaging is great!</li>
            <li> I love this so much! It is so worth it!</li>
            <li> Semells so good!!!!! Love it and it&#x27;s super cute</li>
