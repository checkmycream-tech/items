            <li>Good stuff!  </li>
            <li>Great cream.  </li>
            <li>Great.  </li>
            <li>GREAT LIKE THE PRODUCT</li>
            <li>Surprisingly making a difference to my face and neck when used with Revitol.</li>
            <li>Good hydration, but no wrinkle repair as it promises.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as good as I was lead to believe.  </li>
            <li>Been using the product for over a month, haven&#x27;t seen a change.&lt;br /&gt;Personally feel over the counter products work just as good.</li>
            <li>Good as a moisturizer but didn&#x27;t do what they said.</li>
            <li>People have commented on how nice my skin is.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t receive the results that were promised, but still a nice moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Nice Cream.  </li>
            <li>Really nice - I use it as eye cream.</li>
            <li>but it goes on nice..</li>
            <li>Love, I am combining it with my moisture and loving the effect</li>
            <li>But not any more effective when using Revitol.</li>
            <li>I love how well it works with the Revitol Anti Aging Moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li>When I called after my trial period was over and told them I didnt want any more, I got the run-around.</li>
            <li>used them tighter and you will love it</li>
            <li>Will try one more bottle.  </li>
            <li>I plan to continue using these products and maybe be able to reach a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li>Seen where if you use this with revitol it would work much better.  </li>
            <li>I find I have more wrinkles up any.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, good price</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about 9 months and am very excited to see it available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Too strong for my skin.  </li>
            <li>Used for over two months didn&#x27;t see much change, but skin did feel nice.  </li>
            <li>IT WAS FULL TO THE TOP.&lt;br /&gt;AFTER</li>
            <li>These two products in combination, i.e., Dermology Phytoceramides Wrinkle Repair Complex, and Revitol are the best products on the market today.  </li>
            <li>It dries quickly with no slippery feel when applying foundation.</li>
            <li>Got it quickly.  </li>
            <li>and I enjoy the gentle tightening of my skin</li>
            <li>And free sample was far from free in the end.</li>
            <li>I feel after it is absorbed.</li>
            <li>I am a very laid back, mild manners person and actually had to use foul language and threaten them with a law suit if they charged my card more for more product.</li>
            <li>Went back to my Mary Kay and Avon products that do better.</li>
            <li>Will more than likely re-order when this runs out.  </li>
            <li>THE FIRST TIME I BOUGHT THE PRODUCT</li>
            <li>His next words better be that it was canceled.</li>
            <li>Do NOT try this product unless you absolutely know you will want to keep on purchasing it!</li>
            <li>Too many red flags</li>
            <li>Only drawback is that I mostly get asked out by men in their thirties.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Within two weeks he had an almost identical story out about a famous woman that lied to America about her beauty secrets and now professes her &amp;#34;real secret&amp;#34; is two different products all together.  </li>
            <li>To be fair, I realize that things work differently for different people.  </li>
            <li>As long as I don&#x27;t put it on more than once a day, (as opposed to the three times a day which is listed on the bottle), I do not break out.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t really tell any difference.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Very noticeable results.  </li>
            <li>When I open the container it appeared to look like a full jar; however it was not</li>
            <li>(I took picture before starting treatment and those babies are still smiling back at me and having more babies!)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I highly recommend both of them to all of the ladies.  </li>
            <li>At least the Revitol is a nice face cream that doesn&#x27;t deliver it&#x27;s promise; but, Dermology isn&#x27;t even a decent face cream, if you plan on putting makeup over it or hitting the pillow within an hour.</li>
            <li>I have been using  Dermology along withRevitol  for less than a month and have definitely been able to see an improvement in my complexion.</li>
            <li>and I have said CLEARLY I don&#x27;t want the product SEVEN times.</li>
            <li>but so far, I like the results.........</li>
            <li>This product is not the real one you buy from the actual site.</li>
            <li>Finally I told them I have recorded the whole conversation</li>
            <li>I like so far.  </li>
            <li>so far I see no change.</li>
            <li>I really hope no one else has the same results that I did.  </li>
            <li>THE JARS ARE LESS-NOT EVEN CLOSE TO HALF FULL.</li>
            <li>THAT NOT EVEN HALF FULL</li>
            <li>After a week, I gave up and went back to my old faithful standbys, Bag Balm and Crisco.  </li>

            <li> THE JARS ARE LESS-NOT EVEN CLOSE TO HALF FULL.</li>
            <li> THAT NOT EVEN HALF FULL</li>
            <li> After a week, I gave up and went back to my old faithful standbys, Bag Balm and Crisco.  </li>
            <li> I am also disappointed that when I bought this product it had been endorsed by Dr. Oz and had a before and after picture of a 74 year old granny that showed amazing results.  </li>
            <li> I am a 52 year old grandmother and am told almost everyday that I look like I am in my mid thirties.  </li>
            <li> Days after ordering I saw the same ad, with the same claims and celebrityphotos but with two other products.</li>
            <li> So far, we noticed small improvements on the softness of the facial skin.</li>
            <li> burns make skin feel dry, product sent in bag with no info, or instructions.</li>
            <li> Saying they would extend my trial or give me half off my next purchase.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this a little over a month.  </li>
            <li> I am a bit surprised that there are some negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> Also, I did try each one individually with the same negative results.</li>
            <li> I am only a few weeks in</li>
            <li> I saw absolutely NO noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t what I expected</li>
            <li> Might as well ripped up the money I spent on this product and thrown it away.</li>
            <li> use it as a hand cream and when the jars are empty, I&#x27;ll find another use for them...</li>
            <li> As for it absorbing into the skin, that&#x27;s questionable just because the dry time is so long...</li>
            <li> Jar is deceiving - 1 fluid oz doesn&#x27;t even fill half the jar!!  </li>
            <li> Leaves my face uncomfortably dry and not easy to apply liquid foundation afterwards.</li>
            <li> NOT WORTH THE COST  </li>
            <li> Product is one half of an online scam.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I am using this correctly, and haven&#x27;t seen any visible difference in lessening wrinkles as expected.</li>
            <li> Does not work don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> it may just get air dried.</li>
            <li> I used as directed but it was a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> What a small bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> No more wrinkle reducer products.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how I was suppose to use this product.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for at least 4 months.  </li>
            <li> and since I started using soon after, it was too late to return and get one that appears to have been used and recyled to me.</li>
            <li> Not good.  </li>
            <li> By the way, it didnt work for me at all and actually starting being painful to apply.</li>
            <li> Useless - do not buy - waste of your money</li>
            <li> what a scam my face looked worse after using this</li>
            <li> Disappointing...</li>
            <li> I did not have any bad reaction to it, and I do have sensitive-to-some-creams skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just disappointed that there has been NO improvement yet.</li>
            <li> It caused an allergic reaction!!!&lt;br /&gt;:(</li>
            <li> Very disappointed:(</li>
            <li> Disappointed!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in the product I have been using it now for two months and rather than seeing improvement</li>
            <li> VERY UNHAPPY !!</li>
            <li> The customer service for this company is HORRIBLE!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Surprisingly making a difference to my face and neck when used with Revitol.</li>
            <li> Not good.  And free sample was far from free in the end.</li>
            <li> Good hydration, but no wrinkle repair as it promises.</li>
            <li> What a small bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> I am only a few weeks in but so far, I like the results.........I use it in conjunction with Revitol.  It is a non-greasy moisturizer under make-up in the morning.  It dries quickly with no slippery feel when applying foundation.</li>
            <li> I use this in combination with the Revitol moisturizing cream and I enjoy the gentle tightening of my skin I feel after it is absorbed.</li>
            <li> Once I started using Dermology Wrinkle Repair I immediately saw and felt a change in the wrinkles on my face and neck. My skin felt firmer and younger. I love how well it works with the Revitol Anti Aging Moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> I did not see a big difference.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t really tell any difference.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good as I was lead to believe.  Disappointed!</li>
            <li> Great cream.  People have commented on how nice my skin is.</li>
            <li> NOT WORTH THE COST  RIP OFF to the MAX!</li>
            <li> I saw absolutely NO noticeable difference. Went back to my Mary Kay and Avon products that do better.</li>
            <li> what a scam my face looked worse after using this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it now.  Hope it works.  Got it quickly.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Did not like the way it felt on my skin</li>
            <li> this seems to be working.  People don&#x27;t believe that I am as up in age as I am.  Will more than likely re-order when this runs out.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> THE JARS ARE LESS-NOT EVEN CLOSE TO HALF FULL. THE FIRST TIME I BOUGHT THE PRODUCT IT WAS FULL TO THE TOP.&lt;br /&gt;AFTER THAT NOT EVEN HALF FULL I FEEL CHEATED OUT OF MY MONEY.</li>
            <li> A product endorsed by Dr Oz?????. forget it.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any changes yet</li>
            <li> I GOT NO RESULTS !  VERY UNHAPPY !!</li>
            <li> Product is one half of an online scam. Along with a product called Revitol it was billed as an anti-aging miracle. Days after ordering I saw the same ad, with the same claims and celebrityphotos but with two other products. Save your money.</li>
            <li> Does not work don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> If it would let me choose no stars and write a review I would. This product is not the real one you buy from the actual site.</li>
            <li> So far, we noticed small improvements on the softness of the facial skin. The jury is still out.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t what I expected</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 75 and everybody says I look 50.  This is a pricey product but it definitely helps with facial wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, good price</li>
            <li> Great.  I have been using this product for at least 4 months.  Very noticeable results.  I will continue to use.  BA</li>
            <li> May take some time to work. But am hopeful</li>
            <li> Might as well ripped up the money I spent on this product and thrown it away. Leaves my face uncomfortably dry and not easy to apply liquid foundation afterwards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of skin products to look younger. This cream has made me look 10 years younger. Sold for life!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product twice.</li>
            <li> The customer service for this company is HORRIBLE!! When I called after my trial period was over and told them I didnt want any more, I got the run-around. I am a very laid back, mild manners person and actually had to use foul language and threaten them with a law suit if they charged my card more for more product. Every time I told the representative I still didn&#x27;t want it, the man would try to give me another reason to keep trying it. Saying they would extend my trial or give me half off my next purchase. Finally I told them I have recorded the whole conversation and I have said CLEARLY I don&#x27;t want the product SEVEN times. I asked to speak to the person with the highest position of the company and told him to SHUT UP with his talking!! His next words better be that it was canceled. After TEN minutes, I guess it finally got through and they sent me a cancellation notice. Do NOT try this product unless you absolutely know you will want to keep on purchasing it! What a nightmare! By the way, it didnt work for me at all and actually starting being painful to apply. Probably an allergic reaction. I gave it one star but wish I could have given it no stars!</li>
            <li> used them tighter and you will love it</li>
            <li> Item as described, will like buy from the seller again</li>
            <li> Besides not being sealed at all, there was no lot number or expiration date.  The label was also crooked and the container was different than one I received from the manufacturer.  I suspected it to be repackaged which made me question the purity and age.  Too many red flags -- I returned it.</li>
            <li> Jar is deceiving - 1 fluid oz doesn&#x27;t even fill half the jar!!  Disappointing...</li>
            <li> Love, I am combining it with my moisture and loving the effect</li>
            <li> When I open the container it appeared to look like a full jar; however it was not and since I started using soon after, it was too late to return and get one that appears to have been used and recyled to me.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me and I tried it for a month. Very disappointed:(</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t receive the results that were promised, but still a nice moisturizer.  I will probably not buy it again because of the price.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 9 months and am very excited to see it available on Amazon.  I am a bit surprised that there are some negative reviews.  I am a 52 year old grandmother and am told almost everyday that I look like I am in my mid thirties.  I not only use the product on my face and neck, I use it on my elbows and knees.  Good stuff!  Only drawback is that I mostly get asked out by men in their thirties.</li>
            <li> I like so far.  As long as I don&#x27;t put it on more than once a day, (as opposed to the three times a day which is listed on the bottle), I do not break out.  I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement to my wrinkles or skin yet.  Will try one more bottle.  If nothing happens, I will stop at that.</li>
            <li> Cream was as advertised.  It is too soon to rate the performance of the product.</li>
            <li> Been using the product for over a month, haven&#x27;t seen a change.&lt;br /&gt;Personally feel over the counter products work just as good.</li>
            <li> Too strong for my skin.  Made my face peel.</li>
            <li> seems tp be working just as company claims</li>
            <li> Useless - do not buy - waste of your money</li>
            <li> I am trying all three products..so far I see no change.</li>
            <li> Nice Cream.  Don&#x27;t know if it will perform miracles but I like it..</li>
            <li> burns make skin feel dry, product sent in bag with no info, or instructions. how do i return product?</li>
            <li> Does help with your wrinkles and tighten your skin.  Helps you to look refresh in the morning.</li>
            <li> When the jar arrived, it seemed as if it had been used by someone else.  I used as directed.  No change in my wrinkles or skin.</li>
            <li> These two products in combination, i.e., Dermology Phytoceramides Wrinkle Repair Complex, and Revitol are the best products on the market today.  I highly recommend both of them to all of the ladies.  I use this product at night and the moisturizer in the morning.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t help remove my wrinkles</li>
            <li> bought this just over a month ago w/Revitol in response to ad. At least the Revitol is a nice face cream that doesn&#x27;t deliver it&#x27;s promise; but, Dermology isn&#x27;t even a decent face cream, if you plan on putting makeup over it or hitting the pillow within an hour. As for it absorbing into the skin, that&#x27;s questionable just because the dry time is so long...it may just get air dried. It&#x27;s greasy; but, has no smell. I did not have any bad reaction to it, and I do have sensitive-to-some-creams skin. The problem still is, I had NO reaction. It doesn&#x27;t reduce my wrinkles (I took picture before starting treatment and those babies are still smiling back at me and having more babies!)&lt;br /&gt;I use it as a hand cream and when the jars are empty, I&#x27;ll find another use for them...I won&#x27;t be re-ordering.</li>
            <li> I have been using  Dermology along withRevitol  for less than a month and have definitely been able to see an improvement in my complexion. I plan to continue using these products and maybe be able to reach a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.  But not any more effective when using Revitol.</li>
            <li> I hope I have finally learned my lesson.  No more wrinkle reducer products.  I tried the combination of Dermatology wrinkle repair and Revitol anti aging cream.  Each day I used them my skin got drier and my wrinkles got deeper.  After a week, I gave up and went back to my old faithful standbys, Bag Balm and Crisco.  To be fair, I realize that things work differently for different people.  I really hope no one else has the same results that I did.  Also, I did try each one individually with the same negative results.</li>
            <li> Used for over two months didn&#x27;t see much change, but skin did feel nice.  Won&#x27;t be re-ordering</li>
            <li> Seen where if you use this with revitol it would work much better.  Sooo, this is what I do.  I think its working.  Hope so.</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks of use, (in conjunction with another product) I have not noticed any difference or improvement in my skin.  I will use the entire jar...it is NOT hurting my skin,  I&#x27;m just disappointed that there has been NO improvement yet.</li>
            <li> It caused an allergic reaction!!!&lt;br /&gt;:(</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in the product I have been using it now for two months and rather than seeing improvement I find I have more wrinkles up any.</li>
            <li> There is no visible difference.  I used as directed but it was a waste of money.  Only surgery can give you the look you want.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this a little over a month.  I have seen some results.</li>
            <li> just don&#x27;t see a differents</li>
            <li> Good as a moisturizer but didn&#x27;t do what they said. Will go back to Mary Kay</li>
            <li> Really nice - I use it as eye cream.</li>
            <li> Just starting to use it.</li>
            <li> no improvement at all</li>
            <li> Using Dermology at night and Revitol in the morning has made a noticeable difference in my appearance.</li>
            <li> Not sure how I was suppose to use this product.  No directions came with it, and no list of contents made.  Not sure if I am using this correctly, and haven&#x27;t seen any visible difference in lessening wrinkles as expected.</li>
            <li> GREAT LIKE THE PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s working, let you know after the next jar.</li>
            <li> I just received and started to use. I don&#x27;t know how it will work but it goes on nice.. it says to use 3 times a day.. will see if it helps any at all..</li>
            <li> Tried a lot em!  Awesome absolutely Awesome!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t work.  I am also disappointed that when I bought this product it had been endorsed by Dr. Oz and had a before and after picture of a 74 year old granny that showed amazing results.  Within two weeks he had an almost identical story out about a famous woman that lied to America about her beauty secrets and now professes her &amp;#34;real secret&amp;#34; is two different products all together.  Don&#x27;t waste your money none of this stuff produces the results they claim.</li>
