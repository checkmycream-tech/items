            <li> I was very disappointed that L&#x27;Oreal discontinued my favorite color, but this seller filled the breach.</li>
            <li> because I&#x27;m afraid I won&#x27;t be able to find it at some point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this shade for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps, with a little pressure, they will bring it back to the stores.  </li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> but it seems to be getting harder and harder to find it in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> as expected thank you</li>
            <li> Have used Sea Fleur lipstick for many years and was disappointed when I discovered it was discontinued.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the tube I received from the vendor I purchased from was not pristine--the lipstick case was marked up a bit and not sealed, and the lipstick itself had been touched.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a color I can wear year round.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say I bought several!</li>
            <li> Hard to find item as it has been discontinued by L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li> Oh well, at least I can still get it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> When I could no longer find it in the stores I was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed that Loreal would discontinue this color, sea fleur.  </li>

            <li> I was looking for another discontinued lipstick when I came across this one.  This is an extraordinary shade of fuchsia lipstick!  I&#x27;m surprised that L&#x27;Oreal chose to discontinue carrying it in retail stores.  Oh well, at least I can still get it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I purchased this lip color at my Mom&#x27;s request because she liked it on someone and couldn&#x27;t find it locally.  My Mom is 89 years olds and still stylin&#x27;!!!!!  She really likes it.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal discontinued this color. So glad I can still purchase it online. It is exactly the same that I have purchased in stores.</li>
            <li> so glad that I can still buy my favorite color of lipstick at amazon.  The creaminess of the lipstick is wonderful as well as the color.  Loreal makes a very good product and the color is exceptional.  good packaging as well as prompt service make this a win win purchase.</li>

            <li> Hard to find item as it has been discontinued by L&#x27;Oreal. Love this color</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed that Loreal would discontinue this color, sea fleur.  I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years and it matches everything I wear.

            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that L&#x27;Oreal has discontinued this color! Judging by all the reviews, it seems to be a big seller. I&#x27;ve worn it for 20 years -- it&#x27;s my favorite summer lipstick. It&#x27;s not summer without Sea Fleur! They used to have a matching nail polish too, but that&#x27;s been gone for years. I was so happy to find it on amazon! Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> My favorite cannot find it in stock at any of the stores I shop at.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this shade for a very long time.  When it was unavailable, Amazon was my go-to place &amp; there it was!  Very happy.</li>
            <li> Love this Lipstick - It&#x27;s definitely my favorite and it&#x27;s a color I can wear year round.  Sea Fleur seems to go with just about everything I wear, Spring, Summer, Winter or Fall.</li>

            <li> Perfect could not locate it on stores only online got here quick ! Thank you ! My favorite color definitely</li>
            <li> I have been using this lipstick for 20 years.  I cannot find it in the stores anymore.  I was thrilled that I could order it.</li>
            <li> My favorite color.  Found it to be as fresh and beautiful as ever!  Needless to say I bought several!</li>
            <li> Awesome, just what I wanted</li>
            <li> Product came quickly and was everything I hoped for.  I will definitely use them again.  I was very disappointed that L&#x27;Oreal discontinued my favorite color, but this seller filled the breach.</li>
            <li> as expected thank you</li>
            <li> I have used this L&#x27;Oreal shade for over 15 years and have found nothing that compares to it.</li>
            <li> I love this color. I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years. It&#x27;s moisturizing as well!  ❤️</li>
            <li> The color is great, but one of them 2 tubes I ordered does not turn to swivel up so all I get of that tube is a tiny bit.  I did not expect to receive a defective product.  Maybe the seller should have checked that before mailing it to me.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find this discontinued color; item was new as described, arrived quickly in perfect condition.</li>
