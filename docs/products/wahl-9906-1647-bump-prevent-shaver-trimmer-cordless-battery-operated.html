    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>certainly isn&#x27;t a perfect trimmer</li>
            <li>These are great clippers I got them for my fiancé</li>
            <li>Alright this is a great shaver but for some reason I still bumped up  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You&#x27;re welcome.</li>
            <li>but I now just use this shaver for body hair still good just didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li>Perhaps try out some of the things I mentioned and this will become a more enjoyable trimmer for you as well!</li>
            <li>The battery powered one is not as strong as the plug-in kind</li>
            <li>Will toss this unit in the trash and try to find a better one.</li>
            <li>No adjustable attachment as pictured at top.  </li>
            <li>But I do have sideburns, so good attachments would have been useful.  </li>
            <li>and he doesn&#x27;t have to go to the barber any more.</li>
            <li>but I prefer battery-operated trimmers over electric as they&#x27;re more versatile (and I use rechargeable batteries which makes it cost-effective).</li>
            <li>Interesting thing to note about this as I packed for business trip</li>
            <li>It makes the smooth shave look amazing</li>
            <li>They will come out easily.</li>
            <li>It works just fine...</li>
            <li>It has adjustable attachment that is precise at all angles and never pulls a hair on my head.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Finding a good, working shaver is turning into a major project!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, its a good product works well and no tugging on the old beard, good for trimming have no tried to use it for actual shaving.</li>
            <li>When removing the batteries, take the top battery out first by using a fingernail.</li>
            <li>The best part is that I can use regular alkaline if I lose my charge in the middle of a trim (or anotherset of rechargeables).  </li>
            <li>one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fortunately had a strap from a previous wahl I own, and I am glad I did other wise</li>
            <li>Wahl&#x27;s have been great, so I don&#x27;t expect anything less from this trimmer/shaver.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bluntly stated, you would be wise to avoid this trimmer altogether for anything other than that one to two-day unshaved look.</li>
            <li>model also requires 3 AA batteries (that&#x27;s right, three) instead of the two stated in the description.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I tried to remove them right after inserting them.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as adaptable as my old Conair device, but it seems like it will be OK as I keep my beard really close.  </li>
            <li>a few things to make it perform better is ok with me.</li>
            <li>Despite claim of \\&quot;no pull, no snag\\&quot; the unit does exactly that.  </li>
            <li>First, the model 9906</li>
            <li>This ribbon broke on my first attempt to remove the two batteries.  </li>
            <li>I can also use the T-blade on this by replacing the standard blade with it (though this one is actually more efficient, so far).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s method/style worked way better than mine and changed my opinion on this trimmer entirely.</li>
            <li>So when it finally stopped working, I was glad to find they still make this model.</li>
            <li>Put the batteries inside on top of the floss, perpendicular to it as though you were going to tie the batteries together around the middle.</li>
            <li>The two floss ends can be gathered up and placed on top of the third battery and then folded under the battery compartment cover.</li>
            <li>They are also only meant to be used at a precise angle, otherwise the hair is cut at differing lengths.  </li>
            <li>The batteries are very snug anddifficult to remove.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer is really inexpensive, as well, so having to make adjustments/jury-rig</li>
            <li>This product provides a very close shave and still does not give you shaving bumps.</li>
            <li>This product works really well if you are looking to get rid of your shaver and the bumps that come with it.  </li>
            <li>NIce new sharp one!  </li>
            <li>I felt the vinyl stretch and stretch, knowing full well what was likely coming.  </li>
            <li>I need to buy new more often since this works far better than a 10 yr old Wahl that is dull by now.  </li>
            <li>This leads me to believe it is fairly typical for many models (not a defect but a design flaw).  </li>
            <li>I generally use this for trimming more than shaving - shaping sideburns and my moustache, and shaving the beard if they grow too long before razor shaving.  </li>
            <li>The battery on that model is easily overcharged if forgotten about, which I did several times, after which the battery barely trimmed my neck without needing to be recharged.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>A clear vinyl ribbon is included to strap to the first battery inserted and used to pull the second and first out when batteries need replacing.  </li>
            <li>The third battery is installed last and is fairly easy to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It would be nice if I could get attachments that actually work and don&#x27;t pull hair or cut unevenly, but I assume there are none that exist.  </li>
            <li>I am now using electrical tape wrapped around each of the two batteries (both are taped individually) in the same fashion as the original ribbon (the sticky sides are touching each other with no sticky exposed) in order to remove them without resorting to using a butter knife or similar item.  </li>
            <li>No problems with that, so far.  </li>
            <li>If you can stand the two to four-day unshaved look as opposed to the one to two-day look, may I suggest any of the Conair models available over this, especially for those with varying lengths of facial hair, such as mustache, beard, goatee, sideburns.  </li>
            <li>Wow</li>
            <li>The no pull, no snag guarantee* is for the blades only, and only applies with new or fully-charged battery usage for the first year.  </li>
            <li>in the past Wahl used to include a strap that you&#x27;d put on the battery so you can easily remove it from the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it works with less than full stock of batteries.  </li>
            <li>, different size attachments, all of those pull as well, but are much easier to remove as they use a different method of attaching).  </li>
            <li>Instead of trying to pull the batteries out straight, rock them to one side or the other and pull up.</li>
            <li>Actually it kept going off with only 1 battery in it, not sure how powerful it is at this point</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Actually it kept going off with only 1 battery in it, not sure how powerful it is at this point</li>
            <li> I used to hold the trimmer with the flat, steel part (blade body?)</li>
            <li> I randomly tried running it with two batteries and it worked/works just fine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not surprised to see the unit is no longer made.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s vinyl, for crying out loud.  </li>
            <li> You cannot simply use it while plugged in either, which left me having to wait for a charge before I could finish (several hours, at least).  </li>
            <li> but I remedied this by putting a length of ribbon behind them (with slack on each side) and then just pull on both sides of the ribbon to get the batteries out (far, far easier than trying to will those batteries out with other methods).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> also found it odd that it has room for 3 batteries while the description states it only requires two.</li>
            <li> I have owned several similar items in the past, and use them until they wear out.</li>
            <li> After owning the trimmer for about 6 months, I asked my wife to trim the back of my head with it and she held it with the flat, steel part of the razor down (against my head) while trimming; unlike all the previous times I used this trimmer, it didn&#x27;t snag or pull at all.</li>
            <li> This is not really what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> was not what was expected.</li>
            <li> reviews for other Wahl products with one-star ratings.  </li>
            <li> My blade oil (which has no place in the storage base) came in a small, standup, screwtop bottle rather than the tube pictured, and I&#x27;m glad of it.  </li>
            <li> The tube can be messy, even after it is closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Takes 3 batteries which means I usually have a leftover since they typically sell as 4-packs.</li>
            <li> Less snagging of hair in delicate areas.</li>
            <li> I do agree that the batteries are near impossible to remove once they&#x27;re in</li>
            <li> God help me if it comes to that, considering how hard it is to remove batteries.  </li>
            <li> hardly anything fits the way it&#x27;s displayed in the advertising.  </li>
            <li> That makes this model useless for any purpose other than that unshaved look</li>
            <li> /&gt;Brings me to the biggest problem, Replacing the batteries is a chore, I tried screw drivers, knifes, random switch blade attachments, these things are in there tight and there is no room for taking the out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The storage base does hold everything (except the blade oil) albeit loosely, if you play around a little with the arrangement (this is not the case with my GMAN T-blade model - same base</li>
            <li> They are useless.  </li>
            <li> Still a difficult task.  </li>
            <li> I think I was shaving wrong</li>
            <li> It uses 3 AA batteries and yes they are difficult to get out if you don&#x27;t know the trick.</li>
            <li> Before changing how I held the trimmer, I was very annoyed by the idea of a bump-free trimmer which, ironically, pulled my hair/beard like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All three pull hair like crazy.  </li>
            <li> The attachments are very difficult to remove.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t carry the base and all from one room to another without expecting falling pieces.  </li>
            <li> Also, the base for the shaver and the accessories is a &#x27;plumbers nightmare&#x27;-</li>

            <li> NIce new sharp one!  I need to buy new more often since this works far better than a 10 yr old Wahl that is dull by now.  I&#x27;d buy another in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> Despite claim of \\&quot;no pull, no snag\\&quot; the unit does exactly that.  Using the 3/16\\&quot; spacer, I had to stop using the unit immediately because of the hair pulling.  I&#x27;m not surprised to see the unit is no longer made.  Will toss this unit in the trash and try to find a better one.</li>
            <li> EDIT: The picture is now correct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my thorough review.  It is based on the description and picture on the site as of the submittal of the review.  Subsequent changes may be made to the site.  First, the model 9906-1647 is actually the GMAN series.  That is what I received. It is black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with three attachments, none of which are adjustable - stubble, 1/8 inch, and 3/16 inch.  No adjustable attachment as pictured at top.  The attachments are very difficult to remove.  They are useless.  All three pull hair like crazy.  They are also only meant to be used at a precise angle, otherwise the hair is cut at differing lengths.  That makes this model useless for any purpose other than that unshaved look that I so adore, achieved with no attachments.  That&#x27;s why I bought this.  But I do have sideburns, so good attachments would have been useful.  The no pull, no snag guarantee* is for the blades only, and only applies with new or fully-charged battery usage for the first year.  If it pulls when the batteries are low, change the batteries.  No problems with that, so far.  --Notice reviews for other Wahl products with one-star ratings.  No comments from Wahl when customers complain about attachments pulling hair.  This leads me to believe it is fairly typical for many models (not a defect but a design flaw).  Look to see if there are any comments from Wahl below.  It would be nice if I could get attachments that actually work and don&#x27;t pull hair or cut unevenly, but I assume there are none that exist.  Otherwise, I expect comments from Wahl below.--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model also requires 3 AA batteries (that&#x27;s right, three) instead of the two stated in the description.  A clear vinyl ribbon is included to strap to the first battery inserted and used to pull the second and first out when batteries need replacing.  This ribbon broke on my first attempt to remove the two batteries.  It&#x27;s vinyl, for crying out loud.  The batteries are very snug anddifficult to remove.  I felt the vinyl stretch and stretch, knowing full well what was likely coming.  That&#x27;s why I tried to remove them right after inserting them.  --I&#x27;m using rechargeables in my unit, BTW.--  I am now using electrical tape wrapped around each of the two batteries (both are taped individually) in the same fashion as the original ribbon (the sticky sides are touching each other with no sticky exposed) in order to remove them without resorting to using a butter knife or similar item.  Still a difficult task.  The third battery is installed last and is fairly easy to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The storage base does hold everything (except the blade oil) albeit loosely, if you play around a little with the arrangement (this is not the case with my GMAN T-blade model - same base, different size attachments, all of those pull as well, but are much easier to remove as they use a different method of attaching).  I wouldn&#x27;t carry the base and all from one room to another without expecting falling pieces.  My blade oil (which has no place in the storage base) came in a small, standup, screwtop bottle rather than the tube pictured, and I&#x27;m glad of it.  The tube can be messy, even after it is closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using this as a replacement for the GMAN T-blade rechargeable model 9920.  The battery on that model is easily overcharged if forgotten about, which I did several times, after which the battery barely trimmed my neck without needing to be recharged.  You cannot simply use it while plugged in either, which left me having to wait for a charge before I could finish (several hours, at least).  I just finished up with my Conair.  I could have bought another battery for [...] bucks (with shipping), but probably would have overcharged that one, too.  This unit I use with regular rechargeable batteries which cannot over-charge with my Duracell value charger.  The best part is that I can use regular alkaline if I lose my charge in the middle of a trim (or anotherset of rechargeables).  God help me if it comes to that, considering how hard it is to remove batteries.  I can also use the T-blade on this by replacing the standard blade with it (though this one is actually more efficient, so far).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer gives a closer trim than similar from Conair.  I still use my Conair for my sideburns.  It has adjustable attachment that is precise at all angles and never pulls a hair on my head.  For my personal usage, this model is passable, but I would have preferred a 2 battery unit (easier recharging of batteries since my charger only charges 2 or 4 at a time).  I&#x27;ll buy another set of batteries so I always have a backup since I&#x27;m using two in my camera.  If you can stand the two to four-day unshaved look as opposed to the one to two-day look, may I suggest any of the Conair models available over this, especially for those with varying lengths of facial hair, such as mustache, beard, goatee, sideburns.  Though I can&#x27;t vouch for their strength as my hair is not that thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bluntly stated, you would be wise to avoid this trimmer altogether for anything other than that one to two-day unshaved look.</li>
            <li> I just recently bought what I thought was a Wahl 9400 shaver.  Upon receiving it I noticed on the battery compartment lid it said 9200.  I emailed Amazon about this and have had no reply.  Also, the base for the shaver and the accessories is a &#x27;plumbers nightmare&#x27;- hardly anything fits the way it&#x27;s displayed in the advertising.  I have used it once with &#x27;satisfactory&#x27; results.  It&#x27;s not as adaptable as my old Conair device, but it seems like it will be OK as I keep my beard really close.  How it will do with a &#x27;hair trim&#x27; will be forthcoming.  So- guess the verdict is  still out- as Paul Harvey used say- stay tuned for Page Two!</li>
            <li> This shaver started to heat up once I placed 2 batteries in it. I thought it was going to start a fire!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also in the past Wahl used to include a strap that you&#x27;d put on the battery so you can easily remove it from the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No strap in this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fortunately had a strap from a previous wahl I own, and I am glad I did other wise I&#x27;d had no way way of getting the battery out and given how it was heating up, while in the off position, it&#x27;s very likely smoke would have started coming out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finding a good, working shaver is turning into a major project!</li>
            <li> These are great clippers I got them for my fiancé and he doesn&#x27;t have to go to the barber any more. Wow</li>
            <li> It does the job. The battery powered one is not as strong as the plug-in kind</li>
            <li> I initially agreed with most reviews on this trimmer.. until I realized that I was holding it wrong every time I used it. I used to hold the trimmer with the flat, steel part (blade body?) facing away from my head and would essentially hold the tips of the blades against my head/beard while trimming (if that makes any sense). After owning the trimmer for about 6 months, I asked my wife to trim the back of my head with it and she held it with the flat, steel part of the razor down (against my head) while trimming; unlike all the previous times I used this trimmer, it didn&#x27;t snag or pull at all. My wife&#x27;s method/style worked way better than mine and changed my opinion on this trimmer entirely. Before changing how I held the trimmer, I was very annoyed by the idea of a bump-free trimmer which, ironically, pulled my hair/beard like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found it odd that it has room for 3 batteries while the description states it only requires two. I randomly tried running it with two batteries and it worked/works just fine; I only run it with two batteries nowadays. I do agree that the batteries are near impossible to remove once they&#x27;re in but I remedied this by putting a length of ribbon behind them (with slack on each side) and then just pull on both sides of the ribbon to get the batteries out (far, far easier than trying to will those batteries out with other methods).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This certainly isn&#x27;t a perfect trimmer but I prefer battery-operated trimmers over electric as they&#x27;re more versatile (and I use rechargeable batteries which makes it cost-effective). This trimmer is really inexpensive, as well, so having to make adjustments/jury-rig a few things to make it perform better is ok with me. Perhaps try out some of the things I mentioned and this will become a more enjoyable trimmer for you as well!</li>
            <li> This is not really what I was looking for. I wanted a rechargeable trimmer.</li>
            <li> I generally use this for trimming more than shaving - shaping sideburns and my moustache, and shaving the beard if they grow too long before razor shaving.  It works just fine...</li>
            <li> This product provides a very close shave and still does not give you shaving bumps. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for somebody.</li>
            <li> I have owned several similar items in the past, and use them until they wear out. Wahl&#x27;s have been great, so I don&#x27;t expect anything less from this trimmer/shaver.</li>
            <li> Interesting thing to note about this as I packed for business trip, it works with less than full stock of batteries.  Actually it kept going off with only 1 battery in it, not sure how powerful it is at this point, I was simply trying to get the batteries out to keep it from going off in my luggage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brings me to the biggest problem, Replacing the batteries is a chore, I tried screw drivers, knifes, random switch blade attachments, these things are in there tight and there is no room for taking the out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, its a good product works well and no tugging on the old beard, good for trimming have no tried to use it for actual shaving.</li>
            <li> Alright this is a great shaver but for some reason I still bumped up  also had it a month I think I was shaving wrong but I just purchased a Andis shaver and I will have a picture in the review and I also wrote a review about the andis shaver but I now just use this shaver for body hair still good just didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> I like it. Less snagging of hair in delicate areas. Takes 3 batteries which means I usually have a leftover since they typically sell as 4-packs.</li>
            <li> was not what was expected.</li>
            <li> This product works really well if you are looking to get rid of your shaver and the bumps that come with it.  It makes the smooth shave look amazing and it helps when you use the brush to get your hairs to come out so they will not grow into your skin anymore.  This product will help anyone get rid of the bothersome bumps.</li>
            <li> So when it finally stopped working, I was glad to find they still make this model. It uses 3 AA batteries and yes they are difficult to get out if you don&#x27;t know the trick. I came up with it out of necessity. BEFORE putting the batteries in, take a piece of dental floss- about and 8 inch piece of waxed and lay it inside the open compartment horizontally into the opening. Put the batteries inside on top of the floss, perpendicular to it as though you were going to tie the batteries together around the middle. Then install the last and third battery. The two floss ends can be gathered up and placed on top of the third battery and then folded under the battery compartment cover. When removing the batteries, take the top battery out first by using a fingernail. Now take the two ends of the floss and wrap them around your index finger. Instead of trying to pull the batteries out straight, rock them to one side or the other and pull up. They will come out easily. When the floss becomes worn, replace with new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re welcome.</li>
            <li> Garbage! And it flies through the batteries.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely look for a rechargeable model!</li>
