            <li>I am happy for the results</li>
            <li>Great alternative rather than spending the $300 at a salon or beauty school.  </li>
            <li>I guess if you have a lot of time on your hands then it is great.</li>
            <li>but for 2 $$ I figured I&#x27;d use it for sure!!</li>
            <li>For the product itself, it was not that good.</li>
            <li>The good side was the smell was quite good.</li>
            <li>love to be versatile with my hair!  </li>
            <li>what kind of results that I would get with this product, but</li>
            <li>It is kind of like a perm smell that will not leave.  </li>
            <li>My hair is silky and shiny and still had plenty of volume it smells really nice too.&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
            <li>Nice find for her hair.</li>
            <li>It made her super happy.</li>
            <li>The best keratin treatment for me same as the salon results, good price.</li>
            <li>Wow, this stuff is awesome.  </li>
            <li>And at the 5.99 price tag, that is amazing:)</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>

            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li>I love this product and will use it again.</li>
            <li>she never had hair that lovely before .</li>
            <li>I will buy this again for sure.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for body and healthy shine</li>
            <li>Made :-))&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so i am satisfied.</li>
            <li>My hair is sooooo curly, dry and color treated, so the Brazilian Smoothing treatment, does an awesome job making it look very smooth</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and wanted to manage the frizz better and make my hair look straighter.</li>
            <li>and this product (this product line) is great for give hair some extra strength and boose!!  </li>
            <li>This product leaves my hair feeling luxurious and smooth.</li>
            <li>I like this product followed the directions as stated and my hair looked great after flat ironing.</li>
            <li>It works just as great by Pressing the hair or flat ironing it.</li>
            <li>(That stuff is the bomb and well worth the price!).</li>
            <li>I found that I&#x27;m better off just putting some high quality oils</li>
            <li>It works well with the other Renpure products, though it&#x27;s best not to use a conditioner before using this product, apparently it blocks it from coating the cuticle of the hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway I had tried their Argan Oil Deep Reconstructor as leave in conditioner and really liked</li>
            <li>However for the price, I would say it was worth it</li>
            <li>Gives it a nice smooth feel with minimal perfume.</li>
            <li>colored my hair first, conditioned quickly and then proceeded to wash my hair with the Renpure Brazilian Keratin Straightening Shampoo.</li>
            <li>but after another flat iron session it&#x27;s all nice and srtaight.</li>
            <li>super straight.</li>
            <li>One application( which there about 6 or so for my shoulder length, frizzy and puffy hair) last me about 3 to 4 weeks, leaving it nice and straight.</li>
            <li>And a very reasonable price compared to salon rip offs.</li>
            <li>My hair was very straight.</li>
            <li>and this was my first hair straightening attempt.</li>
            <li>I unfortunately do not have the time to invest.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just better for me to go to the salon and get the longer lasting results</li>
            <li>My hair looks exactly the way it did before I used it.</li>
            <li>Today is Friday and my hair is still soft, silky and bone straight!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;First off, I followed the directions to the T, but didn&#x27;t flat iron my hair more than 2x over</li>
            <li>It worked okay when used with a flat iron.</li>
            <li>keep you posted on how long I can keep it up :-)</li>
            <li>I just put it on after the shower and dry just the top</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see much of a difference after I washed it</li>
            <li>I am very thankful that I tried it.</li>
            <li>So the product did not work as it said it would - keeping it straight for 14 days.  </li>
            <li>and this did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>but I had forgotten all the work to maintain your real hair.....</li>
            <li>It was $5.99 at my grocery store near my house so definitely worth a try</li>
            <li>my color a soft golden brown looked Salon</li>
            <li>did not get my hair straight.</li>
            <li>Downside of course is that I would have to say goodbye to the healthy head of hair that I&#x27;d finally achieved by going natural.</li>
            <li>(ALTERNA BAMBOO Smooth Pure Kendi Oil Pure Treatment oil, also found in amazon &amp;lt;3) in my hair before I blow dry and straighten it works out 1000 times</li>
            <li>My hair came out very straight and soft.</li>
            <li>it pretty much had the exact effect, in fact I think that&#x27;s pretty much what the stuff is... not really a keratin treatment but just some stuff to goop it up and keep it straight with gel/mousse like</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, and after I washed it the first time, it was just as curly as before.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly/frizzy hair and live in humid weather</li>
            <li>I purchased this hair treatment because it was on a super discount at my local store (warning ..?)</li>
            <li>It made my hair so soft and straight...</li>
            <li>just made it more limp.</li>
            <li>I only wash my hair every 4 days, and after the first day had to spend a lot of time</li>
            <li>I think I would experiment would other better products next time.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft and manageable!</li>
            <li>Started the whole process Saturday and followed up with the conditioner the next day as instructed.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser thought that I had it done professionally.</li>
            <li>She has natural hair no chemicals</li>
            <li>I could tell my hair cuticles were open as it was less easy to comb.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t always use the flat iron, when I do, as I mentioned before, I don&#x27;t use it all the way up because I think it dries out my hair too much.  </li>
            <li>B005I0JWUQ Renpure Originals Brazilian Keratin 4 Day Straight Flat Iron Spray, 6 Ounce (Pack of 2).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Blowdried, brushed, then flat ironed, exactly as directed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Could barely brush my hair out after applying the product, as directed.</li>
            <li>I must not use my flat iron hot enough to get 14 day results from this, but it does work extremely well as a styling lotion for me to keep out the frizz and curl even in high humidity days, until it gets wet.  </li>
            <li>my hair up for the 30 minute recommendation, it&#x27;d halfway dried &amp; was pretty crunchy to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have better results with my usual routine which is after shampoo/conditioner I put in leave in conditioner along with Redken Power Tame</li>
            <li>I have thin, fine hair and this</li>

            <li> The pack seemed really old and torn and I am not sure whether the bottle was used or not.</li>
            <li> Maybe 1/3 of bottle on my halfway down my back hair)</li>
            <li> Product for my unruly curly dry hair!</li>
            <li> I am African American and had my hair in a protective style for the past 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> Wait a half hour and then blow dry and use a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Some said that even though it did not straighten that at least their hair was shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> I would suggest their other product that is a 4 day spray [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It did smell of coconuts as mentioned in some other reviews too.</li>
            <li> I read other negative comments and believed that for me it was going to be different.</li>
            <li> Works well for my thick and dry hair type.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s disappointing because it really does work.  </li>
            <li> I do not recommend it, waste of money, did not do what it said it would.</li>
            <li> That works well and does not have the harsh chemical after smell.</li>
            <li> Bought this as an alternative to harsh straightening.  </li>
            <li> I say, don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> I find it hard to believe there are no chemicals because the smell reminds me of other straightening products that do have harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li> It has lasted almost a week now with very little sign of frizziness.</li>
            <li> then I usually have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have tonnes of hair way past my shoulder</li>
            <li> I like to shampoo at least once a week</li>
            <li> This product does not work on course or thick texture hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been transitioning my 3C/4A hair since April of 2012 and found myself getting tired of the routine and longing for a relaxer.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say, I was disapointed.</li>
            <li> but there was no miracle for me unfortunately :(</li>
            <li> Firstly,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say the packaging was disastrous.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> However, it has a terrible smell that lingers for weeks.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been transitioning my 3C/4A hair since April of 2012 and found myself getting tired of the routine and longing for a relaxer. Downside of course is that I would have to say goodbye to the healthy head of hair that I&#x27;d finally achieved by going natural. But guess what, I found Renpure and now I&#x27;m saved!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I followed the directions to the T, but didn&#x27;t flat iron my hair more than 2x over AND I used Goldwell Style Sign Sleek Perfection Thermal Spray before flat ironing each section (That stuff is the bomb and well worth the price!). Started the whole process Saturday and followed up with the conditioner the next day as instructed. Let my hair air dry overnight and flat ironed again on Monday morning. Today is Friday and my hair is still soft, silky and bone straight!!! It even holds a curl all day and I&#x27;ve been getting tons of compliments! Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> My hair is sooooo curly, dry and color treated, so the Brazilian Smoothing treatment, does an awesome job making it look very smooth</li>
            <li> I do not recommend it, waste of money, did not do what it said it would.</li>
            <li> I have long, kinky (3b-4a) African American Hair.  This product is great that it makes my hair manageable.  I like to shampoo at least once a week and this product (this product line) is great for give hair some extra strength and boose!!  Will order the entire line again!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. And a very reasonable price compared to salon rip offs. I do deep treatments as per directions. Sometimes though I just use it after shampooing - leave it in and then dry and style. Great seller too!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair treatment because it was on a super discount at my local store (warning ..?) but for 2 $$ I figured I&#x27;d use it for sure!! My results were ;;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could barely brush my hair out after applying the product, as directed. (I used 1/4 .. Maybe 1/3 of bottle on my halfway down my back hair) Lost a lot of hair in that process. Uggh not going so well..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put my hair up for the 30 minute recommendation, it&#x27;d halfway dried &amp; was pretty crunchy to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blowdried, brushed, then flat ironed, exactly as directed. My hair was very straight. But in addition it was very crunchy, very sticky, very brittle and very unpleasant to touch. It had shine but not anymore shine then I usually have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It actually reminded me of putting a bunch of gel and mousse in my hair and then blow drying and straightening. it pretty much had the exact effect, in fact I think that&#x27;s pretty much what the stuff is... not really a keratin treatment but just some stuff to goop it up and keep it straight with gel/mousse like product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me I found that I&#x27;m better off just putting some high quality oils (ALTERNA BAMBOO Smooth Pure Kendi Oil Pure Treatment oil, also found in amazon &amp;lt;3) in my hair before I blow dry and straighten it works out 1000 times better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Ended up washing it out immediately because I couldn&#x27;t stand the sticky feeling and I couldn&#x27;t run my fingers through my hair without them getting stuck. I will never use this product again.</li>
            <li> I must not use my flat iron hot enough to get 14 day results from this, but it does work extremely well as a styling lotion for me to keep out the frizz and curl even in high humidity days, until it gets wet.  Then it&#x27;s back to Shirley Temple for me.  It works well with the other Renpure products, though it&#x27;s best not to use a conditioner before using this product, apparently it blocks it from coating the cuticle of the hair.  Just shampoo with Renpure Shampoo and put this on.  Wait a half hour and then blow dry and use a flat iron.  I like the natural look of a little wave, so I don&#x27;t always use the flat iron, when I do, as I mentioned before, I don&#x27;t use it all the way up because I think it dries out my hair too much.  This product leaves my hair feeling luxurious and smooth.</li>
            <li> It definitely did not last two weeks but when I used it... It made my hair so soft and straight... Didn&#x27;t see much of a difference after I washed it though</li>
            <li> i bought this product because i thought it would work on me because i have straighish/wavy hair. I read other negative comments and believed that for me it was going to be different. I would suggest for you not to buy it get yourself something better. I will search for something that will give me results.</li>
            <li> Wow, this stuff is awesome.  I wasn&#x27;t sure what kind of results that I would get with this product, but I am very thankful that I tried it. I didn&#x27;t need my hair to be bone straight, just something to tame my frizzy hair. I have 3c/4a curls. This product worked excellently and I didn&#x27;t even use the shampoo that was recommended. I used the As I Am co-wash and then used this product and followed the directions. My hair came out very straight and soft. It has lasted almost a week now with very little sign of frizziness. I love this product and will use it again. I have already bought the shampoo and conditioner to try. This is a great alternative to a perm. I would definitely recommend this to anyone!!!</li>
            <li> This product does not work on course or thick texture hair. I followed all steps and purchased the shampoo as well. I was extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product DOES straighten your hair.  I have thick, coarse, very wavy/curly hair.  However, it has a terrible smell that lingers for weeks. Even after multiple washings - the smell remains.  I find it hard to believe there are no chemicals because the smell reminds me of other straightening products that do have harsh chemicals.  It is kind of like a perm smell that will not leave.  It&#x27;s disappointing because it really does work.  I would suggest their other product that is a 4 day spray [[ASIN:B005I0JWUQ Renpure Originals Brazilian Keratin 4 Day Straight Flat Iron Spray, 6 Ounce (Pack of 2).  That works well and does not have the harsh chemical after smell.</li>
            <li> I like this product followed the directions as stated and my hair looked great after flat ironing. However it has a smell to it from the product and after working out the next day my hair frizz but after another flat iron session it&#x27;s all nice and srtaight. This is my first time using it might use again I am black with unprocessed hair. I used their shampoo as well</li>
            <li> Bought this as an alternative to harsh straightening.  I only wash my hair every 4 days, and after the first day had to spend a lot of time re-straightening it,  I have naturally curly hair, and after I washed it the first time, it was just as curly as before.  So the product did not work as it said it would - keeping it straight for 14 days.  I say, don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> It got my daughters hair super straight. she never had hair that lovely before . It made her super happy. I will buy this again for sure.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say, I was disapointed. I have thin, fine hair and this just made it more limp. I was hoping for body and healthy shine but there was no miracle for me unfortunately :(</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed with this product. I have very curly/frizzy hair and live in humid weather and this did absolutely nothing. Some said that even though it did not straighten that at least their hair was shiny and soft. Not so for me. I have better results with my usual routine which is after shampoo/conditioner I put in leave in conditioner along with Redken Power Tame and It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle leave-in keratin.</li>
            <li> I am African American and had my hair in a protective style for the past 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;Now my weave is out and I have tonnes of hair way past my shoulder I am happy for the results but I had forgotten all the work to maintain your real hair.....&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I had tried their Argan Oil Deep Reconstructor as leave in conditioner and really liked it.&lt;br /&gt;I was tempted to relax my hair again but decided not to and instead opted for an at home color and then to try this treatment. It was $5.99 at my grocery store near my house so definitely worth a try..&lt;br /&gt;I colored my hair first, conditioned quickly and then proceeded to wash my hair with the Renpure Brazilian Keratin Straightening Shampoo. I could tell my hair cuticles were open as it was less easy to comb.&lt;br /&gt;Then I applied the Keratin Treatment kept it a bit longer,  and followed the instructions as recommended.&lt;br /&gt;The results? AMAZING!! My hair is silky and shiny and still had plenty of volume it smells really nice too.&lt;br /&gt;Made a curl or two with my curling iron just to see the results and they were beautiful, bouncy and shiny!!&lt;br /&gt;And my color a soft golden brown looked Salon Made :-))&lt;br /&gt;I love to be versatile with my hair!  This product give me plenty of options I will be using it from now on.&lt;br /&gt;Will keep you posted on how long I can keep it up :-)</li>
            <li> One application( which there about 6 or so for my shoulder length, frizzy and puffy hair) last me about 3 to 4 weeks, leaving it nice and straight. And at the 5.99 price tag, that is amazing:)</li>
            <li> Firstly,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say the packaging was disastrous. The pack seemed really old and torn and I am not sure whether the bottle was used or not. For the product itself, it was not that good. I have fine hair and wanted to manage the frizz better and make my hair look straighter. It worked okay when used with a flat iron. The good side was the smell was quite good. It did smell of coconuts as mentioned in some other reviews too. However for the price, I would say it was worth it and this was my first hair straightening attempt. I think I would experiment would other better products next time.</li>
            <li> did not get my hair straight. i used this for my sons&#x27; coarse hair, and it softens theri hair. so i am satisfied. like the smell, too.</li>
            <li> The best keratin treatment for me same as the salon results, good price.</li>
            <li> Great alternative rather than spending the $300 at a salon or beauty school.  I have shoulder length hair - and followed the instructions &amp; got the results I was searching for.  My hairdresser thought that I had it done professionally.</li>
            <li> I now have my grandmother using it. She has natural hair no chemicals and she presses her hair instead of flat ironing it then she curls it. It works just as great by Pressing the hair or flat ironing it. Nice find for her hair.</li>
            <li> A lot of work for temporary results.. I guess if you have a lot of time on your hands then it is great. I unfortunately do not have the time to invest. It&#x27;s just better for me to go to the salon and get the longer lasting results</li>
            <li> Works well for my thick and dry hair type. Gives it a nice smooth feel with minimal perfume.</li>
            <li> I used this product as the directions said. My hair looks exactly the way it did before I used it.</li>
            <li> Product for my unruly curly dry hair! It makes my hair so soft and manageable! I just put it on after the shower and dry just the top and my curls are bouncing and luxurious!</li>
