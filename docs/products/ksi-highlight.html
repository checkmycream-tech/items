            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Is the product easily washed out of clothing if it gets on a dress shirt or hat?</li>
            <li>You got to get use to using this product, because its not that easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Great product for quick touch ups when your shape up is not real crisp.</li>

            <li>Pretty good product I just wish it workec on grey hair</li>
            <li>But wears off if you take a shower right after.</li>
            <li>This is why barbers used to often bring up the other &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; corner and ruin my hairline forcing me to cut and fade my own head from waves, to afros with a taper, to &amp;#34;Usher&amp;#34; mohawks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I had absolute confidence in my ability to apply this product.</li>

            <li>a Wesley Snipes complexioned brother who has cut his own hair (due to barber chopping up my hairline) from back in the days of Big Daddy Kane and the hi-top fade,</li>
            <li>/&gt;Living in Atlanta a year ago I noticed people who used something like this and look absolutely foolish and obvious that they were coloring their hair with what it looked like shoe polish or a Sharpie or something, so I disregarded what it was until the YouTube videos piqued my interest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>then went to sleep with it an took precautions by placing a old pillow case over my pillow with nothing on my head just in case</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered 2 so far.</li>
            <li>Decent product but not enough product for the price..</li>
            <li>It did not look artificial, it was natural, so natural that my wife did not even notice it Saturday night, Sunday morning and not until I hinted to her on how good a job I did with my hair that morning on the way home that she barely noticed.</li>
            <li>After applying the product I was worried because when wet you really cannot see the effect</li>

            <li> Money making product! Love it!</li>
            <li> overall it is Ok. But wears off if you take a shower right after.</li>
            <li> Worst crap ever. Do not even waste your money there&#x27;s a cheaper easier way to get it done and it and it  lasts longer. Bigen</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve ever used!!! I hope they never go out of business because they have a customer for life.</li>
            <li> I love the product. Easy to apply and take off.</li>
            <li> Pretty good product I just wish it workec on grey hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using KSI highlight for more six months and its better than anything else I have used and I have used quite a few products.</li>
            <li> My customers love it!</li>
            <li> I use it my self and in less than a half hour i was smiling from ear to ear this thing realy works. the only thing i wish that it had some instructions, i had to look it up on youtube to find out how to apply it. im now a fan for life,</li>
            <li> Really good product. Was really satisfied. I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great product for quick touch ups when your shape up is not real crisp. Really quick and easy fix to your shape up!</li>
            <li> Worth the money!!!!!! Excellent product!!! Easy to apply. Gives you the crispy line your looking for..</li>
            <li> Good product I like it a lot</li>
            <li> Without any reviews or feedback that I could conjure up on the product, I was prompted to take a &amp;#34;leap of faith&amp;#34; and give it a try after numerous YouTube videos. I e-mailed a couple of questions to O.G&#x27;s Barber Supply and they were promptly answered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Questions??&lt;br /&gt;1. Does the product cause any breakouts or rashes when applied to skin? No.&lt;br /&gt;2. Is the product easily washed out of clothing if it gets on a dress shirt or hat? Yes?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Living in Atlanta a year ago I noticed people who used something like this and look absolutely foolish and obvious that they were coloring their hair with what it looked like shoe polish or a Sharpie or something, so I disregarded what it was until the YouTube videos piqued my interest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a Wesley Snipes complexioned brother who has cut his own hair (due to barber chopping up my hairline) from back in the days of Big Daddy Kane and the hi-top fade, and I artistically paint portraits as a hobby, I had absolute confidence in my ability to apply this product. I have a full head of hair without any signs of balding but one corner of my hairline grows backward which causes my hairline to look slightly crooked when naturally lined-up. This is why barbers used to often bring up the other &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; corner and ruin my hairline forcing me to cut and fade my own head from waves, to afros with a taper, to &amp;#34;Usher&amp;#34; mohawks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was the perfect solution for I applied it Saturday night (for cutting on Sunday morning) with the applicator which was different than I seen in videos but better at applying the product. The plastic container was bent up so I got the top (Cap) from a large Gatorade bottle and that fit the brush perfectly. After applying the product I was worried because when wet you really cannot see the effect but I continued cautiously by faith. As I continued, the product dried and backed away it looked like a true line-up without even using my Andis T-outlinertrimmers. I then applied the product to my beard (patch of hair on my chin only) as well as my thin mustache. It worked so well I was about to apply it on my eyebrows but decided against it because I did not want to walk around looking like a cartoon character, Prince or Boy George. I applied the Sealer Spray that was included to dry and seal the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then went to sleep with it an took precautions by placing a old pillow case over my pillow with nothing on my head just in case this product runs off and all over my pillow during the night due to sweat or something. Woke up the next morning and NOTHING!! Nothing on the pillow, nothing on the sheets, Hairline still sharp and intact. Got suited up for church and then outlined my hair and the results were truly amazing. It did not look artificial, it was natural, so natural that my wife did not even notice it Saturday night, Sunday morning and not until I hinted to her on how good a job I did with my hair that morning on the way home that she barely noticed. My wife is a engineer and always notice subtle details and changes. It&#x27;s Monday and I&#x27;m at the office typing this review and the line is still sharp and that was an absolute evidence that this product is and will be my new Secret Weapon and I hope O.G&#x27;s Barber Supply start selling it in larger bottles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad, I purchased this product because its like having a nice shape-up all the time. You got to get use to using this product, because its not that easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This is a great product you can&#x27;t go wrong with it I saw videos about thisome produc . So I thought I&#x27;d try it out I&#x27;ve ordered 2 so far. But 2 thumbs up</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take a rocket scientist to figure it out. Simply spray the holding spray, wait a few minutes, then evenly apply the dye with the brush provided.</li>
            <li> Decent product but not enough product for the price..</li>
