            <li>This was a super cute and super cheap panda bag.</li>
            <li>very cute and soft!</li>
            <li>but I pack a lot many pens, pencils, erasers and highlighters to school that most people think I&#x27;m crazy so it will probably be perfect for most people.</li>
            <li>I recommend it, cause its pretty cheap too!</li>
            <li>Fits perfectly in her small backpack.</li>
            <li>Very soft, and nice</li>
            <li>But other than that it&#x27;s adorable and I love the polka dots inside. :3</li>
            <li>I am giving this panda pencil bag to my niece who is 3 year old and I am pretty sure that she will love this dearly.</li>
            <li>Other than that it is great</li>
            <li>Love my new fuzzy friend!</li>
            <li>Nice and lovely, but there wasn&#x27;t pink blush on panda cheeks.</li>
            <li>But I was very happy of the quality of the bag for such a low price!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very cute, soft, and the fabric is of decent quality.</li>
            <li>It is worth it.</li>
            <li>Really soft, roomy, and cute.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves this so much!</li>
            <li>Ripped after first used.</li>
            <li>Zipper broke  the first day my daughter used it.</li>
            <li>It is super soft and great to feel but might be a bit delicate.</li>
            <li>zipper, so it does get caught if you&#x27;re trying to zip too fast, but overall it is a great product, especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soft, fluffy, and unique!</li>
            <li>soo soft and cuddly cant wait to give this as a gift  wonderfully fast shipping thank you!</li>
            <li>really cute little purse/pencil bag/cosmetic bag.  </li>
            <li>so I bought a new one for this school year.</li>
            <li>The ears are more towards the middle and there aren&#x27;t any pink marks under the eyes to make the panda look like it&#x27;s blushing.</li>
            <li>To give an idea of how much the pouch can hold; it can hold about a whole pack of Crayola markers (the 10 pack thick ones) and 5 fine-point markers (think sharpie brand fine point markers).</li>
            <li>the bag itself is very loose unlike in the photo where it looks stiff in a good way.</li>
            <li>It also came in early which is</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine, but only to little kids.</li>
            <li>Big enough for a few pencils and more</li>
            <li>, although the color it not like it is in the picture, it fact it&#x27;s a bit more dull, the ears aren&#x27;t on the edges and the white line (eye)</li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s fine because it would get dirty quick otherwise.</li>
            <li>Soft terry on the outside, fabric lined on the inside.  </li>
            <li>Big hit with 10 yr old.</li>
            <li>Many of them explains how the bag didn&#x27;t have the plush marks, some didn&#x27;t (which confused me)  leaving me to question if some people did get pouches with plush marks or just didn&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li>The stitching inside had some long threads which can be fixed by trimming it off.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s worth keeping if I can&#x27;t actually use it...</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the blush on it which is disappointing, but it&#x27;s still super cute and so fluffy.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The color isn&#x27;t as white, it has a little tinted beige.</li>
            <li> I mean its not high end material, but its soft, and it works for me.</li>
            <li> this is not a good idea, because they are too mature for this.</li>
            <li> When it came to my apartment it was new and nothing was broken.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t have the cute little blush marks that i thought it would :(</li>
            <li> Other then that it&#x27;s just a little pen case.</li>
            <li> nothing too big or serious</li>
            <li> My product was missing on of the fluffy balls on the zipper, I&#x27;m not sure if its suppose to have 2 fluffy balls or only one.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift to a little girl I know, and she likes it.</li>
            <li> Hands down!</li>
            <li> However it came missing with the blush.</li>
            <li> I mean for 2 dollars</li>
            <li> Only bad thing was that it didn&#x27;t come with the rosy cheeks like it shows in the picture.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the zipper was already busted on arrival.</li>
            <li> and there was no blush marks which was disappointing</li>
            <li> She was disappointed when she saw there was no blush.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very cute, took a while to get here and there was no blush marks which was disappointing but it was also inexpensive so you get what you pay for I guess</li>
            <li> This is so dang cute! It can&#x27;t hold a lot but I pack a lot many pens, pencils, erasers and highlighters to school that most people think I&#x27;m crazy so it will probably be perfect for most people. I love this and I recommend it to any panda lover out there. The one I got had lopsided ears but it gave it character (that&#x27;s what I told myself because my OCD was starting to make it bother me).</li>
            <li> It came wrapped in plastic. The color isn&#x27;t as white, it has a little tinted beige. I guess that&#x27;s fine because it would get dirty quick otherwise. It is super soft and great to feel but might be a bit delicate. The stitching inside had some long threads which can be fixed by trimming it off. The inside fabric is of cheap fabric but looks nice.</li>
            <li> really cute little purse/pencil bag/cosmetic bag.  Soft terry on the outside, fabric lined on the inside.  Big hit with 10 yr old. panda-loving girl.</li>
            <li> Mine came looking like it has been used...&lt;br /&gt;and the zipper fell of the moment I unzipped the bag.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  The rosy cheeks are not on the item which would have made it cuter. Other then that it&#x27;s just a little pen case.</li>
            <li> The bag is cute; however, it doesn&#x27;t look expensive. I bought it as a gift to a little girl I know, and she likes it. I would suggest that if you want to give it as a gift it&#x27;s fine, but only to little kids. If you are looking for a gift for teenagers this is not a good idea, because they are too mature for this.</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s female friend wished everything Panda for her birthday, and this piece was a hit!</li>
            <li> its perfect and i like it. finally i have my case to put all my stuff</li>
            <li> Really cute! I mean its not high end material, but its soft, and it works for me. I recommend it, cause its pretty cheap too!</li>
            <li> I am giving this panda pencil bag to my niece who is 3 year old and I am pretty sure that she will love this dearly.</li>
            <li> This was a super cute and super cheap panda bag. I use it to carry around pens I bought. The panda tail did break off of the zipper but I just sewed it back on. Given that I bought this item for a low price I&#x27;m head over heals in love.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this so much! Fits perfectly in her small backpack.</li>
            <li> it the best to hold my things but my does not have blushes on it</li>
            <li> Nice and lovely, but there wasn&#x27;t pink blush on panda cheeks.</li>
            <li> Cute and sooo soft.&lt;br /&gt;But didn&#x27;t have the cute little blush marks that i thought it would :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very cute. The inside is well put together. It can hold quite a bit of make-up. However it came missing with the blush. And the ears for it are too close together then what the sale picture depicted. But other than that it&#x27;s adorable and I love the polka dots inside. :3</li>
            <li> does not have blush Has a string hanging from the zipper No bottom Not the same bag in picture</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the blush on it which is disappointing, but it&#x27;s still super cute and so fluffy. I love it!</li>
            <li> Super cute, plush panda bag! My daughter uses it as a pencil bag for school. The lining fabric is black and white polka dot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skinny zipper, so it does get caught if you&#x27;re trying to zip too fast, but overall it is a great product, especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soft, fluffy, and unique!</li>
            <li> The case is adorable and it even arrived early, but it did not have blushing so that was a bit of a disappointment. Other than that it is great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute. It&#x27;s cheap. BUT it&#x27;s not what&#x27;s pictured. Not as cute as the one advertised. The ears are more towards the middle and there aren&#x27;t any pink marks under the eyes to make the panda look like it&#x27;s blushing. To give an idea of how much the pouch can hold; it can hold about a whole pack of Crayola markers (the 10 pack thick ones) and 5 fine-point markers (think sharpie brand fine point markers).</li>
            <li> Very soft, and nice I love it I ordered another for a friend</li>
            <li> Adorable and cheap! Perfect combination!</li>
            <li> Ripped after first used. Had to get it sewed</li>
            <li> Zipper broke  the first day my daughter used it.</li>
            <li> It was great! When it came to my apartment it was new and nothing was broken. I am going to give this to my daughter. You should buy this. Hands down! :) It is worth it. One week and still will work..even months! -5 stars</li>
            <li> soo soft and cuddly cant wait to give this as a gift  wonderfully fast shipping thank you!</li>
            <li> In love with this pouch . I got one last year and had it throughout the school year and I just adore it so I bought a new one for this school year. It also came in early which is nice üëåüèº much love</li>
            <li> I love it! I bought this for my daughter and it&#x27;s the perfect size for her pens and makeup. She was disappointed when she saw there was no blush. But I was very happy of the quality of the bag for such a low price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute and came undamaged, but it feels and looks very cheaply made. I feel like it might fall apart if I used it a lot.</li>
            <li> Took a little longer then estimated dates, but came in perfect shape. Really soft, roomy, and cute. I love it!</li>
            <li> Super cute I love it, it just the perfect size.  Yet its not the one inwanted the I wanted was the one with blush on it like the picture shown above. Yet the one I got has no blush. Would I order again YES!! But id like to get wht I ordered. Which is why I give it a 4</li>
            <li> Well made. Using it as party favors. Big enough for a few pencils and more</li>
            <li> got this for my wife to put here pens in. she likes it</li>
            <li> I bought this for my pencils, before buying this product I made sure to read the review. Many of them explains how the bag didn&#x27;t have the plush marks, some didn&#x27;t (which confused me)  leaving me to question if some people did get pouches with plush marks or just didn&#x27;t care. I don&#x27;t mind that it doesn&#x27;t have the plush mark, though I would&#x27;ve prefered it did. It has loose tread nothing too big or serious, although the color it not like it is in the picture, it fact it&#x27;s a bit more dull, the ears aren&#x27;t on the edges and the white line (eye) don&#x27;t tilt like in the photo. the bag itself is very loose unlike in the photo where it looks stiff in a good way. Personal I love my pouch I find it super cute, I do wish it had the plush. I mean for 2 dollars it&#x27;s great&lt;br /&gt;Also the tracking info was off I recieved this today and it say it still shipping out&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review help people decided whether or not to buy it</li>
            <li> My product was missing on of the fluffy balls on the zipper, I&#x27;m not sure if its suppose to have 2 fluffy balls or only one. Also I was expecting the Panda that had blush but got the regular one (no blush on it). I don&#x27;t mind it, but the photo was miss leading. I still like it and will use it.</li>
            <li> I love my pencil pouch! It is so fuzzy and i always love to feel it. Ive been using this pouch for a few days already, and it is in great condition! The furry ball on the zipper hadn&#x27;t fell off. Im so happy with it üòÄ</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive this product as I am a huge panda lover. It&#x27;s very cute, soft, and the fabric is of decent quality. Unfortunately the zipper was already busted on arrival. Not sure if it&#x27;s worth keeping if I can&#x27;t actually use it...</li>
            <li> very cute and soft! stores all highlighters, pens, and pencils</li>
            <li> Love my new fuzzy friend! Only bad thing was that it didn&#x27;t come with the rosy cheeks like it shows in the picture. It also took a long time to ship.</li>
