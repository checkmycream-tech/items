            <li>i really love this product.</li>
            <li>I use it to was my face and just love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff :)</li>
            <li>I love the soap in the winter months, it adds moisture to my skin.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product for sure.</li>
            <li>so my bottle I purchased should last at lest a year!&lt;br /&gt;Great product and good value!</li>
            <li>but so far so good :)</li>
            <li>I figured it was time to move away from salicylic acid treatments and move on to something that would help with acne scars and fine lines.</li>
            <li>Black soap is the best for your skin</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy with) for the last two months.</li>
            <li>the day I first used it and smelled it, I thought I had mistakenly got into some of my husbands&#x27; shaving/cologny stuff!!</li>
            <li>I am absolutely loving my new skin care regimen (thank you Amazon reviewers!).</li>
            <li>This soap makes my face feel so clean.</li>
            <li>soap itself smells so clean and earthy to me</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling thoroughly clean, and refreshed.</li>
            <li>I feel clean using this.</li>
            <li>It feels so clean after I wash</li>
            <li>Very soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>It is pretty drying and it doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>So far okay,  </li>
            <li>I am actually going to buy more of this fantastic cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is all natural as well.</li>
            <li>My roommates have all different skin types and we just buy a huge bottle and all use it, we love it so much!</li>
            <li>I just make sure to rinse my face extra well and keep my eyes very tightly shut when lathering the soap in my eye area (to remove mascara because it does a great job at it).</li>
            <li>Very watery, although I do love the natural nutty smell.</li>
            <li>SUPER gentle.</li>
            <li>It was ok, and did not dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li>:  It&#x27;ll leave your skin ashy (smooth but ashy, I recommend using shea butter as a lotion), if you use too much of it in your hair, it can strip your hair dramatically of much needed moisture but if that happens, you can easily get that moisture back with a mild leave-in conditioner of your choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I first received it I used it every night in the shower (for about a week)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my best kept secret!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a problem since the first couple uses.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s worth noting that anything sulfate free will not lather like &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; soap (sulfates are responsible for the bubbly lather effect you get from most drugstore cleansing products), but keep in mind that the saponified coconut oil ingredient in this black soap is basically coconut oil that has been altered to act like soap</li>
            <li>The good old fashion way to clean the skin without harsh chemicals that don&amp;#34;t rinse off well.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling incredibly clean and soft.</li>
            <li>First off let me explain that I came across this product purely by accident.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this black soap for a week and my complexion is sooooo much better!</li>
            <li>just a few days after I made my original purchase, I bought two more</li>
            <li>Not that great at removing oils especially make-up, I still prefer using bar black soap.</li>
            <li>tried using it in my hair too but didn&#x27;t really work for me, makes it greasy by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They work very well together.</li>
            <li>the rose water witch hazel, the st Ives black head scrub or the combo of it all!</li>
            <li>Excellent exfoliation, mild herbal smell (to preference), helps even skin tone a bit faster (with daily water intake), little is more (it only takes about a cap full to wash your entire body and the same amount to wash a thick head full of natural kinky coils).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using bar black soap for MANY YEARS.</li>
            <li>Thoroughly decent soap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see the long term affects of using this product</li>
            <li>and I got instant results like I did with my regular block of black soap and honestly, I&#x27;m hooked already!</li>
            <li>/&gt;BE CAREFUL IF YOU HAVE YARN BRAIDS OR ANY OTHER KIND OF EXTENSION!</li>
            <li>I was surprised by the consistency</li>
            <li>I had been using Clinique and Melaleuca Clarity for years, but now that I am no longer in my early twenties</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t out searching for an all natural soap or anything.</li>
            <li>let me explain a bit about myself, I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li>This leaves your skin soft.</li>
            <li>I am in my early 40&#x27;s have very oily skin (Mexican &amp; Italian decent).</li>
            <li>I had read a review from a woman that had been using this and a few other products a few months before her wedding day, stated that by using all this products together that her skin had developed this beautiful glow and her every once in a while blemish never happened.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used the giant mass of black soap and with me going off to school again, I wanted something a bit more simple without having to break off pieces in order to wash my body and hair.</li>
            <li>After the week and my skin started to clear up, I was left with the softest, clearest skin I ever had!</li>
            <li>I also haven&#x27;t gotten a single blemish since switching to black soap and my acne scars are fading quickly.</li>

            <li> I also haven&#x27;t gotten a single blemish since switching to black soap and my acne scars are fading quickly.</li>
            <li> But when she slacked on using the products after getting married her skin had become dull and pimples started again.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> It exfoliates naturally (no scrubbing or \\&quot;microbeads\\&quot; or \\&quot;peach pits\\&quot; necessary) and leaves skin oil-free yet moisturized.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used it long enough  </li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first because of all the extra ingredients (nothing harmful but extra)</li>
            <li> I have tried other Castile soaps, but, I did not get the same results that I would get with Dr. Woods.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s really pointless to make a natural product, then scent it with a synthetic fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I finally feel after all the products I&#x27;ve wasted money on</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> It does not feel dry and tight after washing.</li>
            <li> &amp; I found that it was over drying, so I started to used it every other day or so.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t linger all day like other soaps.</li>
            <li> Upon the suggestions of other reviewers I ordered this black soap along with organic witch hazel (for toner) and organic argan oil (moisturizer.)</li>
            <li> so seem to be slightly diminished.</li>
            <li> This is why you get less of a lather, but this does not effect the cleansing abilities of the product.</li>
            <li> Now I know it was just the harsh chemicals in the face washes I had been using.</li>
            <li> , I get blemishes a few times a month</li>
            <li> I am 100% natural (4a/ Type O hair, thick density, thready texture, thin to thick strands vs LOIS system) and at the moment I have in yarn braids/genie locs (acrylic).  </li>
            <li> In my search to slow down time on my face, I came across this woman&#x27;s review.</li>
            <li> Be careful to avoid getting it in your eyes, it burns!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is the dr woods,</li>
            <li> At first my skin got bad, like really bad for about a week</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m already addicted, so</li>
            <li> The price paid for the amount not to bad but not pleased with the over all performance of product &amp; probably won&#x27;t be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> Not really very impressed.  </li>
            <li> but my husband says it smells like medicine :(</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve never had terrible skin (severe acne) but it has never glowed (even during my pregnancies)</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very watery, although I do love the natural nutty smell. Does a great job as a moisturizing body wash. Not that great at removing oils especially make-up, I still prefer using bar black soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used the giant mass of black soap and with me going off to school again, I wanted something a bit more simple without having to break off pieces in order to wash my body and hair. So, I decided to give the liquid soap a try.  I was a bit skeptical at first because of all the extra ingredients (nothing harmful but extra) but I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed my hair, face and body with it and I got instant results like I did with my regular block of black soap and honestly, I&#x27;m hooked already! I used it four times and I&#x27;m already addicted, so just a few days after I made my original purchase, I bought two more bottles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:  Excellent exfoliation, mild herbal smell (to preference), helps even skin tone a bit faster (with daily water intake), little is more (it only takes about a cap full to wash your entire body and the same amount to wash a thick head full of natural kinky coils).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:  It&#x27;ll leave your skin ashy (smooth but ashy, I recommend using shea butter as a lotion), if you use too much of it in your hair, it can strip your hair dramatically of much needed moisture but if that happens, you can easily get that moisture back with a mild leave-in conditioner of your choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:  I am 100% natural (4a/ Type O hair, thick density, thready texture, thin to thick strands vs LOIS system) and at the moment I have in yarn braids/genie locs (acrylic).  And since using the product, I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair has thickened dramatically in the braids to the point of where the rapid growth is attempting to loc in my hair.  I&#x27;ve had the braids in for 5 weeks and I&#x27;m immediately taking my hair out now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BE CAREFUL IF YOU HAVE YARN BRAIDS OR ANY OTHER KIND OF EXTENSION!</li>
            <li> I am in my early 40&#x27;s have very oily skin (Mexican &amp; Italian decent). When I first received it I used it every night in the shower (for about a week) &amp; I found that it was over drying, so I started to used it every other day or so. I use the product on my shoulders &amp; chest area with ok results. My skin isn&#x27;t as greasy and the bumps/clogged pores so seem to be slightly diminished. I was surprised by the consistency I though it would be thicker by the description. The price paid for the amount not to bad but not pleased with the over all performance of product &amp; probably won&#x27;t be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> I have acne-prone (medically-controlled) skin, and since I found this product, I refuse to buy any face wash from the drug store again. It exfoliates naturally (no scrubbing or \\&quot;microbeads\\&quot; or \\&quot;peach pits\\&quot; necessary) and leaves skin oil-free yet moisturized. SUPER gentle. I use it 1-3 times daily and it has made a noticable difference in my complexion. It&#x27;s my best kept secret! My roommates have all different skin types and we just buy a huge bottle and all use it, we love it so much!</li>
            <li> So far okay,  haven&#x27;t used it long enough  will update.</li>
            <li> This soap makes my face feel so clean. It&#x27;s unreal! Love the earthy smell.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, leaves skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> I use this as my everyday face wash/body wash &amp; it really helps with my acne. I love the smell -my boyfriend &amp; I both use it, which minimizes the clutter in the shower. I&#x27;m already done with my second bottle &amp; will continue to purchase!</li>
            <li> I am absolutely loving my new skin care regimen (thank you Amazon reviewers!). Upon the suggestions of other reviewers I ordered this black soap along with organic witch hazel (for toner) and organic argan oil (moisturizer.) I had been using Clinique and Melaleuca Clarity for years, but now that I am no longer in my early twenties I figured it was time to move away from salicylic acid treatments and move on to something that would help with acne scars and fine lines. I&#x27;ve been using this black soap for a week and my complexion is sooooo much better! I no longer have any redness (I used to get red blotches to the point that one person even thought I had rosacia.) Now I know it was just the harsh chemicals in the face washes I had been using. I also haven&#x27;t gotten a single blemish since switching to black soap and my acne scars are fading quickly. This stuff is AMAZING! However, it will burn the S out of your eyes! I just make sure to rinse my face extra well and keep my eyes very tightly shut when lathering the soap in my eye area (to remove mascara because it does a great job at it). I haven&#x27;t had a problem since the first couple uses. Also, it&#x27;s worth noting that anything sulfate free will not lather like &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; soap (sulfates are responsible for the bubbly lather effect you get from most drugstore cleansing products), but keep in mind that the saponified coconut oil ingredient in this black soap is basically coconut oil that has been altered to act like soap (saponification is soap making in the chemistry world.) This is why you get less of a lather, but this does not effect the cleansing abilities of the product. My face is happy!</li>
            <li> I have tried other Castile soaps, but, I did not get the same results that I would get with Dr. Woods. I like Dr. Woods because I like the smell of it. My skin and hair feels moisturized after using it. I am glad to find Dr. Woods on this site because I cannot find it anywhere in my area.</li>
            <li> Great soap and would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> Made my own floor wash with this, will try again.  The smell is good, but the combination to mix was water, vinegar and the Castile Soap, I found that when you added the vinegar it made the soap curdle.  Will try again without vinegar.</li>
            <li> Not really very impressed.  A bit too watery for me.  It was ok, and did not dry out my skin.  I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> My husband HATES the smell of this face cleanser.  It is pretty drying and it doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling clean.  I&#x27;ve discontinued use</li>
            <li> First off let me explain that I came across this product purely by accident. I wasn&#x27;t out searching for an all natural soap or anything. I had read a review from a woman that had been using this and a few other products a few months before her wedding day, stated that by using all this products together that her skin had developed this beautiful glow and her every once in a while blemish never happened. But when she slacked on using the products after getting married her skin had become dull and pimples started again.&lt;br /&gt;Now let me explain a bit about myself, I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s, I&#x27;ve never had terrible skin (severe acne) but it has never glowed (even during my pregnancies), I get blemishes a few times a month (yes, even still at my age and now I have to worry about premature aging as well. In my search to slow down time on my face, I came across this woman&#x27;s review. I have been using all the products, with the exception of her lotions (I have a day and night cream that I have been using for yets and I&#x27;m happy with) for the last two months. At first my skin got bad, like really bad for about a week but I kept using it. After the week and my skin started to clear up, I was left with the softest, clearest skin I ever had! I&#x27;m not sure if it is the dr woods, the rose water witch hazel, the st Ives black head scrub or the combo of it all! But it will be what I use until it no longer works!&lt;br /&gt;The soap itself smells so clean and earthy to me but my husband says it smells like medicine :( regardless the smell only lasts for 10 minutes or so. Be careful to avoid getting it in your eyes, it burns!!!! A little goes a long way so my bottle I purchased should last at lest a year!&lt;br /&gt;Great product and good value!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite stuff.  Great for general skin care and awesome for shaving!</li>
            <li> I have been using bar black soap for MANY YEARS. Just recently switched to this liquid form...I must admit, the day I first used it and smelled it, I thought I had mistakenly got into some of my husbands&#x27; shaving/cologny stuff!! I was a bit taken aback by The initial smell!! But its that WONDERFUL rosemary, vitamin E and sea salt that gives it that gusto, so thaats A-Ok with Me : ))</li>
            <li> I love the texture, foaming consistency, and effectiveness of this soap! I give it 4 stars because of the scent... I think it&#x27;s really pointless to make a natural product, then scent it with a synthetic fragrance.  It smells oldperson-ish. I use it on my hair and acne-prone skin. It has made a big difference for my face.</li>
            <li> Thoroughly decent soap.</li>
            <li> I am actually going to buy more of this fantastic cleanser.  It leaves my skin feeling thoroughly clean, and refreshed.</li>
            <li> i really love this product. I use it to was my face and just love the way it makes my skin feel. tried using it in my hair too but didn&#x27;t really work for me, makes it greasy by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;even got a couple of friends who went out and bought it too! I will forever use this as my face wash.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling incredibly clean and soft. It smells amazing but not overpowering and it doesn&#x27;t linger all day like other soaps. Love this stuff :)</li>
            <li> I feel clean using this. It reminds me of my grandparents house. I love the soap in the winter months, it adds moisture to my skin. I have eczema and it help to provide relief. I don&#x27;t use during the summer</li>
            <li> I use this soap at all times, a This is a great soap for softening skin, non- drying, been buying for a while a great product  for skin, fast delivery from seller</li>
            <li> The smell is phenonmonal. Just  enough fragarance to relax you. The good old fashion way to clean the skin without harsh chemicals that don&amp;#34;t rinse off well.This leaves your skin soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product for two weeks and already I scan see a difference in my face. It feels so clean after I wash and it takes all my make up off. I follow with thayers rose water witch hazel. They work very well together. I have oily skin and have been battling acne for years!! I finally feel after all the products I&#x27;ve wasted money on, i know ive found my forever face wash. I love that it is all natural as well. I would recommend this product for sure. I&#x27;m excited to see the long term affects of using this product but so far so good :)</li>
            <li> Black soap is the best for your skin I&#x27;m from the Caribbean an this is the best soap to use for your skin</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a week, but I already see and feel a difference in my  skin. Very soft and smooth! It does not feel dry and tight after washing. LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the way my skin feels after using this.</li>
