            <li> I love how light it feels! It does a great job of keeping my skin protected from the sun.  I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.  I have incredibly sensitive, allergy prone skin.  I have tried dozens of sunscreens trying to find one that doesn&#x27;t break me out and I have finally found it.  I also like how this dries matte and I can put makeup over it easily.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t feel a thing on your skin with this one. Got it for use on body as I thought it would be a larger bottle but it isn&#x27;t as large as I thought it would be thereby making it an expensive way to protect your skin. Great on face, however.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it! no greasy, no fragrance, feels great! my skin is sensitive , it does not hurt my skin at all! It&#x27;s my 6th bottle~!</li>
            <li> it is my third bottle, really love it!! mild and no fragrance, have a smooth skin after applying, pretty good for everyday use</li>
            <li> Really like this product! It is very mild and soft with good protection for sunlight.  Good choice for regular use.</li>
            <li> This is a more cream type of sunscreen product, but it is very light weight even though it is cream type. It doesn&#x27;t have smell which I really appreciate. I usually have allergy to the sunscreen product in the US, but luckily!! This Japanese product save my summer! Compared to the face and body sunscreen product in the US, this one might be small; however, I do love this and use it both my face and body.</li>
            <li> It is okay but a little bit unpleasant semll.</li>
            <li> good product, but i think it&#x27;s not enough for the US&#x27;s hash sun</li>
            <li> I bought this product when I lived in Japan and when I ran out, I searched high and low at Target (and a few other places) for Biore sunscreen and found none, so I repurchased it online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the light weight feel of this product, along with it&#x27;s matte finish. Some sunscreens make my make-up almost pill on my face, but I&#x27;ve never had any problems with this. I&#x27;ve worn it out doing errands and to the beach and had no problems. I&#x27;m hoping to find a facial sunscreen I don&#x27;t have to buy off the internet (for convenience purposes) but this one is hard to beat.</li>
            <li> light as it says, the lotion turns to water/gel like after rubbed on it. Not greasy at all. Love it!</li>
            <li> Absorbs easily and is non sticky.</li>
            <li> Best SPF, very nice light texture (not runny but not thick), very light (almost none) smell, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all, non drying, best best best SPF in the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of generic brands SPF or even top high end brands have strong smell typical of sunscreen or too runny/too thick texture which is unpleasant on the skin.

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since my first study abroad in Japan, so about 10 years. I&#x27;ve been looking for an American equivalent for probably just as long, but there just isn&#x27;t anything else that absorbs as quickly or feels as light. And with no sunscreen smell or stickiness! AND it&#x27;s fragrance free!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my face and neck and never get burned when I&#x27;ve remembered to apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was super fast, too! It arrived long before Amazon&#x27;s ETA.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is light and absorbs quickly...just a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> Mild sunscreen I like it</li>
            <li> Finally found the sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t clog my pores! This sunscreen goes on light, absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast like alot of sunscreen. I will definely repurchase!</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen, it is very, very light, absorbs quickly. With great sun protection.&lt;br /&gt; And it doesn&#x27;t have that sunscreen smell to it. It&#x27;s rather drying tho, so I switched&lt;br /&gt;to the Biore Uv Perfect Silky Bright Milk Spf50.</li>
            <li> My fave sunscreen ever! No white cast, dries like a powder, perfecto for my ultra sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I love this SPF. It is light and watery but absorbs right into the skin. It leaves skin looking glowing and demi matte. A must have for alcohol weary customers such as me.</li>
            <li> i love this sunscreen. it is much lighter on the skin and easier to remove than other japanese sunscreens. a must try!</li>
            <li> Very good ！It‘s suitable to use it in summer</li>
