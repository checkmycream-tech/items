            <li>i love it.very good,is refreshing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot better.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>My skin has never been clearer and more even in tone.  </li>
            <li>This soap is not a whitening soap but it does fades away acne scars a lot and it also made your skin tone uniform :) I&#x27;ll will purchase this again.</li>
            <li>it is okay be me</li>
            <li>I have been using this Makari soap for many years and really love it.</li>
            <li>and it has worked even better there.</li>
            <li>I have fair or medium olive skin of polish/hungarian decent and my skin looks a lot better.  </li>
            <li>AND it works fine,</li>
            <li>Works great for me, and I can see the different.</li>
            <li>The soap is also great and last longer than I was expecting it.</li>
            <li>soap it self is great, way fewer red bumps even on my bikini line.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also has kept me acne free by the way</li>
            <li>so i was able to use it right away.  </li>
            <li>It does lighten but does not remove any scars, the original purpose i purchased this.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feels squeeky clean without drying it.</li>
            <li>Very harsh for sensitive skin, but I liked it and felt it did an awesome exfoliating job.  </li>
            <li>It also works well if you use a scrubby full of its lather instead of using the bar to your skin.  </li>
            <li>I am glad to find it at an affordable price on Amazon from this seller and verified that it is the real Makari soap I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li>Thanks Makari!!</li>
            <li>I tried this soap because of all the great reviews it received, as well as... to see if I was missing anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It cleans the skin and leaves it feeling soft with a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>This product is by far better than anything I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I am confident that my marks will be completely gone before I hit one year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my skin is Copper (like a brand new penny) in the summer and winter I can get as light as sandlewood.</li>
            <li>I will post back in a week to let you know more.  </li>
            <li>I love this soap, It&#x27;s been only 2 weeks</li>
            <li>First of all the soap isn&#x27;t a whitening soap but the label says makari clarifying exfoliating antiseptic soap</li>
            <li>to make sure i have an extra rinse after wards.</li>
            <li>I did not see any results at first</li>
            <li>and it was exactly what i wanted &#x27;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time to try it</li>
            <li>My first time trying it</li>
            <li>As an exfoliant, the grains are a bit too abrasive and large.</li>
            <li>It worked okay on my arms, but when I used it on my face, it caused me to break out and caused very dry patches of skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is slowly but surely becoming one color!!</li>
            <li>my face was broke out with bumbs my whole body</li>
            <li>Went straight into the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really does work.</li>
            <li>And I am very upset.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So as long as you put a moisterizer on afterwards then you should be fine.</li>
            <li>I was able to avoid dark spots, and stretch marks caused by pregnancy.</li>
            <li>I had so many on my chin that my chin appeared black.</li>
            <li>I didnt have much of an issue with spots or anything, i just wanted a more even skin tone and a soap to remove any form of tan or uneven spots.</li>
            <li>I did not see the effectiveness of the Mikari line for my particular skin pigmentation.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product to those in quest of a uniform skin tone.  </li>
            <li>I havent used it more then a few days</li>
            <li>I have been using this soap for more than 3 weeks now, it didn&#x27;t lighten me up but it dried up my pimples.</li>
            <li>This soap does make my skin very soft, but did not lighten my skin.  </li>
            <li>I say shrink because it was almost as if they faded from the outside first.</li>
            <li>It took, literally, 5 weeks for my skin to clear up after using the soap.</li>
            <li>I have eczema and extremely sensitive and this soap is non-irritating.  </li>
            <li>I bought it because my body is prone to ingrown hairs but is also sensitive.</li>
            <li>The product is good, but it is expensive.  </li>
            <li>I have fair, sensitive, oily, acne-prone skin, unfortunately.</li>
            <li>I have no black marks.</li>
            <li>my makeup no longer really fits anymore, but I would rather want my skin to feel hydrated and not feeling stretched.</li>
            <li>It has a light scent, but it&#x27;s not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I wish amazon sold it directly instead of through various sellers because I&#x27;d like to &#x27;subscribe&#x27; but</li>
            <li>I first heard of it from my classmate who in a month went from small brown marks all over her face to barely noticeable in a month and is now completely clear.</li>
            <li>All the originally brown ones are gone and I have few brown (formerly black) marks left.</li>

            <li> All the originally brown ones are gone and I have few brown (formerly black) marks left.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American; however, it left my skin sooo dry!</li>
            <li> I used this to lighten my dark face and arms due to too much sun exposure.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;**it should also be noted that I used it once a day generally not twice a day</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a month with no effect except for my skin&lt;br /&gt;getting dry and having a white residue on my skin after my shower.</li>
            <li> Also the shipping cost is high for this small product.  </li>
            <li> I am definitely not getting the results I expected with this soap</li>
            <li> I am currently reviewing this product and other Makari products on my blog&amp;#34; www.ilightenmyskin.blogspot.com.</li>
            <li> I have even used it on my back and other acne</li>
            <li> The bar of soap is two inches thick and heavy - well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> my overall skin tone got lighter but my acne marks were still there just a little lighter.</li>
            <li> I went back to it after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> no acnes or dark spots and don&#x27;t leave my face dry.</li>
            <li> im looking for other options.</li>
            <li> Other comments provided on the lightener and toner.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product being a block of soap at first.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect to lighten dramatically with this soap but do expect to lighten 2-3 shades when combined with other makari products.</li>
            <li> Dark spots did not diminish so I will try other product lines.</li>
            <li> It looks pretty weird on black skin</li>
            <li> I had really dark knees and underarms.</li>
            <li> It prevented me from getting too dark.</li>
            <li> I had some dark brown marks on my cheeks as well.</li>
            <li> The exfoliating bits feel like pumas stone or some other harsh exfoliant.  </li>
            <li> I received the item in less then three days</li>
            <li> but I can already see a slight difference.  </li>
            <li> but it does help even skin tone slightly.</li>
            <li> My scars through the season have always remained black.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exaggerating they were black if not than charcoal.</li>
            <li> Within a month the brown ones lightened and the black ones began to shrink.</li>
            <li> As a result my chin went from entirely black to separate marks.</li>
            <li> this soap n pills made my face a mess</li>
            <li> You need to be rid of dead skin in order for your product to penetrate.</li>
            <li> I will be updating this review on how it worked for me in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> and I still wore make-up everyday.</li>
            <li> I have been using the soap, body milk AND serum for the past 2 wks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am not sure which one is the culprit</li>
            <li> I tried to find other soaps that were less expensive</li>
            <li> I used this for a few days and every time I used it, the next day I would break out like crazy and the breakouts wouldn&#x27;t go away.</li>
            <li> So having said that I think it works at least on me because my tone is a bit lighter--</li>
            <li> Some other sellers are selling the immitation and that is really sad.</li>
            <li> It has a generic bar soap smell, but not too bad.  </li>
            <li> face has broken out severely.</li>
            <li> Therefore, I was not happy for the price paid.</li>
            <li> for real I was looking horrible</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to try a soap that costs $13.99, but it is a thick bar of soap!!</li>
            <li> an UGLY  surprise when I received my invoice.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed.</li>
            <li> it was horrible</li>
            <li> i have tried alot of whitening soaps and this is one of the worst..</li>
            <li> My face was the worst</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> great shipping and arrived on time. Im using this product for my face and I like it. no acnes or dark spots and don&#x27;t leave my face dry.</li>
            <li> It did nadaaaaaaa for me.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and by having so many good reviews I bought the product.  I received the item in less then three days so i was able to use it right away.  The bar of soap is two inches thick and heavy - well worth the price.  It has a generic bar soap smell, but not too bad.  The exfoliating bits feel like pumas stone or some other harsh exfoliant.  Very harsh for sensitive skin, but I liked it and felt it did an awesome exfoliating job.  It also works well if you use a scrubby full of its lather instead of using the bar to your skin.  I would leave the foam on my skin for a bit and then rinse.  I feel like this product is working.  I havent used it more then a few days but I can already see a slight difference.  I will post back in a week to let you know more.  All in All the bar is great and I would definitely recommend this product.  I have fair or medium olive skin of polish/hungarian decent and my skin looks a lot better.  I didnt have much of an issue with spots or anything, i just wanted a more even skin tone and a soap to remove any form of tan or uneven spots.</li>
            <li> This is a very good soap for people w/ sensitive skin.  I have eczema and extremely sensitive and this soap is non-irritating.  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve noticed any lightening yet but my skin is a lot softer.</li>
            <li> my overall skin tone got lighter but my acne marks were still there just a little lighter. but it lightened my overall skin tone ALOT!! I went from NW43 in Mac makeup to a NC40. It made the undertone of my skin yellowish. I am a African American by the way. When I tried to use it again it broke me out so im looking for other options.</li>
            <li> I love this soap, It&#x27;s been only 2 weeks but I can definitely see some results.  I am only using it on my body.  My skin is slowly but surely becoming one color!! highly recommend this product to those in quest of a uniform skin tone.  Hopefully you will be having more in stock soon since I am planning on ordering again and again!</li>
            <li> I am definitely not getting the results I expected with this soap but it does help even skin tone slightly. As an exfoliant, the grains are a bit too abrasive and large.</li>
            <li> I have been using the soap, body milk AND serum for the past 2 wks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I face has broken out severely. I am not sure which one is the culprit but I would have to stop using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used TOPICLEAR for over 10YRS AND it works fine, doesn&#x27;t cause break outs but DOES have hydroquinone 2%.  Just wanted to try a different product but the additional price and hype hasn&#x27;t paid off for me.</li>
            <li> This soap does make my skin very soft, but did not lighten my skin.  I was hoping for a miracle. I have a lot of freckles and was hoping that this soap would lighten them up, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Really nice product.  Prompt delivery time</li>
            <li> The product is good, but it is expensive.  Also the shipping cost is high for this small product.  Therefore, I was not happy for the price paid.</li>
            <li> i love it.very good,is refreshing</li>
            <li> First of all the soap isn&#x27;t a whitening soap but the label says makari clarifying exfoliating antiseptic soap&lt;br /&gt;with no mentioning of the whitening part.I have been using it for a month with no effect except for my skin&lt;br /&gt;getting dry and having a white residue on my skin after my shower.It looks pretty weird on black skin so i&lt;br /&gt;have to make sure i have an extra rinse after wards.Also my face keeps breaking out when i use it.</li>
            <li> Omg I wish u could give me back my money this soap n pills made my face a mess it was horrible my face was broke out with bumbs my whole body ...can be the soap or pills I was taking them both the  moment I stop both of them  my face came back ....Never ever again nothing in this line for me. ..I would not recommend this product to no one ...for real I was looking horrible</li>
            <li> I think this (Makari) whitening soap did lighten my skin. I&#x27;m African American; however, it left my skin sooo dry! So as long as you put a moisterizer on afterwards then you should be fine. So having said that I think it works at least on me because my tone is a bit lighter--my makeup no longer really fits anymore, but I would rather want my skin to feel hydrated and not feeling stretched.</li>
            <li> I have used this soap for a couple of months. Bought it to reduce my acne scars. I did not see any results at first so I stopped using it. I went back to it after a few weeks. It does lighten but does not remove any scars, the original purpose i purchased this.</li>
            <li> I just stated using this product. It works very well to slough off dead skin. You need to be rid of dead skin in order for your product to penetrate. I am currently reviewing this product and other Makari products on my blog&amp;#34; www.ilightenmyskin.blogspot.com.</li>
            <li> I have fair, sensitive, oily, acne-prone skin, unfortunately. I tried this soap because of all the great reviews it received, as well as... to see if I was missing anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t. I used this for a few days and every time I used it, the next day I would break out like crazy and the breakouts wouldn&#x27;t go away. It took, literally, 5 weeks for my skin to clear up after using the soap. Went straight into the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went back to my PanOxyl soap. It&#x27;s a lot better.</li>
            <li> I really love this soap, it is great! I had really dark knees and underarms. What I did was on my knees I used a pedicure brush and added the soap and scrubbed and after a week, there was a big diff. On my underarms just used like a bar. It really does work.</li>
            <li> Other comments provided on the lightener and toner.  I did not see the effectiveness of the Mikari line for my particular skin pigmentation. Dark spots did not diminish so I will try other product lines.</li>
            <li> Works great for me, and I can see the different. I love it. I think I will use it continuously.</li>
            <li> I will never buy this soap again.</li>
            <li> it did made my face lighter after using it for about 3 days..but then my skin started to breakout..i stopped using it..i have tried alot of whitening soaps and this is one of the worst..</li>
            <li> I used this to lighten my dark face and arms due to too much sun exposure.  It worked okay on my arms, but when I used it on my face, it caused me to break out and caused very dry patches of skin.</li>
            <li> I just got my makari soap in perfect condition.  I will be updating this review on how it worked for me in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Bought this product because of spots I have on my body and I can already see the results. Thanks Makari!!</li>
            <li> The soap is also great and last longer than I was expecting it. Will recommended</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product being a block of soap at first.  I thought it would make me break out but it did just the opposite.  My skin has never been clearer and more even in tone.  I get comments about my skin now.  I even recommended this to a friend.</li>
            <li> I love this soap! It cleans the skin and leaves it feeling soft with a healthy glow. I was skeptical to try a soap that costs $13.99, but it is a thick bar of soap!! It will lasts for months because I only use it on my face.</li>
            <li> This soap is not a whitening soap but it does fades away acne scars a lot and it also made your skin tone uniform :) I&#x27;ll will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> This soap cleanses the skin thoroughly. It makes your skin feels squeeky clean without drying it. I bought my daughter a bar. She loves it. Your sking looks bright and radiant after using it for about two weeks. You will definitely see a difference.</li>
            <li> it is just what I want. it is okay be me and it was exactly what i wanted &#x27; I like tit</li>
            <li> I bought it because my body is prone to ingrown hairs but is also sensitive. I felt like a bar made for face with built in exfoliant would be a best bet and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed. I wish amazon sold it directly instead of through various sellers because I&#x27;d like to &#x27;subscribe&#x27; but I can&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap it self is great, way fewer red bumps even on my bikini line.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time to try it so I don&#x27;t know yet</li>
            <li> I have been using this Makari soap for many years and really love it. I am glad to find it at an affordable price on Amazon from this seller and verified that it is the real Makari soap I&#x27;ve been using. Some other sellers are selling the immitation and that is really sad.</li>
            <li> Just received the soap today.I hope it turns out good. My first time trying it</li>
            <li> Ive been using this soap for years now. I tried to find other soaps that were less expensive but I didn&#x27;t get the results I get from this soap. I use this soap with the body beautifying milk by makari. It has a light scent, but it&#x27;s not overwhelming. With continued use of this soap. I was able to avoid dark spots, and stretch marks caused by pregnancy. It&#x27;s great to use after being exposed to the sun for hours. It prevented me from getting too dark. I have a medium brown complexion. I won&#x27;t give this soap 5 stars because of the price.</li>
            <li> This product is by far better than anything I have ever used. I first heard of it from my classmate who in a month went from small brown marks all over her face to barely noticeable in a month and is now completely clear. I am African American (so is my classmate by the way) my skin is Copper (like a brand new penny) in the summer and winter I can get as light as sandlewood. My scars through the season have always remained black. I&#x27;m not exaggerating they were black if not than charcoal. I had so many on my chin that my chin appeared black. Pounds of make up couldn&#x27;t even cover it.! Just made it look brown. I had some dark brown marks on my cheeks as well. This soap has been a miracle worker! Within a month the brown ones lightened and the black ones began to shrink. I say shrink because it was almost as if they faded from the outside first. As a result my chin went from entirely black to separate marks. Its been five months now. I have no black marks. All the originally brown ones are gone and I have few brown (formerly black) marks left. Nothing that make up doesn&#x27;t cover unlike before. I am confident that my marks will be completely gone before I hit one year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has kept me acne free by the way if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re getting it for too. I have even used it on my back and other acne scared areas and it has worked even better there. My face was the worst so that&#x27;s why I focused on it but its removed it from my back as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**it should also be noted that I used it once a day generally not twice a day like I should unless I went to the gym or something and I still wore make-up everyday.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered this soap for $12.10 via Amazon.com&lt;br /&gt;What an UGLY  surprise when I received my invoice. The seller charge me $25.00 for it. And I am very upset.&lt;br /&gt;It is a reap off.</li>
            <li> I got an antiseptic soap, instead of a whitening exfoliating soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap since 2008 and it&#x27;s the only lightening soap that works for me. I&#x27;ve tried plenty of lightening soaps but I always go back to using this one. Don&#x27;t expect to lighten dramatically with this soap but do expect to lighten 2-3 shades when combined with other makari products.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for more than 3 weeks now, it didn&#x27;t lighten me up but it dried up my pimples. I recommend it</li>
