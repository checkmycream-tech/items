            <li>and I found this perfect shade, it is a great color for summer, one of my favorites from summer!</li>
            <li>I think it looks best on tan toes or fingers.  </li>
            <li>But voila-the color is beautiful!</li>
            <li>I love it!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Very happy.</li>
            <li>Awesome quality and color!</li>
            <li>Perfect for spring!</li>
            <li>Great for spring!</li>
            <li>I loved this color in the pictures!</li>
            <li>And it takes 3 coats to get the bright color as shown in the photo.</li>
            <li>Its still bright even tho its pastel color.</li>
            <li>The polish is a gorgeous color, however it did require 3 coats.  </li>
            <li>Bright OPIs look good on me becos of my yellow-ish tone.</li>
            <li>This is an awesome sky blue that is great for spring!</li>
            <li>OPI IS ALWAYS AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT, SO THIS JUST MIGHT BE BOLD STEP INTO CATTITUDE.</li>
            <li>I really love this color!</li>
            <li>I love the product!  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very unique &amp; eye catching.</li>
            <li>the nail color arrived quickly, is a beautiful color, lasts long time, and best of all..dries fast!</li>
            <li>I was hoping I&#x27;d have better luck with an OPI color.    </li>
            <li>I paired this with \\&quot;Ogre the Top Blue\\&quot; on my toes, and I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments.</li>
            <li>I was more of a China Glaze fan, but after seeing one of my customers with this lovely color and buying it from here soon after, I am now an OPI fan.</li>
            <li>I thought the picture showed a \\&quot;sky blue\\&quot; but the polish, in reality, was more periwinkle than pictured.  </li>
            <li>I love this color</li>
            <li>I love OPI products and this is my favorite color.</li>
            <li>The perfect blue for wedding day toes!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I was able to find this color.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite OPI color.</li>
            <li>OK why is this polish 49.99?</li>
            <li>Also fashionable &amp; very stylish, goes with all outfits, or i could create a retro look with combining one of the nails polished by golden brown metallic.</li>
            <li>OPI nail polishes are great to begin with, but it is so nice when they arrive and are better than what you expected.</li>
            <li>Its not my favorite OPI color, but it reminds me of springtime and is very pretty.</li>
            <li>It is very pretty for spring though!</li>
            <li>I love this color, I have been looking for a while a bright light blue nail polish</li>
            <li>No matter how you shake it, it does not go on smooth and leaves streaks.</li>
            <li>And to be honest, I just don&#x27;t reach for it that much.</li>
            <li>GREAT NAME - AND A FUN COLOR, ESPECIALLY FOR TOES</li>
            <li>But surprisingly this is more than what I expected.</li>
            <li>Perfect, also, for the pale winter sweaters when the pearl nailpolish just does not look right</li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t pay that for any polish not even if it had pure gold flakes in it!!</li>
            <li>I tried 4 other shades but this was best by far.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite polish as it&#x27;s a fantastic shade of blue.  </li>
            <li>so I finally decided to buy my own bottle..</li>
            <li>It is a bit of a deeper shade in person than in the photograph here - more of a rich sky blue.  </li>
            <li>Perfect powder blue color - long lasting and doesn&#x27;t chip easily.</li>
            <li>I also felt it was more sheer than expected, and not as bright as I wanted it to be after two coats.</li>
            <li>The price was a bit excessive, but there&#x27;s no other color that matches perfectly.</li>
            <li>First off, the color is a tad deeper blue than in the image; however, I still love it.</li>
            <li>It does look exactly like the picture shown.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this color although the color itself is pretty.</li>
            <li>and you really don&#x27;t want to glitter!</li>
            <li>Everyone, from friends to total strangers in the supermarket, seems to love this color.  </li>
            <li>Definitely glad I picked it, and will definitely be wearing it again!</li>
            <li>I love the color, but it goes on very sheer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I finally got around to getting it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this fun color.</li>
            <li>The only con of this polish is that, with two coats, it is just a tad streaky; however, I am not deleting stars b/c I find that, unless you get a professional manicure, most polishes have some streaking at two coats.     </li>
            <li>Not only do they have new, amazing, fresh colors, but they make their lacquer last super long.</li>
            <li>The consistency was watery, more so than other OPI polishes I&#x27;ve purchased.  </li>
            <li>I bought it and love it except it does streak if you do not let it dry completely before adding another coat.</li>
            <li>So that&#x27;s nearly 5 full days already with no chipping, which is a personal record for me</li>
            <li>Today is Thursday, and after applying a fresh coat of NailTeq daily, this polish still hasn&#x27;t begun to chip or lift, although it looks like it may very soon.</li>
            <li>The picture of this polish made the color look a bit washed out, but when it got here it was a lovely deep sky blue color</li>
            <li>A previous reviewer called it a \\&quot;sky blue\\&quot; and that&#x27;s pretty accurate.</li>
            <li>Being that I had never actually seen this color except on the internet, I was really chancing it, since pictures do not always depict the real thing.</li>
            <li>and I was plesantly surprised.</li>
            <li>So far this is my fave</li>
            <li>It is exactly the baby blue color I&#x27;ve been looking for since last summer.</li>
            <li>If you tend to have yellow undertones in your skin, steer clear of this.</li>
            <li>To be clear, it&#x27;s not actually periwinkle, but it&#x27;s not as turquoise</li>
            <li>The color is a gorgeous color, I love wearing it, sadly, it takes about three coats to get the color of the bottle (or I just got a bad batch).</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve never gotten so many random compliments on my nails before!  </li>
            <li> ou could wear this shade ALL SUMMER LONG!!</li>
            <li> I agree with the previous poster, about the picture making the blue look washed out.</li>
            <li> Something Borrowed and Blue,&#x27; since that polish started chipping off after less than a day.</li>
            <li> I was hesitate to buy this sky blue color as I thought it would be pale.</li>
            <li> I usually go with red cremes, but this just stood out to me.  </li>
            <li> I used a Nailteq base and top coat, and two coats of \\&quot;What&#x27;s With the Cattitude\\&quot; on Saturday night.</li>
            <li> I recommend using Seche Vite top and base coat to make it wear longer.</li>
            <li> when OPI&#x27;s Black Shatter is added over it.</li>
            <li> I do think it is a little overrated for the color.  </li>
            <li> It looks pretty bad a$$</li>
            <li> This shade you can dress up or dress down!!</li>
            <li> Ridiculous</li>
            <li> this is exactly the color i&#x27;ve been looking for, but the price is insane!</li>

            <li> I agree with the previous poster, about the picture making the blue look washed out. I really love this color! This is an awesome sky blue that is great for spring!</li>
            <li> I ordered this color b/c it was similar in color to Essie&#x27;s &#x27;Something Borrowed and Blue,&#x27; since that polish started chipping off after less than a day. I was hoping I&#x27;d have better luck with an OPI color.    First off, the color is a tad deeper blue than in the image; however, I still love it. A previous reviewer called it a \\&quot;sky blue\\&quot; and that&#x27;s pretty accurate. I used a Nailteq base and top coat, and two coats of \\&quot;What&#x27;s With the Cattitude\\&quot; on Saturday night. Today is Thursday, and after applying a fresh coat of NailTeq daily, this polish still hasn&#x27;t begun to chip or lift, although it looks like it may very soon. So that&#x27;s nearly 5 full days already with no chipping, which is a personal record for me (polish tends to chip off within 1 day of my manicures).    The only con of this polish is that, with two coats, it is just a tad streaky; however, I am not deleting stars b/c I find that, unless you get a professional manicure, most polishes have some streaking at two coats.     I paired this with \\&quot;Ogre the Top Blue\\&quot; on my toes, and I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments. I highly recommend this fun color.</li>
            <li> I love this color, I have been looking for a while a bright light blue nail polish and I found this perfect shade, it is a great color for summer, one of my favorites from summer!</li>
            <li> You can get the same color at Kroger for $7-$10. This is overpriced. I bought it and love it except it does streak if you do not let it dry completely before adding another coat. And it takes 3 coats to get the bright color as shown in the photo.</li>
            <li> I do like this color for summertime.  I do think it is a little overrated for the color.  I think it looks best on tan toes or fingers.  If you tend to have yellow undertones in your skin, steer clear of this.</li>
            <li> OPI nail polishes are great to begin with, but it is so nice when they arrive and are better than what you expected. The picture of this polish made the color look a bit washed out, but when it got here it was a lovely deep sky blue color and I was plesantly surprised. Its not my favorite OPI color, but it reminds me of springtime and is very pretty.</li>
            <li> Being that I had never actually seen this color except on the internet, I was really chancing it, since pictures do not always depict the real thing. But voila-the color is beautiful! It is exactly the baby blue color I&#x27;ve been looking for since last summer. I love it!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The polish is a gorgeous color, however it did require 3 coats.  The consistency was watery, more so than other OPI polishes I&#x27;ve purchased.  It does look exactly like the picture shown.</li>
            <li> No matter how you shake it, it does not go on smooth and leaves streaks. I am using it up on my toe nails. It is long lasting though streaked. I would not recommend this color although the color itself is pretty.</li>
            <li> I was more of a China Glaze fan, but after seeing one of my customers with this lovely color and buying it from here soon after, I am now an OPI fan. Not only do they have new, amazing, fresh colors, but they make their lacquer last super long.</li>

            <li> This shade you can dress up or dress down!! ou could wear this shade ALL SUMMER LONG!! Perfect, also, for the pale winter sweaters when the pearl nailpolish just does not look right and you really don&#x27;t want to glitter!</li>
            <li> GREAT NAME - AND A FUN COLOR, ESPECIALLY FOR TOES THIS SUMMER.  OPI IS ALWAYS AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT, SO THIS JUST MIGHT BE BOLD STEP INTO CATTITUDE.</li>
            <li> I love the product!  And was so thankfully I could find it here since no one else had it!</li>
            <li> One of my all-time fave colors</li>
            <li> this is exactly the color i&#x27;ve been looking for, but the price is insane! 40 dollars for nail polish?? is it made out of panda??</li>
            <li> This is my favorite polish as it&#x27;s a fantastic shade of blue.  I recommend using Seche Vite top and base coat to make it wear longer.</li>
            <li> I chose this color on a whim.  I usually go with red cremes, but this just stood out to me.  I&#x27;ve never gotten so many random compliments on my nails before!  Everyone, from friends to total strangers in the supermarket, seems to love this color.  It is a bit of a deeper shade in person than in the photograph here - more of a rich sky blue.  Definitely glad I picked it, and will definitely be wearing it again!</li>
            <li> Bright OPIs look good on me becos of my yellow-ish tone. I was hesitate to buy this sky blue color as I thought it would be pale. But surprisingly this is more than what I expected. Its still bright even tho its pastel color. So far this is my fave, it&#x27;s very unique &amp; eye catching. Also fashionable &amp; very stylish, goes with all outfits, or i could create a retro look with combining one of the nails polished by golden brown metallic. Chic! Very happy.</li>
            <li> I love this color I always would get this color when I would go to the nail salon and get my nails done so I finally decided to buy my own bottle..</li>
            <li> Awesome quality and color! Perfect for spring!</li>
            <li> I love OPI products and this is my favorite color. It looks pretty bad a$$ when OPI&#x27;s Black Shatter is added over it.</li>
            <li> The perfect blue for wedding day toes! I&#x27;m so glad I was able to find this color. I tried 4 other shades but this was best by far.</li>
            <li> the nail color arrived quickly, is a beautiful color, lasts long time, and best of all..dries fast! Will definitely order another.</li>
            <li> I love the color, but it goes on very sheer.  Not like transparent, but if you want the color like in the preview, that&#x27;s about two or three coats.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite OPI color. I&#x27;m glad I finally got around to getting it. The price was a bit excessive, but there&#x27;s no other color that matches perfectly.</li>
            <li> I loved this color in the pictures! I like it on my hands too, but it is not as opaque as I like. It takes 3 coats to get to fully opaque for me, which I don&#x27;t like. And to be honest, I just don&#x27;t reach for it that much. It is very pretty for spring though!</li>
            <li> Perfect powder blue color - long lasting and doesn&#x27;t chip easily. Great for spring!</li>
            <li> OK why is this polish 49.99? What does it do...polish your nails by it self?&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t pay that for any polish not even if it had pure gold flakes in it!! Ridiculous</li>
