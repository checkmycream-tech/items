    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Considering that I have had the majority of these marks since puberty, I am impressed at the efficacy of this product.  </li>
            <li>I used it twice a day along with the Kielhs moistourizer and I am very happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>It really is a great product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too impressed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed.  </li>
            <li>It smells very good.  </li>
            <li>And my skin feels very good after I used it.</li>
            <li>She feel very good and efective.</li>
            <li>Good~!</li>
            <li>Great product works great...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Everyone else had good result, it seems.&lt;br /&gt;Not me.</li>
            <li>Good pricing for stablized Vit C product.</li>
            <li>and the price was good</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m very happy with the product, it was exactly what i wanted, and just on time.</li>
            <li>The fact that it is a relatively safe product, free of toxic ingredients, is a plus; and the liberal sample policy practised by the Kiehl&#x27;s company probably &#x27;made the deal&#x27; for me.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a good product, and you might like the results.</li>
            <li>Almost all the \\&quot;best\\&quot; lists had this product as one of their top products.  </li>
            <li>and I could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li>has gotten better</li>
            <li>I love love love this product...:)</li>
            <li>great seller and fast shipping too:)</li>
            <li>My fiance even commented on how much better they look.  </li>
            <li>and their dutyfree store at the airport- very good visual display.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how much lighter sun spots are after this routine.</li>
            <li>they look so simple and effective!</li>
            <li>I still have a ways to go, but it&#x27;s good to know something is finally working.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 weeks and have seen TREMENDOUS results.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference yet, but I am willing to stick it out.</li>
            <li>Never really had good results with Kiehl&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;Tried  Line Reducer.</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>I am always on look outs for a good dark spot solution.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and i have super fast internet connection.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing a single drop of this product</li>
            <li>Price is on the higher end</li>
            <li>drops of hot oil dropped on my skin</li>
            <li>I got my first ever acne scar at age 37 and</li>
            <li>So as you can imagine, after a couple months of this the sides of my face are scarred pretty</li>
            <li>All were mostly positive, so I decided to fork out $50 to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>The texture is light and comfortable, not sticky as other brands.  </li>
            <li>This product really works, and FAST!</li>
            <li>had only used it on that one spot, but with more than 2/3 of a bottle left, I started slathering it everywhere to see what it could do on my light melasma.  </li>
            <li>if you want to get the real one so order it from another seller or from the original maker you will pay little more</li>
            <li>Being in Las Vegas&#x27; sun didn&#x27;t help them a whole lot either.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work as fast as peeling soaps or Products with Retinols.  </li>
            <li>In the beginning I thought maybe it was doing something, but it defintely hasn&#x27;t done much.  </li>
            <li>any way its only an advice the product is good just buy from other place</li>
            <li>Fades sun spots better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Thought this is more expensive than the drugstore brands, it works much better than they do.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have purchased a second bottle, which is something I rarely do because nothing has ever made a difference like this.[[ASIN</li>
            <li>And overall, when I look in the mirror, my skin just looks overall far more even and</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m Italian, so dark hair is kind of an issue for us).  </li>
            <li>used it about half a bottle and thinking about chucking it.&lt;br /&gt;Tried to go to Kiehl&#x27;s site to see what it&#x27;s supposed to do exactly with what ingredients, but it takes tremendous time to download pages and keep getting errors opening the product page</li>
            <li>It is not a miracle-worker, but compared to other OTC products available in store and online, it is well priced and doing the job as promised.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was so upsetting because I&#x27;ve always had mostly clear skin, with the exception of one or two pimples during high hormone times.  </li>
            <li>It was definitely diluted with something, very watery, and made my face break out!</li>
            <li>The real &#x27;Kiehls Clearly Corrective Serum&#x27; was an actual serum and was thicker, it worked very well on my skin and did not make me break out.</li>
            <li>Do not buy it from Blue Mercury, it is not the real stuff!</li>
            <li>I broke out with one or two pimples after the first or second session, but they came and went, no biggie.  </li>
            <li>Light and slightly moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>I came across the Kiehls Clearly Corrective Dark Spot Solution and read reviews from many different websites.  </li>
            <li>just figured days of clear skin were over.  </li>
            <li>50/50 on it so far...</li>
            <li>So far one month in my brown spots have lightened my skin tone</li>
            <li>The scars aren&#x27;t completely gone, but they have faded drastically.  </li>
            <li>I exfoliate my face first with my Clarisonic and then apply this and let it dry before applying makeup.</li>
            <li>Too mild for dark spots.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered this product directly from the maker before, and what I got from blue mercury was not the same product!!</li>
            <li>One more thing I was making food few days back and few</li>
    </ol>

            <li> :B0077TLO4I Kiehl&#x27;s Clearly Corrective Dark Spot Solution]]</li>
            <li> All of my dark spots are completely gone.</li>
            <li> So far Kiehl&#x27;s dark spot solution seems to be fading some of my spots.  </li>
            <li> I still recommend for young ppl~ since dark spot correction is not one day&#x27;s job</li>
            <li> absolutely no difference after twice daily use through the course of the entire bottle over several months.</li>
            <li> One drop goes a long way, so this bottle will last awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I am not dark though~ dark spots correction?</li>
            <li> It has not completely erased the age spots but they are lighter and the rest of my face seems brighter.</li>
            <li> little goes a long way, as I only apply the serum on the actual dark marks, not on the entire face.  </li>
            <li> From reviews I read and my limited understanding of skin, there is quite a variance in what works and what does not.  </li>
            <li> get occasional break outs and the dark spots lasts forever.</li>
            <li> I finally started researching dark spot correctors.  </li>
            <li> and they said they did not, and the serum should be slightly thicker than water, not watery like the one I received from Blue Mercury!!!</li>
            <li> but u have to use it on regular basis to see the results I am assuming this bottle will last me at least 6months</li>
            <li> I spent hours aggregating data before purchasing this product.  </li>
            <li> It didnt dry my skin out and wasnt harsh - not surprised since it&#x27;s by Kiel&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I use it morning and night along with some of their other products (cleanser and moisturizer).</li>
            <li> I have dark spots due to acne scaring.</li>
            <li> I started using Kiehl&#x27;s Dark Spot Corrector about 2 months ago, and I have seen a gradual lightening of my acne marks.  </li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t seen a difference in the dark spots yet.</li>
            <li> the dark spots i had began to fade within a week...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen some improvement in my dark spots, but nothing miraculous.</li>
            <li> My dark spots are still there as before.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue until finish it, but I never purchase again.</li>
            <li> My dark spot faded somewhat.</li>
            <li> I used 2 full bottles and my dark spots in my face didn&#x27;t change at all, I did everything it said and nothing changed, a little expensive for me not to see results!</li>
            <li> once they started to go down, another 4 or 5 flared up.  </li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t spend 60$ for slight moisturization.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> do think it breaks me out a little around the mouth about half the time, but I can make that go away with a few days off while the clearer skin</li>
            <li> Whitening?yeah little bit after 2weeks</li>
            <li> Goodbye hydroquinone and hello Keilhs dark spot corrector!</li>
            <li> Let me start off by giving you a little background information for why I purchased this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June</li>
            <li> I stopped getting laser hair removal, which seemed to keep the pimples from returning, and had been using &amp;#34;home remedies&amp;#34; for my scars but saw little improvement.  </li>
            <li> This product worked a little.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this product by a friend, started using it a few months ago</li>
            <li> Waste of my money and time.</li>
            <li> It has only been 3 weeks and the results are dramatic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sucker.</li>
            <li> I was so tired of using harsh bleaching chemicals to even out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> After I read reviews on amazon about this product, I was skeptical some reviews saying it started see result in 2,3 weeks, but I decided to give it try, hoping at least my dark spots get lighter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Frustrating.</li>
            <li> But nothing dramatic like they claim happened.  </li>
            <li> After the 4th session, my face broke out with the worst case of acne I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Got this at a dutyfree a month ago on a whim.&lt;br /&gt;I get occasional break outs and the dark spots lasts forever. I am always on look outs for a good dark spot solution.&lt;br /&gt;Kiehl&#x27;s dutyfree store had it on the bestseller&#x27;s group, so I picked it up.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it day and night for a month but don&#x27;t see any effects what so ever. I like the texture. Light and slightly moisturizing.  but I didn&#x27;t spend 60$ for slight moisturization.&lt;br /&gt;I used it about half a bottle and thinking about chucking it.&lt;br /&gt;Tried to go to Kiehl&#x27;s site to see what it&#x27;s supposed to do exactly with what ingredients, but it takes tremendous time to download pages and keep getting errors opening the product page and i have super fast internet connection. Frustrating. Anyone had same problem?&lt;br /&gt;I gave up and did a google search and was led here.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone else had good result, it seems.&lt;br /&gt;Not me. Never really had good results with Kiehl&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;Tried  Line Reducer. It was alright. Good pricing for stablized Vit C product. But nothing dramatic like they claim happened.  didn&#x27;t like the texture and stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;I keep buying this brand partly because  I like their product design- they look so simple and effective! and their dutyfree store at the airport- very good visual display. I&#x27;m a sucker.</li>
            <li> I started using Kiehl&#x27;s Dark Spot Corrector about 2 months ago, and I have seen a gradual lightening of my acne marks.  Considering that I have had the majority of these marks since puberty, I am impressed at the efficacy of this product.  It is not a miracle-worker, but compared to other OTC products available in store and online, it is well priced and doing the job as promised.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way, as I only apply the serum on the actual dark marks, not on the entire face.  The texture is light and comfortable, not sticky as other brands.  The fact that it is a relatively safe product, free of toxic ingredients, is a plus; and the liberal sample policy practised by the Kiehl&#x27;s company probably &#x27;made the deal&#x27; for me.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a good product, and you might like the results.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference yet, but I am willing to stick it out. Non-drying, not oily but I haven&#x27;t seen a difference in the dark spots yet. 50/50 on it so far...</li>
            <li> I spent hours aggregating data before purchasing this product.  Almost all the \\&quot;best\\&quot; lists had this product as one of their top products.  Price is on the higher end but I want something that works and for me, this did.  From reviews I read and my limited understanding of skin, there is quite a variance in what works and what does not.  I am of Asian/American-Indian/Jewish/White descent and it worked for me within one week and by two weeks my sun spots didn&#x27;t need make to cover them anymore.  I used it twice a day along with the Kielhs moistourizer and I am very happy with this product.  As an fyi, if you buy it at Kielh&#x27;s, they will take it back if it does not work.</li>
            <li> This product really works, and FAST! I am biracial and I have had acne marks for a while now. Being in Las Vegas&#x27; sun didn&#x27;t help them a whole lot either. I was recommended this product by a friend, started using it a few months ago and I could not be more pleased. All of my dark spots are completely gone. I use it morning and night along with some of their other products (cleanser and moisturizer). It really is a great product!</li>
            <li> Great product works great... I&#x27;m African American....the dark spots i had began to fade within a week...they were gone within a month (used 2x a day)</li>
            <li> absolutely no difference after twice daily use through the course of the entire bottle over several months. Waste of my money and time.</li>
            <li> This product is a must have even if u don&#x27;t have any brown spots or freckles on ur face or hands or anywhere else u should use this it&#x27;s amazing a single drop of this product does for u.. It&#x27;s not a miracle serum but u have to use it on regular basis to see the results I am assuming this bottle will last me at least 6months and I be using it almost twice a day every day.. So far one month in my brown spots have lightened my skin tone has gotten better it&#x27;s even out it has brighten my skin and I have started to get compliments on my skin!!! One more thing I was making food few days back and few drops of hot oil dropped on my skin I started dabbing that serum there as well and within a week they have diminished&lt;br /&gt; I love love love this product...:) great seller and fast shipping too:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen some improvement in my dark spots, but nothing miraculous. That said, I will keep using it and see what happens.</li>
            <li> if you want to get the real one so order it from another seller or from the original maker you will pay little more but you get what you need , they sent me a very different product , I got it out of the united states so no hope for return while they will not answer you soon ! any way its only an advice the product is good just buy from other place</li>
            <li> I expect this product does work in time, that&#x27;s why I gave 4 stars.  Doesn&#x27;t work as fast as peeling soaps or Products with Retinols.  Too mild for dark spots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brown spot on my face for a couple of years (caused by the sun).  I read a bunch of reviews and this was one of the recommended products for getting rid of them.  I&#x27;ve been using this for about 9 months now and I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s changed anything.  In the beginning I thought maybe it was doing something, but it defintely hasn&#x27;t done much.  Maybe it would work on newer spots or lighter spots or smaller spots or different kinds of spots...I don&#x27;t know.  I don&#x27;t use it twice a day as recommended because it&#x27;s just not possible, but I do use it every night.  Regardless, if it was going to do something, it probably would have done it already.  I&#x27;m not too impressed.</li>
            <li> Fades sun spots better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried. I exfoliate my face first with my Clarisonic and then apply this and let it dry before applying makeup. It&#x27;s amazing how much lighter sun spots are after this routine.</li>
            <li> So far Kiehl&#x27;s dark spot solution seems to be fading some of my spots.  I will keep using it for a while before I decide.</li>
            <li> Whitening?yeah little bit after 2weeks but I am not dark though~ dark spots correction? No see in 2weeks~ well but I have spots since middle school~ moisture? Good~! I still recommend for young ppl~ since dark spot correction is not one day&#x27;s job</li>
            <li> After I read reviews on amazon about this product, I was skeptical some reviews saying it started see result in 2,3 weeks, but I decided to give it try, hoping at least my dark spots get lighter.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for almost six months.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see any improvements what&#x27;s so ever! My dark spots are still there as before.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue until finish it, but I never purchase again.</li>
            <li> My husband says I look 10years younger! It has not completely erased the age spots but they are lighter and the rest of my face seems brighter. I have purchased a second bottle, which is something I rarely do because nothing has ever made a difference like this.[[ASIN:B0077TLO4I Kiehl&#x27;s Clearly Corrective Dark Spot Solution]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed.  I got my first ever acne scar at age 37 and just figured days of clear skin were over.  But when I saw this product days after getting engaged, I thought it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try it with all those pictures coming up.  After 3.5 months (using twice a day), the acne scar was entirely gone.  Completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had only used it on that one spot, but with more than 2/3 of a bottle left, I started slathering it everywhere to see what it could do on my light melasma.  Another 3 months later, it is noticeably lighter but not 100% gone.  And overall, when I look in the mirror, my skin just looks overall far more even and clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think it breaks me out a little around the mouth about half the time, but I can make that go away with a few days off while the clearer skin stays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And after all this, I still have almost a third of a bottle!  The stuff works at a glacial pace, BUT IT WORKS.  Well worth it.</li>
            <li> Did not clear my dark spots, didn&#x27;t really see any difference</li>
            <li> I have dark spots due to acne scaring. I was so tired of using harsh bleaching chemicals to even out my skin tone. I decided to give this product a try and low and behold it works wonders. Goodbye hydroquinone and hello Keilhs dark spot corrector! It has only been 3 weeks and the results are dramatic. I cant wait to see how well my face will be at the end of month two.</li>
            <li> I got it on time. It smells very good.  And my skin feels very good after I used it. I think I will but it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product directly from the maker before, and what I got from blue mercury was not the same product!! It was definitely diluted with something, very watery, and made my face break out! The real &#x27;Kiehls Clearly Corrective Serum&#x27; was an actual serum and was thicker, it worked very well on my skin and did not make me break out. Do not buy it from Blue Mercury, it is not the real stuff! I actually called Kiehls to see if they changed the product and they said they did not, and the serum should be slightly thicker than water, not watery like the one I received from Blue Mercury!!! Buy this product somewhere else.</li>
            <li> I buy this product for my friend&#x27;s daughter.Her daughter used this.She feel very good and efective.Now I havn&#x27;t given her.</li>
            <li> I used 2 full bottles and my dark spots in my face didn&#x27;t change at all, I did everything it said and nothing changed, a little expensive for me not to see results!</li>
            <li> Let me start off by giving you a little background information for why I purchased this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June 2012 I started laser hair removal on my side burn, chin area (I&#x27;m Italian, so dark hair is kind of an issue for us).  Since then, I&#x27;ve had 4 sessions.  I broke out with one or two pimples after the first or second session, but they came and went, no biggie.  I&#x27;ve had breakouts before.  After the 4th session, my face broke out with the worst case of acne I&#x27;ve ever had.  I was getting 4 or 5 pimples on each side of my face and once they started to go down, another 4 or 5 flared up.  It was so upsetting because I&#x27;ve always had mostly clear skin, with the exception of one or two pimples during high hormone times.  So as you can imagine, after a couple months of this the sides of my face are scarred pretty bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I stopped getting laser hair removal, which seemed to keep the pimples from returning, and had been using &amp;#34;home remedies&amp;#34; for my scars but saw little improvement.  I finally started researching dark spot correctors.  I came across the Kiehls Clearly Corrective Dark Spot Solution and read reviews from many different websites.  All were mostly positive, so I decided to fork out $50 to give it a try.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 weeks and have seen TREMENDOUS results.  The scars aren&#x27;t completely gone, but they have faded drastically.  My fiance even commented on how much better they look.  I still have a ways to go, but it&#x27;s good to know something is finally working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the serum twice daily; once in the morning and once before I go to bed.  One drop goes a long way, so this bottle will last awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have acne scars, give this serum a try.</li>
            <li> This product worked a little. My dark spot faded somewhat. It didnt dry my skin out and wasnt harsh - not surprised since it&#x27;s by Kiel&#x27;s. Overall it did help me.</li>
            <li> Thought this is more expensive than the drugstore brands, it works much better than they do.  I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m very happy with the product, it was exactly what i wanted, and just on time. and the price was good</li>
