            <li>It&#x27;s really strong and works pretty good.</li>
            <li>I recommend this but not if you need a strong hold.</li>
            <li>It has a strong smell when applied but that disappears within minutes.  </li>
            <li>They have changed it and the smell is offensive--really strong and stayed on my hair until I washed it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do not require a strong hold</li>
            <li>Comes out even and fine.</li>
            <li>The quality is fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light that it doesn&#x27;t look like you have hair spray on.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like fragrance free BTW.</li>
            <li>My new favorite hairspray :) .</li>
            <li>I have super fine hair</li>
            <li>This hairspray is so light but dries super quickly and doesn&#x27;t smell strongly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please bring back the old formula, it was perfect!</li>
            <li>This is great for when I put my hair in a ponytail, and I don&#x27;t want a single strand poking out from anywhere.</li>
            <li>Great hold , brush able  no strong oders that can linger.</li>
            <li>Overall, good product.</li>

            <li>I am surprised to hear so many of you LIKE the smell of this hairspray.  </li>
            <li>I have curly hair and like a good hairspray to keep the fly-aways down.</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I love this hairspray, and buying it on Amazon is the only way to go.</li>
            <li>It smells like fresh powder, and holds REALLY well.</li>

            <li>I ran out of my go-to hair spray and thought I&#x27;d try something new.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair truly soft and the spray becomes invisible both in appearance and hold.  </li>
            <li>It smells like an old lady&#x27;s perfume.</li>
            <li>Did not hold as well as expected &amp; had too much perfume for me.</li>
            <li>Kind of a weird musky type smell.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even spray that much, but as soon as I got in the car, my husband had to roll the window down.</li>
            <li>I have really thin, fine hair</li>

            <li> I use other products in this line and I love them, just a weird smell here.</li>
            <li> it actually holds well without making your head feel like helmet, and it smells kind of like baby powder, which is much nicer than nasty hairspray smell</li>
            <li> It is so much more expensive everywhere else!</li>
            <li> so i will continue to purchase as long as they have it!!</li>
            <li> Stop paying huge prices for a product that does the job much less expensive.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for big hair or heavy hair.</li>
            <li> Other than that I like it.</li>
            <li> it smells weird at first  </li>
            <li> so I needed a hairspray that wouldn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> I have bought this in the past and the odor/perfume was minimal.</li>
            <li> Does not make my curls stiff or rigid.</li>
            <li> It holds well, without being stiff and make you feel like &amp;#34;helmet hair.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> This spray is not a strong holding spray.</li>
            <li> I dont usually do reviews but on this i had to cause ive used ALOT of diff hairsprays in all price ranges....</li>
            <li> Small amount does the trick.</li>
            <li> It clogged after only a few uses and was very difficult to unclog.</li>
            <li> I hate to throw away a brand new can of hairspray, but I just don&#x27;t think I can deal with the smell of this stuff</li>
            <li> so I need a spray that has serious hold, but I don&#x27;t want my hair to feel or look like it&#x27;s glued either.  </li>
            <li> This hairspray is awful and does absolutely nothing for my hair... plus, it stinks!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this hair spray.</li>
            <li> worst part is I cant even return it, since amazon doesnt permit return of flammable items.</li>
            <li> The worst thing about this spray is the smell.</li>
            <li> I think it smells terrible!  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> This hair spray is great because it is very flexible and leaves my hair shinny and smelling great. I recommend this but not if you need a strong hold.</li>
            <li> Ruined my hair, I had to wash it multiple times to get the stuff out. Dont buy this.&lt;br /&gt;The worst part is I cant even return it, since amazon doesnt permit return of flammable items.</li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCT WILL ORDER AGAIN</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and liked it then. Had a discontinued status at the store level and I tried to find another spray I like nothing like it.  I found this product again at Amazon and was thrilled.  I like the way it treats my hair.  It leaves my hair truly soft and the spray becomes invisible both in appearance and hold.  It has a strong smell when applied but that disappears within minutes.  I really really like how this spray works and looks. No sticky build up.  I plan on stocking up!</li>
            <li> I have really thin, fine hair so I need a spray that has serious hold, but I don&#x27;t want my hair to feel or look like it&#x27;s glued either.  This spray has just the right amount of hold, and it smells really, really good.  More than once I&#x27;ve been told I smell good, and it&#x27;s the hairspray!  Most importantly, the price is outstanding.</li>
            <li> i love this spray! Comes out even and fine. Does not make my curls stiff or rigid. Perfect bounce and frizz control!</li>
            <li> This is a very good hair spray for a reasonable price.  It holds well, without being stiff and make you feel like &amp;#34;helmet hair.&amp;#34;  Stop paying huge prices for a product that does the job much less expensive.</li>
            <li> I like the price but does not have a scent for a man. The quality is fine. I wanted it for the shine.</li>
            <li> I have bought this in the past and the odor/perfume was minimal. They have changed it and the smell is offensive--really strong and stayed on my hair until I washed it.&lt;br /&gt;Should have some sort of label to warn customers that if they don&#x27;t want to offend people who come close--or themselves--to avoid.</li>
            <li> The hairspray works just fine, but I find it has a weird smell. I am pretty sensitive to smell so this may not bother others, but I will probably not purchase again. I use other products in this line and I love them, just a weird smell here.</li>
            <li> This hairspray gives GREAT hold which I love but is still flexible, so my hair is not stiff.&lt;br /&gt;And, the neat thing.....it smells like baby powder!!!</li>
            <li> I dont usually do reviews but on this i had to cause ive used ALOT of diff hairsprays in all price ranges....This one is a winner for me!! Smells good to me and holds my hair ALL day long!! With my very fine hair thats amazing for me so i will continue to purchase as long as they have it!!</li>
            <li> This spray is not a strong holding spray. The worst thing about this spray is the smell. Kind of a weird musky type smell. I will definitely not be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> Long lasting hold, volume, and shine. Plus it smells really nice, I love it! My new favorite hairspray :) .</li>
            <li> I love the way this hairspray smells. I do not require a strong hold so it works nicely for me.</li>
            <li> This hairspray really does hold pretty well.  And that&#x27;s saying something, my hair never holds. However, it doesn&#x27;t smell very nice in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this hair spray. It clogged after only a few uses and was very difficult to unclog. I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I am surprised to hear so many of you LIKE the smell of this hairspray.  I think it smells terrible!  I have to hold my breath while I spray it.  The scent seems to linger.  I hate to throw away a brand new can of hairspray, but I just don&#x27;t think I can deal with the smell of this stuff any longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to hold well, so I do think the quality is good.</li>
            <li> I have super fine hair so I needed a hairspray that wouldn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. This hairspray is so light but dries super quickly and doesn&#x27;t smell strongly. It&#x27;s so light that it doesn&#x27;t look like you have hair spray on. Will definitely buy again. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for big hair or heavy hair.</li>
            <li> I ran out of my go-to hair spray and thought I&#x27;d try something new. I have curly hair and like a good hairspray to keep the fly-aways down. Not only were my fly-aways sticking back up after 20 mins, but I&#x27;m actually getting nauseous from the smell. I can&#x27;t stand it! It smells like an old lady&#x27;s perfume. I didn&#x27;t even spray that much, but as soon as I got in the car, my husband had to roll the window down. Won&#x27;t be using the rest of the can.</li>
            <li> great product, nice hold</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what people are talking about it smells great and holds well. Obviously wont hold as well as a 20$ bottle of hairspray but it does work pretty well! I really like the smell of it too.</li>
            <li> Great hold , brush able  no strong oders that can linger. Makes my hair shiny and bouncy. Love all dove products</li>
            <li> Container aerosol spray works well 1/3 of the way and then it fizzels out.</li>
            <li> smells amazing and works even better! the people complaining about the smell are being babies!! amazing hairspray ill buy more when i run out (:</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray, and buying it on Amazon is the only way to go. It is so much more expensive everywhere else! It smells like fresh powder, and holds REALLY well.</li>
            <li> smells amazing, hold is not so great.</li>
            <li> I just love Dove hair spray!  It has a nice scent and gives my gray hair a luster.  I would certainly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I just got a shipment of 7 containers of the hairspray.  The packaging consisted of throwing 7 bottles in the box and adding one piece of crumpled paper.  Every lid had been knocked off their container.  Two lids were shattered.  The interior of the box was soaked with hairspray.  On the positive side, I am sure that the UPS truck smells good.  The product (or what is left of it) is fine.  Packaging is a big problem and the product cannot be returned (flammable).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really strong and works pretty good. You really shouldn&#x27;t try to brush your hair soon after spraying it. Wait a while.</li>
            <li> i love this hairspray. it actually holds well without making your head feel like helmet, and it smells kind of like baby powder, which is much nicer than nasty hairspray smell</li>
            <li> This hairspray is awful and does absolutely nothing for my hair... plus, it stinks!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring back the old formula, it was perfect!</li>
            <li> This is great for when I put my hair in a ponytail, and I don&#x27;t want a single strand poking out from anywhere. When  I spray my hair, my scalp feels weird at first, then my scalp turns normal. Other than that I like it.</li>
            <li> I like Dove products. I use the body lotion,body wash and hair spray,find them all very&lt;br /&gt;good. Good for your skin and easy for you to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> Will not order again as it leaves the hair brittle.</li>
            <li> it smells weird at first  but then it smells softer like vanilla.it hardens your hair if you dont brush it or rub it in but it does not flake</li>
            <li> Small amount does the trick. I over did it at first and it make my scalp itch a bit. Overall, good product.</li>
            <li> Did not hold as well as expected &amp; had too much perfume for me. I don&#x27;t like fragrance free BTW.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the hold that this spray gives me.  I would order it again next time I need spray.</li>
