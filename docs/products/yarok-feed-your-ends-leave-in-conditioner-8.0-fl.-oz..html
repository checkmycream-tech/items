            <li>This is a good product, lots of great stuff in it that is helping to make my hair super soft.</li>
            <li>Super satisfied!</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and wanted a heat protector free of alcohol, parabens, sulfates and silicones,  </li>
            <li>My hair is clean and shiney And feels naturally healthy.</li>
            <li>Its works just fine for my oily scalp and fine hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sticky and it&#x27;s silicone free which my curly hair LOVES.</li>
            <li>My hair look so great now, only after 1 month of application.</li>
            <li>This is fabulous leave in conditioner, I have used it for a couple of years and it leaves my hair ultra shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>Every oil has a smoke point (the point at which the oil begins to burn), the primary ingredient in this protector is grapeseed oil which has a smoke point beyond 450F, therefor it will not burn or burn your hair unless it is warmed to temperatures beyond it&#x27;s max smoke point.  </li>
            <li>It smells great and doesn&#x27;t have any irritants or cancer causing ingredients like so many other products on the market.</li>
            <li>It smoothes over my ends, has a pleasant smell, and I&#x27;m a big fan of the all natural and good for my hair ingredients.</li>
            <li>I love this product and saw results to the ends of my hair the day after I used it for the first time.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my ends healthy for much longer!</li>
            <li>Had no issues and was worth the money!</li>
            <li>Their whole line smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>The bottom line for me is this product meets all my requirements of environmental  safe and no unhealthy  chemical  compounds.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes my hair without weighing it down, which is great for the summer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and the scent for the most part is fine, but sometimes my nose has registered it as slightly musty.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; reminds me of ginger and is quite strong and put me off initially, but I&#x27;m glad I decided to keep using it.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients are pure, all-natural, 100% vegan, free of alcohol, paraben &amp; sulfates.  </li>
            <li>This is fine if I&#x27;ve already used a conditioner in the shower, but at least for my hair, does not work great as a standalone conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love that all of the ingredients are all natural.</li>
            <li>I love how clean (and short!)</li>
            <li>Not to mention it is a pure product and doesn&#x27;t have any chemicals!  </li>
            <li>By far the best conditioner for thin damaged hair.</li>
            <li>Everyone compliments how my hair smells, as it&#x27;s slightly different to your standard hair product scent - in a good way.</li>
            <li>The feel of this product is extremely light and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair at all.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft, looks super silky, lays neatly without frizz and smells divine.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair super soft, shiny, manageable, and not greasy whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>I would rate this as 3 - 4 because of value; it does not have the fullness or foundation of a &amp;#34;leave in conditioner&amp;#34; that pure oils do</li>
            <li>The smell is very earthy.</li>
            <li>still much prefer Davines all-in-one leave in milk.</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>I like the ingredients in this and the sent smells fresh/natural, but it doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and that it has only natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I mainly like a leave-in conditioner to help de-tangle my hair, but his product doesn&#x27;t de-tangle at all.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend to anyone looking to go the organic route with hair products.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I enjoy this product on my wet hair before blow drying.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t quite mastered the whole natural hair care routine yet</li>
            <li>I blow dry and flat iron my hair every time it&#x27;s washed and it stays so healthy with no split ends.</li>
            <li>It refreshes your hair and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair .</li>
            <li>I use this every time I get out of the shower and my hair feels completely rejuvenated!</li>
            <li>I have really curly, fine yet thick, dense hair</li>
            <li>The only downside for me is that I think it makes my hair look rather piecey and oily if I use too much.</li>
            <li>so far I like the results.</li>
            <li>Hair feels soft but without the feel of product in your hair.  </li>
            <li>Love the ingredients, I actually refill this with water and essential oils when I only have a third left.</li>
            <li>I have a combo of straight/thin and slightly thicker/textured hair, so this might just not be the right leave-in conditioner for my hair.</li>
            <li>As far as the naysayers who bring up the concern of &amp;#34;cooking your hair&amp;#34;, simply put they are misinformed....  </li>
            <li>I have had really bad hair since I arrived in my new home, as apparently water is not that good here.</li>
            <li>So far my hair is soft and less frizzy.  </li>

            <li> So far my hair is soft and less frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Will definitely be trying out other Yarok products in the future!</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t think it will work for very dry hair .</li>
            <li> Spray it on wet hair, before blow-drying, to detangle, to protect it from heat &amp; to add shine.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product a few times.  </li>
            <li> so that might also be due to other methods.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use and try other Yarok products as well.</li>
            <li> I have received numerous compliments on my hair lately</li>
            <li> I stopped shampooing my hair a month ago(only conditioning it with Feed Your Volume Condiitoner) and use this product everyday.</li>
            <li> It stops the frizz in its tracks(my hair is curly, coarse and thin) and adds volume as well.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are an added bonus with nothing harsh that would damage rather than cleanse.  </li>
            <li> I have had a chance to use the product a few rimes and</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have any weird smell and its a natural organic product</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at first because the thought of using oil in my hair made me think my hair was going to greasy, so not true!  </li>
            <li> They would leave my hair stiff &amp; sticky.  </li>
            <li> My only issue  is it is expensive  </li>
            <li> I received a small bottle of this in my Petit Vour monthly box subscription.  </li>
            <li> I never liked spray-on products.  </li>
            <li> The product is a little expensive</li>
            <li> When I purchased this leave-in-conditioner, I was skeptical and unsure it would work.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed by the results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it, but not particularly impressed by it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product makes my wavy/curly hair hydrated and smelling great. It adds shine as well! Super satisfied!</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product on my wet hair before blow drying. It not only helps detangle but also protect from heat. Would highly recommend to anyone looking to go the organic route with hair products.</li>
            <li> Love the ingredients, I actually refill this with water and essential oils when I only have a third left. I would rate this as 3 - 4 because of value; it does not have the fullness or foundation of a &amp;#34;leave in conditioner&amp;#34; that pure oils do but it does contribute to hair health / protection.</li>
            <li> This conditioner definitely does its job in terms of detangling! It smoothes over my ends, has a pleasant smell, and I&#x27;m a big fan of the all natural and good for my hair ingredients. The only downside for me is that I think it makes my hair look rather piecey and oily if I use too much. I haven&#x27;t quite mastered the whole natural hair care routine yet so that might also be due to other methods. Will definitely be trying out other Yarok products in the future!</li>
            <li> This leave-in smells amazing and the scent is long-lasting.  It moisturizes my hair without weighing it down, which is great for the summer.  I love that I don&#x27;t have to worry about the ingredients too!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I discovered it in a subscription box and the smell is what captured me the most. My hair smells amazing with this in it. It&#x27;s not sticky and it&#x27;s silicone free which my curly hair LOVES.</li>
            <li> I stopped shampooing my hair a month ago(only conditioning it with Feed Your Volume Condiitoner) and use this product everyday. It stops the frizz in its tracks(my hair is curly, coarse and thin) and adds volume as well. Their whole line smells fantastic! I also appreciate that they do NOT test on animals and all products are vegan!!</li>
            <li> I love this product and saw results to the ends of my hair the day after I used it for the first time.  When I purchased this leave-in-conditioner, I was skeptical and unsure it would work.  The &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; reminds me of ginger and is quite strong and put me off initially, but I&#x27;m glad I decided to keep using it.  When I set my hair, Yarok is part of the routine.  It adds shine and does an excellent job protecting my hair from the heat.  I will continue to purchase this superb all natural conditioner.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it, but not particularly impressed by it. It&#x27;s very light and the scent for the most part is fine, but sometimes my nose has registered it as slightly musty. I have a combo of straight/thin and slightly thicker/textured hair, so this might just not be the right leave-in conditioner for my hair. My hair also tends to be on the dryer side, so I almost always also use a leave in conditioner. This is fine if I&#x27;ve already used a conditioner in the shower, but at least for my hair, does not work great as a standalone conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have had really bad hair since I arrived in my new home, as apparently water is not that good here. I have tried all sort of things but finally found it when I bought the Yarok shampoo and the Yarok leave in conditioner. My hair look so great now, only after 1 month of application. The texture is crazily better, their look is awesome, they are soft and look so healthy. I will never change again and have been advising it to all my girlfriends !</li>
            <li> I love this product. It keeps my ends healthy for much longer!</li>
            <li> By far the best conditioner for thin damaged hair. I use this every time I get out of the shower and my hair feels completely rejuvenated! The ingredients are an added bonus with nothing harsh that would damage rather than cleanse.  The smell is very earthy. Definitely a must in your hair routine!</li>
            <li> Favorite pre-styling product! LOVE it.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, lots of great stuff in it that is helping to make my hair super soft. The smell is somewhat neutral... not my fave, but it&#x27;s still turnign out to be some good stuff.</li>
            <li> I have done the research and completed the &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; challenge.  The bottom line for me is this product meets all my requirements of environmental  safe and no unhealthy  chemical  compounds. I have had a chance to use the product a few rimes and so far I like the results. My hair is clean and shiney And feels naturally healthy. My only issue  is it is expensive  which is very limiting a wonderful product like this should be more affordable for all.</li>
            <li> I love how clean (and short!) the list of ingredients are for this leave-in. Everyone compliments how my hair smells, as it&#x27;s slightly different to your standard hair product scent - in a good way. I&#x27;ll admit I panicked a bit when I was running out. I&#x27;m hooked...</li>
            <li> Meh. Not impressed by the results. But I am impressed by the pure ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I still much prefer Davines all-in-one leave in milk. But this is purer...so, you decide!</li>
            <li> I never liked spray-on products.  They would leave my hair stiff &amp; sticky.  But, I luv Yarok&#x27;s FEED YOUR ENDS leave-in conditioner!!!  The ingredients are pure, all-natural, 100% vegan, free of alcohol, paraben &amp; sulfates.  Spray it on wet hair, before blow-drying, to detangle, to protect it from heat &amp; to add shine.</li>
            <li> The product is a little expensive but I love the good ingredients and it works great!</li>
            <li> I have only used this product a few times.  I love the smell and that it has only natural ingredients.  No chemicals.  So far my hair is soft and less frizzy.  I will continue to use and try other Yarok products as well.</li>
            <li> I received a small bottle of this in my Petit Vour monthly box subscription.  This stuff is amazing. My hair feels so soft, looks super silky, lays neatly without frizz and smells divine.  I ordered the giant bottle and will continue to use this every time I wash my hair.  I haven&#x27;t tried the shampoo or condition yet but when I run out of my current stuff I will!</li>
            <li> When I decided to grow my hair out I knew I needed to take really good care of it and this product has been an essential part of that goal. I blow dry and flat iron my hair every time it&#x27;s washed and it stays so healthy with no split ends. The feel of this product is extremely light and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair at all. I&#x27;ve bought this over and over again.</li>
            <li> Really? Thought this sounded wonderful, but it did NOTHING for my hair at all. Doesn&#x27;t really smell all that great either.&lt;br /&gt;Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I like the ingredients in this and the sent smells fresh/natural, but it doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair. I mainly like a leave-in conditioner to help de-tangle my hair, but his product doesn&#x27;t de-tangle at all. I put a bunch of the spray all over my hair and I am not even sure why, because it doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything. I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> This product does an excellent job of detangling my hair after the shower.  It smells great and feels good on my hair.  Not to mention it is a pure product and doesn&#x27;t have any chemicals!  I will order again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay product . It refreshes your hair and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair . But I don&#x27;t think it will work for very dry hair . Its works just fine for my oily scalp and fine hair. It doesn&#x27;t have any weird smell and its a natural organic product so you are no harming your hair .</li>
            <li> Provides enough moisture for my curly hair without being too greasy.</li>
            <li> This leave in conditioner is great to detangle hair after shampooing.  It smells great and doesn&#x27;t have any irritants or cancer causing ingredients like so many other products on the market.</li>
            <li> use this EVERY day.  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> This is fabulous leave in conditioner, I have used it for a couple of years and it leaves my hair ultra shiny and smooth. Perfect product for my hair.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. Excellent shipping.</li>
            <li> I love this brand and the heat protector.  I have very fine hair and wanted a heat protector free of alcohol, parabens, sulfates and silicones,  I was very skeptical at first because the thought of using oil in my hair made me think my hair was going to greasy, so not true!  I have found through trial and error that you have to apply this spray liberally and allow it to soak for about 5 minutes before blow drying.  It leaves my hair super soft, shiny, manageable, and not greasy whatsoever.  I have received numerous compliments on my hair lately (I&#x27;m a guy) and contribute it to this product.  As far as the naysayers who bring up the concern of &amp;#34;cooking your hair&amp;#34;, simply put they are misinformed....  Every oil has a smoke point (the point at which the oil begins to burn), the primary ingredient in this protector is grapeseed oil which has a smoke point beyond 450F, therefor it will not burn or burn your hair unless it is warmed to temperatures beyond it&#x27;s max smoke point.  Wonderful product.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Bought this with the shampoo and conditioner. Had no issues and was worth the money!</li>
            <li> I have really curly, fine yet thick, dense hair and this does the trick.  I love that all of the ingredients are all natural. You can tell by the wonderful smell that there are no chemicals in the product.  Hair feels soft but without the feel of product in your hair.  Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for making such a great product for all hair types!</li>
