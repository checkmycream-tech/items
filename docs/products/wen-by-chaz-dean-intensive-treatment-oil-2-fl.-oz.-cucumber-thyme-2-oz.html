    <ol>
            <li>so I think it will be the perfect combination.</li>
            <li>Works great</li>
            <li>This product is great for my hair.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>I love it!!</li>
            <li>If you want an oil that would cause your hair to stink, I would get this one; if you want a product a product that would work great for your and make your hair smell good, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li>On gives the sunny look to my hair, strong smell like it for summer reason, as anti frizz is perfect</li>
            <li>Although I hope it works better than it smells!</li>
            <li>Happy this is a true WEN product!</li>
            <li>Amazing treatment.  </li>
            <li>Thought it would be more cucumber than Thyme, but work wise</li>
            <li>I can say that the aloe/cucumber smells nice, and you are supposed to be able to use the treatment oil all over your body, but I&#x27;m reluctant to do that because of my experience.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do anything for my skin, just OK...</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Semis one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li>Love all Wen products, love the treatment oils.</li>
            <li>love Wen products...</li>
            <li>so many people try to get me to switch to Aveda...</li>
            <li>Wen is simply the best product on the market I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It does have an amazing herbal clean fragrance.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how strong it was until my mom said that the stench woke her up and caused her stomach to turn</li>
            <li>have fine waist length hair</li>
            <li>Love the fresh cucumber (which is the dominating) scent.  </li>
            <li>It is a fantastic product that is priced well also.</li>
            <li>and this was too strong to use full strength</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use oil on my hair, and I was more interested in this Cucumber Thyme product for my skin care.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t finished using bottle so cant give a full review.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair super shiny.</li>
            <li>My daughter uses it and she has very thick wavy hair... works perfectly on both hair types.</li>
            <li>Definately more a heavy thyme smell than the cleaner cucumber I would have liked.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, shiney, and so easy to style now after ONE use.</li>
            <li>I should have read the reviews a little bit more carefully next time as more people use the WEN products as an oil for their hair.  </li>
            <li>I tried this product for the first time, and it has completely changed my hair!!</li>
            <li>It took some experimentation to figure out how much to use.</li>
            <li>Ok to tame frizzys but find using WEN cleansing conditioner as a leave - in works  just as well.</li>
            <li>You only need a tiny, tiny amount and the fragrance is very strong.  </li>
            <li>All natural and not harmful to your hair.</li>
            <li>It really helped my dry ends.</li>
            <li>This makes my hair very soft, but be careful to only put it on the ends.  </li>

            <li> ... dried out my hair...  </li>
            <li> This week I&#x27;m mixing a few drops with coconut oil, which I then use as a moisturizer and in very small amounts I even rub on my hair for shine.  </li>

            <li> You only need a tiny, tiny amount and the fragrance is very strong.  This week I&#x27;m mixing a few drops with coconut oil, which I then use as a moisturizer and in very small amounts I even rub on my hair for shine.  Works great but I was sick of smelling like a coconut and this was too strong to use full strength so I think it will be the perfect combination.</li>
            <li> No noticeable difference and scent is unpleasant and lasts all day/night until you wash it out.</li>
            <li> I should have read the reviews a little bit more carefully next time as more people use the WEN products as an oil for their hair.  I don&#x27;t use oil on my hair, and I was more interested in this Cucumber Thyme product for my skin care.  It is a bit disappointing in this regard.  It doesn&#x27;t do anything for my skin, just OK...</li>
            <li> It is oil, so use sparingly, however, I now use it mixed with apre-shampoo hair products and in my bath.  Love the fresh cucumber (which is the dominating) scent.  It is a fantastic product that is priced well also.</li>
            <li> I had to stop all of the WEN products because my scalp and upper body started to itch and break out after a week of use.  I can say that the aloe/cucumber smells nice, and you are supposed to be able to use the treatment oil all over your body, but I&#x27;m reluctant to do that because of my experience.  I&#x27;ve considered using it as aromatherapy, though, on cotton or potpourri.</li>
            <li> This product is great for my hair. It made it smoother. However, when I opened it up, it had an odor that stunk so bad I thought somebody died. I didn&#x27;t realize how strong it was until my mom said that the stench woke her up and caused her stomach to turn (she was in the other room asleep). If you want an oil that would cause your hair to stink, I would get this one; if you want a product a product that would work great for your and make your hair smell good, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is actual WEN. This dried out my hair.</li>
            <li> On gives the sunny look to my hair, strong smell like it for summer reason, as anti frizz is perfect</li>
            <li> I tried this product for the first time, and it has completely changed my hair!! I love it!! My hair is soft, shiney, and so easy to style now after ONE use. I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t order this - my teenagers say it spells really bad</li>
            <li> Love it.Just as described. Makes my hair super shiny. Semis one of my favorite products. All natural and not harmful to your hair.</li>
            <li> Love all Wen products, love the treatment oils. This does work wonders, not too crazy on the smell of this one. Thought it would be more cucumber than Thyme, but work wise it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> Amazing treatment.  This makes my hair very soft, but be careful to only put it on the ends.  I have no idea who typed up the label but whoever did should realize that the font is so tiny it is unreadable!  (I didn&#x27;t even know fonts came that small!)&lt;br /&gt;I love Wen products... so many people try to get me to switch to Aveda... tried it... dried out my hair...  Wen is simply the best product on the market I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I have fine waist length hair, I color, I do not blow dry.  My daughter uses it and she has very thick wavy hair... works perfectly on both hair types.</li>
            <li> It took some experimentation to figure out how much to use. It really helped my dry ends. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t finished using bottle so cant give a full review.  Although I hope it works better than it smells! Its not greasy which I like.</li>
            <li> Happy this is a true WEN product! Enough said!</li>
            <li> Ok to tame frizzys but find using WEN cleansing conditioner as a leave - in works  just as well. It does have an amazing herbal clean fragrance.</li>
            <li> Definately more a heavy thyme smell than the cleaner cucumber I would have liked.</li>
