            <li>Good, cheap outdoorsy type cologne.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of Aspen, and this is an EXCELLENT buy for this normally overpriced cologne.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to find a cologne moderately priced with a great scent!  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for another great cologne at a great price, my actual favorite (and my fiancee&#x27;s favorite)</li>
            <li>great my wife said her favorite when it first came out.  </li>
            <li>Those cologne has a nice smell, but is easy to forget.</li>
            <li>Nice bottle and easy to use.</li>
            <li>, i just bought 2 more 4</li>
            <li>Love it :~)</li>
            <li>Aspen has been a favorite of mine for some time now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received many compliments about the cologne.</li>
            <li>I have used this for many years.  </li>
            <li>This has always been one of my favorites and at such a great price!!</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s his favorite scent)</li>
            <li>Love to order from Amazon.</li>
            <li>This is my husband&#x27;s favorite fragrance and mine as well.</li>
            <li>Makes just want to kiss him all over :)</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the way this stuff smells.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my daughter who wanted to surprise her boyfriend with his favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>The price was fantastic!</li>
            <li>If these are colognes you like then I think it&#x27;s safe to say try something else.</li>
            <li>All of the reviewers saying this is a great buy for the money are delusional, really really delusional.  </li>
            <li>but I wore this cologne 5 or 6 days a week for many years.</li>
            <li>So many fond memories</li>
            <li>and I will always Like These 2 better</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>This is my husbands favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>When I can get it as reasonably priced as you sell it for I am a happy buyer.</li>
            <li>U get what u pay for..or pay more</li>
            <li>Love the spritzer, my husband loves this scent.</li>
            <li>I really do love this scent.  </li>
            <li>The females enjoy it too, but I would use it even if nobody else liked it.  </li>
            <li>My husband gets so many compliments each time he wears it.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and great gift</li>
            <li>My husband love it, it&#x27;s always one of his favorite.</li>
            <li>I see many reviews of colognes expressing concerns about copies or knockoffs.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s smell does not stay more than 5 to 10 minutes</li>
            <li>Definitely a more manly smell, wouldn&#x27;t recommend for someone who likes a sweeter cologne.</li>
            <li>Not terrible but not my stlye.</li>
            <li>it is okay.</li>
            <li>I have ordered many times before and there is no stopping me now.  </li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>this was a total excellent experience!</li>
            <li>Love this cologne.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and my fiance love the smell and is there Aspen shampoo</li>
            <li>But this deal is much better than I ever found in the stores, even the after Christmas sales at drug stores</li>
            <li>It is quite disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;There are better choices even at this price range</li>
            <li>pleased with this cologne</li>
            <li>My favorite cologne.  </li>
            <li>so i could get more sooner</li>
            <li>I still love the scent after all these years.</li>
            <li>Perhaps most telling, none of my girlfriends have ever asked me to change it.  </li>
            <li>More piney than CW.</li>
            <li>Coty love to know many years.</li>
            <li>Still love the smell of Cologne.</li>
            <li>The cost is okay, too.</li>
            <li>So glad I found it on line</li>
            <li>Aspen by Coty for men has been one of my all time favorite colognes for quite some time.  </li>
            <li>I am glad that I didn&#x27;t buy both at once...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this Cologne for more than 15 years.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have gotten many complements on the scent.</li>
            <li>So glad that Amazon can carry all the things I like.  </li>
            <li>Interesting scent.</li>
            <li>Awesome price for such a big bottle of an awesome cologne.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my boyfriend to try, because it is one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li>Love when my husband wears this.</li>
            <li>He always comes and reports that he get many compliments on the smell.  </li>
            <li>, the scent is very strong, maybe too strong.</li>
            <li>It smells much more pine scented than GIT but for the price is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Very fast delivery and a good smell.</li>
            <li>It has a distinct smell, kind of PineSol-ish, if that makes sense, but much more appealing.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is good and consistent and the bottles don&#x27;t leak....</li>
            <li>good for a crisp aroma</li>
            <li>just there be for you not for teenagers trying to find that right cologne but its a good light but strong smell</li>
            <li>Old school, but smells great...</li>
            <li>Very pleased  First time I ordered  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good but not too much, cause</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping &amp; great price.</li>
            <li>Aspen is a very nice cologne,it has a masculine scent yet isn&#x27;t overbearing.</li>
            <li>I love Amazon&#x27;s free super saving shipping!  </li>
            <li>Not a bad investment!</li>
            <li>Great everyday cologne at a good price.</li>
            <li>so refreshing and brisk clean smell.</li>
            <li>but is not that strong..</li>
            <li>This cologne is strong.</li>
            <li>I find it too strong on my skin and it gives me a headache</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong...</li>
            <li>Aspen has a strong scent,last all day even when I sweat,great price,this is one cologne</li>
            <li>not too strong and lasts well.</li>
            <li>do have to agree as some have mentioned, it is a strong cologne if you over use it.</li>
            <li>but it might be too strong for some occasions.</li>
            <li>When it is going though I have got some pretty nice compliments from it.</li>
            <li>ladies didn&#x27;t love it as much as Lucky You or Chrome,</li>
            <li>Thank you for making it available at such an amazing price!  :)</li>
            <li>Its a great cheap colonge...smells very good but dosent last long at all..</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed a cheap, good-smelling cologne....</li>
            <li>Even at that age I knew this was a cheap cologne.</li>
            <li>He had a great statement about cologne &#x27;either it be one scent or several in choice,a cologne should reflect a man&#x27;s persona without him requiring to speak&#x27;.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s light...</li>
            <li>This seems to be the genuine scent as I remember it.</li>
            <li>He enjoyed the fresh pine mountain scent.  </li>
            <li>This cologne smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of Aspen and the price makes it even more appealing.  </li>
            <li>Outstanding Price, Fast shipper, will do business again with them!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks You :-)</li>
            <li>The price was very good, under $10, and was extremely well packaged, had some concerns about ordering a bottle and how it would arrive, but not a problem.</li>
            <li>Any place that i go people ask me what kind of perfume it is due to smell really good</li>
            <li>The original aspen i&#x27;ve been wearing for over 10 years.</li>
            <li>So not disappointed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Clarity is probably the best description I can give for this very green fragrance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just clean and almost soapy smelling.</li>
            <li>$12 is a fair price for this nice green piny smelling cologne.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend uses this cologne for his &amp;#34;everyday cologne&amp;#34; because it has a good scent and is more affordable then other products like Polo.</li>
            <li>i still remember the smell, i found it on amazon, i wasnt sure if this was the real thing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a closer match to GIT than Cool Water.</li>
            <li>This cologne is SUSPICIOUSLY identical to Davidoff Cool Water.  </li>
            <li>good price compared to local stores.</li>
            <li>Hope he likes it as much as I do. :)</li>
            <li>My girlfriend loved it back then.</li>
            <li>I actually think this product is good, I gave it 1 star because I bought it at a lower price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, not too much.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still a nice masculine fragrance.</li>
            <li>For the price, this is not a bad spray.</li>
            <li>Not too overpowering, spells fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I ordered through Amazon, and had it in no time-and the price was much better than I would have normally paid, as well.  </li>
            <li>Although the price seems very attractive, this was not a good</li>
            <li>My son liked it so much that it instantly became his favorite.</li>
            <li>good old classic like it</li>
            <li>superior sillage and long life makes this a winner!</li>
            <li>This is a great everyday scent.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice, fresh, lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li>I have used this cologne for over 20 years, and it is by far, my wife&#x27;s favorite.  </li>
            <li>the same nice fragrance and well worth for its price.</li>
            <li>so they smell just as fresh.</li>
            <li>worth the price.</li>
            <li>I use this pretty much every time I go out, and people certainly like it. :)</li>
            <li>Brings back good memories in High school.</li>
            <li>Just right, not too feminine, not to manly off putting.</li>
            <li>My order and evrything was right on time.</li>
            <li>Clean scent that lasts and very affordable.  </li>
            <li>It is the ultimate precursor to Cool Water and quite frankly, Aspen is the better pick...</li>
            <li>Big bottle for a cheap price and quickly became my new favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>Smells very light and sweet, almost mountainy, and the smell lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>it smell as good as more expensive colognes such as Armani Code (I own), Jean Paul Gaultier&#x27;s Le Male (I own), or others?  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t say this cologne will make you turn up your nose to the classic Polo Original EDT.But</li>
            <li>Unlike many other scents it doesn&#x27;t come off too cloying or strong and isn&#x27;t nauseating.</li>
            <li>Arrived very fast, packed well.</li>
            <li>Smells like creeds green irish tweed for cheap!!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always hard to describe a fragrance, so you&#x27;ll have to trust me on this one - this stuff smells great.  </li>
            <li>I use to wear this  cologne in the early 90&#x27;s to high school and chicks love wen</li>
            <li>The product has been around for many years for obvious reasons.</li>
            <li>THIS PURCHASE WAS FOR MY HUSBAND AND SOME MIGHT THINK IT&#x27;S CHEAP OR FOR OLD MEN</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have bought it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Please make sure these are inspected in the future.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never forget my first bottle of Aspen...</li>
            <li>My brother wore it before me, and i fell in love instantly</li>
            <li>My favorite cologne of all time especially on a guy.  </li>
            <li>The smell sticks pretty well throughout the day</li>
            <li>Exactly what we needed.</li>
            <li>This was the cologne that my boyfriend used to wear when we first met.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I am using the same cologne through out and love it.  </li>
            <li>I wear it to work regularly and have received many compliments.  </li>
            <li>Got exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I still use even when she passed awayin02010,were married 45 years</li>
            <li>It is literally good smelling all year round in my opinion.</li>
            <li>For the price, quantity, and quality it is good to use as an everyday scent.</li>
            <li>THANKS AMAZON FOR THE SUPER FAST SHIPPING.</li>
            <li>In addition, it is a slightly more unique scent than the average fist pumping clubbers are wearing out every night.</li>
            <li>I wear it on my work clothes and always get positive responses.  </li>
            <li>But on the positive note it is alot of colgne.</li>
            <li>To my surprise, not only does this cologne smell cheap, but it also lacks the true nature remnants that I have become used to in products such as HUGO Boss, Aqua Di Gio, and Cool Water.</li>
            <li>he likes something mild and masculine and Aspen is the one...</li>
            <li>I got the large spray for $17.00.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend ;-)</li>
            <li>this made a very gud b&#x27;day gift for my husband..</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too</li>
            <li>This is for the guy who wants that smell like your father use to have growing up as a kid</li>
            <li>I was really hoping this would smell like those &amp;#34;Black Ice&amp;#34; car freshner &#x27;trees&#x27;, but in my opinion, it just doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>i really don&#x27;t like the smell</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much cheaper here then in the store.</li>
            <li>I like this product after shower and really like it.  </li>
            <li>The seller was very prompt with my order.</li>
            <li>One thing I must say about Aspen Cologne is that it&#x27;s reasonably priced for it&#x27;s quality in scent.</li>
            <li>She loves it so much anything else sitting on the vanity for that &#x27;change of pace&#x27; gets put in the cabinet underneath...except for the Aspen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sell this product very expensinve.</li>
            <li>I like the scent, very woodsy.</li>
            <li>this fragrance, as I expected more of an &amp;#34;evergreen&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;green&amp;#34</li>
            <li>and he really likes this cologne.</li>
            <li>,Thank you so much for being there,The Ramps</li>
            <li>unit is the largest you can buy at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Gave as gift which was appreciated.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely synthetic.</li>
            <li>But the one a got from you guys is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the quality.</li>
            <li>Thanks again: Armando Castillo.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like your grandfathers cologne either and is very affordable and lasts a reasonable time.</li>
            <li>Nice smelling cologne for everyday use.</li>
            <li>Like other reviewers, I bought this in college and for my money, it&#x27;s still my favorite cologne.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nowhere near as deep as GIT, but for 200% less money, it&#x27;s a great alternative.</li>
            <li>It has such a clean and distinctive smell.</li>
            <li>Very similar to CoolWater by Davidoff, great for young people but lasts 6 hours or less.  </li>
            <li>The top notes are out in the first few mins and then the soapy cedar kicks in.</li>
            <li>It smells great, very subtle.</li>
            <li>While it was a unbelievable evening, the pain I endured throughout this spectacular event cannot and shouldn&#x27;t be replicated.  </li>
            <li>Classic &amp;#34;guy.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I saw a lot of reviews from older men and women for this product.</li>
            <li>Most stores (if they carry the cologne), are more expensive.  </li>
            <li>is if it arrived busted and if it did that, as a Prime member I get mainly from Amazon and they take care of all issues like that</li>
            <li>, it &#x27;s CLASSIC...</li>
            <li>Now this is not a repugnant scent, but if you like a clean smelling colognes that you aren&#x27;t constantly aware that you&#x27;re wearing due to the strength of the cologne and are under the age of 50</li>
            <li>highly recommend this now classic cologne.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but since, the price has gone up because of the high ratings given.</li>
            <li>But this is the actual real stuff!!</li>
            <li>Hubby was so thankful he just love these for everyday wear</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure it does not fit this case&lt;</li>
            <li>Its refreshing but the smell doesnt last too long.</li>
            <li>I buy a cologne I expect a nice smell and at least some</li>
            <li>This seems OK, and a few others have told me they like it.</li>
            <li>I forget all of the above when I remember that I bought this for $9 and it still smells good than some of the colognes I had in the past.</li>
            <li>This is a very masculine smell.</li>
            <li>Safe bet for an everyday cologne for both old and young.  </li>
            <li>my old school Cologne!</li>
            <li>Thought i would like the cologne, some people compare to cool water, or even millesime, not really to my liking at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very fresh of green leaves and cedarwood and light in moss,very sharp in citrus and juniper.</li>
            <li>You spray it, it smells ok for a little bit, but then the aroma does not last.  </li>
            <li>is one of the items that a review is silly to do as I am happy with this product and would have no reason to not reorder in the same manner&lt;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also clearly a man&#x27;s cologne.  </li>
            <li>BUT, YOUNG MEN WEAR THIS COLOGNE</li>
            <li>The scent can last the whole day.</li>
            <li>I believe the old KISS principle pertains.  </li>
            <li>but my son (14 yrears old) does</li>
            <li>The I really like cologne thats not so age specific.</li>
            <li>so I was pleasantly surprised to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I remembered liking it, and when it popped up on a search, I was pleasantly surprised that it was still being made (I hadn&#x27;t seen it in 10 years).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just wanted to chime in and say that as a 25 year old, I have received a number of compliments on this scent.</li>
            <li>and it last a whole day.</li>
            <li>Wow, what a deal too.</li>
            <li>Young principamente recommend.</li>
            <li>It is a hardcore 80&#x27;s and early 90&#x27;s smelling cologne.</li>
            <li>Chances are that you won&#x27;t need to use that much and the scent will not fade for several hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Last I looked, it was around $15 for 3.4oz, and I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s at least as good as Code or Le Male.</li>
            <li>It don&#x27;t last as long as many more expensive colognes do</li>
            <li>/&gt;Speaking of sprays, for me usually one or two does it fine.</li>
            <li>smells nice, cheap spray, if you have never tried it you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li>as far as how long the smell lasts i really haven&#x27;t taken a look at it.</li>
            <li>Next was very unexpected, as I knew the woodsy citrus scent was heavenly, but this literally awoke the neighboring women like a pack of war wolves!</li>
            <li>Product was exactly as I expected and exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I was actually planning to order a new Davidoff, and decided to try this one out instead.  </li>
            <li>Very woodsy masculine scent, last long.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a sundry or something I use in everyday life like light bulbs, toilet paper, cereal etc</li>
            <li>Decent woody smell but only lasts for a short time before it&#x27;s gone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It brings back old memories.  </li>
            <li>It looks professional while still being low</li>
            <li>After going over all of the reviews which raved about the quality of this product, I decided to take the plunge and buy this instead of my usual Cool Water.</li>
            <li>Definitely a hit.&lt;br /&gt;It smells of Crisp Mountain Air and Wide Open Spaces!</li>
            <li>Aspen Cologne ranks as my second favorite cologne of all time behind only Minotaure.  </li>
            <li>It smells fresh and green and like a much more expensive fragrance.</li>
            <li>Other than that, decent product.</li>
            <li>plain and simple, if you&#x27;re hoping to be reminded of your amazing hiking or camping trip and the sweet scent of pine and dew among other tantalizing aromas, be wary of this product because what you&#x27;ll get is the scent of a retired lumberjack doused in overpowering cologne musk.</li>
            <li>Most places sell this perfume very weak.</li>

            <li> great my wife said her favorite when it first came out.  </li>
            <li> Those cologne has a nice smell, but is easy to forget.</li>
            <li> Nice bottle and easy to use.</li>
            <li> , i just bought 2 more 4</li>
            <li> Love it :~)</li>
            <li> Aspen has been a favorite of mine for some time now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received many compliments about the cologne.</li>
            <li> I have used this for many years.  </li>
            <li> This has always been one of my favorites and at such a great price!!</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s his favorite scent)</li>
            <li> Love to order from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite fragrance and mine as well.</li>
            <li> Makes just want to kiss him all over :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the way this stuff smells.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter who wanted to surprise her boyfriend with his favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> The price was fantastic!</li>
            <li> If these are colognes you like then I think it&#x27;s safe to say try something else.</li>
            <li> All of the reviewers saying this is a great buy for the money are delusional, really really delusional.  </li>
            <li> but I wore this cologne 5 or 6 days a week for many years.</li>
            <li> So many fond memories</li>
            <li> and I will always Like These 2 better</li>
            <li> I love the smell.</li>
            <li> This is my husbands favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> When I can get it as reasonably priced as you sell it for I am a happy buyer.</li>
            <li> U get what u pay for..or pay more</li>
            <li> Love the spritzer, my husband loves this scent.</li>
            <li> I really do love this scent.  </li>
            <li> The females enjoy it too, but I would use it even if nobody else liked it.  </li>
            <li> My husband gets so many compliments each time he wears it.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and great gift</li>
            <li> My husband love it, it&#x27;s always one of his favorite.</li>
            <li> I see many reviews of colognes expressing concerns about copies or knockoffs.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s smell does not stay more than 5 to 10 minutes</li>
            <li> Definitely a more manly smell, wouldn&#x27;t recommend for someone who likes a sweeter cologne.</li>
            <li> Not terrible but not my stlye.</li>
            <li> it is okay.</li>
            <li> I have ordered many times before and there is no stopping me now.  </li>
            <li> I really love it.</li>
            <li> this was a total excellent experience!</li>
            <li> Love this cologne.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and my fiance love the smell and is there Aspen shampoo</li>
            <li> But this deal is much better than I ever found in the stores, even the after Christmas sales at drug stores</li>
            <li> It is quite disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;There are better choices even at this price range</li>
            <li> pleased with this cologne</li>
            <li> My favorite cologne.  </li>
            <li> so i could get more sooner</li>
            <li> I still love the scent after all these years.</li>
            <li> Perhaps most telling, none of my girlfriends have ever asked me to change it.  </li>
            <li> More piney than CW.</li>
            <li> Coty love to know many years.</li>
            <li> Still love the smell of Cologne.</li>
            <li> The cost is okay, too.</li>
            <li> So glad I found it on line</li>
            <li> Aspen by Coty for men has been one of my all time favorite colognes for quite some time.  </li>
            <li> I am glad that I didn&#x27;t buy both at once...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this Cologne for more than 15 years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have gotten many complements on the scent.</li>
            <li> So glad that Amazon can carry all the things I like.  </li>
            <li> Interesting scent.</li>
            <li> Awesome price for such a big bottle of an awesome cologne.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend to try, because it is one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li> Love when my husband wears this.</li>
            <li> He always comes and reports that he get many compliments on the smell.  </li>
            <li> , the scent is very strong, maybe too strong.</li>
            <li> It smells much more pine scented than GIT but for the price is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Very fast delivery and a good smell.</li>
            <li> It has a distinct smell, kind of PineSol-ish, if that makes sense, but much more appealing.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is good and consistent and the bottles don&#x27;t leak....</li>
            <li> good for a crisp aroma</li>
            <li> just there be for you not for teenagers trying to find that right cologne but its a good light but strong smell</li>
            <li> Old school, but smells great...</li>
            <li> Very pleased  First time I ordered  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but not too much, cause</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping &amp; great price.</li>
            <li> Aspen is a very nice cologne,it has a masculine scent yet isn&#x27;t overbearing.</li>
            <li> I love Amazon&#x27;s free super saving shipping!  </li>
            <li> Not a bad investment!</li>
            <li> Great everyday cologne at a good price.</li>
            <li> so refreshing and brisk clean smell.</li>
            <li> but is not that strong..</li>
            <li> This cologne is strong.</li>
            <li> I find it too strong on my skin and it gives me a headache</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong...</li>
            <li> Aspen has a strong scent,last all day even when I sweat,great price,this is one cologne</li>
            <li> not too strong and lasts well.</li>
            <li> do have to agree as some have mentioned, it is a strong cologne if you over use it.</li>
            <li> but it might be too strong for some occasions.</li>
            <li> When it is going though I have got some pretty nice compliments from it.</li>
            <li> ladies didn&#x27;t love it as much as Lucky You or Chrome,</li>
            <li> Thank you for making it available at such an amazing price!  :)</li>
            <li> Its a great cheap colonge...smells very good but dosent last long at all..</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed a cheap, good-smelling cologne....</li>
            <li> Even at that age I knew this was a cheap cologne.</li>
            <li> He had a great statement about cologne &#x27;either it be one scent or several in choice,a cologne should reflect a man&#x27;s persona without him requiring to speak&#x27;.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s light...</li>
            <li> This seems to be the genuine scent as I remember it.</li>
            <li> He enjoyed the fresh pine mountain scent.  </li>
            <li> This cologne smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of Aspen and the price makes it even more appealing.  </li>
            <li> Outstanding Price, Fast shipper, will do business again with them!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks You :-)</li>
            <li> The price was very good, under $10, and was extremely well packaged, had some concerns about ordering a bottle and how it would arrive, but not a problem.</li>
            <li> Any place that i go people ask me what kind of perfume it is due to smell really good</li>
            <li> The original aspen i&#x27;ve been wearing for over 10 years.</li>
            <li> So not disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Clarity is probably the best description I can give for this very green fragrance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just clean and almost soapy smelling.</li>
            <li> $12 is a fair price for this nice green piny smelling cologne.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend uses this cologne for his &amp;#34;everyday cologne&amp;#34; because it has a good scent and is more affordable then other products like Polo.</li>
            <li> i still remember the smell, i found it on amazon, i wasnt sure if this was the real thing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a closer match to GIT than Cool Water.</li>
            <li> This cologne is SUSPICIOUSLY identical to Davidoff Cool Water.  </li>
            <li> good price compared to local stores.</li>
            <li> Hope he likes it as much as I do. :)</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loved it back then.</li>
            <li> I actually think this product is good, I gave it 1 star because I bought it at a lower price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, not too much.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still a nice masculine fragrance.</li>
            <li> For the price, this is not a bad spray.</li>
            <li> Not too overpowering, spells fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I ordered through Amazon, and had it in no time-and the price was much better than I would have normally paid, as well.  </li>
            <li> Although the price seems very attractive, this was not a good</li>
            <li> My son liked it so much that it instantly became his favorite.</li>
            <li> good old classic like it</li>
            <li> superior sillage and long life makes this a winner!</li>
            <li> This is a great everyday scent.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice, fresh, lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have used this cologne for over 20 years, and it is by far, my wife&#x27;s favorite.  </li>
            <li> the same nice fragrance and well worth for its price.</li>
            <li> so they smell just as fresh.</li>
            <li> worth the price.</li>
            <li> I use this pretty much every time I go out, and people certainly like it. :)</li>
            <li> Brings back good memories in High school.</li>
            <li> Just right, not too feminine, not to manly off putting.</li>
            <li> My order and evrything was right on time.</li>
            <li> Clean scent that lasts and very affordable.  </li>
            <li> It is the ultimate precursor to Cool Water and quite frankly, Aspen is the better pick...</li>
            <li> Big bottle for a cheap price and quickly became my new favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> Smells very light and sweet, almost mountainy, and the smell lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> it smell as good as more expensive colognes such as Armani Code (I own), Jean Paul Gaultier&#x27;s Le Male (I own), or others?  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say this cologne will make you turn up your nose to the classic Polo Original EDT.But</li>
            <li> Unlike many other scents it doesn&#x27;t come off too cloying or strong and isn&#x27;t nauseating.</li>
            <li> Arrived very fast, packed well.</li>
            <li> Smells like creeds green irish tweed for cheap!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always hard to describe a fragrance, so you&#x27;ll have to trust me on this one - this stuff smells great.  </li>
            <li> I use to wear this  cologne in the early 90&#x27;s to high school and chicks love wen</li>
            <li> The product has been around for many years for obvious reasons.</li>
            <li> THIS PURCHASE WAS FOR MY HUSBAND AND SOME MIGHT THINK IT&#x27;S CHEAP OR FOR OLD MEN</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have bought it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Please make sure these are inspected in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never forget my first bottle of Aspen...</li>
            <li> My brother wore it before me, and i fell in love instantly</li>
            <li> My favorite cologne of all time especially on a guy.  </li>
            <li> The smell sticks pretty well throughout the day</li>
            <li> Exactly what we needed.</li>
            <li> This was the cologne that my boyfriend used to wear when we first met.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I am using the same cologne through out and love it.  </li>
            <li> I wear it to work regularly and have received many compliments.  </li>
            <li> Got exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I still use even when she passed awayin02010,were married 45 years</li>
            <li> It is literally good smelling all year round in my opinion.</li>
            <li> For the price, quantity, and quality it is good to use as an everyday scent.</li>
            <li> THANKS AMAZON FOR THE SUPER FAST SHIPPING.</li>
            <li> In addition, it is a slightly more unique scent than the average fist pumping clubbers are wearing out every night.</li>
            <li> I wear it on my work clothes and always get positive responses.  </li>
            <li> But on the positive note it is alot of colgne.</li>
            <li> To my surprise, not only does this cologne smell cheap, but it also lacks the true nature remnants that I have become used to in products such as HUGO Boss, Aqua Di Gio, and Cool Water.</li>
            <li> he likes something mild and masculine and Aspen is the one...</li>
            <li> I got the large spray for $17.00.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend ;-)</li>
            <li> this made a very gud b&#x27;day gift for my husband..</li>
            <li> Fast shipping too</li>
            <li> This is for the guy who wants that smell like your father use to have growing up as a kid</li>
            <li> I was really hoping this would smell like those &amp;#34;Black Ice&amp;#34; car freshner &#x27;trees&#x27;, but in my opinion, it just doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> i really don&#x27;t like the smell</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s much cheaper here then in the store.</li>
            <li> I like this product after shower and really like it.  </li>
            <li> The seller was very prompt with my order.</li>
            <li> One thing I must say about Aspen Cologne is that it&#x27;s reasonably priced for it&#x27;s quality in scent.</li>
            <li> She loves it so much anything else sitting on the vanity for that &#x27;change of pace&#x27; gets put in the cabinet underneath...except for the Aspen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sell this product very expensinve.</li>
            <li> I like the scent, very woodsy.</li>
            <li> this fragrance, as I expected more of an &amp;#34;evergreen&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;green&amp;#34</li>
            <li> and he really likes this cologne.</li>
            <li> ,Thank you so much for being there,The Ramps</li>
            <li> unit is the largest you can buy at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Gave as gift which was appreciated.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely synthetic.</li>
            <li> But the one a got from you guys is the real deal.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the quality.</li>
            <li> Thanks again: Armando Castillo.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like your grandfathers cologne either and is very affordable and lasts a reasonable time.</li>
            <li> Nice smelling cologne for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I bought this in college and for my money, it&#x27;s still my favorite cologne.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nowhere near as deep as GIT, but for 200% less money, it&#x27;s a great alternative.</li>
            <li> It has such a clean and distinctive smell.</li>
            <li> Very similar to CoolWater by Davidoff, great for young people but lasts 6 hours or less.  </li>
            <li> The top notes are out in the first few mins and then the soapy cedar kicks in.</li>
            <li> It smells great, very subtle.</li>
            <li> While it was a unbelievable evening, the pain I endured throughout this spectacular event cannot and shouldn&#x27;t be replicated.  </li>
            <li> Classic &amp;#34;guy.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I saw a lot of reviews from older men and women for this product.</li>
            <li> Most stores (if they carry the cologne), are more expensive.  </li>
            <li> is if it arrived busted and if it did that, as a Prime member I get mainly from Amazon and they take care of all issues like that</li>
            <li> , it &#x27;s CLASSIC...</li>
            <li> Now this is not a repugnant scent, but if you like a clean smelling colognes that you aren&#x27;t constantly aware that you&#x27;re wearing due to the strength of the cologne and are under the age of 50</li>
            <li> highly recommend this now classic cologne.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but since, the price has gone up because of the high ratings given.</li>
            <li> But this is the actual real stuff!!</li>
            <li> Hubby was so thankful he just love these for everyday wear</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure it does not fit this case&lt;</li>
            <li> Its refreshing but the smell doesnt last too long.</li>
            <li> I buy a cologne I expect a nice smell and at least some</li>
            <li> This seems OK, and a few others have told me they like it.</li>
            <li> I forget all of the above when I remember that I bought this for $9 and it still smells good than some of the colognes I had in the past.</li>
            <li> This is a very masculine smell.</li>
            <li> Safe bet for an everyday cologne for both old and young.  </li>
            <li> my old school Cologne!</li>
            <li> Thought i would like the cologne, some people compare to cool water, or even millesime, not really to my liking at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very fresh of green leaves and cedarwood and light in moss,very sharp in citrus and juniper.</li>
            <li> You spray it, it smells ok for a little bit, but then the aroma does not last.  </li>
            <li> is one of the items that a review is silly to do as I am happy with this product and would have no reason to not reorder in the same manner&lt;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also clearly a man&#x27;s cologne.  </li>
            <li> BUT, YOUNG MEN WEAR THIS COLOGNE</li>
            <li> The scent can last the whole day.</li>
            <li> I believe the old KISS principle pertains.  </li>
            <li> but my son (14 yrears old) does</li>
            <li> The I really like cologne thats not so age specific.</li>
            <li> so I was pleasantly surprised to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I remembered liking it, and when it popped up on a search, I was pleasantly surprised that it was still being made (I hadn&#x27;t seen it in 10 years).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just wanted to chime in and say that as a 25 year old, I have received a number of compliments on this scent.</li>
            <li> and it last a whole day.</li>
            <li> Wow, what a deal too.</li>
            <li> Young principamente recommend.</li>
            <li> It is a hardcore 80&#x27;s and early 90&#x27;s smelling cologne.</li>
            <li> Chances are that you won&#x27;t need to use that much and the scent will not fade for several hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Last I looked, it was around $15 for 3.4oz, and I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s at least as good as Code or Le Male.</li>
            <li> It don&#x27;t last as long as many more expensive colognes do</li>
            <li> /&gt;Speaking of sprays, for me usually one or two does it fine.</li>
            <li> smells nice, cheap spray, if you have never tried it you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> as far as how long the smell lasts i really haven&#x27;t taken a look at it.</li>
            <li> Next was very unexpected, as I knew the woodsy citrus scent was heavenly, but this literally awoke the neighboring women like a pack of war wolves!</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as I expected and exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I was actually planning to order a new Davidoff, and decided to try this one out instead.  </li>
            <li> Very woodsy masculine scent, last long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a sundry or something I use in everyday life like light bulbs, toilet paper, cereal etc</li>
            <li> Decent woody smell but only lasts for a short time before it&#x27;s gone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It brings back old memories.  </li>
            <li> It looks professional while still being low</li>
            <li> After going over all of the reviews which raved about the quality of this product, I decided to take the plunge and buy this instead of my usual Cool Water.</li>
            <li> Definitely a hit.&lt;br /&gt;It smells of Crisp Mountain Air and Wide Open Spaces!</li>
            <li> Aspen Cologne ranks as my second favorite cologne of all time behind only Minotaure.  </li>
            <li> It smells fresh and green and like a much more expensive fragrance.</li>
            <li> Other than that, decent product.</li>
            <li> plain and simple, if you&#x27;re hoping to be reminded of your amazing hiking or camping trip and the sweet scent of pine and dew among other tantalizing aromas, be wary of this product because what you&#x27;ll get is the scent of a retired lumberjack doused in overpowering cologne musk.</li>
            <li> Most places sell this perfume very weak.</li>
            <li> A lot of people would say probably not, but it IS a very nice scent and at only 15% of the cost of those others, it&#x27;s hard to go wrong with Aspen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do have other more expensive colognes to go out with, but this is my old reliable.</li>
            <li> My father is extremely picky about what he wears as far as cologne goes.</li>
            <li> i was using this everyday when i was back in high school 15 years ago.</li>
            <li> I was skepital at first because I thought this would be too much for my husband who is 43, but I was sooooo wrong.  </li>
            <li> I cannot fathom your reasoning for requiring excessive verbiage when the full evaluation was provided with less words.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to last long.</li>
            <li> I have bronze  color skin and also sweetie this cologne last long on me.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last as long as i would want.</li>
            <li> Aspen for Men by Coty is what happened a long time ago if everything that is wrong with Cool Water by Davidoff ever got fixed.</li>
            <li> Here are some colognes that I like to give you an idea of where I stand as far as prefernces go: Kenneth Cole- Reaction and Black, Jean Paul Gaultier-</li>
            <li> ;  We bought it online because it has become hard to find in the stores at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I used to wear this in high school back in the late 90s.</li>
            <li> One thing to keep in mind, don&#x27;t go crazy on the spray :)</li>
            <li> It actually smells very similar to Creed&#x27;s Green Irish Tweed.</li>
            <li> The scent is similar to coolwater and green irish tweed with the only drawback being its longevity.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s something subtle, yet positive about it.  </li>
            <li> However, it wears off sooner than other colognes, even in the same price range.  </li>
            <li> I have worn other scents but have always come back to Aspen.</li>
            <li> Who knows, maybe that&#x27;s part of the reason she stuck with me so long!</li>
            <li> The odor is rather &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34;, however the smell does not last very long, and it&#x27;s not exactly a panty dropper.</li>
            <li> It stays on my skin (dry) for about 3 hours.</li>
            <li> Although I wear cologne, I have a limited sense of smell.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find where I live.  </li>
            <li> and i was surprise for the price, half price in a regular store</li>
            <li> Most people are been shocked on both the brand and the price I have paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Lately, it  is a bit more difficult to find.  </li>
            <li> My girlfriend always says I smell &amp;#34;Piney&amp;#34; when wearing this, which was to be expected with a name like Aspen.</li>
            <li> Product was as expected.</li>
            <li> It was delivered promptly and it was just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Received the cologne today and it is completely empty!</li>
            <li> Received faster than expected and as always, Amazon came thru again!  </li>
            <li> Do not buy this for anything other than post-workouts or maybe if you just want a cover up when you&#x27;re out in the heat.</li>
            <li> If you decide to go out on a whim and buy it without being able to smell it, you will not be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I Try mambo, Curve, Perry Ellis Addidas, Jordan, other</li>
            <li> the other teens are wearing the up to date cologne and they smell alike, but this sets my son apart.  </li>
            <li> #34;You get what you pay for,&amp;#34; but unfortunately that seems to be exactly the problem this time</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that it seems to wear off too soon</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a firm reminder that the forest won&#x27;t look empty forever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to the base used in many fragrances.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t seem watered down or anything,</li>
            <li> However my only disappointment is that it does not stay on long enough.</li>
            <li> Sometimes a little lavender creeps in and gives the cologne a soapy accord</li>
            <li> Smells a little too fruity for me.</li>
            <li> In winter it&#x27;s that an accelerant to that deep breath of cold air to really open up your lungs and nose and</li>
            <li> I use it everyday for work.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few months ago and I use it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Rarely ever do I smell cologne as quality as this, and if I do it&#x27;s usually on somebody who sprays waaaayyy too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughters gave me a small bottle of this for fathers day.</li>
            <li> Sorry no actual feed back.&lt;br /&gt;DS PA</li>
            <li> I have payed twice that amount for it in the past.</li>
            <li> Even got a gift  with my small purchase&amp;#60; would recommend this company to anyone.</li>
            <li> I am reviewing this for my age group and I am 26, and for me it is not a very good cologne.</li>
            <li> But sometime it is hard to purchase.</li>
            <li> Words that are hard to argue with.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand for years and it is hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> It never fails...as soon as I find something I like, it&#x27;s either discontinued or hard to find.</li>
            <li> only way I would give a bad review</li>
            <li> It is also a very delicate scent, not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> When I bought it I felt it was the best-kept secret in the world of cologne.  </li>
            <li> Not happy bought 5 bottles ,,,,,,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confused and thought I would be buying a trip to Aspen.</li>
            <li> I hate it when the price of a product follows the traditional saying : &amp;</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed i</li>
            <li> My husband loves Aspen cologne and it has gotten difficult to buy around home.</li>
            <li> I will plead guilty and say &#x27;</li>
            <li> It came on time and there was nothing wrong with the product.</li>
            <li> 4 ounce cant go wrong with the price</li>
            <li> Not an expensive smelling cologne,</li>
            <li> Aspen by Coty for Men - 4 Ounce EDC Spray earns two thumbs down because the cologne stinks like crap.</li>
            <li> Not all colognes have to be expensive to smell good.5-stars!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not knocking it off, or saying is bad.</li>
            <li> This cologne is horrible.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good price but is not that strong..</li>
            <li> Awesome, reasonable purchase!</li>
            <li> I have used this for years. It has a nice, fresh, lasting fragrance. I also only buy colognes in spray version.</li>
            <li> WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR, a cologne my dad had when i was a kid i still remember the smell, i found it on amazon, i wasnt sure if this was the real thing but i gave it a try, i just bought 2 more 4 my dad, he is very happy couse the first person to give it to him was a good friend of him</li>
            <li> I am a woman and I wear this cologne. Love it :~)</li>
            <li> The product has been around for many years for obvious reasons. It is one of the best!</li>
            <li> Aspen Cologne ranks as my second favorite cologne of all time behind only Minotaure.  The smell is \\&quot;sweet\\&quot; and \\&quot;pine-like\\&quot;, in my opinion.  It&#x27;s always hard to describe a fragrance, so you&#x27;ll have to trust me on this one - this stuff smells great.  I bought this back in &#x27;93, a couple of years before it became popular.  When I bought it I felt it was the best-kept secret in the world of cologne.  Then a couple years later I started seeing commercials for it on TV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this now classic cologne.</li>
            <li> Smells great, my husband loves it.</li>
            <li> THANKS AMAZON FOR THE SUPER FAST SHIPPING. I ORDERED THIS MONDAY AND RECEIVED IT TODAY. THIS PURCHASE WAS FOR MY HUSBAND AND SOME MIGHT THINK IT&#x27;S CHEAP OR FOR OLD MEN BUT, YOUNG MEN WEAR THIS COLOGNE TOO. I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED THE SPELL OF THIS COLOGNE SINCE I WAS 18. IT&#x27;S A GOOD BARGAIN AND IT SPELLS GREAT.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of Aspen and the price makes it even more appealing.  I wear it on my work clothes and always get positive responses.  Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Aspen has been a favorite of mine for some time now. I use it to work and go run about town. I&#x27;ve received many compliments about the cologne. I do have other more expensive colognes to go out with, but this is my old reliable. Great everyday cologne at a good price. Give it a try, you might just like it. I have recently ordered four bottles, three were for friends that wanted the cologne after they tried mine.</li>
            <li> You again? Well, I feel similarly about this one as I do for the Adidas:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed a cheap, good-smelling cologne.... wish I had it in front of me so I could describe its bouquet...hahaha&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, I was resorting to smearing magazine cologne on myself -- sounds ghetto but whatever, that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have a choice.... this will do the job. Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fresh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What can I add? Nothing. This makes you smell goooooood.</li>
            <li> I have used this for many years.  This is the first time I have bought it on Amazon.  How awesome!  It is cheaper than buying it in the store quite frankly.  I will do it again.  The product is awesome too.</li>
            <li> this made a very gud b&#x27;day gift for my husband..he likes something mild and masculine and Aspen is the one...</li>
            <li> I used to wear this cologne when I was like 15 or so and didn&#x27;t think much of it back then. Even at that age I knew this was a cheap cologne. Now that I&#x27;m in my mid 20&#x27;s I appreciate this fragrance. It&#x27;s an ea de cologne and it&#x27;s cheap, but it smells great and lasts 5-6 hours on me. It actually smells very similar to Creed&#x27;s Green Irish Tweed. It&#x27;s nowhere near as deep as GIT, but for 200% less money, it&#x27;s a great alternative. It&#x27;s a closer match to GIT than Cool Water. It smells fresh and green and like a much more expensive fragrance.</li>
            <li> This has always been one of my favorites and at such a great price!! It has such a clean and distinctive smell.</li>
            <li> Old school, but smells great...</li>
            <li> Makes my husband smell good! (it&#x27;s his favorite scent)</li>
            <li> Big bottle for low price. Smells great</li>
            <li> Brings back good memories in High school. The scent can last the whole day. Fast shipping too</li>
            <li> Received the cologne today and it is completely empty! Please make sure these are inspected in the future.</li>
            <li> Aspen is the perfect kind of spicy fragrance that I wanted. I simply loved it. Also, the shipment was sent promptly.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as I expected and exactly as advertised.  Received faster than expected and as always, Amazon came thru again!  Love to order from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is for the guy who wants that smell like your father use to have growing up as a kid you know the one when you smelt it you knew your father was just there be for you not for teenagers trying to find that right cologne but its a good light but strong smell</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite fragrance and mine as well. Sometimes I even borrow a bit for myself. Unlike many other scents it doesn&#x27;t come off too cloying or strong and isn&#x27;t nauseating. It&#x27;s just clean and almost soapy smelling. Very nice.</li>
            <li> My guy smells so good when he has this cologne on! Makes just want to kiss him all over :)</li>
            <li> See my review for Aspen aftershave. I cannot fathom your reasoning for requiring excessive verbiage when the full evaluation was provided with less words.  I believe the old KISS principle pertains.  KISS translates as &amp;#34;Keep it simple, stupid.&amp;#34;  There.  I hope this meets your asinine requirement.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping this would smell like those &amp;#34;Black Ice&amp;#34; car freshner &#x27;trees&#x27;, but in my opinion, it just doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> One of two back-up or alternate colognes I use.  My girlfriend likes it - what else is there?  Last about 8 - 10 hours on me.</li>
            <li> Been a. Aspen user for over 20 years this doesn&#x27;t smell the same at all !!!!!! Not happy bought 5 bottles ,,,,,,</li>
            <li> i really don&#x27;t like the smell but my son (14 yrears old) does</li>
            <li> My husband and I like this smell and it&#x27;s much cheaper here then in the store.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the way this stuff smells. Also like the look and feel of the bottle. Like everything about it.</li>
            <li> Always happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter who wanted to surprise her boyfriend with his favorite cologne. The price was fantastic!</li>
            <li> This is my regular brand sent 1990&#x27;s. But sometime it is hard to purchase. Thank you.</li>
            <li> My grandpa wears this cologne and always has. This cologne is strong. I will give it that, one spray will do. Now this is not a repugnant scent, but if you like a clean smelling colognes that you aren&#x27;t constantly aware that you&#x27;re wearing due to the strength of the cologne and are under the age of 50 it&#x27;s not for you. Why two stars? I am reviewing this for my age group and I am 26, and for me it is not a very good cologne. The I really like cologne thats not so age specific. Now so how would you know if you like it based on just words and not samples? Here are some colognes that I like to give you an idea of where I stand as far as prefernces go: Kenneth Cole- Reaction and Black, Jean Paul Gaultier- Le Male, Curve- Regular, Crush, and Connect, Liz Claiborne- Mambo,Tommy Hilfiger- Tommy, Burberry- Brit and Sport, and Giorgio Armani- Acqua Di Gio and Code. If these are colognes you like then I think it&#x27;s safe to say try something else.</li>
            <li> This cologne has a very nice scent, and not too overwhelming either. Packaging and bottle are excellent touches as well.</li>
            <li> This cologne is horrible.  All of the reviewers saying this is a great buy for the money are delusional, really really delusional.  It smells like it costs, $10, and it does NOT last for hours; it lasts for about 30 minutes at a time.  Do not buy this for anything other than post-workouts or maybe if you just want a cover up when you&#x27;re out in the heat.</li>
            <li> This is a bottle of smells, not Aspen. I&#x27;m confused and thought I would be buying a trip to Aspen. 10/10 would buy again.</li>
            <li> I like this product after shower and really like it.  It is also a very delicate scent, not overpowering.  It don&#x27;t last as long as many more expensive colognes do but this one is excellent for its price.  Like any cologne you need to try it on your skin before you purchase it.  I have really liked many colognes, but upon trying it on my skin some turn rancid and some change scents.  I try everything in the way of colognes before I buy.  This one is great for the price and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> My husband loves Aspen cologne and it has gotten difficult to buy around home. I&#x27;m only sorry I didn&#x27;t get more and just keep it on hand for the future. The seller was very prompt with my order.</li>
            <li> Aspen is a very nice cologne,it has a masculine scent yet isn&#x27;t overbearing.One thing I must say about Aspen Cologne is that it&#x27;s reasonably priced for it&#x27;s quality in scent.I&#x27;ll never forget my first bottle of Aspen...my grandfather actually bought me a bottle in an Ivey&#x27;s department store and one for himself.He had a great statement about cologne &#x27;either it be one scent or several in choice,a cologne should reflect a man&#x27;s persona without him requiring to speak&#x27;.Words that are hard to argue with.I will plead guilty and say &#x27;yes I do like a change of pace&#x27; but I wore this cologne 5 or 6 days a week for many years.For how inexpensive it is it smells very good.So many fond memories and I met my wife in my youth wearing this cologne.She loves it so much anything else sitting on the vanity for that &#x27;change of pace&#x27; gets put in the cabinet underneath...except for the Aspen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what does Aspen smell like?&lt;br /&gt;Clarity is probably the best description I can give for this very green fragrance.It&#x27;s very fresh of green leaves and cedarwood and light in moss,very sharp in citrus and juniper.In fact juniper berries are why I think people confuse the wood to be pine.Sometimes a little lavender creeps in and gives the cologne a soapy accord but it&#x27;s light...kind of reminds me of Coolwater.There&#x27;s no musky character,gummy or sweetness vibe.It is literally good smelling all year round in my opinion.In the fall when everything is dying it&#x27;s that quiet walk through the woods it&#x27;s a firm reminder that the forest won&#x27;t look empty forever.In winter it&#x27;s that an accelerant to that deep breath of cold air to really open up your lungs and nose and smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;On my skin I get about 6 hours out of Aspen through 3 sprays and always have.I won&#x27;t say this cologne will make you turn up your nose to the classic Polo Original EDT.But it will make you question the price tag once you smell Aspen.Not all colognes have to be expensive to smell good.5-stars!</li>
            <li> I have used Aspen for around two decade&#x27;s and consider it as value for money - behold the mellow and lasting mountain freshness.  sudhir sondhi.</li>
            <li> One of the best smelling colognes of all time!  If you decide to go out on a whim and buy it without being able to smell it, you will not be disappointed.  Only complaint is that it seems to wear off too soon so I use a couple extra sprays.</li>
            <li> This product is good and smells good. Also I bought it in good price. The product stays on the cloth for several hours. I bought it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> would recommend to anyone very good and fast delivery</li>
            <li> This Spray Colonge Of Aspen of 4 Oz is the best to get it here In amazon since Walgreens and CVS mostly (there are others) Sell this product very expensinve. Here in amazon you can get 2 bottles for the price of 1 and beleive me this and the Gravity smells Very good no complains from females. I Try mambo, Curve, Perry Ellis Addidas, Jordan, other and I will always Like These 2 better and then the one I mention&lt;br /&gt;Aspen and Gravity Are The Best Colonge for Me and so far to the Ladies that Like it too!</li>
            <li> I have used Aspen for years.  Clean scent that lasts and very affordable.  I use it everyday for work.</li>
            <li> Everyone was asking me what kind of perfume I&#x27;ve got. I love the smell. I would advice anyone to try it.</li>
            <li> This is my husbands favorite cologne. When I can get it as reasonably priced as you sell it for I am a happy buyer.</li>
            <li> $12 is a fair price for this nice green piny smelling cologne. The scent is similar to coolwater and green irish tweed with the only drawback being its longevity.</li>
            <li> Its a great cheap colonge...smells very good but dosent last long at all.. U get what u pay for..or pay more get gud stuff..</li>
            <li> Love the spritzer, my husband loves this scent.</li>
            <li> I love Aspen!  I can&#x27;t find it here locally so I was pleasantly surprised to find it on Amazon.  I can&#x27;t count the number of compliments I receive, especially from females (always a plus in my book).  It has a distinct smell, kind of PineSol-ish, if that makes sense, but much more appealing. The scent lasts a good while without being overbearing.  I really do love this scent.  The females enjoy it too, but I would use it even if nobody else liked it.  Something that hasn&#x27;t happened yet.</li>
            <li> Best men&#x27;s cologne ever! My husband gets so many compliments each time he wears it. Long lasting!</li>
            <li> love it this stuff is great! If you wanna smell good for the ladies this is good stuff for a fair price!</li>
            <li> A good scent for my husband.  Classic &amp;#34;guy.&amp;#34;  We bought it online because it has become hard to find in the stores at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and great gift</li>
            <li> meet with my expectations , and was a very nice perfume to share into your friends or family group !,</li>
            <li> The original aspen i&#x27;ve been wearing for over 10 years. Truly a great product. My brother wore it before me, and i fell in love instantly</li>
            <li> Great product....Great price.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Meijer wanted $40 or so for this same product!!</li>
            <li> My husband love it, it&#x27;s always one of his favorite.</li>
            <li> Against the descriptions numerous statements about it recommended for day time wear, I decided to splash a dash of this product on my neck. Next was very unexpected, as I knew the woodsy citrus scent was heavenly, but this literally awoke the neighboring women like a pack of war wolves! While it was a unbelievable evening, the pain I endured throughout this spectacular event cannot and shouldn&#x27;t be replicated.  DAY TIME WEAR ONLY PEOPLE!!!</li>
            <li> Been looking these cologne for my husband in 4 stores can&#x27;t find them in a shelves. Found it here in amazon and i was surprise for the price, half price in a regular store so i got 2 of them. Hubby was so thankful he just love these for everyday wear</li>
            <li> I have used this cologne for over 20 years, and it is by far, my wife&#x27;s favorite.  Lately, it  is a bit more difficult to find.  I ordered through Amazon, and had it in no time-and the price was much better than I would have normally paid, as well.  Quite pleased!</li>
            <li> An ex-girlfriend had bought Aspen for me 15 years or so ago.  I remembered liking it, and when it popped up on a search, I was pleasantly surprised that it was still being made (I hadn&#x27;t seen it in 10 years).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At $9.95 for a FOUR-ounce bottle, it&#x27;s a no-brainer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it smell as good as more expensive colognes such as Armani Code (I own), Jean Paul Gaultier&#x27;s Le Male (I own), or others?  A lot of people would say probably not, but it IS a very nice scent and at only 15% of the cost of those others, it&#x27;s hard to go wrong with Aspen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for another great cologne at a great price, my actual favorite (and my fiancee&#x27;s favorite) men&#x27;s cologne is Ulysse by Vicky Tiel.  Last I looked, it was around $15 for 3.4oz, and I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s at least as good as Code or Le Male.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this cologne for over 20 years and its never changed. Ive tried others but I always seem to come back to Aspen. Plus I always get complements from chicks saying it smells good and asking me what it is.</li>
            <li> I find it too strong on my skin and it gives me a headache</li>
            <li> I see many reviews of colognes expressing concerns about copies or knockoffs. This seems to be the genuine scent as I remember it. Finished off a bottle I had for 10 or 15 years recently, and this smells the same. The price was very good, under $10, and was extremely well packaged, had some concerns about ordering a bottle and how it would arrive, but not a problem.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but not too much, cause it&#x27;s smell does not stay more than 5 to 10 minutes</li>
            <li> This is for the GROWN man in your life!  I was skepital at first because I thought this would be too much for my husband who is 43, but I was sooooo wrong.  My hubby has the type of body chemistry that blends perfect with any type of cologne that has that woodsy, citus, spicey kind of mixture to it.  I think we might be buying this one again!</li>
            <li> I saw a lot of reviews from older men and women for this product. I just wanted to chime in and say that as a 25 year old, I have received a number of compliments on this scent. It is cheap, and smells great without being overpowering. In addition, it is a slightly more unique scent than the average fist pumping clubbers are wearing out every night.</li>
            <li> My favorite cologne of all time especially on a guy.  It came on time and there was nothing wrong with the product.</li>
            <li> This is a very masculine smell. My girlfriend always says I smell &amp;#34;Piney&amp;#34; when wearing this, which was to be expected with a name like Aspen. The smell sticks pretty well throughout the day and I get a lot of compliments when wearing it. Definitely a more manly smell, wouldn&#x27;t recommend for someone who likes a sweeter cologne.</li>
            <li> I like this smell...inexpensive , and my husband gets a lot of compliments</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, I started buying it 15 years ago and keep a stock at home to ensure I do not run out. The fragrance is good and consistent and the bottles don&#x27;t leak....a big plus if they fall sideways on the shelf. I guarantee I have no affiliation to this company, just a very satisfied customer of many years.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because the price couldn&#x27;t be beat.  Most stores (if they carry the cologne), are more expensive.  My boyfriend uses this cologne for his &amp;#34;everyday cologne&amp;#34; because it has a good scent and is more affordable then other products like Polo.</li>
            <li> For the price, this is not a bad spray. The odor is rather &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34;, however the smell does not last very long, and it&#x27;s not exactly a panty dropper. Other than that, decent product.</li>
            <li> It is ok but not really impressed with scent. Smells a little too fruity for me. Doesn&#x27;t seem to last long. No one has commented either way when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Those cologne has a nice smell, but is easy to forget. It&#x27;s not the best smell in the world. For the price, quantity, and quality it is good to use as an everyday scent.</li>
            <li> Have freshened myself, with Aspen, for years and l love it !</li>
            <li> good old classic like it</li>
            <li> MY son has always worn Aspen, &amp; this is a very good deal. Very nice indeed, &amp; he was pleased!</li>
            <li> I like the scent, very woodsy.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive. .nice mellow scent..not to overbearing. Safe bet for an everyday cologne for both old and young.  4 ounce cant go wrong with the price</li>
            <li> Aspen by Coty for Men - 4 Ounce EDC Spray earns two thumbs down because the cologne stinks like crap. I regret that I bought it.</li>
            <li> good for a crisp aroma</li>
            <li> Smells like creeds green irish tweed for cheap!!!!</li>
            <li> Ordered this for the hubby for Christmas.  Showed up JUST in time and affordable.  I love Amazon&#x27;s free super saving shipping!  I dont&#x27; buy anything without it!</li>
            <li> Been using it for 10 years. It&#x27;s the best smelling and cheapest one that women like with great compliments from the ladies.</li>
            <li> Nice smelling cologne for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Smells remotely similar to Gillett shaving cream. Not terrible but not my stlye. But on the positive note it is alot of colgne.</li>
            <li> Nothing spectacular about this cologne. You spray it, it smells ok for a little bit, but then the aroma does not last.  It was a good value though.</li>
            <li> Decent woody smell but only lasts for a short time before it&#x27;s gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price and smell it&#x27;s nice having in my collection but definitely nothing to write home about.</li>
            <li> As a canned response to a requested review, I state this:&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the items that a review is silly to do as I am happy with this product and would have no reason to not reorder in the same manner&lt;br /&gt;It is a sundry or something I use in everyday life like light bulbs, toilet paper, cereal etc&lt;br /&gt;the only way I would give a bad review is if it arrived busted and if it did that, as a Prime member I get mainly from Amazon and they take care of all issues like that so I&#x27;m sure it does not fit this case&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product it works very good</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed i this fragrance, as I expected more of an &amp;#34;evergreen&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;But it is okay.</li>
            <li> Its refreshing but the smell doesnt last too long. Very good price for this piece.</li>
            <li> awesome and very affordable!!!</li>
            <li> wonderful price and a great scent to wear</li>
            <li> My favorite for my boyfriend!</li>
            <li> This is a terrific investment.  The orders arrived quickly and in excellent condition.  I am absolutely thrilled to be a customer. I have ordered many times before and there is no stopping me now.  I am more than happy, I&#x27;m so satisfied.  Thank You!!!</li>
            <li> I really love it. Any place that i go people ask me what kind of perfume it is due to smell really good and it last a whole day.</li>
            <li> Good Seller. Product was as expected.</li>
            <li> love this stuff !!!!!</li>
            <li> Very pleased  First time I ordered  and I would do it again.</li>
            <li> The product is a nicely scented cologne by Coty. It was delivered promptly and it was just what I expected. There were no problems anywhere from my order placement to the delivery to the product it self!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product as described in the Amazon description was spot on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me this was a total excellent experience!</li>
            <li> the cologne is excellent</li>
            <li> Love this cologne. Wow, what a deal too. Arrived very fast, packed well.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and my fiance love the smell and is there Aspen shampoo</li>
            <li> Exactly what we needed. Super fast shipping &amp; great price.</li>
            <li> This was the cologne that my boyfriend used to wear when we first met. It brings back old memories.  Will purchase again</li>
            <li> I love the scent of Aspen, and this is an EXCELLENT buy for this normally overpriced cologne. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love it!! I thought it would be like a Ross brand where I would spray and the scent would go away after 30 minutes.. But this is the actual real stuff!! Had it on for 5 hours and it&#x27;s still going strong... I should order another bottle.. I have been wearing this stuff since I was 16 and I&#x27;m 32... I need rocawear 10 next!!</li>
            <li> Great fragrance I&#x27;ve enjoyed using for years.</li>
            <li> Have been a user of Aspen for years.. the same nice fragrance and well worth for its price.</li>
            <li> Awesome product at an awesome price! Aspen by Coty is one of my favorite cologne&#x27;s! Thank you for making it available at such an amazing price!  :)</li>
            <li> I bought this a few months ago and I use it almost everyday. I still get complements from the smell of it. I am so buying this again!</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that for the price of this item it has a great scent. It was exactly what I was looking for. It has that backwoods outdoors smell to it. My problem is the lack of length. I know the term you get what you pay for here. I just wish that you didn&#x27;t have to spray it on every hour in order to keep the scent going. When it is going though I have got some pretty nice compliments from it.</li>
            <li> Aspen for Men by Coty is what happened a long time ago if everything that is wrong with Cool Water by Davidoff ever got fixed. It is the ultimate precursor to Cool Water and quite frankly, Aspen is the better pick...superior sillage and long life makes this a winner!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cologne for last 15 years.  I am using the same cologne through out and love it.  I always get compliment specially from Ladies that i smell excellent.  Sometimes my wife does not like that.</li>
            <li> Big bottle for a cheap price and quickly became my new favorite cologne. Smells very light and sweet, almost mountainy, and the smell lasts a long time. Definitely am buying again.</li>
            <li> This is a great everyday scent.  I wear it to work regularly and have received many compliments.  It reminds me of evergreens, and one spray is sufficient to last all day without knocking people over when they meet you.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find it in stores anymore. But this deal is much better than I ever found in the stores, even the after Christmas sales at drug stores</li>
            <li> Although the price seems very attractive, this was not a good choice.&lt;br /&gt;When I buy a cologne I expect a nice smell and at least some lasting.&lt;br /&gt;Well, the scent is very strong, maybe too strong.The moment you spray it on you, if someone else is around this one might complain you have overdone. Nevertheless, the smell lasts for 20 or 30 minutes tops. It is quite disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;There are better choices even at this price range</li>
            <li> My father is extremely picky about what he wears as far as cologne goes. This is the only thing he&#x27;ll wear. It lasts him for 6 months so he gets it twice a year. Great product!</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a gift last Christmas and he really likes this cologne. And I couldn&#x27;t beat the price that Amazon had.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to find a cologne moderately priced with a great scent!  I&#x27;ve always liked Aspen and have bought if for my husband and son.</li>
            <li> I use to wear this  cologne in the early 90&#x27;s to high school and chicks love wen I wear it. I&#x27;m now in my thirties and still avin women asking me wat cologne I&#x27;m wearing cause it smells good.</li>
            <li> Aspen has a strong scent,last all day even when I sweat,great price,this is one cologne I will always use.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with this cologne</li>
            <li> Excellent scent that goes along with my skin type...I have bronze  color skin and also sweetie this cologne last long on me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for years. It looks professional while still being low price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me say tho, the price does NOT reflect the quality. This stuff is amazing. Smells nice, but is not overbearing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rarely ever do I smell cologne as quality as this, and if I do it&#x27;s usually on somebody who sprays waaaayyy too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of sprays, for me usually one or two does it fine. Around three is when I start getting people cringe from the cologne.</li>
            <li> My favorite cologne.  My son liked it so much that it instantly became his favorite.</li>
            <li> I wish he would use it faster so i could get more sooner,Thank you so much for being there,The Ramps</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from Amazon mainly because the price is half of what retailers are charging. This 4 oz. unit is the largest you can buy at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> i was using this everyday when i was back in high school 15 years ago. i decided to buy it again when i saw it. I still love the scent after all these years. not too strong and lasts well. good price too! my wife also loved it. will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to the base used in many fragrances. My daughters gave me a small bottle of this for fathers day. No problems with this, like the smell, too. Just right, not too feminine, not to manly off putting.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I bought this in college and for my money, it&#x27;s still my favorite cologne.  There&#x27;s something subtle, yet positive about it.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like a chemical.  It&#x27;s also clearly a man&#x27;s cologne.  Perhaps most telling, none of my girlfriends have ever asked me to change it.  In fact, several have complemented me on it.</li>
            <li> Got this to try since it is supposed to be similar to Creed GIT.  It smells much more pine scented than GIT but for the price is pretty good.  Very similar to CoolWater by Davidoff, great for young people but lasts 6 hours or less.  More piney than CW.</li>
            <li> This Tradicinal company parfum is destaqa quality is lovely their products are safe and striking good investment Coty love to know many years. Young principamente recommend.</li>
            <li> my old school Cologne! Still love the smell of Cologne. and at  nice price I recommend this product to every one</li>
            <li> Gave as gift which was appreciated. Sorry no actual feed back.&lt;br /&gt;DS PA</li>
            <li> Hard to find where I live.  Perfect price. My husband loves this and so do I.</li>
            <li> The best cologne in the world!</li>
            <li> Same as I have been using for years!</li>
            <li> Not over-powering, yet pleasing to others! People always comment on how good it smells, when I don&#x27;t even know that I&#x27;m wearing it. The cost is okay, too.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my son, he loves it and he smells good.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand for years and it is hard to find in the stores.So glad I found it on line</li>
            <li> Man what a deal I got on this bottle of Aspen. I got the large spray for $17.00. I have payed twice that amount for it in the past.</li>
            <li> Although I wear cologne, I have a limited sense of smell.  This seems OK, and a few others have told me they like it.</li>
            <li> Outstanding Price, Fast shipper, will do business again with them!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks You :-)</li>
            <li> Got exactly what I wanted. I&#x27;ve always loved the smell of this cologne bought it for my son he loves it. Fast shipping.bottle is good size good price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely synthetic. It is a hardcore 80&#x27;s and early 90&#x27;s smelling cologne. Very different from what we have today. This&#x27;d be a very good after shave though. The top notes are out in the first few mins and then the soapy cedar kicks in. It stays on my skin (dry) for about 3 hours. This will be saved for the day when I don&#x27;t want to use any of my regular colognes. One thing to keep in mind, don&#x27;t go crazy on the spray :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I forget all of the above when I remember that I bought this for $9 and it still smells good than some of the colognes I had in the past. So not disappointed.</li>
            <li> smells nice, cheap spray, if you have never tried it you will not be disappointed. as far as how long the smell lasts i really haven&#x27;t taken a look at it.</li>
            <li> It is a good fragance I bought it because a persons ask me to buy it for him, since here in panama was sold out.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift and he was thrilled with it.  He enjoyed the fresh pine mountain scent.  Very attractive smell to the nose.  I have always loved this scent of cologne.....so refreshing and brisk clean smell.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells fantastic. Definitely a hit.&lt;br /&gt;It smells of Crisp Mountain Air and Wide Open Spaces! Absolutely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Girls dig it. Guys want to know where to get it so they smell just as fresh. Not a bad investment!</li>
            <li> A Great Product, a must have.!!!!!!!!!!! Most places sell this perfume very weak. But the one a got from you guys is the real deal. Thanks for the quality. I&#x27;ll keep getting this perfume from you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Thanks again: Armando Castillo.</li>
            <li> Aspen by Coty for men has been one of my all time favorite colognes for quite some time.  For the price you just can&#x27;t beat it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had plenty of complements about the fragrance before. Most people are been shocked on both the brand and the price I have paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to agree as some have mentioned, it is a strong cologne if you over use it. So, I recommend that you limit the sprays per wear. Chances are that you won&#x27;t need to use that much and the scent will not fade for several hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a good daytime(work, etc) fragrance this one is great cologne. You can use it for a nighttime (going out) cologne but it might be too strong for some occasions. So I would not recommend this one for that purpose.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite fragrances for my hubby--&amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; or not--I love it on him! I recommend this scent to everyone!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  I can go for weeks without a shower and still smell like, well... Aspen!  Highly recommend ;-)</li>
            <li> Not an expensive smelling cologne, but I like it, it &#x27;s CLASSIC...</li>
            <li> This cologne is SUSPICIOUSLY identical to Davidoff Cool Water.  I realized it immediately once this arrived.  If you look at the formatting of the item descriptions, they match.  It makes me think that the same company makes one fragrance and markets it in two bottles.  Buy whichever one is cheaper at the moment. I was actually planning to order a new Davidoff, and decided to try this one out instead.  I am glad that I didn&#x27;t buy both at once...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, I like the scent.  However, it wears off sooner than other colognes, even in the same price range.  Would re-buy it (and accidentally did).</li>
            <li> Even got a gift  with my small purchase&amp;#60; would recommend this company to anyone. My order and evrything was right on time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only cologne that  I use. I&#x27;ve used this Cologne for more than 15 years.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m allergic to all the colonies and only Aspen can use.</li>
            <li> Good, cheap outdoorsy type cologne. Seems like it would be a nice fall scent.</li>
            <li> This product smells very good. I have gotten many complements on the scent. I will definitely be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> Great smell and it didn&#x27;t seem watered down or anything, good price compared to local stores.</li>
            <li> Got this for my son....Aspen by Coty for Men - 4 Ounce EDC Spray.  Can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore.  So glad that Amazon can carry all the things I like.  It never fails...as soon as I find something I like, it&#x27;s either discontinued or hard to find.</li>
            <li> Good value + timely delivery + quality product &#x3D; satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> my brothers favourite cologne ..thank you</li>
            <li> great product at great price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this colonel for 5 years and I love it!</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> This was an add-on product, to the price was really good.  And I had this before and realty liked it.</li>
            <li> I bought them for their fragrance and it is very good, woody and fresh. However my only disappointment is that it does not stay on long enough.</li>
            <li> Just in time, very good congrats!!!  nice and sheap perfume, recomended.!!!</li>
            <li> Thought i would like the cologne, some people compare to cool water, or even millesime, not really to my liking at all. YMMV</li>
            <li> I like this stuff. I have worn other scents but have always come back to Aspen. I have received complements on it. It doesn&#x27;t smell like your grandfathers cologne either and is very affordable and lasts a reasonable time. I used to pay over $22 at Walmart and now I order it through Amazon for about $12. Good stuff. I reccomend.</li>
            <li> Interesting scent. Somewhat woody, of course. Didn&#x27;t blow me away but it&#x27;s quite solid--lasts for a while and doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li> Awesome price for such a big bottle of an awesome cologne.  I bought this for my boyfriend to try, because it is one of my favorite scents. Hope he likes it as much as I do. :)</li>
            <li> Purchased for someone else.</li>
            <li> Great smelling cologne. My husband loves this and it made a nice christmas gift. Nice bottle and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Nice smell.  Lasts a long time.  And inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update!  I have had the same bottle for over a year now and have been using it daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> great my wife said her favorite when it first came out.  she surpised me with a bottle for our25th anniversary.  I still use even when she passed awayin02010,were married 45 years&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;clavin benedict</li>
            <li> Not too overpowering, spells fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Very woodsy masculine scent, last long. ladies didn&#x27;t love it as much as Lucky You or Chrome,</li>
            <li> I used to wear this in high school back in the late 90s. My girlfriend loved it back then. She&#x27;s my wife of almost 15 years now! Who knows, maybe that&#x27;s part of the reason she stuck with me so long!</li>
            <li> I actually think this product is good, I gave it 1 star because I bought it at a lower price but since, the price has gone up because of the high ratings given. I don&#x27;t think the price should go up because of the rating, your going to get more business with the good comments.Like I have. I&#x27;m not knocking it off, or saying is bad. Im just saying that I think it&#x27;s unfare for the price increase, but if you have no problem with the price, then I suggest you buy it.</li>
            <li> Love when my husband wears this.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my son.  He always comes and reports that he get many compliments on the smell.  I remember this scent from when i was in school.  the other teens are wearing the up to date cologne and they smell alike, but this sets my son apart.  He loves it too.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery and a good smell. reminds me of the outdoors/woods</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, not too much. Doesn&#x27;t last as long as i would want. but it&#x27;s still a nice masculine fragrance.</li>
            <li> It smells great, very subtle. One spray is enough. I use this pretty much every time I go out, and people certainly like it. :)</li>
            <li> After going over all of the reviews which raved about the quality of this product, I decided to take the plunge and buy this instead of my usual Cool Water. To my surprise, not only does this cologne smell cheap, but it also lacks the true nature remnants that I have become used to in products such as HUGO Boss, Aqua Di Gio, and Cool Water. Instead of these nature remnants, there is a poignant almost chemical like scent to this product. I hate it when the price of a product follows the traditional saying : &amp;#34;You get what you pay for,&amp;#34; but unfortunately that seems to be exactly the problem this time around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So plain and simple, if you&#x27;re hoping to be reminded of your amazing hiking or camping trip and the sweet scent of pine and dew among other tantalizing aromas, be wary of this product because what you&#x27;ll get is the scent of a retired lumberjack doused in overpowering cologne musk.</li>
