            <li>The smell is also amazing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say that whatever this product claims is very true!</li>
            <li>I have used biolage before, but this one is not as good as I remembered, but better than over the counter stuff for sure.  </li>
            <li>The scent is lovely, and I am really pleased with this set!</li>
            <li>so far this is the best product she&#x27;s found.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner, and I was really pleased by the price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I will defiantly buy more items from this website.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>The price was better than most stores and I received it in 2 days.  </li>
            <li>What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li>My hair drys out more now and gets tangled more.</li>
            <li>I have to use more conditioner to get the comb through my curly hair.</li>
            <li>Love this product - have used it for a year now.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was shipped very quickly and no leaks.</li>
            <li>I had a strong smell too.</li>
            <li>The shipping and price information were both accurate.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is of the quality of Wen or B&amp;B for example, but it is better than store brands and is priced very reasonably.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>dont really know what the terms are for her hair and how it is, but she deffinitely has better smoothness in it.</li>
            <li>I love it soooo much</li>
            <li>It came as just two bottles, of the right product, taped together.  </li>
            <li>Right after I rinsed out the conditioner my hair felt softer</li>
            <li>Her naturally curly hair needs intense hydration to stay healthy and</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t used this shampoo in a couple of years, and have been using other, more expensive brands, however Hydratherapie is perfect for my hair!</li>
            <li>I really like the smell too</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my daughter who really likes it.  </li>
            <li>After peeling off the tape, I am left with a very sticky residue right where you would hold it while using it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Biolage for a few years now and love this duo.  </li>
            <li>Matrix offers a variety of hair products and this particular one suited my needs.  </li>
            <li>I find if I mix a little extra virgin coconut oil with the conditioner, it works better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping this is actually the real product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hydrating but not heavy and doesn&#x27;t build up in your hair.  </li>
            <li>It has reduced frizziness and flyaways (far better than the tons of product I was using to counteract this before) and it has helped relieve dry scalp and dandruff issues I&#x27;ve been experiencing for the past year or so (probably as I don&#x27;t have to use as much product).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered Biolage on Amazon in the past and it came super fast.</li>
            <li>The winter really took a toll on my hair and it is really dry</li>
            <li>As always, biolage is the only product i have eber used for soft hair, without causing flakes.</li>
            <li>Does not dry hair out like some shampoos and conditioners</li>
            <li>I have long soft curly hair.</li>
            <li>It is worth the price and only small amounts are required to do the job.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> this was great for my haair</li>

            <li> Matrix offers a variety of hair products and this particular one suited my needs.  It is worth the price and only small amounts are required to do the job.</li>
            <li> I got acne a over my shoulders, back, and forehead. I had a strong smell too. I never finished it. I just threw it out.</li>
            <li> I have yet to actually use the product.  I am extremely annoyed by the way it was packaged.  It didn&#x27;t look anything like the photo on the page.  It came as just two bottles, of the right product, taped together.  After peeling off the tape, I am left with a very sticky residue right where you would hold it while using it.  The shampoo bottle&#x27;s cap was also broken off.  It also seems like a UPC sticker was peeled off the side of the conditioner prior to it being sent as you can see the leftover marks from the glue.  I&#x27;m hoping this is actually the real product.  I know I will not be purchasing from this again.</li>
            <li> Gift for my daughter.  It&#x27;s all she uses.  Her naturally curly hair needs intense hydration to stay healthy and so far this is the best product she&#x27;s found.</li>
            <li> Service price top quality on time kept wife happy happy happy that makes my life very easy happy happy happy</li>
            <li> I only use this product on my hair and have a difficult time finding it at a reasonable price!  I have this product in my spare bathroom for guest to use</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner, and I was really pleased by the price on Amazon. I don&#x27;t know if I have been taken for a ride at other locations, but this was less than I usually spend. I hadn&#x27;t used this shampoo in a couple of years, and have been using other, more expensive brands, however Hydratherapie is perfect for my hair!

            <li> The winter really took a toll on my hair and it is really dry but after only a few washes with this product I can tell a difference. Right after I rinsed out the conditioner my hair felt softer and I had no tangles.

            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased from Amazon. The shipping and price information were both accurate. I will defiantly buy more items from this website.</li>
            <li> i absolutley LOVE biolage! it makes your hair silky and shiny and the price is unbelieavable!!! get compliments daily with this product!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter who really likes it.  I have used it in the past and like it, as well.  I don&#x27;t think it is of the quality of Wen or B&amp;B for example, but it is better than store brands and is priced very reasonably.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  I was too lazy/busy to get to the store before a trip and I ordered it throug Amazon.  The price was better than most stores and I received it in 2 days.  What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> I think they changed the formula. My hair drys out more now and gets tangled more. I have to use more conditioner to get the comb through my curly hair. I have long soft curly hair.</li>
            <li> Great service and great price. I received shampoo and conditioner for a great price in a lovely travel bag with travel bottles included.</li>
            <li> So my gf got this for herself and I can immediately tell the difference. Im a guy and dont really know what the terms are for her hair and how it is, but she deffinitely has better smoothness in it. Her hair shines more as well! I&#x27;d say that whatever this product claims is very true! Worth every penny!</li>
