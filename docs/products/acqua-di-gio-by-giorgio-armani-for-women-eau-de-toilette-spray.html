            <li> (the new fragrance aqua di giogia is a little bit sweeter than this one).</li>
            <li> In any case, even if it is legit, I don&#x27;t like receiving something personal enough that you spray it on your skin only to find out that it was already opened at least once</li>
            <li> This is my everyday perfume, and is exactly what I was expecting, is hard to find it in the stores anymore</li>
            <li> just like I received it without further destroying the package - which is what made me suspicious).</li>
            <li> and now I have a bottle of perfume that has already been opened at least once before I got it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid I received a counterfeit product, or worse, something that was tampered with and perhaps diluted or replaced with a cheaper fragrance.  </li>
            <li> The product appears to be a fake.</li>
            <li> However, it came from NJ, took a week to get here (even as Prime customer) but the weather was bad, so</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t disappointed!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Horrible buy.</li>

            <li> Clean smelling always get compliments on this perfume.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fake..and box is for the men&#x27;s cologne not the women&#x27;s as indicated..do not buy!</li>
            <li> My wife likes fragrances and I actually bought this from Amazon as the retailer, because I figured they would ship me legitimate product.  However, it came from NJ, took a week to get here (even as Prime customer) but the weather was bad, so I figured I&#x27;d give them a pass.  Tomorrow is my wife&#x27;s birthday and now I have a bottle of perfume that has already been opened at least once before I got it.  When I sprayed it in the office and asked the woman that recommended it to me to tell me what she thought, she felt it wasn&#x27;t the right stuff.  She reportedly said hers didn&#x27;t smell like that.  I&#x27;m afraid I received a counterfeit product, or worse, something that was tampered with and perhaps diluted or replaced with a cheaper fragrance.  I personally don&#x27;t like the way the product smells, but I don&#x27;t have a reference to compare it to.  In any case, even if it is legit, I don&#x27;t like receiving something personal enough that you spray it on your skin only to find out that it was already opened at least once (The plastic over-wrap was torn on the bottom and I could open it without having to break any of the seals and I was actually able to &amp;#34;repackage it&amp;#34; just like I received it without further destroying the package - which is what made me suspicious).</li>
            <li> Bought this for my gf for xmas. I ordered it on the 18th. Received it on the 23rd of dec.&lt;br /&gt;It lasts forever and she smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister for Christmas .&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s her favorite.&lt;br /&gt;For some reason they don&#x27;t sell it is stores anymore.&lt;br /&gt;So to find it and at such a great price .&lt;br /&gt;Was a great surprise.</li>
            <li> This is my everyday perfume, and is exactly what I was expecting, is hard to find it in the stores anymore (the new fragrance aqua di giogia is a little bit sweeter than this one). So, I decided  to buy this perfume online, and I love it!</li>

            <li> Great price and smell</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister as a gift. She really likes it. Amazon has a good price on this.</li>
            <li> AWESOME!  Will keep purchasing this on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Not the scent I remember it to be, for some reason this bottle smelled very strong giving me a headache. Very dissapointed since it is my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> Smells like a flower shop mixed with a nursing home, this can&#x27;t be authentic. Horrible buy. I am very disappointed. Do not waste your money on this one folks</li>
            <li> My favourite perfume!</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this spray. Very light and clean. I wish there was lotion and body talc available.</li>
            <li> The product appears to be a fake. It does not smell the same as supposedly identical product in Macy store.</li>
            <li> Love Giorgio Armani Women&#x27;s Di Gio  smells Great!</li>
            <li> Having never used this perfume before, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. I knew it was a 50/50 chance I&#x27;d like it, but I loved the men&#x27;s version, so thought this would be good too. I wasn&#x27;t disappointed! It is stronger than my favorite, Lucky You, but has a nice scent that reminds me of something floral. I will buy again!</li>
