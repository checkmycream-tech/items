            <li>so worth it!!!!</li>
            <li>That being said some are better than others and this is one is very good.  </li>
            <li>I would leave plenty of good ventilation when using just in case.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something that smelled good and also was inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Like all HEM, it gives off a good amount of ash.  </li>
            <li>This smells so good.</li>
            <li>However, I still thought it smelt good</li>
            <li>I love vanilla and this HEM incense smells great and a good buy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very nice quality incense, as it burns for a good amount of time, and the smell is okay.</li>
            <li>The product is good and they burn nice, we just don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>

            <li>Even my cat seems to love it!</li>

            <li>Absolutely aromatically perfect!!!  </li>
            <li>This item comes nicely packed.</li>
            <li>Great product, Just buy it if you are looking for the best french vanilla that you have ever</li>
            <li>Very strong smell.</li>
            <li>Very good sweet vanilla smell (not like the terribly sweet vanilla scents that have the popular, overpowering &amp;#34;sugar&amp;#34; scent in them,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my favorite incense I own, but I do like it and burn it often.</li>
            <li>I will say, it does give off quite a deal of smoke so if you are sensitive to that, these may not be the best bet.</li>
            <li>This one is a nice warm sweet vanilla.</li>
            <li>Comes with so many incense for so little which is awesome and smells really good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be getting more once I run out</li>
            <li>but it comes with so many it&#x27;ll take a while</li>
            <li>but okay with ventilation.</li>
            <li>My mom loves it, she is really satisfied.</li>
            <li>was the next best option.</li>
            <li>It is the best if you (like me) prefer home smells such as coffee or cinnamon.  </li>
            <li>The scent is okay.</li>
            <li>Love the smell.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and the packaging was great.</li>
            <li>I think that the price was okay</li>
            <li>It smells okay.</li>
            <li>But before you light it, it smells kind of like pepper..</li>
            <li>I love this scent.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>This smells better than most incense.</li>
            <li>Overall wonderful and will buy these again once I run out!</li>
            <li>my best present ..</li>
            <li>I know it is, but I was thinking it would be more like a vanilla candle or air freshner.</li>
            <li>more words</li>
            <li>more words</li>
            <li>more words required.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t your exotic incense</li>
            <li>We love incense but this aroma did not work for us.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found better from the incense man on the street.</li>
            <li>Now i want ice cream :)</li>
            <li>A sweet and soft scent HEM makes the best quality incense</li>
            <li>These are definitely a good deal and if you really like incense, you may want to buy two boxes at once!</li>
            <li>but they are pretty good.</li>
            <li>A very true vanilla scent.</li>
            <li>Smells good but burns fast.</li>
            <li>very good smell... not very Vanilla-ish smell at the very begging but as it burns its very nice.</li>
            <li>Could be rather strong for some.</li>
            <li>Smell isnt&#x27; too strong on these. . .</li>
            <li>There is also a fair bit of smoke, far more than I am used to.  </li>
            <li>In general HEM incense is great.  </li>
            <li>Wish is was a more true vanilla scent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty inexpensive and it really smells great.</li>
            <li>She is quite happy, we will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>The ends of these sticks didn&#x27;t fit into the incense holder I purchased.</li>
            <li>I am definitely a fan of this scent, great product.</li>
            <li>Some of the sticks are square and won&#x27;t fit in my burner, they last a good while and the smell is okay.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and I am overall very happy with the product.</li>
            <li>love it, it has good smell, and lights throughout the stick without extinguishing in the middle</li>
            <li>This incense has a very sweet smell , but its pleasant enough.</li>
            <li>and I will order more as the price is very reasonable for a fine incense.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think too many people have burned their house down with incense LOL</li>
            <li>I love it so much!</li>
            <li>Would be five stars in product more consistent.</li>
            <li>Burns fairly clean.  </li>
            <li>Clean burning, and well rolled.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how clean burning they are.</li>
            <li>I always use HEM incense and the French Vanilla is a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>Very nice smell and it l√°stima for a long time</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a deep and very masculine vanilla, and a very pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li>though - this is a gentle refreshing vanilla)</li>
            <li>Sweet aroma, warming atmosphere.</li>
            <li>Was very weary in buying this, but I&#x27;m glad I did..</li>
            <li>The vanilla is a good quality scent but at the same time the odor doesn&#x27;t overpower you at all.  </li>
            <li>I own several scents and each is unique.  </li>
            <li>Pretty Good, different stick to stick.</li>
            <li>The aroma is very pleasant and subtle.  </li>
            <li>and I am very thrilled with these the sticks never break and the smoke isn&#x27;t too thick and strong</li>
            <li>It is worth the money.</li>
            <li>well I bought 4 scents in this brand and so far am well satisfied with them all</li>
            <li>i love having my home filled with the scent of french Vanilla and almost all the fragances of Hem Line</li>
            <li>It leaves a nice scent in the house after burning, so I&#x27;ll use these but will probably try something else next time.</li>
            <li>The scent is very French vanilla nice</li>
            <li>I have found most of the varieties of HEM products I try are a good quality with subtle scents.</li>
            <li>good way to get other scents out of the house without it smelling like an ashram</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of vanilla comes through.  </li>
            <li>Smell amazing although a little too strong depending on the person</li>
            <li>But, it smells good and makes my kitchen smell less like onions and garlic after the meal is done.</li>
            <li>Beautiful aroma- doesn&#x27;t have that typical &amp;#34;hippie shop&amp;#34; smell, but a soft vanilla that doesn&#x27;t overpower.</li>
            <li>The smell is a very intense *almost vanilla smell.</li>
            <li>It was hard for her to find great insense in the store so online</li>
            <li>but when you first light it, it emits dark smoke that stained the top of the shelf it was sitting under.</li>
            <li>French vanilla incense can  lift any mood i love it</li>
            <li>Over all I love this scent and have bought it several times.</li>
            <li>I am always skeptical of vanilla scents however these smell awesome.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very different from the Patchouli that I use most of the time.</li>
            <li>you love the smell of French Vanilla</li>
            <li>We got the white box and will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would highly recommend this HEM incense!!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a lot more black soot that comes off of them when you first light them, so</li>
            <li>It always has a strong scent without the general chemical smell of some incenses.  </li>
            <li>It smelled potent and floral not so much like french vanilla.</li>
            <li>The incense scent is much more flowery than I like, I have purchased a different type that burns with a very calming scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but doesn&#x27;t really smell like French Vanilla to me.</li>
            <li>When they first arrived, my boyfriend laughed at me for getting such a large quantity of them, but once they were lit he took it back!</li>
            <li>Would purchase it again, but as it is only sold as an add on item, make sure you purchase something light weight with it so same problem wont happen to you.</li>
            <li>and I now have a large supply.</li>
            <li>Individual tubes make great little gifts to friends.</li>
            <li>It smells just like the real thing.  </li>
            <li>The smell is not quite what I expected but It is ok</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much cooler to me to burn incense than buy those overpriced scented candles.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>The scent is very lght.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very comforting.</li>
            <li>It has a much lighter aroma.</li>
            <li>and they burn very well, so</li>
            <li>no matter how much she cleans the litter box</li>
            <li>You cannot go wrong with this smell and precious rose from HEM.</li>
            <li>Smell is good, just lost a couple stars because it was shipped with a heavy bookshelf for some reason, and got crushed and lost 40 sticks out of the 120 it originally included.</li>
            <li>, it leave a strong but not over whelming scent, and it doesn‚Äôt trigger minor allergies like some scents.  </li>
            <li>I usually  two sticks, which really gives you a nice vanilla scent.  </li>
            <li>It burns nice and slow and truly does set a peaceful atmosphere.</li>
            <li>Lovely light scent, not too heavy but definitely noticeable.</li>
            <li>Great scent and burns slow for several minutes.  </li>
            <li>Only downside is they burn rather quickly.</li>
            <li>They are decent-</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I recommend &amp;#34;FRENCH VANILLA&amp;#34; over regular vanilla because in my case, this one smells much sweeter</li>
            <li>pefect game old of course had to keep trying it over and over but works as expected and would buy more!!</li>
            <li>Smokes black quite a bit when you light it, but it lights quick, so you don&#x27;t have to wait as long as other incense to blow it out to smolder.</li>
            <li>In less than 10 minutes one stick had half of my apartment and especially my room where it was in use smelled amazing.  </li>
            <li>There the nice black ones that burn alot and slow.  </li>
            <li>I did not like the scent at first, but after trying these a few times I do like it now.  </li>
            <li>Burns a little fast but not a deal breaker.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> She is quite happy, we will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> The ends of these sticks didn&#x27;t fit into the incense holder I purchased.</li>
            <li> I am definitely a fan of this scent, great product.</li>
            <li> Some of the sticks are square and won&#x27;t fit in my burner, they last a good while and the smell is okay.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and I am overall very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> love it, it has good smell, and lights throughout the stick without extinguishing in the middle</li>
            <li> This incense has a very sweet smell , but its pleasant enough.</li>
            <li> and I will order more as the price is very reasonable for a fine incense.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think too many people have burned their house down with incense LOL</li>
            <li> I love it so much!</li>
            <li> Would be five stars in product more consistent.</li>
            <li> Burns fairly clean.  </li>
            <li> Clean burning, and well rolled.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how clean burning they are.</li>
            <li> I always use HEM incense and the French Vanilla is a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Very nice smell and it l√°stima for a long time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a deep and very masculine vanilla, and a very pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> though - this is a gentle refreshing vanilla)</li>
            <li> Sweet aroma, warming atmosphere.</li>
            <li> Was very weary in buying this, but I&#x27;m glad I did..</li>
            <li> The vanilla is a good quality scent but at the same time the odor doesn&#x27;t overpower you at all.  </li>
            <li> I own several scents and each is unique.  </li>
            <li> Pretty Good, different stick to stick.</li>
            <li> The aroma is very pleasant and subtle.  </li>
            <li> and I am very thrilled with these the sticks never break and the smoke isn&#x27;t too thick and strong</li>
            <li> It is worth the money.</li>
            <li> well I bought 4 scents in this brand and so far am well satisfied with them all</li>
            <li> i love having my home filled with the scent of french Vanilla and almost all the fragances of Hem Line</li>
            <li> It leaves a nice scent in the house after burning, so I&#x27;ll use these but will probably try something else next time.</li>
            <li> The scent is very French vanilla nice</li>
            <li> I have found most of the varieties of HEM products I try are a good quality with subtle scents.</li>
            <li> good way to get other scents out of the house without it smelling like an ashram</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of vanilla comes through.  </li>
            <li> Smell amazing although a little too strong depending on the person</li>
            <li> But, it smells good and makes my kitchen smell less like onions and garlic after the meal is done.</li>
            <li> Beautiful aroma- doesn&#x27;t have that typical &amp;#34;hippie shop&amp;#34; smell, but a soft vanilla that doesn&#x27;t overpower.</li>
            <li> The smell is a very intense *almost vanilla smell.</li>
            <li> It was hard for her to find great insense in the store so online</li>
            <li> but when you first light it, it emits dark smoke that stained the top of the shelf it was sitting under.</li>
            <li> French vanilla incense can  lift any mood i love it</li>
            <li> Over all I love this scent and have bought it several times.</li>
            <li> I am always skeptical of vanilla scents however these smell awesome.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very different from the Patchouli that I use most of the time.</li>
            <li> you love the smell of French Vanilla</li>
            <li> We got the white box and will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would highly recommend this HEM incense!!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a lot more black soot that comes off of them when you first light them, so</li>
            <li> It always has a strong scent without the general chemical smell of some incenses.  </li>
            <li> It smelled potent and floral not so much like french vanilla.</li>
            <li> The incense scent is much more flowery than I like, I have purchased a different type that burns with a very calming scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but doesn&#x27;t really smell like French Vanilla to me.</li>
            <li> When they first arrived, my boyfriend laughed at me for getting such a large quantity of them, but once they were lit he took it back!</li>
            <li> Would purchase it again, but as it is only sold as an add on item, make sure you purchase something light weight with it so same problem wont happen to you.</li>
            <li> and I now have a large supply.</li>
            <li> Individual tubes make great little gifts to friends.</li>
            <li> It smells just like the real thing.  </li>
            <li> The smell is not quite what I expected but It is ok</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much cooler to me to burn incense than buy those overpriced scented candles.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The scent is very lght.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very comforting.</li>
            <li> It has a much lighter aroma.</li>
            <li> and they burn very well, so</li>
            <li> no matter how much she cleans the litter box</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with this smell and precious rose from HEM.</li>
            <li> Smell is good, just lost a couple stars because it was shipped with a heavy bookshelf for some reason, and got crushed and lost 40 sticks out of the 120 it originally included.</li>
            <li> , it leave a strong but not over whelming scent, and it doesn‚Äôt trigger minor allergies like some scents.  </li>
            <li> I usually  two sticks, which really gives you a nice vanilla scent.  </li>
            <li> It burns nice and slow and truly does set a peaceful atmosphere.</li>
            <li> Lovely light scent, not too heavy but definitely noticeable.</li>
            <li> Great scent and burns slow for several minutes.  </li>
            <li> Only downside is they burn rather quickly.</li>
            <li> They are decent-</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I recommend &amp;#34;FRENCH VANILLA&amp;#34; over regular vanilla because in my case, this one smells much sweeter</li>
            <li> pefect game old of course had to keep trying it over and over but works as expected and would buy more!!</li>
            <li> Smokes black quite a bit when you light it, but it lights quick, so you don&#x27;t have to wait as long as other incense to blow it out to smolder.</li>
            <li> In less than 10 minutes one stick had half of my apartment and especially my room where it was in use smelled amazing.  </li>
            <li> There the nice black ones that burn alot and slow.  </li>
            <li> I did not like the scent at first, but after trying these a few times I do like it now.  </li>
            <li> Burns a little fast but not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, but not good either.</li>
            <li> There is no fake-perfume smell that usually plague other incense products.&lt;br /&gt;Burns at an average speed for incense and the lovely smell lingers for several hours.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t timed how long they last, but I would say probably 20-25 minutes or so.</li>
            <li> high quality with subtle scent that does not overwhelm</li>
            <li> Love vanilla but some just smell bad.</li>
            <li> It did not smell even remotely like vanilla.  </li>
            <li> It is a little too sweet, which makes it smell extremely fake.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance was a little strange.</li>
            <li> Not quite the vanilla scent I was expecting as other reviewers noted.</li>
            <li> Some neighbors from other countries cook food with unsatisfactory smells to Americans.</li>
            <li> The scent of the incense is too sharp.  </li>
            <li> would recommend this product to others, as well as other HEM products.</li>
            <li> It is enough to fill a two small to medium sized rooms.  </li>
            <li> The product has a few quirks and some boxes are difficult to use due to extremely thin and splitting sticks that can&#x27;t support their own weight in a holder.</li>
            <li> the vanilla fragrance seems to last quite a while and does not have a hard, woody type smell that a lot of incense have.  </li>
            <li> I like this brand, and this scent didn&#x27;t let me down.</li>
            <li> I have to shave down the ends each time I use it.</li>
            <li> A little too per-fumy,</li>
            <li> Over mere traditional scents.  </li>
            <li> Not sure I need the amount provided in this box.  </li>
            <li> Some sticks burned through in less then 5 minutes and the scent is very weak.  </li>
            <li> It was not a pleasant vanilla smell like I was expecting.  </li>
            <li> I can even use it in the office without irritating anyone.</li>
            <li> Even in the sticks that burned longer the scent was very weak.  </li>
            <li> My SO has fairly bad allergies</li>
            <li> The smell does not linger or leave a bad after-smell.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is an awesome smelling incense. It is worth the money. You cannot go wrong with this smell and precious rose from HEM. the vanilla fragrance seems to last quite a while and does not have a hard, woody type smell that a lot of incense have.  It is not overbearing and is quite relaxful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t timed how long they last, but I would say probably 20-25 minutes or so. These are definitely a good deal and if you really like incense, you may want to buy two boxes at once!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of Vanilla and these sticks are wonderful.  Great scent and burns slow for several minutes.  Definitely will buy again!</li>
            <li> Smells greats and the odour spreads throughout the entire home. I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Comes with so many incense for so little which is awesome and smells really good I&#x27;ll be getting more once I run out but it comes with so many it&#x27;ll take a while</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful fragrance.  It smells just like the real thing.  I can&#x27;t determine the difference between the HEM French Vanilla and the regular HEM Vanilla. But in any event, both products are delightful.</li>
            <li> They smell great but when you first light it, it emits dark smoke that stained the top of the shelf it was sitting under. But if you have it in the open it obviously won&#x27;t be a problem</li>
            <li> Very strong smell. Could be rather strong for some. Smells quite like toasted, kinda burnt vanilla (obviously)</li>
            <li> Very nice smell and it l√°stima for a long time</li>
            <li> A little too per-fumy, but okay with ventilation.</li>
            <li> Smells good but burns fast.</li>
            <li> Smell is good, just lost a couple stars because it was shipped with a heavy bookshelf for some reason, and got crushed and lost 40 sticks out of the 120 it originally included. Would purchase it again, but as it is only sold as an add on item, make sure you purchase something light weight with it so same problem wont happen to you.</li>
            <li> The smell is not quite what I expected but It is ok</li>
            <li> I like this brand, and this scent didn&#x27;t let me down. It&#x27;s so much cooler to me to burn incense than buy those overpriced scented candles. I don&#x27;t think too many people have burned their house down with incense LOL</li>
            <li> Beautiful aroma- doesn&#x27;t have that typical &amp;#34;hippie shop&amp;#34; smell, but a soft vanilla that doesn&#x27;t overpower. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice quality incense, as it burns for a good amount of time, and the smell is okay. It&#x27;s not my favorite incense I own, but I do like it and burn it often. Shipping was fast and I am overall very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> French vanilla incense can  lift any mood i love it</li>
            <li> My mom loves it, she is really satisfied. It was hard for her to find great insense in the store so online was the next best option. She is quite happy, we will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Absolutely aromatically perfect!!!  Just the right amount of vanilla comes through.  Will be bvuying more as needed!</li>
            <li> In general HEM incense is great.  It always has a strong scent without the general chemical smell of some incenses.  I own several scents and each is unique.  That being said some are better than others and this is one is very good.  Well‚Ä¶. It is the best if you (like me) prefer home smells such as coffee or cinnamon.  Over mere traditional scents.  It has a very nice Vanilla smells which I love, it leave a strong but not over whelming scent, and it doesn‚Äôt trigger minor allergies like some scents.  Over all I love this scent and have bought it several times.</li>
            <li> Love vanilla but some just smell bad. This one is a nice warm sweet vanilla. Burns a little fast but not a deal breaker. Would recommend</li>
            <li> love it, it has good smell, and lights throughout the stick without extinguishing in the middle</li>
            <li> The ends of these sticks didn&#x27;t fit into the incense holder I purchased. I have to shave down the ends each time I use it. The scent is okay. Not quite the vanilla scent I was expecting as other reviewers noted.</li>
            <li> Very good sweet vanilla smell (not like the terribly sweet vanilla scents that have the popular, overpowering &amp;#34;sugar&amp;#34; scent in them, though - this is a gentle refreshing vanilla) Individual tubes make great little gifts to friends. Smokes black quite a bit when you light it, but it lights quick, so you don&#x27;t have to wait as long as other incense to blow it out to smolder.</li>
            <li> The package came on time which was wonderful but it wasn&#x27;t necessarily the smell I excpected. It smelled potent and floral not so much like french vanilla.</li>
            <li> This item comes nicely packed. The scent is very lght. I usually  two sticks, which really gives you a nice vanilla scent.  Burns fairly clean.  Will try another scent.</li>
            <li> Love the smell.  There the nice black ones that burn alot and slow.  Very nice</li>
            <li> This smells like great vanilla, and grandma&#x27;s house. I love it. It&#x27;s very comforting. Clean burning, and well rolled. The shipping was fast and the packaging was great. I will order again.</li>
            <li> Very nice and pleasant smelling.</li>
            <li> I think that the price was okay and I now have a large supply. This incense has a very sweet smell , but its pleasant enough.</li>
            <li> This is probably as close as you can get to vanilla with incense. It&#x27;s not bad, but not good either. I&#x27;m sticking to Vanilla-scented candles.</li>
            <li> It smells okay. But before you light it, it smells kind of like pepper..</li>
            <li> smells just like vanilla I love it so much! so worth it!!!! I recommend it to anyone who enjoys incense and vanilla!!! amazing!</li>
            <li> It has a much lighter aroma. I don&#x27;t like incense to smell like a flower shop, but this is great!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a lot in here and they burn very well, so this is a great price. The smell is good, but not the greatest vanilla I&#x27;ve ever experienced. There&#x27;s a lot more black soot that comes off of them when you first light them, so I don&#x27;t know how clean burning they are. I would leave plenty of good ventilation when using just in case.</li>
            <li> I love this scent. Would burn it 24/7 if I could. The product has a few quirks and some boxes are difficult to use due to extremely thin and splitting sticks that can&#x27;t support their own weight in a holder. Would be five stars in product more consistent.</li>
            <li> I am definitely a fan of this scent, great product. I will be ordering more. This smells better than most incense. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love vanilla and this HEM incense smells great and a good buy.</li>
            <li> pefect game old of course had to keep trying it over and over but works as expected and would buy more!!</li>
            <li> I like my house to smell great. Some neighbors from other countries cook food with unsatisfactory smells to Americans. This helps to eradicate them.</li>
            <li> Vanilla! one of my favorites--this is well-scented and burns well I bought 4 scents in this brand and so far am well satisfied with them all</li>
            <li> Sweet aroma, warming atmosphere. I recommend &amp;#34;FRENCH VANILLA&amp;#34; over regular vanilla because in my case, this one smells much sweeter and it&#x27;s more pleasant. I bought both versions at the same time to compare them, that is why I say it.</li>
            <li> good way to get other scents out of the house without it smelling like an ashram</li>
            <li> high quality with subtle scent that does not overwhelm</li>
            <li> Smell isnt&#x27; too strong on these. . .</li>
            <li> Their aroma is so relaxing</li>
            <li> Lovely light scent, not too heavy but definitely noticeable.</li>
            <li> Love this! It smells great! I was looking for something that smelled good and also was inexpensive. This was perfect. It smells just like vanilla. My SO has fairly bad allergies but this does not affect them at all. The smell does not linger or leave a bad after-smell. I will say, it does give off quite a deal of smoke so if you are sensitive to that, these may not be the best bet. Overall wonderful and will buy these again once I run out!</li>
            <li> my best present .. i love having my home filled with the scent of french Vanilla and almost all the fragances of Hem Line</li>
            <li> I always use HEM incense and the French Vanilla is a pleasant smell. I can even use it in the office without irritating anyone.</li>
            <li> I am always skeptical of vanilla scents however these smell awesome. Only downside is they burn rather quickly.</li>
            <li> Smells like vanilla!  Like all HEM, it gives off a good amount of ash.  But, it smells good and makes my kitchen smell less like onions and garlic after the meal is done.</li>
            <li> I love this incense! It&#x27;s a deep and very masculine vanilla, and a very pleasant fragrance. It burns well, as is my experience with HEM incense.</li>
            <li> A sweet and soft scent HEM makes the best quality incense and I am very thrilled with these the sticks never break and the smoke isn&#x27;t too thick and strong</li>
            <li> Wish is was a more true vanilla scent.  Still smells like a burning stick of incense.  I know it is, but I was thinking it would be more like a vanilla candle or air freshner.</li>
            <li> While this is a great value, it seems to be so for a reason.  The smell is a very intense *almost vanilla smell. It is a little too sweet, which makes it smell extremely fake.  There is also a fair bit of smoke, far more than I am used to.  I had to open all of the doors in my house to get the smoke to dissipate to prevent the smoke alarm from going off. I will be looking for different vanilla incense in the future.</li>
            <li> no smell of any vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;View tips and guidelines |  more words required.&lt;br /&gt;View tips and guidelines |  more words required.&lt;br /&gt;View tips and guidelines |  more words required.</li>
            <li> Great product, Just buy it if you are looking for the best french vanilla that you have ever burned!&lt;br /&gt;  R Oswalt</li>
            <li> I did not like the scent at first, but after trying these a few times I do like it now.  It&#x27;s very different from the Patchouli that I use most of the time. It leaves a nice scent in the house after burning, so I&#x27;ll use these but will probably try something else next time.</li>
            <li> This was packaged very nicely but the smell isn&#x27;t all that great</li>
            <li> The scent of the incense is too sharp.  The incense scent is much more flowery than I like, I have purchased a different type that burns with a very calming scent.</li>
            <li> Smells HEAVENLY!  Just wonderful.</li>
            <li> Some of the sticks are square and won&#x27;t fit in my burner, they last a good while and the smell is okay.  They aren&#x27;t your exotic incense but they are pretty good.</li>
            <li> Pretty Good, different stick to stick.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best incense that I have ever used. It&#x27;s pretty inexpensive and it really smells great. I bought it for my Mom since she has a cat and no matter how much she cleans the litter box, there&#x27;s is always somewhat of a smell. This stuff doesn&#x27;t just mask the smell, but it also covers it and the scent remains for a couple hours after the flame burns out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to others, as well as other HEM products. Their cherry Vanilla and Butterscotch are awesome as well!</li>
            <li> This smells so good. It changed my opinion of incense forever.</li>
            <li> The fragrance was a little strange. I didn&#x27;t think it smelt like french vanilla at all. However, I still thought it smelt good so I&#x27;ve continued to use this incense.</li>
            <li> Was very weary in buying this, but I&#x27;m glad I did.. .If you love the smell of French Vanilla this is it!</li>
            <li> Stunk like soap.  I gave it away to a friend.  It did not smell even remotely like vanilla.  I think they mis-labeled the box!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy these again.  Some sticks burned through in less then 5 minutes and the scent is very weak.  Even in the sticks that burned longer the scent was very weak.  Would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> We love incense but this aroma did not work for us.  It was not a pleasant vanilla smell like I was expecting.  The product is good and they burn nice, we just don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells AMAZING. We got the white box and will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> In less than 10 minutes one stick had half of my apartment and especially my room where it was in use smelled amazing.  It burns nice and slow and truly does set a peaceful atmosphere. Even my cat seems to love it!</li>
            <li> These smell SO GOOD! When they first arrived, my boyfriend laughed at me for getting such a large quantity of them, but once they were lit he took it back! They smell like something delicious baking. A very true vanilla scent.</li>
            <li> Smell amazing although a little too strong depending on the person</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but doesn&#x27;t really smell like French Vanilla to me. I&#x27;ve found better from the incense man on the street.</li>
            <li> very good smell... not very Vanilla-ish smell at the very begging but as it burns its very nice. Now i want ice cream :)</li>
            <li> This item was packaged very nicely in six separate boxes, wrapped in plastic, and arrived very quickly. The scent is very French vanilla nice and I will order more as the price is very reasonable for a fine incense.</li>
            <li> OMG...  NOW THIS SMELLS LIKE VANILLA!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit like someone smoking a pipe of vanilla flavored tobacco.</li>
            <li> Not sure I need the amount provided in this box.  Will take me years to use them all.  They are decent- but not sure exactly smell like french vanilla.</li>
            <li> Almost out need to reorder</li>
            <li> The aroma is very pleasant and subtle.  It is enough to fill a two small to medium sized rooms.  The vanilla is a good quality scent but at the same time the odor doesn&#x27;t overpower you at all.  I have found most of the varieties of HEM products I try are a good quality with subtle scents.</li>
            <li> Beautiful vanilla aroma!!!  There is no fake-perfume smell that usually plague other incense products.&lt;br /&gt;Burns at an average speed for incense and the lovely smell lingers for several hours.&lt;br /&gt;I have two cats and this works wonders for odor control in the household.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend this HEM incense!!</li>
