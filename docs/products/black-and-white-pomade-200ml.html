            <li>I am very excited that I found it!</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li>The tub gives you a nice quantity.</li>
            <li>One of the best things I like about this pomade is that it washes out pretty easily.  </li>
            <li>The scent is amazing, however the hold isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>For me it&#x27;s  simply the best.</li>
            <li>Works better than the water soluble stuff</li>
            <li>and if I use more, I can have a lot of shine.</li>
            <li>The smell is interesting:  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>If you want a shine and be able to have a hold this is it.</li>
            <li>it also smells pretty good...</li>
            <li>Frankly it&#x27;s pretty good on</li>
            <li>It does have a strong scent that it would be even better without but it will lessen throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>I would definetly love to have an unscented version available.</li>
            <li>The price is good for a can this size, but I doubt I will continue to use it for much longer.</li>
            <li>Love the clean scent (Cocconut &amp; something else)</li>
            <li>Although its waterproof it does seem to wash out easy in the shower which is a plus...</li>
            <li>Keeps hair pliable for easy recombing.</li>
            <li>it just isn&#x27;t as strong as Murray&#x27;s</li>
            <li>okay hold nothing special</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it all, Murray&#x27;s, Murray&#x27;s Super Light, DAX, Layrite, Royal Crown, Brylcreem, Groom and Clean, and many more, just to try to get a good classic hairstyle.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery product is awsome will purchase more</li>
            <li>thought Lucky 13 Swagger was my favorite cream style pomade.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing on it&#x27;s own or  if you mix it with different  pomades.</li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>Great for cooler weather or when you want to restyle your hair later.  </li>
            <li>, I have plenty of light pomades and hair dressings which could fill that in, if needed.  </li>
            <li>and I found this to be far superior than Murray&#x27;s in every way (for my tastes).</li>
            <li>Works fine for my hair, smells clean, medium hold.</li>
            <li>super good old school</li>
            <li>Its worth every penny but come on!</li>
            <li>If its good enough for Elvis its good enough for me.</li>
            <li>Good price for a highly regarded and good quality classic American product...</li>
            <li>It goes in smoothly and slicks my hair back nicely.</li>
            <li>it arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>To be sure, this is the stuff Elvis used to get his classic pomp.</li>
            <li>If it is hot out, though, it may be to light.</li>
            <li>I moved across country and haven&#x27;t been able to find this product in the city where i currently live, so i&#x27;ve had to purchase it online.</li>
            <li>My very first thought upon my very first use of this was &amp;#34;I could have been using this stuff during every decade of my entire life.&amp;#34; For a pomade, this product is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s worth the sacrifice.</li>
            <li>More teenager or early twenties at a relaxed job.</li>
            <li>It really isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>It washes out just as easily as any &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; non-water-based pomade I&#x27;ve used, maybe even a little more easily.</li>
            <li>As for hold, I started needing to reapply a new coat four hours in, which isn&#x27;t something I can easily do when I&#x27;m working.</li>
            <li>Old school, old fashioned light-weight cr√®me pomade for high shine and medium control of tidy, tight, clean barbershop cuts which are best slicked for a no-nonsense, masculine appearance.</li>
            <li>so brings me to a conlcusion that this could be the next buyers favorite pomade ever</li>
            <li>Great hold even for thick hair...</li>
            <li>Anyway, this stuff is a real classic and if it were easier to get ahold of, I would use it all the time.</li>
            <li>and I get a nice wet greasy shine every time.</li>
            <li>The trendy old fashion styles that many younger guys are wearing now, I was already sporting back then</li>
            <li>If you have thick short hair, this is the best pomade!</li>
            <li>It has pretty good hold for a small pompadour.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t quite understand all of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>, Elvis is said to have used it, that pretty much says it all.</li>
            <li>It also does not have strong hold, so if you&#x27;re looking for that strong hold, you might want use in combo with a heavy pomade.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to wash off, which is a definite plus.</li>
            <li>Even after using large amounts, hair manageability leaves something to be desired.  </li>
            <li>but it certainly isn&#x27;t a deal breaker.</li>
            <li>i wish i discovered it in the 80&#x27;s when i was into the whole Rockabilly thing.</li>
            <li>Really greasy.</li>
            <li>Wich means alot of peopel really like it</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>If you use to much your hair can look greasy.  </li>
            <li>Also very greasy to me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice the coconut scent once it&#x27;s in my hair..</li>
            <li>I have generally straight hair with tons of cowlicks and sweeps).  </li>
            <li>but frankly it doesn&#x27;t really produce that much shine (which I was expecting based on that one fact)..</li>
            <li>if you have straight hair it will do the job.</li>
            <li>(but then again nothing beats the hold of Murrays Superior) or other similar pomades.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t wash out very easily of course, but that&#x27;s expected from an old school pomade.</li>
            <li>my barber used this on me the past 2 cuts and i love it!</li>
            <li>This is a classic, straight forward product that doesn&#x27;t need fancy labels or ads to pump it up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a collector of many pomaded and this hands down is one of my favorites...</li>
            <li>This gave me that classic fifties pompadour.</li>
            <li>THE SMELL makes for a classic pomade product.</li>
            <li>wonder this is a Classic.</li>
            <li>A classic pomade that can get the job done.</li>
            <li>and you can always add a little more if needed.</li>
            <li>As far as middle-of-the-road pomades go, this one is a real winner..  </li>
            <li>It goes in smooth and keeps hair shiny wet and greasy all day.</li>
            <li>Black &amp; White Pomade works much better then most of the other pomades on the market.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t expensive and it is very effective.</li>
            <li>Apparently from the late 19th century, It&#x27;s not too stiff, it&#x27;s easy to get through the hair, and it has pretty decent hold (not like murrays or the red dax but good for my needs -</li>
            <li>For the price it&#x27;s well worth it, this lasts me a long time, up to five months.</li>
            <li>They say Elvis Presley used this pomade, but with how weak the hold is and how medium the shine is I kind of doubt it.</li>
            <li>It holds hair shape all day and its not stiff and crunchy ..</li>
            <li>to actually stay in my hair and make a difference the whole day.</li>
            <li>Hair is soft and not sticky.  </li>
            <li>For a professional or adult this is not the smell for you.</li>
            <li>I have only used a few petroleum based pomades, this being the most undesirable of the bunch.  </li>
            <li>If I use a little, I can have more of a dry look</li>
            <li>If I could change anything it would be the smell which is a little too sweet for my liking</li>
            <li>the product sort of builds-up in the hair as it doesn&#x27;t wash out with water, at least not very easily, for those that wish to de-dress it buy a good shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>As with many medium hold (and the hard stuff) pomades, it&#x27;s still a bit tricky to get this out in the shower, but if you&#x27;re here reading this then that&#x27;s probably what you want in a product like this anyway, so stay greasy!  </li>
            <li>Like similar products, it doesn&#x27;t wash out completely with one shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Other petroleum products (Lockharts in particular) seem to absorb into the hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard about Black &amp; White for years, but since its hard to find in the US, never was able to try it until I ordered it thru Amazon.</li>

            <li> As far as middle-of-the-road pomades go, this one is a real winner..  </li>
            <li> It goes in smooth and keeps hair shiny wet and greasy all day.</li>
            <li> Black &amp; White Pomade works much better then most of the other pomades on the market.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t expensive and it is very effective.</li>
            <li> Apparently from the late 19th century, It&#x27;s not too stiff, it&#x27;s easy to get through the hair, and it has pretty decent hold (not like murrays or the red dax but good for my needs -</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s well worth it, this lasts me a long time, up to five months.</li>
            <li> They say Elvis Presley used this pomade, but with how weak the hold is and how medium the shine is I kind of doubt it.</li>
            <li> It holds hair shape all day and its not stiff and crunchy ..</li>
            <li> to actually stay in my hair and make a difference the whole day.</li>
            <li> Hair is soft and not sticky.  </li>
            <li> For a professional or adult this is not the smell for you.</li>
            <li> I have only used a few petroleum based pomades, this being the most undesirable of the bunch.  </li>
            <li> If I use a little, I can have more of a dry look</li>
            <li> If I could change anything it would be the smell which is a little too sweet for my liking</li>
            <li> the product sort of builds-up in the hair as it doesn&#x27;t wash out with water, at least not very easily, for those that wish to de-dress it buy a good shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> As with many medium hold (and the hard stuff) pomades, it&#x27;s still a bit tricky to get this out in the shower, but if you&#x27;re here reading this then that&#x27;s probably what you want in a product like this anyway, so stay greasy!  </li>
            <li> Like similar products, it doesn&#x27;t wash out completely with one shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Other petroleum products (Lockharts in particular) seem to absorb into the hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard about Black &amp; White for years, but since its hard to find in the US, never was able to try it until I ordered it thru Amazon.</li>
            <li> This pomade is probably better for people with thin hair, as it took way too much of the product to do anything to my short, thick hair.</li>
            <li> The smell is not bad or not good.</li>
            <li> B&amp;W. That being said, you cannot use too much because it gets slick then so be careful.</li>
            <li> Long time presence in the market</li>
            <li> they havnt gone out of buisness in a long time.</li>
            <li> Black &amp; White globs up and seems to only coat the hair.  </li>
            <li> However - Black and White tops it.</li>
            <li> In my opinion Black and White beats them all.</li>

            <li> I had tried a few classic grooming products (Brylcreem; Murray&#x27;s Pomade) in the past, but they were never right for me for various reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He has thick, naturally wavy hair, so it helps him manage and style.</li>
            <li> It goes into dry hair easily, which shocked me.</li>
            <li> Its a little greasy so a littl ebit goes a long way</li>
            <li> You can slick your hair back the Gatsby with this stuff.</li>
            <li> cannot compare this to any other pomade aside from Murray&#x27;s</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not to greasy like some of the other ones out there</li>
            <li> The scent is coconut, and a little too heavy for my taste, especially in the heat.</li>
            <li> but when i used it and used a comb small little white wax balls appeared from the wax.</li>
            <li> its the only thing that works on my thick and voluminous hair.</li>
            <li> It is a bit greasy and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot, but just a little will do.</li>
            <li> Like the ones that harden a little and my hair stays.</li>
            <li> so I need heavy duty</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> but i prefer the shine to the dull waxy build up of other pomades...</li>
            <li> its really really hard to wash out</li>
            <li> really hard to wash out.</li>

            <li> and I find it to be rather expensive!</li>
            <li> And it is very difficult to wash off your hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so bad after it has been in my hair fir a couple of days.</li>
            <li> The hold isn&#x27;t too bad</li>

            <li> Quick delivery product is awsome will purchase more</li>
            <li> This is what Elvis used on his hair! Look it up. This gave me that classic fifties pompadour. The scent is coconut, and a little too heavy for my taste, especially in the heat. However, it&#x27;s worth the sacrifice. This is a classic, straight forward product that doesn&#x27;t need fancy labels or ads to pump it up. Enjoy.</li>
            <li> The best pomade ever made...And Elvis used it!</li>
            <li> I had been using all of the pomades that i could find...im overseas and am unable to just go and purchase from a beauty supply store...i had tried Murray&#x27;s, DAX, even Motions Pomade, but they&#x27;re all soooooo thick and waxy...its really really hard to wash out and it builds up...using those products i noticed when i did wash and comb my hair, i began to develop dandruff...my barber used this on me the past 2 cuts and i love it! Its a little greasy so a littl ebit goes a long way but i prefer the shine to the dull waxy build up of other pomades...it also smells pretty good...again, i prefer the cocao like smell to waxy motor oil...</li>
            <li> Black &amp; White Pomade works much better then most of the other pomades on the market.  It holds hair shape all day and its not stiff and crunchy .. it smells great too!  Would recommend to others !</li>
            <li> Great for cooler weather or when you want to restyle your hair later.  This has been around for 90+ years for a reason.  Nice, pleasing smell and good hold.  If it is hot out, though, it may be to light.</li>
            <li> This product smells great, goes in easy and has helped me achieve the hair style I had in mind. I especially like the way the product sort of builds-up in the hair as it doesn&#x27;t wash out with water, at least not very easily, for those that wish to de-dress it buy a good shampoo and conditioner. Finally, like any pomade product i recommend to stay out of the sun or you will catch the notorious pomade drip on the forehead/neck areas. LOVE THE SMELL makes for a classic pomade product.</li>
            <li> If you have thick short hair, this is the best pomade! It isn&#x27;t expensive and it is very effective. It is the only one - and I&#x27;ve tried about 10 different kinds- to actually stay in my hair and make a difference the whole day. My sister works for a hair care company and I&#x27;ve tried all of those products but I keep going back to B&amp;W. That being said, you cannot use too much because it gets slick then so be careful. But give it a try!</li>
            <li> This is an American made product but not for sale in America? I&#x27;ve ordered it 5 times and it works great. Its worth every penny but come on! If its good enough for Elvis its good enough for me. I just wish I didn&#x27;t have to order it from another country!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been putting this stuff in my hair for the last 30 years, and nothing comes close to the hold and look that this provides. Hey, Elvis used it!</li>
            <li> I discovered this hair product back in the mid 90&#x27;s. The trendy old fashion styles that many younger guys are wearing now, I was already sporting back then and i needed good pomade, i found this by accident in a barber and hair salon supply shop. i wish i discovered it in the 80&#x27;s when i was into the whole Rockabilly thing. It is a bit greasy and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot, but just a little will do. It also has a coconut smell to, which i like. I moved across country and haven&#x27;t been able to find this product in the city where i currently live, so i&#x27;ve had to purchase it online. For the price it&#x27;s well worth it, this lasts me a long time, up to five months. For me it&#x27;s  simply the best.</li>
            <li> Good price for a highly regarded and good quality classic American product... Long time presence in the market, Elvis is said to have used it, that pretty much says it all.</li>
            <li> I received this last year and just haven&#x27;t written a review til now. It smells like coconut and crayons...which is good. It goes in smoothly and slicks my hair back nicely. It has pretty good hold for a small pompadour. Doesn&#x27;t wash out very easily of course, but that&#x27;s expected from an old school pomade.</li>
            <li> Could be my favorite! Love the clean scent (Cocconut &amp; something else) hold, control and the ease it goes in - and washes out. Also has a terrific shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought Lucky 13 Swagger was my favorite cream style pomade. However - Black and White tops it. This is a blend of cream and wax - done just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No wonder this is a Classic.</li>
            <li> I have only used a few petroleum based pomades, this being the most undesirable of the bunch.  The price is good for a can this size, but I doubt I will continue to use it for much longer. This product simply does not work into my hair well.  Other petroleum products (Lockharts in particular) seem to absorb into the hair.  Black &amp; White globs up and seems to only coat the hair.  Even after using large amounts, hair manageability leaves something to be desired.  It&#x27;s not so bad after it has been in my hair fir a couple of days. Like similar products, it doesn&#x27;t wash out completely with one shampoo.  I don&#x27;t quite understand all of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing on it&#x27;s own or  if you mix it with different  pomades. It has a pretty good hold, great shine, and smells great. A must buy in my book.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find it locally so I searched trough Amazon. Works fine for my hair, smells clean, medium hold. Nice for winter.</li>
            <li> its the only thing that works on my thick and voluminous hair. best product to hold the most stubborn hair types. this comes all the way from England and I find it to be rather expensive!</li>
            <li> Really greasy. really hard to wash out. okay hold nothing special</li>
            <li> This stuff is almost flawless. It&#x27;s the perfect blend of a wax and a grease with the perfect balance of hold and flexibility. If I could change anything it would be the smell which is a little too sweet for my liking but it certainly isn&#x27;t a deal breaker. It washes out just as easily as any &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; non-water-based pomade I&#x27;ve used, maybe even a little more easily. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I use this but mix it with just a dab of wax hair gel. Like the ones that harden a little and my hair stays. I have really thick hair so I need heavy duty</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this pressing cream for years and my niece found it here.  I am very excited that I found it!</li>
            <li> Its a really good design and i like that they havnt gone out of buisness in a long time. Wich means alot of peopel really like it so brings me to a conlcusion that this could be the next buyers favorite pomade ever</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it all, Murray&#x27;s, Murray&#x27;s Super Light, DAX, Layrite, Royal Crown, Brylcreem, Groom and Clean, and many more, just to try to get a good classic hairstyle.  In my opinion Black and White beats them all. The scent is amazing, however the hold isn&#x27;t too strong. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this if you have shorter hair especially on the sides. B&amp;W probably is best for medium length to longer hair. The hold isn&#x27;t too bad it just isn&#x27;t as strong as Murray&#x27;s (but then again nothing beats the hold of Murrays Superior) or other similar pomades.  The shine is great. One of the best things I like about this pomade is that it washes out pretty easily.  If you want to go for the Clark Gable or Cary Grant look, don&#x27;t look anywhere else. Your hair will stay in form!  If only I could find this in my local stores, oh well.  B&amp;W can&#x27;t be bad if Elvis Presley used it!</li>
            <li> fast shipping. my husband loves this stuff and has used it for years.</li>
            <li> Works well for reducing frizz and adding some definition.  Hair is soft and not sticky.  Use sparingly and you can always add a little more if needed. If you use to much your hair can look greasy.  It does have a strong scent that it would be even better without but it will lessen throughout the day.  I have gotten used to it.  I would like to have known about the scent before purchasing.  I would definetly love to have an unscented version available.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> This stuff is made out of wax and Impossible yo get out of your hair! I shampoo my hair 3 times now and this stuff is still in my hair! And idk but when i used it and used a comb small little white wax balls appeared from the wax.</li>
            <li> A classic pomade that can get the job done. You can&#x27;t beat the price for the amount the container comes with. Very nice smell &amp; shine. Medium hold. Also very greasy to me.</li>
            <li> You can slick your hair back the Gatsby with this stuff. Good shine. It is somewhat strong smelling, but good though! Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Old school, old fashioned light-weight cr√®me pomade for high shine and medium control of tidy, tight, clean barbershop cuts which are best slicked for a no-nonsense, masculine appearance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a collector of many pomaded and this hands down is one of my favorites...I don&#x27;t really notice the coconut scent once it&#x27;s in my hair..Great hold even for thick hair...Although its waterproof it does seem to wash out easy in the shower which is a plus...Also great price for a 7 oz container..</li>
            <li> My son loves this product.  He has thick, naturally wavy hair, so it helps him manage and style.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff. Works better than the water soluble stuff</li>
            <li> Great product and it arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I had tried a few classic grooming products (Brylcreem; Murray&#x27;s Pomade) in the past, but they were never right for me for various reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Black &amp; White Hair Dressing. My very first thought upon my very first use of this was &amp;#34;I could have been using this stuff during every decade of my entire life.&amp;#34; For a pomade, this product is very easy to use. It goes into dry hair easily, which shocked me. If I use a little, I can have more of a dry look and if I use more, I can have a lot of shine. In either case, my hair is held and stays held. Please note; I have shorter hair and cannot speak as to how well this would work on longer hair (pompadour).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot compare this to any other pomade aside from Murray&#x27;s and I found this to be far superior than Murray&#x27;s in every way (for my tastes). I can&#x27;t say whether this product will work for you, but I can say that this product works for me and I will probably never use another hair product again.</li>
            <li> As far as middle-of-the-road pomades go, this one is a real winner..  Apparently from the late 19th century, It&#x27;s not too stiff, it&#x27;s easy to get through the hair, and it has pretty decent hold (not like murrays or the red dax but good for my needs - I have generally straight hair with tons of cowlicks and sweeps).  The shine is decent, not extraordinary.  It is said that Elvis used this stuff but frankly it doesn&#x27;t really produce that much shine (which I was expecting based on that one fact).. No problemo for me though, I have plenty of light pomades and hair dressings which could fill that in, if needed.  Frankly it&#x27;s pretty good on it&#x27;s own.  The smell is interesting:  Coconut, Vanilla, cinnamon?! something spicy, at least.  Honestly it vaguely smells like a tres leches cake or something.. Whatever it is, it&#x27;s fairly subtle.  As with many medium hold (and the hard stuff) pomades, it&#x27;s still a bit tricky to get this out in the shower, but if you&#x27;re here reading this then that&#x27;s probably what you want in a product like this anyway, so stay greasy!  Anyway, this stuff is a real classic and if it were easier to get ahold of, I would use it all the time.</li>
            <li> if you have straight hair it will do the job. On wavy hair it will not work as well. The smell is not bad or not good. For a professional or adult this is not the smell for you. More teenager or early twenties at a relaxed job. It smells like Vaseline and baby powder so I personally would not use this on a work day. And it is very difficult to wash off your hair.</li>
            <li> This pomade is probably better for people with thin hair, as it took way too much of the product to do anything to my short, thick hair. As for hold, I started needing to reapply a new coat four hours in, which isn&#x27;t something I can easily do when I&#x27;m working. They say Elvis Presley used this pomade, but with how weak the hold is and how medium the shine is I kind of doubt it. Maybe if used with another pomade it might be effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be trying this product again. It really isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard about Black &amp; White for years, but since its hard to find in the US, never was able to try it until I ordered it thru Amazon. I am so glad I did. This is an amazing creamy hair grease. To be sure, this is the stuff Elvis used to get his classic pomp. It goes in smooth and keeps hair shiny wet and greasy all day. I love it. Keeps hair pliable for easy recombing. It also does not have strong hold, so if you&#x27;re looking for that strong hold, you might want use in combo with a heavy pomade. The scent is pleasant and not overpowering. The tub gives you a nice quantity. I use a lot of the stuff daily and it takes awhile to finish a tub. I learned not to be stingy when applying. I need to use a good size scoop and I get a nice wet greasy shine every time. I use it in combo with a medium pomade for hold. I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I like this product it&#x27;s not to greasy like some of the other ones out there and it&#x27;s easy to wash off, which is a definite plus.</li>
            <li> super good old school</li>
            <li> If you want a shine and be able to have a hold this is it. I work 24 hour shifts and it was like I just put it in the morning after. I could comb if I needed to. Hard to shampoo out but It didn&#x27;t matter to me.</li>
