            <li>Now we both are using this product and totally happy about it.</li>
            <li>I heard great things about it .</li>
            <li>my skin looked great.  </li>
            <li>If you want to grow your hair thicker and longer this is a great product for you.</li>
            <li>so happy i bought them.</li>
            <li>However it also made my skin break out with huge cyctic acne!!!  </li>
            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li>I have been in Viviscal for seven months, my hair has stopped falling out, breaking; it now has a very nice texture.</li>
            <li>(and my nails look amazing!</li>
            <li>and this stuff is truly amazing!  </li>
            <li>This product has been amazing!</li>
            <li>It was amazing!</li>
            <li>Good luck!! :)</li>
            <li>and i can honestly say it WORKS!</li>
            <li>(her hair has become thicker, but it&#x27;s not as if she became Rapunzel :p).</li>
            <li>Speedy delivery, arrived in perfect condition and fully satisfied.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t even stand my own company!  </li>
            <li>i have 3 kids and cannot justify spending that kind of money on my hair!</li>
            <li>i heard all the ads and saw a lot of good reviews, i have been using propecia for years and had great results up till about 3 years ago.</li>
            <li>It is worth it!!!!</li>
            <li>I think that this is a good supplement.</li>
            <li>well actually it&#x27;s a good thing because if this grows my nose hair it should grow my head hair also</li>
            <li>Good vitamin, but takes time to see the difference.</li>
            <li>i took viviscal for 3 months and it didnt give me good results like biotin</li>
            <li>AND biotin would make my hair look beyond gorgeous.</li>
            <li>I still think they are good pills though, for a non-vegetarian who doesn&#x27;t have an issue downing fishy tasting pills.</li>
            <li>I heard good reviews about his product and decided to try it.</li>
            <li>My hair grew out nicely and looks great.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>I thought they were gone for good.  </li>
            <li>I read about this product in an article written by Dr. Leslie Baumann who said it was good for both hair and nails.</li>
            <li>like almost never) but wanted to share my experience with this product because i have just been searching and searching for a good hair growth product and thought this may have been it.  </li>
            <li>A friend told me the biotin was good for hair growth as well, so I looked and found 10,000 mcg on Amazon, and take that as a supplement as well.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Through it all my hair never stopped looking good.</li>
            <li>She followed the instructions as directed, and after 3 months you could see a good difference on her.  </li>
            <li>It had good reviews like Viviscal.  </li>
            <li>Both are a good deal.</li>
            <li>I never had bald patches or thinning isolated areas, but now I can see that the wispy hair is thickening and thats good.</li>
            <li>and I heard this was a good product.  </li>
            <li>(that&#x27;s a good roblem to have).&lt;br</li>
            <li>My beatician really loved how this product made my hair healthier.</li>
            <li>Biotin gave it a good jump start.</li>
            <li>In good shape and eat as well as I can.</li>
            <li>It is a good product.</li>
            <li>my skin did&#x27;t look as good.</li>
            <li>I am hoping for good results from my hair as well as time goes on.</li>
            <li>seems to be a good product, does not upset my stomach</li>
            <li>I saw Viviscal in an ad in a magazine, and looked online to see what the reviews of it were, and they were really good</li>
            <li>its a good product my hair has improved dramtically ..</li>
            <li>It is really good.</li>
            <li>Good.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to try everything out there with a good review, so I ordered books and researched every body part and how to maintain it.</li>
            <li>always check thyroid levels and get an anxiety medication and pour vitamins and good food and watch your hair turn around.</li>
            <li>Work relly good</li>
            <li>I waited 6 months to give it a fair review.  </li>
            <li>so this was surprising to me.</li>
            <li>It just takes a good six months  to notice any results</li>
            <li>All is good....</li>
            <li>I started using Viviscal, because of really good reviews in Internet.</li>
            <li>and it sounded good</li>
            <li>these are really good</li>
            <li>Within no time at all it became almost as good as when I was a teenager.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>it more beautiful and shiny- and for that reason alone I have ordered another batch.</li>
            <li>it more beautiful and shiny- and for that reason alone I have ordered another batch.</li>

            <li>My Dermatologist recommended this for my toe nails, but I would love thicker hair!</li>
            <li>love these!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I love this product !  </li>
            <li>and I feel like my hair is falling out so much more since I&#x27;ve started taking it!</li>
            <li>Update!&lt;br /&gt;Viviscal has lost its magic!</li>
            <li>I am so glad to have found this product!</li>
            <li>with means more waxing and shaving, ugh!</li>
            <li>I Love it!</li>
            <li>This is magic!</li>
            <li>Sure, so believeable!</li>
            <li>love being on the plan where they send it to me automatically!</li>
            <li>but I know I surely will not be buying this product again!</li>
            <li>Recommended to me by top hair colorist in NYC - there is a noticeable change after just one month!</li>
            <li>If I just get great nails and eyebrows from using this product, I would be thrilled, but to think that it will improve the appearance of my hair, as well, wow, what a wonderful find!</li>
            <li>After taking it for 2-3 months, my hair has grown more than it has in years!</li>
            <li>So glad I found out about these two products!</li>
            <li>I will continue to take these as I love the results!</li>
            <li>I just bought 60 more!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>My hair has definitely filled in!!</li>
            <li>I love the viviscal hair vitamins, but the product is exspensive!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m one of the fortunate ones for whom it works beautifully (age 69).   </li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>made my hair grow for sure!  </li>
            <li>okay problem to have!  </li>
            <li>Will have to order more, but I think it did the trick!</li>
            <li>I will reorder for sure!</li>
            <li>Also I&#x27;m a hair stylist and have most of my customers using it too !</li>
            <li>I am going to continue this for 5 more months!</li>
            <li>I would recommend it for sure!</li>
            <li>LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>After taking this product, my hair is so much more healthier and it is no longer shedding and growing again!</li>
            <li>and I love this product!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I was at my ideal weight and fairly quickly without any change to my diet</li>
            <li>and i have to pay the ship&#x27;s price which isn&#x27;t cheap at all and by this great raising</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing product and has truly changed my hair and my confidence!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Switched to these about a month ago and they are amazing.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.  </li>
            <li>But I got amazing results.</li>
            <li>I had gotten amazing results and my hair has become thicker than what it ever has been before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i havent noticed my nails getting stronger or growing faster, but the change in my hair is amazing.  </li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve seen amazing results yet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>it’s amazing .</li>
            <li>Its quite amazing.</li>
            <li>this is soo amazing for me...</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>A friend, who is in beauty culture field, has told me about this amazing product.  </li>
            <li>I liked this product and think it helped while I was anemic.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m  loving 😍</li>
            <li>So, works for my hair, not so nice on my skin.</li>
            <li>I am thinking my hair and nails look a good bit better.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s nice, too.</li>
            <li>with this I have really noticed a wonderful difference.</li>
            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t want longer, thicker, more gorgeous hair?</li>
            <li>I am genuinely thrilled.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it is a great product -- as most everyone else says.  </li>
            <li>but I honestly thought I could notice that it was helping out.</li>
            <li>But my hair has shown growth which is really nice.</li>
            <li>My hair is quite thicker than it used to be thanks to this wonderful product.</li>
            <li>The coupon in the box was a nice surprise also.  </li>
            <li>Should I spend this kind of money?</li>
            <li>It was not the company&#x27;s fault and I emailed them and they kindly refunded me.</li>
            <li>Loving my thicker</li>
            <li>but I was greatly appreciative once they were.</li>
            <li>Just didn&#x27;t seem liked it worked for me at all</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for making this wonderful product</li>
            <li>PER MONTH.&lt;br /&gt;I DON&#x27;T WORK FOR AMAZON OR VIVISCAL, JUST AN HONEST CONSUMER,</li>
            <li>Really effective product.</li>
            <li>But I honestly don&#x27;t see any difference in my hair</li>
            <li>SO I was terrified to take these pills and honestly I had them sit in my cupboard for two months before trying.</li>
            <li>I took this for months, honestly cant say I saw any difference</li>
            <li>Just started taking this ,I liked them hope they work for me .</li>
            <li>Excellent hair product, it really works to thicken hair</li>
            <li>Intense Grow Hair Vitamins is the best on the market</li>
            <li>Honestly did not see a change in hair growth or strenght.  </li>
            <li>I have recommended them to a bunch of hair dressers for their clients and my own friends and family.</li>
            <li>There are plenty of alternative products with iron and biotin that are effective without shark powder.</li>
            <li>Hopefully in a couple more months I will have good results and can rate the product five stars...</li>
            <li>Good stuff, my hair feels better.</li>
            <li>My part is filling in nicely.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with Viviscal and plan on using it again for a much longer period of time.</li>
            <li>After about 7 months, I honestly don&#x27;t know if this supplement has made any difference.</li>
            <li>I would give it a try for 3 months and see what kind of results you get...</li>
            <li>and I honestly thought I would be bald in no time at all.</li>
            <li>I decided to tackle this on my own.</li>
            <li>I am not even kidding you when I honestly tell you this THE NIGHT I started taking Viviscal my hair loss in the shower</li>
            <li>I honestly thought that this product would not work on my hair.</li>
            <li>We both color our hair, and our roots were significantly showing!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these off and on since they were first released and still find them the best supplement to promote hair growth and to obtain a healthy head of hair.</li>
            <li>Like most vitamins, they need to be taken consistently for best results.  </li>
            <li>The product is very good if used consistently.</li>
            <li>so excited to be seeing so much healthy growth!!</li>
            <li>much longer as your hormones (which control hair growth) are depleted greatly.  ONTO the the GOOD stuff.  </li>
            <li>and they are very easy to swallow .</li>
            <li>very strong.  </li>
            <li>The product is very easily digestible and never&lt;br /&gt;hurts</li>
            <li>My nails also got got very strong and is growing faster that they ever did before.  </li>
            <li>Been using for about a week now can&#x27;t tell a difference yet, but it is very easy to take for those of you like me who dont like pills.</li>
            <li>my hair is on the way to becoming like it used to be!</li>
            <li>It seems a bit more moist than before which was ok!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 5 months and have not experience any problems, the best thing about Viviscal is that it is a  natural product.</li>
            <li>This is the most effective, it reduces hair loss, and helps grow the hair faster.  </li>
            <li>By far the best hair supplement that I have come across.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve seen best results after taking Viviscal for 3 months.</li>
            <li>The best so far for ingested aid.</li>
            <li>far, I am very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to be able to purchase this item online.  </li>
            <li>so I think I&#x27;ll still to biotin or prenatals which I think are more effective.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say I&#x27;m so glad I never have to worry about this problem again.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best.</li>
            <li>but so far I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li>So far ive been really impressed</li>
            <li>I have always had very fine hair, but in quantity.  </li>
            <li>My nails have never been so strong!</li>
            <li>Great and super fast shipping!!!!</li>
            <li>good ingredient, over priced, did not get any significant thickening ...</li>
            <li>I have turned on many of my friends to this product and it works great for absolutely everyone!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled for everyone who sees great results and really wanted this to work, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>First shipment was great</li>
            <li>(I have had very fine hair all of my life, but had managed to style it and use volumizing products, so I&#x27;m used to having to spend money to maintain healthy looking hair).</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny, healthy and strong!</li>
            <li>I started using a magnesium drink every night which helped with that and is super good for you anyway.  </li>
            <li>good price and quick delivery</li>
            <li>Excellent prices and super fast shipping on this top of the line product that helps hair shedding and encourages hair growth.</li>
            <li>and I see a HUGE difference in the thickness of my hair and the texture!</li>
            <li>Yes, it is tempting - we all want that luxurious, sexy hair.</li>
            <li>ok, you can decide for youself.</li>
            <li>This stuff does work magic.  </li>
            <li>I used it for quite a while, until I discovered Hairfinity, which works better and is cheaper.</li>
            <li>Plus, I&#x27;m sure the health benefits are even better for you too.</li>
            <li>Even if this product dose work for you and you like or even love it, save you money and get prenatal.</li>
            <li>It was progressively thinning on top and I was told to try bcps to \\&quot;balance my hormones\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>My latest experiment was progesterone cream which i started 3 months ago.</li>
            <li>But I read everyone else&#x27;s to help make my decisions in most purchases I make online.</li>
            <li>Which is fantastic!</li>
            <li>the condition seems to be getting better.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>What is the deal with so many words??</li>
            <li>I think :) no biggie.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t be sure if it was tied to the pills, but it did subside.</li>
            <li>more voluminous hair.  </li>
            <li>Love the results I got after just a month but not a fan of the taste of the pills or the way they make my stomach feel.</li>
            <li>I find more hair on the floor..</li>
            <li>That was my primary reason for purchasing the item!</li>
            <li>Seems like these issues are much better.</li>
            <li>I think it may have helped improve the quality of my hair as well, but I can&#x27;t be sure.  </li>
            <li>Maybe in 3 to 6 months time a better assessment or commentary of Viviscal products will be appropriate.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try it for 6 months to see if more areas of my forehead have improvement.</li>
            <li>, I was certainly impressed and actually reordered for another 6 month supply.</li>
            <li>I have to give it some more time.</li>
            <li>maybe abt inch or so, mostly I&#x27;ve notice the thickness.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure that is playng a role also.</li>
            <li>I do believe my hair is healthier (and my skin a bit more oily)</li>
            <li>This product is great and really helps hair grow faster.</li>
            <li>You will notice that your hair will not fall out, you will also notice your skin texture changing for the better.  </li>
            <li>Outstanding product.</li>
            <li>Thank you.  :)</li>
            <li>I have received so many compliments on my hair.</li>
            <li>I ended up having to cut more and more of it off which devastated me.</li>
            <li>Just glad this is working.</li>
            <li>$30.00 a month is much better than that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Just biotin mostly.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>And, P.S.-my son made it safely home.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping it will get better based on reviews</li>
            <li>and they say you should use it for 6 months, with most people seeing results in two.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s making a difference on top of propecia and minoxinol.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I found that DHT blocking supplemnts, DHT blocking shampoos that also contain caffein work much better for me.</li>
            <li>give it 3 months then review it, its the best, I had many surgeries where they had to shave my head, and this was the only medication that helped regrowth</li>
            <li>And the cessation of hair loss is more than I hoped for.</li>
            <li>I love Amazon</li>
            <li>I am a hair designer always looking  for the next, best thing for hair growth.</li>
            <li>it works better and shows result faster than viviscal</li>
            <li>My hair has been looking better after a couple weeks of use...    </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s this or something else, but this sure isn&#x27;t hurting.</li>
            <li>Very impressive double blinded trial.</li>
            <li>so tat says a lot..:)</li>
            <li>I purchased this a while ago but do not use these any more.  </li>
            <li>I love Viviscal hair supplements, have used them for more than a year.</li>
            <li>and I took 2 pills most days instead of 1</li>
            <li>- my stylist has noticed and I have noticed there&#x27;s more of it.  </li>
            <li>but the fact is, it doesn&#x27;t work any better than anything else for hair.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it and still use it.</li>
            <li>one more go &#x27;</li>
            <li>Helped keep my hair looking and feeling healthy.  </li>
            <li>More iodine than my body could handle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still weighing whether I&#x27;m going to continue for a couple more months to see if my body adjusts</li>
            <li>I hope to see more improvement.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>My hair is better and I will use these vitamins from time to time.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know how much more they can grow.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the service.</li>
            <li>I love the product...</li>
            <li>I did not contact the seller and going to assume it is safe to take.</li>
            <li>Also, my hair appears healthy and stronger than ever.</li>
            <li>I noticed more nail growth than hair growth.</li>
            <li>IMPORTANT UPDATE!</li>
            <li>I have had better luck with \\&quot;other\\&quot; online sources.</li>
            <li>I wish they would offer more disclosure.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these hair vitamins.  </li>
            <li>Bottom line, I still love the product, but now I take the men&#x27;s version.</li>
            <li>** star feedback rating more often, rather than just skip them all together</li>
            <li>Love this product have used it for a couple of years now.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for a couple years and have always been pleased.  </li>
            <li>Yes I will buy contiue to buy more of Viviscal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After about a month, it seemed like my eyelashes and eyebrows were a bit fuller, but wasn&#x27;t sure if it was my imagination/wishful thinking.  </li>
            <li>Tried for 6 months and saw MORE hair fall.</li>
            <li>I hope it works better for someone else</li>
            <li>I hope that this will give me more benefits.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t have been more pleased and I will continue to use Viviscal with the hope that improvement will continue.</li>
            <li>Also I need haircuts more often.  </li>
            <li>So hopefully I will see more improvement by the end.  </li>
            <li>I would like to see more noticeable growth on the top of my head, but I&#x27;m hopeful.</li>
            <li>While she was doing the pedicure, she noticed my nails and commented about how much better they looked.</li>
            <li>I have had problems with thinning hair at the temples and tried many things now there is the appearance of hair, hope that it lasts.</li>
            <li>and i advise you not to buy it or u be wasting money for sure</li>
            <li>I am a woman that has gone through menopause and should not have more then 8 mg of iron a day.</li>
            <li>so I could purchase it more often.</li>
            <li>I was experiencing thinning in the crown of my head, and now I see more fullness in this area.  </li>
            <li>I love it and it was cheaper online than at the drugstore, even on sale with a coupon.</li>
            <li>My hair was getting thiner on the top but not anymore.  </li>
            <li>but it sure does.</li>
            <li>Added benefits: stronger nails and better skin.  </li>
            <li>Have several friends that also had excellent results taking this product after chemo.</li>
            <li>I have been taking it for about a year and my hair has never been better.</li>
            <li>Also having to shave, wax, and cut my nails more</li>
            <li>I switched to once a day and haven&#x27;t had problems and still see results. :)</li>
            <li>I went through one pack of these and I&#x27;m not so sure they work?  </li>
            <li>I got three month&#x27;s worth and I think I gave it a fair trial.</li>
            <li>it makes your hair healthy from the inside out and it also promotes hair growth.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It takes a good 3 months or so to kick in, but it&#x27;s worth the wait.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say whether this has helped for sure, but I have been using it for three months</li>
            <li>and I truly think I see more &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; hairs growing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve re-ordered 2 more months and will keep at it.  </li>
            <li>mom reordered the product and it has been working fabulously!</li>
            <li>Have always been really pleased with everything I ever order through Amazon...</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this supplement.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed the results of using this product.</li>
            <li>I love the compliments I receive, andI love giving referrrals even more.</li>
            <li>More shaving.  </li>
            <li>I have also received many comments about how shiny my hair is.</li>
            <li>However, since I was more concerned about the thinning areas of my hair, I thought I&#x27;d try this product.</li>
            <li>There don&#x27;t seem to be many comments</li>
            <li>Quite satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>Need to make sure to take it two times a day.</li>
            <li>My hair also is growing more rapidly.</li>
            <li>I will return immediately and buy from a reputable store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>will give it two more months to make it six and then</li>
            <li>and they said products are manufactured for the Portuguese market and they can verify if it&#x27;s an authentic product by emailing the product lot number and expiration date found on the bottom of the box to  viviscalcare@viviscal.com.  </li>
            <li>And she told me that she was noticing more hair on her brush and in the shower.  </li>
            <li>(Okay, I figure out how to post a picture here.  </li>
            <li>It is growing faster as well, but for me, I think the thickening factor is more noticeable than growth.</li>
            <li>I agree that it has made my skin oilier, but it is definitely doing something wonderful to my hair and nails.</li>
            <li>I love the Subscribe and Save option, as well.</li>
            <li>My mom is considering taking this, too, now that she&#x27;s seen what it&#x27;s done for my hair! :)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on Viviscal for over 2 years now, and I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>every day has done a lot to help me feel better about my hair.</li>
            <li>It definitely has more softness and body now though is still very fly away from all the breakage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hopeful that Viviscal will give me even better hair.</li>
            <li>More updates to come.  </li>
            <li>so I think I may have to buy some more.</li>
            <li>great product fast shipping</li>
            <li>that is how much I love the stuff.</li>
            <li>for better results I would say that it is working and 1 side.</li>
            <li>more to work with.</li>
            <li>I notice that my nails look better &amp; are stronger.</li>
            <li>and I decided to cut it shorter so it could look more healthy.</li>
            <li>When I take the Viviscal with in a week or so the texture of my hair is soooo much better.</li>
            <li>However, I find Biosil VegCap worked better in stronger hair and better hair texture, nail growth and smoother skin texture.  </li>
            <li>but it became much more noticeable..</li>
            <li>i love this product...</li>
            <li>but overall my hair is in excellent condition since i use this</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: 3 Months.</li>
            <li>it sure wont help anyone</li>
            <li>tried many vitamins before.</li>
            <li>And once again, I love that it&#x27;s so convenient and</li>
            <li>My hair and nails are growing faster and better.</li>
            <li>Best product...Had Chemo and my hair is growing back fuller and stronger.</li>
            <li>more so i needed something.</li>
            <li>Anyway I heard about these &amp; most people found they worked &amp; i can tell you my nails grow faster..</li>
            <li>so i cant give it more stars yet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep ya posted:)</li>
            <li>Will write more as I see results.</li>
            <li>then nioxin #3 conditioner on the top of my head and TIGI moisture recovery conditioner on the ends.</li>
            <li>And Even More shinier, I Would Recommend This Product To Every One.</li>
            <li>also feel like I have more energy at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i will not order any more</li>
            <li>I love your product....</li>
            <li>I just wish it were more affordable.</li>
            <li>Before Viviscal, my hair fell out by the handful after each shampooing and more during comb out and styling.</li>
            <li>the seller thought is was appropriate to send it.</li>
            <li>It looks healthy and shiny.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The tablets seem to be helping, have to use longer to be sure.</li>
            <li>and this does work :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad my stylist recommended it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know how many stars to give this.  </li>
            <li>Love Viviscal and truly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I Love this product.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m already able to tell a difference in the amount of hair that I leave in the shower.</li>
            <li>I had to cut it off to my collarbone, and would love to have longer hair</li>
            <li>I am sure the results vary from person to person--My doctor had recommended it to me.</li>
            <li>Nails are much better.</li>
            <li>It does take a couple of months to start seeing results, but then it gets so much better.  </li>
            <li>After 3 months the growth was more dense and by the end of four months there was a lot more.  </li>
            <li>but I will reorder to see if I need more time to see results.</li>
            <li>I love this vitamin for hair.</li>
            <li>My hair was being affected by so many hear meds.</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft,looks fuller and more shiney and more bounce.</li>
            <li>Also, I notice that my hair is easier to style and holds a style better.</li>
            <li>Love it and it works.</li>
            <li>I need to give it more time</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>The instructions say to use for 6 months before seeing a change, so I still have two more months to go.</li>
            <li>My hair dresser even commented on being able to feel the difference in the hair close to my scalp, and the longer hair.</li>
            <li>Its much more thicker and looks healthy.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>but this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>:) :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to continue to take Viviscal until my hair grows about 5-6 more inches, I think it works. :)</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I took a chance on this.</li>
            <li>Need more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fan, and will buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li>Or I should say don’t’ see)&lt;br /&gt;For now it looks like magic.</li>
            <li>maybe my nail grew a bit more if anything.</li>
            <li>Boltin works way better</li>
            <li>I hear that chrome-domes are more aero-dynamic.</li>
            <li>so I started using viviscal to hopefully promote more hair growth on my sides and top.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair became oilier more often, but I didn&#x27;t mind.&lt;br /&gt;August</li>
            <li>I will see how much more growth will kick in after the six month period.</li>
            <li>I will see how much more growth will kick in after the six month period.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it had done anything for me or</li>
            <li>I still wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li>and I wanted to be sure to let others know that it could be a problem for them as well.</li>
            <li>You need to continue taking it for more than a month</li>
            <li>For anyone wanting to read more about this: Environmental neurotoxins β-N-methylamino-l-alanine (BMAA) and mercury in shark cartilage dietary supplements by Mash et al.</li>
            <li>My hair was over-processed and I noticed more hair in my brush and in the shower drain then on my head.  </li>
            <li>Still waiting on more though.</li>
            <li>I love these vitamins.</li>
            <li>anyway I didnt expect much from this because my nails and hair are already in great shape and my skin considering I dye my hair with bleach and baked in the sun in my 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>The more you stress over hair the more hair will fall out.</li>
            <li>but things can get better.</li>
            <li>When I stop taking it, I feel better.</li>
            <li>it is.growing in so much better with no snapping and breaking ...</li>
            <li>I love  what this product did for me:  </li>
            <li>My hair feels softer &amp; more moisturized compared to before I started to taking the pills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This may not be an advertised side effect, but it sure is</li>
            <li>the most benefits)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>Eyelashes are fuller and look better with and without mascara, but I did not see any improvement with nails</li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t feel as if more hair grew in, it did stop my hair from falling after about 3-4 weeks of using it.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think more hair grew in.  </li>
            <li>I pray you have better luck and find a product that works for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I hope it turns out better than the vitamins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I have had thinning hair for many years.</li>
            <li>maybe the Viviscal didn&#x27;t grow more hair, but prevented some of the loss?</li>
            <li>Would love if they came out with a vegetarian option.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve told so many of my girlfriends about it...</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know that there were this many Americans suffering from thinning hair or it falling out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gotten thicker with more body!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gotten thicker with more body!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I guess I just had a moment of hair loss desperation that eclipsed my better judgment.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now taking Biotin from a reputable source.</li>
            <li>More than 3 times than before.</li>
            <li>It has promoted healthy hair and fingernails.</li>
            <li>We used all 60 tablets with no result and then the company wanted us to automatically buy more to insure fuller hair.</li>
            <li>Found one that&#x27;s cheaper &amp; works better</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty nice thing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my mid 40&#x27;s and my hair was changing, and not for the best.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work</li>
            <li>and I was getting concerned because this had gone on for more than a year</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t see any more hair fall with the bulbs attached.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad there&#x27;s something on the market that will help me do that.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve read that you don&#x27;t notice too many changes until about 4-5 boxes into it.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>My hair is lustrous, shinier,  and the growth rate is phenomenal.  </li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>I rated I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I rated it three stars because I&#x27;ll need more time with it, I&#x27;ll re-address it at the end of the completed treatments.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Scalp health matters a lot more unless you&#x27;re starving yourself of nutrients.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>In February 2013 I will be able to give a better review.</li>
            <li>This product for sure made my hair grow faster and gave my hair shine.</li>
            <li>So when I finally broke up the news about this superb product he too wanted to use it on him.</li>
            <li>We will know better in a couple of months as it takes 4 to 6 months to see results.</li>
            <li>just keep at it :)</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll notice baby hairs at your hairline first, like cowlicks, they have a mind of their own!</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT DOES EXACTLY WHAT IT STATES!!!</li>
            <li>Very excited about that.</li>
            <li>I am very excited to continue taking these vitamins</li>
            <li>my hairdresser was very excited too.  </li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>The item i was told to take by the women who does my hair and so far so good !</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>So far - so good!  </li>
            <li>I have great hopes on this product as it was a recommendation from a friend who is enjoying the natural beauty of his hair growth!!  </li>
            <li>I love the vitamins and notice how much more strong and healthy my hair is since I&#x27;ve started using it.  </li>
            <li>I wish very much I could give a good review.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Biotin Vitamin H, promotes Healthy Hair and Strong Nails and it has been Proven to Help with Healthy Hair Growth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now taking Toji which has a few but perfect reviews and so far im impressed.</li>
            <li>My hair is as long as it has ever been, and my nails are great!</li>
            <li>My hair does seem to be becoming fuller, thicker and stronger, so for these reasons alone, I think I will continue giving it a go just to see what happens in a couple more months.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!!</li>
            <li>I have also noticed the new hairs that been growing around my temple which is also really great.</li>
            <li>I am happy I did because I have new hair sprouting up.  </li>
            <li>I get it trimmed and touched-up regularly every 8-9 weeks and have a good hair care regimen and good diet.</li>
            <li>will definitely buy this again, the price is good and the result is good.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, my hair feels and looks much better after two months on this product.</li>
            <li>i was supper happy when i got them for the price i got them they were too good to be true, but when i received the pills they looked completely different from the ones i purchased from ulta</li>
            <li>This is always more noticeable on those of us with silky fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have more fine hair and not a ton of it</li>
            <li>Though they didn&#x27;t help my nails, my hair became very full and in fact a bit unruly from the fullness.</li>
            <li>It is very, very good and definitely works!</li>
            <li>and my hair is shoulder length and very full &amp; thicker than before.</li>
            <li>I also had quit my birth control at the time, and wow my hair was greatly damaged by all of the stress and hormonal shedding.</li>
            <li>Incredible hair growth in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>Happy so far.</li>
            <li>I have only been taking this product for a month (along with Biotin supplements in the morning) and am noticing an incredible amount of growth.  </li>
            <li>And although I have not appreciated the cost increases of the product over this time, I am still very impressed with the results.  </li>
            <li>I am a 46 year old mom, in great health</li>
            <li>I am 40 years old and experienced ALOT of hair loss after the birth of my son 4 years ago.</li>
            <li>Just finishing up my first month on Viviscal and so far I&#x27;m impressed with the results.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making me feel good about</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s price is just too good not to give it a real</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product but costs too much.</li>
            <li>Tried all kinds of special shampoos and supplements from my doctor, nothing worked!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my 50s and started noticing that my hair (which is very fine) was not as full as it was.  </li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite products for growing your hair out quickly and healthy.</li>
            <li>My hair has never grown so quickly and looked so much more healthy in one month&#x27;s time.  </li>
            <li>Her hair grew back and it hadn&#x27;t looked this good in many years!</li>
            <li>Makes hair soft and more manageable!!</li>
            <li>Other than that, great product!</li>
            <li>and it has grown 3-4 inches in the last 2-3 months which is good for me!  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;a head full of hair beyond belief !  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to remember.</li>
            <li>All you do is take two tablets a day and they are an easy to swallow size too.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to get caught up in something you see on TV.</li>
            <li>so it is easy to take.</li>
            <li>These supplements are easy to consume and they seem to work.</li>
            <li>I could easily get away with 5 weeks of dying my hair</li>
            <li>they grow faster, and my nails do not break as easily as they used to.</li>
            <li>arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>It does not alter the flavor of my shake which makes it easy to take the vitamin.</li>
            <li>I have been using Viviscal for a few years and am very happy with the hair results which are continued plentiful and healthy hair.</li>
            <li>Now I scrub my scalp strong while shampooing to provoke and test this product&#x27;s effects</li>
            <li>It was to strong for me.</li>
            <li>I use this in conjunction with biotin, horsetail, and folic acid to help my hair be strong and grow faster.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Thicker, lusher, strong hair after just 3 weeks of using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does not have strong smell either.</li>
            <li>It truly does help your hair grow strong and resilient.</li>
            <li>Strong hair or neurodegenerative disease?</li>
            <li>For me it was too strong and upset my stomach</li>
            <li>so it has been a major headache and has impacted my confidence greatly.</li>
            <li>, I have nothing but positive things to say about it (and also love that it&#x27;s cheaper to purchase on Amazon than Walgreens)!</li>
            <li>I also dont want to OD on the multi&#x27;s, since Nioxin also has many of the same ingrediants as my multi (which is whole food based) any opionons would be great!</li>
            <li>I have always had baby hair, but it was full and healthy.</li>
            <li>and now my hair is beautiful again after letting it fully grow back out.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s healthy and full.  </li>
            <li>I am African-American with pressed hair, that is fine.</li>
            <li>Like me, she has fine hair and said that these pills helped her have thicker hair.</li>
            <li>I am 41, with baby fine hair, shoulder length, color/highlight every 2-3 months.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my wife, who has fine hair, and she now claims to have the hair of Venus.  </li>
            <li>My hair is growing fine with this product.</li>
            <li>It is a fine</li>
            <li>I used the first month&#x27;s supply and my hair is already fuller, the sections that were sparse are filling in and my hair styles so much better because there&#x27;s more hair to work with.</li>
            <li>I also have baby fine hair that is coming in as well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the tablets for 3 months and still have fine growth coming in....</li>
            <li>I always had fine hair</li>
            <li>my stomach was fine.</li>
            <li>For the price, I&#x27;d like more extraordinary results.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed my hair getting thicker, but it is growing more quickly.  </li>
            <li>and they take my pimples quick and these acne with this pills are lagging !</li>
            <li>My hair is growing so quickly, it is healthier and as a bonus, my eyelashes are thicker and longer, too!  </li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t the amazing, beautiful, shiny, thick hair I had at 18, but it&#x27;s much, much better than it was before I started taking it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m super happy with the result thus far.</li>
            <li>Seeing as my hairdresser ordered her own box the next day, that pretty much tells you how impressed she was by my results.</li>
            <li>I was excited the first two days because my hair was nice and shiny but it went downhill after that.  </li>
            <li>MY HAIR HAS ALWAYS BEEN HEALTHY AND NOW THAT I&#x27;VE BEEN TAKING IT OVER 3 MONTHS; MY HAIR IS GROWING SUPER FAST!!!</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t seem to be as strong as my original order.  </li>
            <li>Amazon has the best price for this product hands down!</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have a huge clump of hair with it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experience the whole eyelash growth some people have been commenting about, but i have notice a huge improvement on my nails which is really nice.</li>
            <li>Update as of December 2015 - I. Have noticed a huge difference with the use of these tablets.</li>
            <li>Another area I can see a huge difference in is my lashes.</li>
            <li>but they are huge ones</li>
            <li>- my daughter said she noticed a huge difference in the texture of her hair.  </li>
            <li>hair started falling out almost two years ago, and to this day I do not have an accurate reason why.</li>
            <li>The niacin in this product caused me to break out in a huge rash all over my body.  </li>
            <li>will help HUGE amounts with the integrity of your hair.</li>
            <li>I know that it is a huge bummer, having to wait 6 months, or</li>
            <li>and the hair has grown in there and has not broken off again which I&#x27;m thrilled about.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m having waaaaaaaay more success with pairing a prenatal with biotin.</li>
            <li>I did my own test and began taking this supplement after having my hair highlighted so that I could tell how much my hair was growing.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t make an iron free version of this pill.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will say that until proven by successive retests, there is still the possibility that either Great Earth or GNC were the culprit by suddenly outsourcing their product.  </li>
            <li>but I found that it broke me out with cystic acne - a rare occasion for me since most of my skin issues are hormonal and on the surface.  </li>
            <li>Take biotin 5mg daily as well, prescribed by another great derm.</li>
            <li>NOW, 6 MONTHS LATER IM HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS, ALTHOUGH IM GOING TO HAVE TO CONTINUE TO TAKE IT</li>
            <li>Shampoo and conditioner are available, but I need a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>and I have experienced hair growth on my eyebrows only.  </li>
            <li>It may be great for hair loss related to hormones or traction alopecia, but not AGA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I enjoy it coming in the mail, so I don&#x27;t have to remember to order it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s soooo smooth.</li>
            <li>up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the primary constituents of horsetail extract is thiaminase.</li>
            <li>Recommended it to a friend who experienced the same results.  </li>
            <li>I can happily say that my hair is now about two inches above my waist.  </li>
            <li>My hair has gotten stronger, shinier and smooth</li>
            <li>My brows filled in a bit.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product.  </li>
            <li>My hairline is all filled in--</li>
            <li>Currently - my hair is in the growing stage and looks great.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much that my husband is now using it, too.  </li>
            <li>Honestly don&#x27;t think will do much to regrow hair.  </li>
            <li>I tried a gluten free diet as I have heard from others it helps.</li>
            <li>I was happy with the regular brand</li>
            <li>Fantastic product</li>
            <li>One thing I know for sure is that prenatal vitamins are the much cheaper and from what i see much better way to go.</li>
            <li>Five months later, my hair has gotten 5 inches longer, so much healthier and thicker, not to mention my eyelashes look so awesome my skin, and nails too.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>so far so good</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to, because the old ones were working so good.  </li>
            <li>I took this for 3 months straight and my hair got really good and stopped falling so much, then of course i took a month off because i was traveling and forgot to order more</li>
            <li>So far so good with this product.  </li>
            <li>Viviscal works a good bit better than Biotin with regular usage.</li>
            <li>So far so good for me.</li>
            <li>but so far so good.</li>
            <li>Even though it is only a 30 day supply, it has really kept my hair looking great, and no longer falls out when I wash or brush it!</li>
            <li>As I was shopping for furniture, the sales lady stated &amp;#34;you got beautiful hair&amp;#34; had not heard those words in a long time.</li>
            <li>I follow the package instructions and so far so good.</li>
            <li>I see a lot of new hair growth and am very pleased.</li>
            <li>The reviews read that most noticed a change in there fingernails right away, so I figured that if I saw a change in my nails I would know that it was \\&quot;doing something\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering more right now.  </li>
            <li>I researched the reviews and have noticed that people who have the best success with Viviscal once had thicker fuller hair, and went thin/fine due to an event like child birth, disease, hormone-related, etc.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works!!!</li>
            <li>I noticed an improvement after the first month!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Super fast delivery!!!</li>
            <li>I am so excited, relieved and over joy my hair loss has significantly improvement only after taking this product over a month!</li>
            <li>It has made my nails super strong</li>
            <li>During the first month, I then purchased 3 more months on the products website, as they were running a promotion for buy 2 months, get one free.</li>
            <li>What more could i say thank you very much.</li>
            <li>I see a huge difference from the stressful event from a year ago, and it never hurts to have a positive attitude and healthy diet</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any difference for the first 4 days, but by the fifth, I was breaking out with a huge spattering of cystic acne!</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>There is a significant difference in my hair with lots of re-growth.</li>
            <li>But worth!</li>
            <li>Will be interested to see what 3 more months does.</li>
            <li>and I feel these are not the original tablets.</li>
            <li>but Im already excited.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed significant nail growth.  </li>
            <li>Okay first off, this product would receive 10 stars a year ago before they changed the product.</li>
            <li>My original review shows below.  </li>
            <li>The original Viviscal saved my hair.</li>
            <li>Taking it twice a day can be a pain, but worth it in the end!  </li>
            <li>I think after about 6 months I started to notice the length improving, and after 1 year there was definitely a significant difference - my hair was the longest it had been in 7 years.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when it did.  </li>
            <li>I originally tried Viviscal months ago and it broke me out, so I stopped using it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>I saw it originally on the Dr. Oz Show.  </li>
            <li>Treatment with horsetail extract may significantly increase the amount of thiaminase in your body, which may cause a vitamin B-1 deficiency.</li>
            <li>Will order more to do the whole 3 months and see what happens!  </li>
            <li>they have the original Viviscal.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m pretty sure this stuff is working, either that or its just the Rogain.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried to discontinue, however hair loss returns although not at as significant of intensity, thus now using their maintenance dose recommendations and the hair loss is now normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am excited to see how my hair looks at 6 months.</li>
            <li>Make sure you are aware of this if you try it.  </li>
            <li>After the first month, I felt that my hair looked alittle healthier, and better.</li>
            <li>The items are okay but be aware this product makes hair grow everywhere.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absoutely  worth a try!</li>
            <li>I returned to my original salon with reliable hair professionals.&lt;br /&gt;March</li>
            <li>Plus has other vitamins and minerals in it that are good for you too!</li>
            <li>I still use the product hoping that given more time, I will have more hair growth especially where I need it most.</li>
            <li>and while I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant growth, I feel that my hair is a bit stronger.</li>
            <li>Totally worth a try!</li>
            <li>I have been using Viviscal for more than 6 months and it really does work!  </li>
            <li>Absolutely worth the investment!</li>
            <li>The hair fall has improved significantly.</li>
            <li>My hair has gotten significantly longer and thicker.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth seeing the growth of my hair!</li>
            <li>I was excited to try viviscal .</li>
            <li>I was wondering if anyone out there has experienced dry hair after taking the pills for any length of time?</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth that face peach fuzz which can easily be waxed off</li>
            <li>I think this is a excellent product, I will be purchasing it in the near future, as well as recommend to my family &amp; friends.</li>
            <li>In that time I got two haircuts, just for trims to clean up split ends.</li>
            <li>Good luck to everyone going through this depressing situation and best wishes if you decide to try Visical</li>
            <li>What a pleasant surprise my hair is actually growing.</li>
            <li>but after reading some of the reviews and finding most positive, I thought I would try.  </li>
            <li>Everyone has such good results - my hair is already healthy and pretty</li>
            <li>I have been using less products to make my hair look better (volume, shine, etc), so that&#x27;s nice too!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful product, it turns ordinary into extraordinary.</li>
            <li>I went from 1/4&amp;#34; a month to 3/4&amp;#34; a month easily and saw results right away.</li>
            <li>My home is full of my hair, each time I clean</li>
            <li>and I love that my hair is super strong and vibrant.  </li>
            <li>Im also using it with a special shampoo ,you take&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>
            <li>If the price were lower, I am almost certain more people would try it, and those of use who use it, would continue.</li>
            <li>My goal was thicker and longer hair - for years, I hadn&#x27;t been able to get it to grow longer than a certain point.</li>
            <li>More vibrant and shiny!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ve got nothing to loose but more hair!! :0)</li>
            <li>OK, first I have to say I have RARELY take time to write reviews of anything.  </li>
            <li>I read the reviews and expected great results</li>
            <li>Used this in combination with Biotin - 10,000 mcg (10 mg) daily, noticeable difference within 3 weeks - stronger hair with bright sheen  &amp; almost no hair loss.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really say this if conditioner or shampoo have made any real difference because I&#x27;m honestly only subscribing to all 3 Vivscal products because it&#x27;s recommended that these products be used in conjunction with the oral supplements because work best when used together.</li>
            <li>the full effect will emerge after 6 months.</li>
            <li>I took Viviscal for a full month as directed and was encouraged to see a difference in the thickness of my eyelashes, feeling that soon my hair would start to show improvements.</li>
            <li>, I read review on viviscal and think this is the most promising to try.  </li>
            <li>Really worked to make my hair grow faser and get healthy again.</li>
            <li>This really works and my hair has never grown so well or been so healthy since I started taking this supplement.</li>
            <li>I figured that if it&#x27;s her business to try and look good as much as possible, she probably knows something!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t known how good it will work only been taking for 8 weeks</li>
            <li>/&gt;Delivery was fast and I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>I used to have adolescent acne but was entirely manageable, not bad and to this day use still love using my Proactiv products, skin is clear and great, so</li>
            <li>/&gt;6 months to get full results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to give it the full 90 days though.</li>
            <li>and you can tell her hair is longer and looking full.</li>
            <li>B00MMA7W5C Hair Growth Essentials: #1 Rated Hair Loss Supplement for Women and Men - Advanced Hair Regrowth Treatment With 29 Powerful Hair Growth Vitamins &amp; Nutrients for Rapid Growth -</li>
            <li>/&gt;Between the two, I was able to begin to regain the growth I&#x27;d lost and my hair was growing in much stronger.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had good luck with all 3 products, although they affected my hair problem differently.</li>
            <li>I am getting ready to order some more this month.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  </li>
            <li>I have never written a review for anything before, but this truely deserves 5 stars from me.  </li>
            <li>When I was reviewing the reviews again the 2nd time i thought about it, I saw a lot of good reviews so decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>i keep forgetting to take them 2x daily, so can&#x27;t give a fair review in that respect.</li>
            <li>and my edges are in full effect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s recommended 6 full months</li>
            <li>I am dissapointed and would like to have a full refund.  </li>
            <li>I have not taken this product for a full month yet</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sticking with it for a full year to see what it does.</li>
            <li>I am going to continue for the full 90 days then</li>
            <li>This product does everything it says it does, my hair never looked better, so much shine and body.</li>
            <li>2012.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The length of my hair is now at my lower mid-back with full, even ends, about 5 inches from my waist.</li>
            <li>2012.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The length of my hair is now at my lower mid-back with full, even ends, about 5 inches from my waist.</li>
            <li>After just a couple months of taking them, I noticed my hair was much thicker and had more body.</li>
            <li>I also have a very strict and consistant hair routine that also has been astonishing for my hair</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference until I was taking it for about 2 months, but then there was a noticeable difference in length and even better texture.</li>
            <li>When people think of thinning or balding hairlines they think of men, yet it&#x27;s just as true for women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Many thanks.</li>
            <li>I heard of this product on Dr. Oz and tried it because my hair was coming out by the hand full.  </li>
            <li>The product seemed to help produce more very fine hair growth but not enough to warrant my continued use.</li>
            <li>Also, my nails have always been strong and grow very fast.</li>
            <li>I can not speak for others but I have tried viviscal and for me it works like magic ,I have tried other things on the market but this for me is magic in a pill it has done what it said it would do and more, im hooked on this</li>
            <li>Just recently reordered a 2-month supply since I&#x27;ve experienced a positive difference.  </li>
            <li>I have no problems swallowing them, they are pretty easy with a gulp of water.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It helps that the pills are easy to swallow and don&#x27;t smell or taste funny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It helps that the pills are easy to swallow and don&#x27;t smell or taste funny.</li>
            <li>This product might be great for other people</li>
            <li>Like others, I also experienced rapid hair growth in other locations requiring shorter interval betweens shaving/waxing.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that my eyebrows filled in first and then started seeing more hair on the sides of my &amp;#34;bangs&amp;#34; - where it had really been thinning.</li>
            <li>I could notice more health in the new growth of my hair, but i would have appreciated MORE than what I had after couple months of using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I saw results quickly.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed much improvement yet, but I was worried about having an allergic reaction and so far so good.</li>
            <li>When I became inconsistent with taking them in about month 3 and 4 the effect was quickly lost.</li>
            <li>I have noticed longer hair that&#x27;s growing quickly.</li>
            <li>I have been using viviscal for years off and on, whenever I need my hair to grow quickly and it does work</li>
            <li>I believe it also contributed to my relatively quick regrowth.  </li>
            <li>My hair grows so quickly with this product and it seems thicker -</li>
            <li>I do find it makes my hair greasy quickly, which I dislike.</li>
            <li>someone sees what I wrote and knows of another pills to grow hair quick and won&#x27;t do these effect</li>
            <li>Seems to work quick delivery</li>
            <li>I regularly take Irwin Naturals hair skin and nail formula - and it has some of the ingredients as Viviscal (most notably the Biotin).  </li>
            <li>Not only is the volume of hair better, but the over-all health of my hair is better.</li>
            <li>I also was super nauseous after taking it.</li>
            <li>I did quickly notice a difference in the thickness of my hair.</li>
            <li>quick and as described</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be able to write a better review prior to February</li>
            <li>Most definitely recommend :)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to those who are patient and can safely take it.</li>
            <li>The last time my hair was this healthy was 20 years ago with my first pregnancy!!!  </li>
            <li>chips!!&lt;br /&gt;I now have BEAUTIFUL new growth all across my temples and the entire hairline.</li>
            <li>This product was recommended by my dermatologist when I expressed concern that I was losing more hair than normal.  </li>
            <li>Try other products this one is the best so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually not one to leave rave reviews, but this product is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>people experienced cystic breakouts - i had never even heard of that before and when i checked out pictures online, sure enough that was what i was seeing on my back!  </li>
            <li>The result is simply brilliant and almost unbelievable.</li>
            <li>I bought this because it had good reviews I justo have long hair</li>
            <li>to me having a full head of hair is worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have superfine hair that breaks easily to begin with, so when I started to lose more of it due to a thyroid condition I tried Viviscal after reading so many positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>36 years old with very fine, thinning hair.</li>
            <li>I have even seen new hair growth at my temples where it was most noticeable.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t notice more (read new) hair growing during the 6-8 months I took this.</li>
            <li>After that time, I wasn&#x27;t sure I noticed any new hair growth, so I stopped.  </li>
            <li>Without my even telling my long-time hairdresser that I had started using Viviscal, she commented on how she could see so much more new growth when I get my hair colored.  </li>
            <li>I had previously bought Viviscal and it worked great.</li>
            <li>My hair is slightly thinning in the crown, but I&#x27;m still extremely happy with the results.</li>
            <li>I realized that the first 2 boxes I bought were the old stock, it was effective and works like a miracle</li>
            <li>Surprisingly I have also noticed my extremely dry skin disappear on my face.  </li>
            <li>I first saw ads for Viviscal about a year before I bought it, but I didn&#x27;t think there were good enough reviews at the time.  </li>
            <li>All in all, I am very satisfied and will continue taking the vitamins for a few more months until I achieve the desired hair length.</li>
            <li>The pills are easily digestible and the two pills per day is reasonable.</li>
            <li>I got lucky and found this extremely useful hair nutrient solution.</li>
            <li>THANKS!!</li>
            <li>Of all the product I tryed in the past, this is the best for my hair after about two months of use I am seeing hair grow back in the top of my head.</li>
            <li>I really want it to work!!</li>
            <li>is my first review writing!</li>
            <li>These tablets are pretty pricey but it works!  </li>
            <li>I do feel like my hair gets oiler quicker (but that could also be the hot summer weather too!).  </li>
            <li>Just be aware!</li>
            <li>this is NOTHING like i have ever experienced before and have never been so disappointed after purchasing a product with so many good reviews.  </li>
            <li>It really works!!</li>
            <li>my hair feels so much thicker now!!  </li>
            <li>and I really hope to see an improvement!!</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I first heard about viviscal.  </li>
            <li>Thanks again!!</li>
            <li>My hair came back better than ever!</li>
            <li>but hey, there&#x27;s a lot of damage to fix, and while its no where near my gorgeous hair of yesteryear, I can live with it now.</li>
            <li>Also a mild headache for a whole day and got light headed a couple of times too.</li>
            <li>I was determined to give the product 6 months, as I read somewhere ( most likely on their own website, although I can&#x27;t find what I read any more) that it took that long to start seeing results.</li>
            <li>They stop doing certain activities that they may enjoy because it can add to their hair loss or thinning hair.</li>
            <li>and I have experienced a little growth in areas where the hair stopped growing completely.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I started growing a few silky hairs on my elbows, lol, so</li>
            <li>I definitely saw some amazing growth while using this...</li>
            <li>I have been using the product for a few months and have been happy with the results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m doing a lot of things to get myself healthier, but I think the viviscal really played an important roll.</li>
            <li>My hair seems thicker as well, and nails are amazing especially since I removed acrylic tips when I began the Viviscal.</li>
            <li>By the end of one month the texture of my hair had improved, by the end of 2 months, you could really start seeing genuine growth at the hairline.  </li>
            <li>I use Reservage Keratin booster vitamins because it&#x27;s the cheap version of the product Kyle Richards from Real Housewives of OC uses (can&#x27;t afford the one she uses which are Nourage).  </li>
            <li>But honestly nothing was able to bring me back my old hair.&lt;br /&gt;Finally</li>
            <li>so I could start fresh.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for 4 months and am satisfied with the results so far.</li>
            <li>This is worth the price for me.</li>
            <li>I heard about Viviscal through a third party endorsement - an article by a popular model listing products she likes, so that recommendation seemed worth taking.</li>
            <li>but I do believe its worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was very hopeful when I read all of the great reviews here, but I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months now, and I see absolutely no change to my hair whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>Really worth the money.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about a month, and I can&#x27;t really tell if it&#x27;s the Viviscal or the amazing natural products I have been using in my hair.</li>
            <li>I gave the rest of my 6 month supply to my lovely 76 year old mother, who is trying to thicken her hair and gain some weight.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t worth it, to me.</li>
            <li>It is pricey, but worth it if you are in dire need like I am...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly this isn&#x27;t worth your money-but if you are exploring alternative hair growth options, and have some money to blow-you might want to give this a shot.</li>
            <li>$100.00 ((wasn&#x27;t worth it at all).  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li>I was getting it directly from Viviscal and paid more for it from them.</li>
            <li>Changed to a different kind, and with days my hair was falling out by the handfuls.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>I have not really given this a good trial yet but will.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied so far and will review after 60 days.    </li>
            <li>Hope this continues as worth every penny if it does.</li>
            <li>I use this product along with a natural shampoo with biotin and a potent herbal blend and the results are amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worth the money to me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been coloring, as well, so since I&#x27;m really rough on my hair, I&#x27;m glad that these pills are doing wonders to keep my hair healthy.  </li>
            <li>id say its definitely worth around $40 a month.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Def it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>Worth the $$ because it works.</li>
            <li>Being a woman one of the most sensitive things to talk about is weakened hair.</li>
            <li>but for me worth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll decide then if it&#x27;s worth $30 a month (for the rest of my life, I&#x27;m guessing)</li>
            <li>It is a bit pricey, but so worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I rarely use a hairbrush now.</li>
            <li>I rarely use a hairbrush now.</li>
            <li>it is worth it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product is okay so far after about 2 months.</li>
            <li>It may work for some, but is it worth the cost?</li>
            <li>Well worth it because it truly has improved the health of my hair.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price to me</li>
            <li>My edges are growing back in nicely.</li>
            <li>they all love it and how it completely transforms your hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is appropriate for any age group between 20-80 years old.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricy but its worth it.</li>
            <li>It does cost more to go directly from the source but</li>
            <li>I took it for a week and then decided the breakout and oil wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>I think it is worth the $40 risk.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is the price since it is kind of pricey.</li>
            <li>I am almost through my second month of taking Viviscal, and I can honestly say that I have seen very positive results.  </li>
            <li>even more so that it all works together safely and didn&#x27;t counteract my other medications.</li>
            <li>Maybe overall time I&#x27;ll see a more significant difference.</li>
            <li>hair always and still does grow quickly, but has been thinning since my first pregnancy.</li>
            <li>I once again have \\&quot;good hair days\\&quot; at lot, and I like my hair for the first time in a long time!!</li>
            <li>I am very healthy conscious and mostly used organic products and minimal chemical product and rarely perm, blow or color my hair after the hair loss issue started for 4 years.</li>
            <li>To never ever have experienced something like this before, it is incredibility disheartening that a product can produce such a side effect on someone who does not normally breakout and do not consider myself to have sensitive skin (some find Proactiv incredibly sensitive to them and it has worked great for me).  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that the original volume has been restored but my hair looks much healthier.  </li>
            <li>Good product and does not repeat on me like other supliments have.</li>
            <li>Unless you know someone personally that had good luck with this exact product I highly suggest trying for hair nutrients elsewhere!</li>
            <li>now they&#x27;ve grown out and my hair feels so much healthier :) highly recommend.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right</li>
            <li>Hair stylist commented on it right away.</li>
            <li>Whatever I am doing I am doing it right now.  </li>
            <li>Unless I styled it just right, there were almost bald-looking areas that showed.  </li>
            <li>My hair never grew in right after having chemo.</li>
            <li>My right kidney area seems to hurt often, but I have no way of knowing that this is causing</li>
            <li>in the midst of using this product right about now, so, no verdict is in just yet.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s too soon right now.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t notice it right away</li>
            <li>stopped hair loss and new hair growth is strong and shiny...</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t notice a lot of new hair and my hair is still fine, but it&#x27;s worth using.  </li>
            <li>My scalp was showing easily but with the new growth it is starting to look more full, The regrowth is about 3/4 inch</li>
            <li>you can EASILY see my scalp on the whole top of my head and above my ears.  </li>
            <li>I have been taking the not pleasant tasting huge tablets of Great Earth for two decades or so, maybe even longer.  </li>
            <li>(I love having a bit more hair around my scalp), but should cost less for that.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Viviscal Extra Strength Hair Nutrient Tablets through Amazon and was extremely pleased with how quickly I received the product...  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend doing both to achieve healthy and vibrant hair.</li>
            <li>Not sure about all these great reviews.</li>
            <li>I was taking the Great Earth NSP program, GNC Women&#x27;s Hair Skin and Nails formula, and now for this past year Viviscal.  </li>
            <li>Although I have not noticed a huge difference in my hair, it does appear to be growing faster than normal.  </li>
            <li>I had completely damaged my hair from over processing, and it was becoming thinner, and my hair line started to recede.</li>
            <li>I may very well end up doing the full six months</li>
            <li>Within the first 2 weeks I could see significant improvement in how much hair I was loosing in the shower and my hair brush.  </li>
            <li>This is my second order for this product, and I must say I have absolutely fallen in love!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference.&lt;br /&gt;Its not a bad product, I just won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li>I would NEVER have believed my hair could grow so long if I had not witnessed the results with my own eyes.  </li>
            <li>Nothing will make your hair grow super fast and thicken up unless you take the right vitamins, eat well, exercise, and try try to leave your hair alone with alot of blow drying and curling irons, and dont wash it every day.</li>
            <li>The only warning I have is that for me (I have very fine hair)</li>
            <li>I am still in my first month of using this product,  am looking forward to positive results!</li>
            <li>My hair was fine before, but was becoming a bit dry from lightening it some.  </li>
            <li>This product costs a lot of money per package and you do have to purchase many (a couple of months worth) to actually see results.</li>
            <li>It does not grow super fast.  </li>
            <li>I took Viviscal extra strength for about ten days and experienced severe headaches</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s only been taking if for about 5 weeks now and isn&#x27;t always great at remembering to take the second pill, but already I am seeing a difference.  </li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s not Victoria Secret model hair, it&#x27;s just really great to be free of the worry and anxiety.</li>
            <li>So far, I feel like it really helped my hair grow and stay healthy.</li>
            <li>wish it would repair hair better on top of my head, still space and missing hair,</li>
            <li>The fact that it&#x27;s natural and safe really got me hooked at the start.  </li>
            <li>It grew out at the standard length of a 1/2 inch monthly but it really thickened up nicely.  </li>
            <li>I used to shed great amounts daily, now I only lose 1/2-1/3 of what I used to shed.</li>
            <li>I just ordered my second month&#x27;s worth and hoping i will see even greater results with continued use.</li>
            <li>I used to have acne, but when I became a vegetarian my complexion became very clear and smooth.</li>
            <li>After your body goes through significant weight loss, it is normal to experience hair loss as your body is in a state of malnutrition.</li>
            <li>it looks good - is thick but very fine and naturally curly.  </li>
            <li>And it was very amenable to styling.</li>
            <li>very fast.  </li>
            <li>VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED SELLER !</li>
            <li>when auto-ordered on Amazon &amp; shipping is very fast.</li>
            <li>I had noticeable breakage around my edges which has plagued me for years due to braiding and chemical treatments but now even after years of trying many remedies my patches have filled in</li>
            <li>It is also in great shape (but I rarely ever blow dry or curl it and try to only wash once a week).</li>
            <li>Added bonus, my nails have become very strong and long which I have never had in my life</li>
            <li>After becoming a vegetarian three years ago I suffered major hair loss-losing about 3 inches of hair because of a protein deficiency.</li>
            <li>It made huge difference in my hair texture and strength..am not losing hair as much as i did before which ws my main concern...</li>
            <li>It is hard to believe it works so great</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>, this is the real deal baby!</li>
            <li>Please be safe when taking anything and following the directions</li>
            <li>I read all the great reviews even the reviews where ppl complained about it causing acne</li>
            <li>I love it, my hair is definitely growing much faster!</li>
            <li>benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product for the first time a month ago.</li>
            <li>Overall I have healthy hair.</li>
            <li>I asked my sister to gauge my hair length as compared to when I first started six months ago</li>
            <li>My hairline is still filling out more and oddly enough</li>
            <li>This stuff REALLY works!</li>
            <li>I am willing to keep trying, though, as I understand it can take 6 months to work.</li>
            <li>I started incorporating fish and more healthy fats back into my diet to try and reverse the hair loss, but my hair would never get back to what it was.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Viviscal to anyone struggling to grow their hair!!</li>
            <li>I brought this product the first time, and I feel it works.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Two, be aware if you take Viviscal in conjunction with a biotin supplement, it may cause cystic acne.  </li>
            <li>That said, I&#x27;m a total believer, and now that my bald spots have cleared up, I continue to take the Viviscal because my hair and hairline have never looked better.</li>
            <li>So even more stress but granted, this was sheer</li>
            <li>I will post a review at the top of the year and give my final opinion.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommend it and it really works!</li>
            <li>My hair has really started to fill in!</li>
            <li>Btw, I don&#x27;t get paid to write this review, as I was so encouraged by the review written by other that give me the confident to try, I now in turn hope to help others!</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work!</li>
            <li>While I know that it may be my thyroid disease at fault here, I also started getting cystic acne for the first time in my life</li>
            <li>just so you guys know, this is my first ever review on any kinds of product</li>
            <li>Just to track the growth, I colored my hair the first day of taking Viviscal to see the difference.  </li>
            <li>This happens to be the first time trying this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>I started taking Viviscal about a month ago, so I&#x27;m just finishing up my first box.  </li>
            <li>I may be willing to try another 30 days.</li>
            <li>I doubled my last order to make sure I don&#x27;t miss a day of my Viviscal.</li>
            <li>I first realized it and compared the boxes side by side.</li>
            <li>went for my anual physical, albeit a couple of months more than I should have gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Looking forward to more growth as I&#x27;m now on my second month!</li>
            <li>But this is the first time that the tablets appeared &amp;#34;old&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>It was gradual at first, but began to pick up speed.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and delivered on time.</li>
            <li>I am almost finished with my first pack</li>
            <li>I see absolutely no change or improvement of any kind.</li>
            <li>First, I must say I have a friend who recommended this to me since it has helped her</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that my hair seems like it has more split ends when it grows with this stuff</li>
            <li>I figured Viviscal must be worth a try, and after having a baby and losing handfuls of hair for almost 2 years straight I&#x27;d try anything.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny that the thickness didn&#x27;t stay.</li>
            <li>I love the added benefit of having my eyebrows grow thicker because they are usually very fine and hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li>I have been using these supplements for the past 4 months and my hair is definitely more healthy.</li>
            <li>I am sure that it affects everyone different</li>
            <li>I first heard about it on one of Dr. Oz&#x27;s shows.</li>
            <li>I tried many things over the last 3-4 years but nothing seem to make a difference.</li>
            <li>I am over 50 and my hair is thinning especially on the top.  </li>
            <li>This one is advertised as &amp;#34;extra strength&amp;#34; but the &amp;#34;men&#x27;s&amp;#34; version has more of the supposed key ingredient.  </li>
            <li>It is really work!</li>
            <li>Then I ordered more and noticed the packaging was different.  </li>
            <li>I hope that all women that have gone through menopause be carefull and check with your doctor first.</li>
            <li>but I keep taking it just in case ;-)  </li>
            <li>ive finished my first pack</li>
            <li>I love it either way and have actually received comments on my hair a lot!</li>
            <li>but i decided to stop 1 min to say that it really works!</li>
            <li>I first learned about Viviscal tablets from a model on a photo shoot.  </li>
            <li>It really works!  </li>
            <li>It is growing everywhere except in the top back part of my head.  </li>
            <li>I first learned of this product on Dr. Oz&#x27;s show and wanted to give this product a try...  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my first pack and about 3 1/2 weeks in.</li>
            <li>I am strict about taking 2 pills a day, no specific time, but I make sure I take 2 a day.</li>
            <li>My hair wasn&#x27;t coming back, but it was maintaining which was better than nothing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>It performs exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I am pleased to report that the thinning areas of my hair are starting to fill in.</li>
            <li>I have not seen any improvement in the first three weeks</li>
            <li>This product really works!  </li>
            <li>mother first tried Viviscal about a year ago.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a difference after the first month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;HOWEVER, when I first started using it</li>
            <li>My first instinct was to suspect the Viviscal</li>
            <li>I am naturally thin and have NEVER had an issue with staying at my ideal weight or taking off a couple of pounds when needed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an Asian woman in my 40&#x27;s with hair that is thinning on top.</li>
            <li>I used to color my highlights every 12 weeks and most recently had to do it after 8 weeks because of the increased rate of hair growth.</li>
            <li>I started taking this product 3 months ago, the first thing I noticed was how oily my hair became, and that was within the first 24 hours of taking the supplement.</li>
            <li>I have blonde hair and put highlights in it which dries it out, and this kept it healthy.</li>
            <li>So, I finally decided to just try one more product.</li>
            <li>About 3 months ago, I bought the first box of Viviscal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What I ordered was exactly as shown.</li>
            <li>i just finished my first month on this</li>
            <li>Biotin is no wonder pill, but it works pretty well when you&#x27;re good about taking it everyday.</li>
            <li>I started taking it because I cut 5 inches off of my hair that I want back more than anticipated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with it for the three month period that they suggest and hope that I don&#x27;t go bald first.  </li>
            <li>I tried this product, for the this first month I was discouraged.</li>
            <li>I wish I had tried this product first.</li>
            <li>Really works !</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>- I emailed the company and they said that can happen the first couple months until your body gets use to it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not even two weeks later her hair was looking fuller and better than it ever has.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely recommend that you try these, but look at the seller first.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money at first</li>
            <li>After my next set of tablets I should be sure, hair seems to be stronger than before the viviscal.</li>
            <li>I tried many different things to help my hair stop falling out, but it continued to shed</li>
            <li>I really believe this product has made a difference in my hair!  </li>
            <li>It takes time, I had baby hair at first</li>
            <li>did notice they made my stomach a bit bloated the first day</li>
            <li>&quot; my first month, now getting about 2-2.5\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Then, after about 1-1/2 months of taking the vitamins, my hair growth really increased!</li>
            <li>It is so much thicker and fuller!</li>
            <li>Still looking and doing my homework on growing back healthy hair</li>
            <li>But it does really give the hair you&#x27;ve got all it needs to prosper!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my first box.  </li>
            <li>This really does work!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It seems that I grew more hair on my upper lip than I did on my scalp!</li>
            <li>I have more hair than I know what to do with in only 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough about it.:-)</li>
            <li>(I love myself blonde, since that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve always been).</li>
            <li>and I cannot tell you how fast my hair has regained strength!</li>
            <li>Funny thing is I never took Viviscal for hair growth</li>
            <li>This is the first time I write a review</li>
            <li>Ran out of Biotin, but taking Viviscal consistently.</li>
            <li>Ran out of Biotin, but taking Viviscal consistently.</li>
            <li>The product does say use for 6 months, this is the first month my hair is growing but the areas where I&#x27;m thinning or balding has shown no improvements.</li>
            <li>Absolutely works!</li>
            <li>I JUST started taking those tablets and already 5 days later my hair feels fluffier and got more shine.</li>
            <li>The first effect I noticed in the first 3 months of use was in my nails.  </li>
            <li>I just started the product last week and noticed within hour of using product my hair just looked shinier and had a better texture.</li>
            <li>After the first box of 60 tablets, I noticed nothing.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t willing to suffer any longer.</li>
            <li>So, if you think that you are getting more of any thing in the extra strength, think again.</li>
            <li>I do want to mention that when I first started using the pills, they did not have any after taste.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone that either experienced hair damages, shedding, thinning or slow hair growth.</li>
            <li>Well 3 months later off Viviscal and on Biotin alone, it seems like I have lost more hair again -</li>
            <li>My hair was exactly as it was before I started.  </li>
            <li>It had grown like a weed and was so much thicker!</li>
            <li>This product did nothing but make my bowels more regular.</li>
            <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t think anything of it because I am a graduate student and prone to headaches.</li>
            <li>It helps with hair growth, the fullness of your hair, and it&#x27;s consistent,</li>
            <li>As a first hear teacher those in the industry know that in between planning lessons, grading, teaching, meetings, ongoing trainings, school events and</li>
            <li>It really Works!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The purple/white package is made in Ireland and has a lot more ingredients (niacin, biotin, etc.) than the purple/light blue package does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a lot more fuzzies and baby hairs starting to grow.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, will order again!</li>
            <li>I just finished my first month</li>
            <li>I purchased this product after reading MANY reviews, as I have tried countless \\&quot;hair and skin\\</li>
            <li>twenty first birthday gift</li>
            <li>did break out with one or two pimples the first week</li>
            <li>so I thought the extra strength would be better.  </li>
            <li>Just finished my first box</li>
            <li>This is going to be my first review</li>
            <li>Give these at least 6 months for really great results</li>
            <li>Since I am no longer a sweet young thing - I cannot attest to my hair growing super fast as some have reported.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve given this product 3 stars because I still have not seen any results as far as more new hairs growing on my head.</li>
            <li>I have had more hair loss with the new formula than with the old.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a new high school teacher and the start of this year hasn&#x27;t been easy for me.</li>
            <li>one good thing I can say about this, was that it did help my eyelashes VERY slightly.</li>
            <li>I read lots of reviews on this product before I ordered them and they were all pretty positive</li>
            <li>Thse are a fairly large size, similar to the size of most multivitamin capsules.</li>
            <li>You have to take it with other vitamins though and nothing is overnight amazing</li>
            <li>The hair along my temples had filled in a little more (I lost a lot of hair in that area after child birth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other products before and they were not as effective as this one.</li>
            <li>Just hope it is as effective as the other formulation.</li>
            <li>I have been taking these supplements for nearly a year and have seen significant thickness to my hair.</li>
            <li>Slowly but surely :-)</li>
            <li>I do attribute part of this result to a recent change in diet and eating better and much healthier foods.</li>
            <li>I have to admit it is nice to finally see results without dealing with heartburn or upset stomach as an unexpected &amp;#34;bonus&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Helped to strengthen my hair big time, getting ready to order more .</li>
            <li>Its kind of weird to be honest.  </li>
            <li>However, this product so increased the speed of growth that I see my young full head of hair again after the first box.</li>
            <li>The old was better so if you can find the old one, buy it.  </li>
            <li>thanks this is my second box hoping  for more hair</li>
            <li>I am wondering if I might not have had even better results if I had started when my hair first started thinning and my hair follicles were not dormant for so long.</li>
            <li>I bought this product to help my thinning hair grow in better, this should take at least two more months before I see that happen.</li>
            <li>Received right away and Viviscal really works fast.  </li>
            <li>I started taking this product over a year ago due to some damage from being a frequent &amp;#34;hi-lighter.&amp;#34;  I experienced a lot of new growth,</li>
            <li>I started taking Viviscal to grow my hair longer and hope for a positive effect on my nails as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although I have not been using this product for the recommended 6 months yet, it does seem to be having a positive effect on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for almost 2 months and am still waiting to see some positive results.</li>
            <li>I purchased a two month supply and plan to continue using it as there is so much positive feedback, and I did research before investing.  </li>
            <li>I am just about finished with the box, and I did not have any positive results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give the benefit of doubt to those who say they&#x27;ve had all the positive changes to their hair, but it didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li>I have been taking this product for 2 months and noticed positive results immediately.  </li>
            <li>It takes awhile of continued use, but I believe there has been a positive change in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Hope it continues to be positive.</li>
            <li>I bought this product after reading the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>rather it had some positive effect on my hair.</li>
            <li>a positive one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to take for another two months and will update my review</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notices  ANY positive result from the vitamins after 60 days.</li>
            <li>Any growth in my situation is positive.</li>
            <li>I decided to give viviscal a try after reading its mostly positive reviews on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I generally have blemish free skin.  </li>
            <li>One  the first things I noticed is that my skin and scalp  became very oily when I started using this product.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with the original and was buying a box consistently for 2.5 years from the only local store that carries it.</li>
            <li>I remain confident Viviscal will make a difference for me in the long run.</li>
            <li>As for hair growth, since I have grey hairs that I color over, I can confidently say that my hair grows about an inch a month.</li>
            <li>It was cute and sassy but I still missed my long hair.</li>
            <li>my hair is also growing pretty fast.  </li>
            <li>This product is the first one I ever heard of that really make your hair grow.</li>
            <li>The produce came pretty fast in the mail</li>
            <li>It did take a full 3 days after stopping this supplement for the headache to completely subside....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been taking good care if my hair for awhile, and although it was soft and healthy, it was still thin.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a good product to use if you have fine hair, but it&#x27;s not going to totally change from super fine to mega thick.</li>
            <li>So I was looking at my pictures of when I was pregnant with my son and shortly after then noticed that my hair was so beautiful, long thick, shinny and healthy.</li>
            <li>I took this pill for 60 days and it kind of slowed down the hair loss process for awhile.</li>
            <li>Quickly - I noticed thicker, less shedding and more manageable hair.</li>
            <li>Love the product and highly recommend - especially since</li>
            <li>suspected one of the suplements that I am taking saying that suplements are not regulated by the FDA and that many are made outside of the U.S., mostly in China, where other ingredients are added for one reason or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That is enough to keep me going for another couple months, since I want to give it the full 6 months to work like the box says!</li>
            <li>Wow, I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s working so quickly for him, and that&#x27;s with inconsistent use.  </li>
            <li>The product is in an easy to use tablet form, and can be incorporated into your daily supplement regimen.</li>
            <li>It becomes less effective after the 1st month.</li>
            <li>, my hair is only growing at its normal rate (yes i am sure because i have been literally measuring my growth with a tape measure).</li>
            <li>After just one week of usage I could easily feel the different.</li>
            <li>My hair is thick, supple, and pretty much gorgeous ..</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about 6 weeks  which isn&#x27;t long enough to fairly evaluate.</li>
            <li>I can say that while there&#x27;s been no dramatic thickening of the hair yet, fall out does appear to be slowing.  </li>
            <li>I have been taking Viviscal for just about a month now, so not long enough to be certain of the results, but I am seeing new hair growth along the hairline and baby fine hairs, but it is more than I had before.  </li>
            <li>It did not look any shinier and it certainly did not look any fuller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would never order it again and have certainly spread the word about it</li>
            <li>The drain would have a large pile of hair in it every time I took a shower, it was going on for months.</li>
            <li>So I am certain that Viviscal helped my hair growth.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t thinning, it wasn&#x27;t falling out in large amounts every time I&#x27;d take a shower or wash my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was then that I noticed the change in texture and again the large amounts of hair I was losing in the shower.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the first month I noticed my hair was starting to get really shiny and smooth.  </li>
            <li>:)  A few tips: one, I started taking a stand-alone iron supplement and generally felt better.  </li>
            <li>WASTE OF MONEY that I stock up so many boxes of junks!</li>
            <li>Less breakage also, I do want to add I&#x27;ve been fresh juicing and eatting healthy foods and taking multivitamins an herbs</li>
            <li>It typically doesn&#x27;t grow very fast at all, and is super fine.</li>
            <li>I have had every test done and all of my labs come back fine..</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fine, but viviscal helped the hair grow back</li>
            <li>Now, after two months, they are definitely getting more lush!</li>
            <li>I could actually tell that my hair was growing significantly, and the appearance was much thicker as well!</li>
            <li>Also, the fine hairs around my hairline are a bit thicker and facial hair grows faster too.</li>
            <li>The fine hairs around my face that used to break off and give the appearance of thinning hair seem to be gaining strength and body daily.  </li>
            <li>and it has actually help my fine, thinning hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s growing back just as quickly as the hair on the right temple.</li>
            <li>It does however make the hair you have grow long super quick, and your nails too.</li>
            <li>Good price, for hard to find item.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to those who are patient and can safely take it.inch trim at a long hair salon.&lt;br /&gt;October</li>
            <li>and I need to use it another several months before I can make an accurate evaluation.</li>
            <li>I wasted so much money before I found these amazing pills.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lol I recently got my hair chopped off because it had a ton of dead ends-</li>
            <li>I can definitely tell a huge difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>I noticed a huge difference the very next day.</li>
            <li>but about a month later I can already see a huge difference.</li>
            <li>and I really saw no difference.</li>
            <li>because when something does not work as expected I should be able to get it returned.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like the idea of taking vitamins</li>
            <li>I was losing hair by clump and shedding so much.</li>
            <li>Well I purchased a 1 month supply and within my 3rd week my bald spots on my edges were filled in it</li>
            <li>I have not noticed much hair growth yet</li>
            <li>So, I really didn&#x27;t think the Viviscal would work.  </li>
            <li>It is really too soon to determine if the product is doing what it has claimed to do</li>
            <li>This product works very well.</li>
            <li>Hair really grows faster.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>Got product fast.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen much difference.</li>
            <li>I have been using the product for three months now and haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference in terms of growth.</li>
            <li>My hair is growing really fast</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have nearly as much falling out.  </li>
            <li>However I will state this much at this point, my hair does not fall out as much, but I can&#x27;t say I have a lot of knew growth.</li>
            <li>It works very well</li>
            <li>and I can really tell my hair has been growing faster...</li>
            <li>This stuff really does work.</li>
            <li>However, it didn’t seem to really stop the loss or hair.</li>
            <li>Too much biotin may cause cystic acne, and once I flushed some excess biotin from my vitamin regimen, the cystic acne cleared up.  </li>
            <li>Took 2 of these for five straight months and noticed NO DIFFERENCE whatsoever.</li>
            <li>My hair is so much thicker.</li>
            <li>of biotin/day), but didn&#x27;t hold out much hope.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s all much thicker, to boot.</li>
            <li>I have bought this product twice now, I really can not tell if its working.</li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t take too much, stop when your hair stop</li>
            <li>I was very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am in my early forties and I am awaiting thyroid test results but heard of this product&#x27;s success so wanted to try it in the meantime.</li>
            <li>Still, I&#x27;m committed to 6 months and very hopeful.</li>
            <li>AND my hair is much stronger.  </li>
            <li>I tried this supplement for 3-4 months straight</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see hair growth as fast as I used to</li>
            <li>since I have very short hair mine filled in within 3-4 months.</li>
            <li>They had the whole salon looking at my head and everyone wanted to know what I was using.</li>
            <li>The woman that cuts my hair noticed hair growth and not as much hair falling out.  </li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>I really.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Laser comb, Rogaine, Latisse (when it comes out), and a hair transplant are much safer ways of dealing with hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast forward four months.</li>
            <li>Nails grew, not so much hair.</li>
            <li>It really works</li>
            <li>no results so far,other than my nails growing fast.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if there has been much growth in my hair.</li>
            <li>I am VERY acne prone and have not had this happen.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 56 and my hair was really thinning, but honestly except for the gray my hair is about the same now as later 30s.  </li>
            <li>I really notice a difference with my hair and nails.</li>
            <li>and I am not loosing too much hair</li>

            <li>Thanks Viviscal.</li>
            <li>This was too much iron</li>
            <li>hair loss really bothered me.</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;ve never suffered from acne my whole life</li>
            <li>The box package hasn&#x27;t changed since I started taking it but the pills&#x27; package comes in straight lines or diagonally.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to and really hoped this product would work for me.  </li>
            <li>I started see some whiteheads on my jawline and my checks, didn&#x27;t think too much of it - was in the sun and wearing sunscreen and thought it was the sweat.  </li>
            <li>Its summertime and with how my back looks currently, it&#x27;ll be WEEKS before i&#x27;ll be able to show my back, wear a tank top or a bathing suit.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about 1.5 months and my hair feels so much healthier.  </li>

            <li>It really has made a difference.</li>
            <li>I know it will take a while for it to really work.</li>
            <li>It really helped my hair from taking the beating from bleaching.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks much healthier in 1 month......</li>
            <li>, I did not see any postivie results, though I didn&#x27;t expect fast results.  </li>
            <li>the product really works if you use it consistently&lt;</li>
            <li>nails and hair are stronger and growing fast</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast and product was sealed as it should be.</li>
            <li>and it is really depressng.  </li>
            <li>its falling out soooo much and feels like it broke a lot.</li>
            <li>It was much stronger.</li>
            <li>how amazed she is at how much it has grown.  </li>
            <li>This product costs to much</li>
            <li>This product really seem to be doing the job.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
            <li>Very suspicious.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t lose as much hair</li>
            <li>You could still see her scalp (she&#x27;s 75), but not as much.  </li>
            <li>Very distressing.</li>
            <li>After about a month I noticed I wasn&#x27;t shedding as much...</li>
            <li>that is when I really started noticing growth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve posted reviews on this before - with continued use this really works.</li>
            <li>It really does work, but you need to give it time -</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find myself picking hairs off all my clothes throughout the day as much.</li>
            <li>and It works really well.  </li>
            <li>It has really help my hair.  </li>
            <li>I quit taking it about 2 months ago and started taking biotin since it&#x27;s much cheaper</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect it to work so fast.</li>
            <li>I can NOT begin to tell you all how much hair is growing.</li>
            <li>it is so much thicker.  </li>
            <li>AND I notice that I&#x27;m not losing as much.</li>
            <li>But not as much as I did before.</li>
            <li>My hair stopped growing when I was going through some very stressful events about a year ago.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know how much longer I will give it.</li>
            <li>One thought perhaps I&#x27;d changed my hairstyle since it looks so much fuller, but there is no illusion here.</li>
            <li>I believe that this does really work.</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>I have now been taking the viviscal supplements, very faithfully, twice a day, for 8 months now and see no improvement.  </li>
            <li>I have been taking this for about two months, I can&#x27;t really see if it&#x27;s working or not.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very subjective.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really see much of a difference as yet.  </li>
            <li>This really seems to be helping.  </li>
            <li>Recommend from health professional useful</li>
            <li>soo i haven&#x27;t really seen any results yet..</li>
            <li>It will take about six months to see any real results.</li>
            <li>No woman wants to suffer hair loss.</li>

            <li>It made my nails longer but not that much stronger though they still chipped.</li>

            <li>i had a Mohawk i needed to grow out for work (i am a girl) and this helped speed up the process, so much</li>
            <li>After 3 months I REALLY noticed the difference - my hair had grown about 3 inches.  </li>
            <li>Give it a couple of months to really start to feel the difference.</li>

            <li>My hair is growing but I use so much stuff</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something that works and works FAST...</li>
            <li>and I did not see much of a difference at all.</li>
            <li>I and I can really see and feel a difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much fuller than it has ever been.  </li>
            <li>my hair was really thinning now</li>
            <li>I was a skeptic on this product and was ready to give up on all hair product</li>
            <li>real difference in my nails thati can tell at this point</li>
            <li>but I did notice an increase in the length of my eyelashes -  not what I bought it for, but appreciated.</li>
            <li>and so is the hair on my chin fast and furious.</li>
            <li>and it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>(I often get acne if I eat too much sugar/cheese etc) and my nails are growing faster.</li>
            <li>and I can grow them much longer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just about ready to save my money and stop using this product.</li>
            <li>I really think it&#x27;s helping my hair growth.</li>
            <li>I really want this to work and am committed to using it for the 6 months.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really tell.  </li>
            <li>I really recommend this and will continure to use it.  </li>
            <li>I used it a month before I could see a real difference.</li>
            <li>I had been just taking the vitamins (which really helped my hair stop falling out) and then ordered these via mail.</li>
            <li>TO BEGIN WITH - really that its</li>
            <li>I also began to supplement with Biotin as some reviewers noted it was much cheaper and worked as well.  </li>
            <li>it really does work.  </li>
            <li>it does really work.</li>
            <li>and it was very achy...</li>
            <li>I felt VERY self concious and decided to do something about it.  </li>
            <li>My hair is growing very fast--1.5 inches per month.  </li>
            <li>Her self esteem hits rock bottom and she can&#x27;t stop thinking about how much hair she has lost, or will continue to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very thankful that it wasn&#x27;t the \\&quot;patchy\\&quot; hair loss.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Today, my hair has thinned and fallen out to the point that the area where my hair parts,my scalp has really begun to show.</li>
            <li>my hair is growing twice as fast</li>
            <li>And it was really evidenced by the fact I stopped for two months</li>
            <li>Within two weeks my hair stopped falling out as much</li>
            <li>This product looks promising.</li>
            <li>I just glossed over it because I didn&#x27;t want to jinks my progress, but the comments have really backed up my opinion that this product works.</li>
            <li>- can&#x27;t tell much about hair growth.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser was amazed by how much growth occurred in three months.  </li>
            <li>before I had really noticeable results.  </li>
            <li>I probably just start buying biotin instead because it&#x27;s much cheaper.</li>
            <li>hair has gotten thicker and growing fast.</li>
            <li>I contacted Amazon, they investigated the matter of the used box of pills and handled it very well.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>My hair also seems to be getting much thicker.</li>
            <li>So, i don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m going to continue to buy this product b/c i really don&#x27;t want to grow a beard.</li>
            <li>This product hasn&#x27;t changed the texture, but since it is growing  I am happy with the results and will continue to use it until I notice a change for the worse.</li>
            <li>Your ads are very misleading.</li>
            <li>This product did absolutely nothing to improve the quality or quantity of my hair.</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>I do have to say that I also grown hair in very unwanted places.</li>
            <li>Again, it made my hair grow fast, probably about an inch a month.</li>
            <li>and i think we started noticing about 1 month after she started using it it works really well</li>
            <li>and they really do make your hair grow faster because her hair has really gotten longer since she has been using them</li>
            <li>she really likes them</li>
            <li>they were very prompt in sending out my order</li>
            <li>and i recieved it very soon after i ordered it</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t know if my hair is growing faster</li>
            <li>Also my Hair doesn&#x27;t fall out as much as it did before after taking all these Products.</li>
            <li>What it did was to make my hair grow fast</li>
            <li>i gave up after 4 months, but then two separate hairdressers commented on how much baby hair was all over my scalp without knowing i was taking any supplements (i was getting extensions</li>
            <li>These really work, im</li>
            <li>take time for the hair to grow to really get the results.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that my edges are growing back in nicely, and I see moderate growth all over.</li>
            <li>I started losing more hair early last year, still am.  </li>
            <li>look more natural but it will be like growing a short hair cut</li>
            <li>I also have to shave more frequently (the only downside to taking vitamins for hair, it is not like you can pin point</li>
            <li>But so far 5 days later my skin is getting better</li>
            <li>It is not a miracle drug for hair loss, but it does give key nutrients that assist in growing strong vibrant hair.</li>
            <li>Before then, I had gorgeous, thick hair.</li>
            <li>but I have noticed a lot of new growth in the form of small frizzy hairs poking out which is a good sign.</li>
            <li>I get that my case might be very rare but is possible to break out from vitamins.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve had about almost a half inch of hair growth, which is really good for me, since my hair barely passes my shoulders without getting frizzy and breaking off.</li>
            <li>I gave it more than six months, but saw no positive change.</li>
            <li>I started noticing new growth after the first month.</li>
            <li>I take 2/day and within my first month had A LOT of new hair growth in my hairline.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that Viviscal works well for others, but I&#x27;ve been taking it for months and really haven&#x27;t noticed a difference between it and biotin or other hair-nail vitamins that cost a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li>In the second year, my hair hasn&#x27;t grown much longer than the length I achieved after 1 year, but I think it is significantly thicker and still improving.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use Nioxin shampoo (#3 for colored hair) which I feel really gets my hair clean (used to be very oily), then Clairol shimmer lights for my blonde hair (let that sit for 2 mins)</li>
            <li>One doctor suggested if maybe I am not in fact under stress it could possibly just be that when you get older naturally you lose more hair.</li>

            <li>Perfect Food Raw &amp; a multi-vitamin everyday).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited to see what the next 2 months on this system will bring!!</li>
            <li>this is my second week of using viviscal and i am excited to continue the course ...</li>
            <li>After only two weeks of using it as directed I was amazed at the significant decrease in hair loss while showering.</li>
            <li>They say that you should take them regularly for 3 months to see any significant changes.</li>
            <li>I will NOT be recommending or buying anymore unless it goes back to the original.</li>
            <li>and I have just recently noticed a significant decrease in hair shed when I comb my hair in the mornings.</li>
            <li>I love this product for my hair, but need the other hair care products to go with the vitamins.  </li>
            <li>I think it helps but cannot say for sure since I&#x27;m also taking other supplements.  </li>
            <li>I would surely recommend this product to other amazon users.</li>
            <li>By the time I got to the last three tablets, I noticed that the hairs on the left side of my head and top was longer than when I first started taking Vivascal.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to keep going because even though I don&#x27;t notice too much more, I&#x27;ve gotten compliments from other people about my hair AND eyelashes - a bonus effect</li>
            <li>Much better than any other products I have tried before.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten many comments on how thick my hair is becoming, and I&#x27;m even noticing new growth around my temples where I normally have wispy baby hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;By this time I have been air-drying my hair on large rollers, using jojoba oil, sleeping on a satin pillowcase, and detangling with a high quality comb instead of brushing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;By this time I have been air-drying my hair on large rollers, using jojoba oil, sleeping on a satin pillowcase, and detangling with a high quality comb instead of brushing.</li>
            <li>Actual new hair growth would be amazing and the only thing missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 30 years old and have been trying everything to get my hair to get thicker and longer, my hair stylist said that because of my age, how long my hair had been at that length for, and because of it not all that healthy it would not get any longer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really hoping to have a completely different head of hair in the full six month period.</li>
            <li>Like I said, for older women who are pre or post menopausal, I doubt it will pack as much of a punch.</li>
            <li>I used to clean my brush several times a day.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been told it really takes several months to get the full effect</li>
            <li>I liked the idea of the vitamins but did not get to take them long enough to see if there was a response.  </li>
            <li>very rare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I searched the postings of the more critical reviewers to see if this downside is more common but didn&#x27;t find anything.</li>
            <li>I really had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a big &amp;#34;fad&amp;#34; person and not normally one to spend this kind of money on a hair product, but when it works it works.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described and prompt, professional shipping.  </li>
            <li>Wearing a jacket or sweater before was full of hair in the back.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyone wanting to work on regrowing hair should better spend the money seeing a professional, possibly getting FUE (Folicle Unit Extraction) or a version of Minoxidil or other treatments available.</li>
            <li>I plan on using the full six month run to see if there are any further results and plan to update at three and six months.</li>
            <li>was never the kind of person to react easily to small portions.</li>
            <li>Even on a second day, I&#x27;m amazed how full it looks.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember exactly when I stopped taking Resveratrol, but it was sometime in early</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember exactly when I stopped taking Resveratrol, but it was sometime in early</li>
            <li>I started using this about 7 months ago it really works not only does your hair come back , but it makes it more manageable..</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not until later did I find out that this might be true, but the stress was also a trigger into hair thinning.</li>
            <li>If you envy every girl that goes by with long, thick, beautiful hair, then you really should try this,  </li>
            <li>I think with a product like this, you cannot expect to see true results over-night, or even after several weeks.</li>
            <li>After hearing about Viviscal on tv, I immediately bought them at a local drug store, paying full retail.</li>
            <li>In September 2013 I switched to the Extra Strength hoping that I would really see more hair growing since the regular formula didn&#x27;t seem to do the job.  </li>
            <li>It does not work overnight -- it took time, but now, about eight months after first discovering the two bald spots, they&#x27;re both completely grown over with hair, and my biggest problem is how to make my new growth blend in with the rest of my hair instead of sticking straight out the side of my head.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve notice my hair get thicker, my hair was very fine an limp.</li>
            <li>I attached a picture of my new hair growth!</li>
            <li>Like I said, I&#x27;ve had that new growth happening for about 6 months, (after I stopped nursing), and the growth process was lagging until I started this supplement!  </li>
            <li>and I can see a lot of new hair growth around my hair line!</li>
            <li>My hairdresser recommended this product and said \\&quot;she was jealous\\&quot; of all the new growth!</li>
            <li>and I wouldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>Cannot live without this stuff!</li>
            <li>However, it did not do anything for the massive amounts of shedding I&#x27;ve experienced for over a year (due to a medical condition) nor did it help with regrowth (that i can tell).</li>
            <li>It has taken about 5 months to get a lot of new hair,especially around the front hairline,and really all over my head.</li>
            <li>I have about 6 inches of new growth and it is much shinier and healthier than before I started this product.</li>
            <li>I noticed new hair growth around my hair line after a month, I guess if I would have kept it up, it would have really took off.</li>
            <li>Biotin instead, it works much better and will cost you so much less</li>
            <li>I love this stuff--my hair had been falling out for about a year and half</li>
            <li>and I know I can&#x27;t change that but wanted to restore my hair to previous healthy condition.</li>
            <li>I combined this product with vitamin B/folic acid and biotin supplements, tried to start treating my hair better (deep conditioner treatments, better hair products, less washing and use of styling tools), and cut back (pun) on highlighting and trimming it to just once every 4-6 months.</li>
            <li>I found that taking even less than the recommended dosage helped my hair grow and stay healthy.</li>
            <li>In the month that I took Viviscal, my weight steadily increased, despite no change to my eating and exercising habits.</li>
            <li>/&gt;About 9 months ago, I read a magazine article discussing hair loss, and a particular line from one of the hairdressers caught my eye: he said something about Viviscal, \\&quot;all the models take it\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I took it for a month, nothing, I bought 3 months and now as I used the last weeks of month 4, I can tell you I am going back for more.</li>
            <li>These horse pills do not appear to be working for this healthy hair having African American woman.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, there is an obvious mg change in the amounts.</li>
            <li>If anything, my hair loss continued at a steady pace.</li>
            <li>After paying varying prices (no one keeps the price steady often), I&#x27;ll continue to do so.</li>
            <li>its not about all the hoopla it receives just ok , but not fantastic fast growing</li>
            <li>I have tried everything, particularly after having two children and going through hair loss situations after both births.  </li>
            <li>I have also noticed baby hairs growing along my hair line which I believe suggests some decent re-growth is occuring.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been steadily losing my hair, I don&#x27;t know if its age , or what, but I started taking this about 2 months ago and though it hasn&#x27;t helped my hair</li>
            <li>the prices are quite decent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had moderate thinning hair for over 2 years, ruled out medical causes and have tried the recommended supplementation of B&#x27;s and more.  </li>
            <li>I did everything possible to regain the health of my hair like when I was a younger and never had my hair felt and looked soooo healthy until I took viviscal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been taking Viviscal 2x daily since Feb 1st, and have been documenting my progress to make sure I wasn&#x27;t totally wasting my money.</li>
            <li>So... if you are at all sensitive like I am stick with the regular strength if it&#x27;s still available.  </li>
            <li>I have a good feeling in the next few months</li>
            <li>so when I saw the regular Vivascal ad 5 years ago in August 2011, I ordered it and faithfully bought more when my stock got low.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I strongly advice you be careful where you purchase from.</li>
            <li>(she will flat iron it for special</li>
            <li>If you are already on a regimen for healthy hair, meaning your diet is right, you exercise, and take your other vitamins and supplements, this product is the only hair vitamin you will ever need.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, stringy and lacks volume as well as gets frizzy fast, i also had an issue with my hair falling out a lot due to stress.</li>
            <li>I have used these several times, right now I don&#x27;t seem to notice my hair growing as fast but will finish up the ones I bought and move on.</li>
            <li>At least if you own a convertible, you baldies can drive with the top down.</li>
            <li>My hair has grown a CONSIDERABLE amount since then and my nails are long and strong.</li>
            <li>Highly, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>So I bought high rated bottle of the vitamins for under $20 and it was 180 count one pill a day.</li>
            <li>My biggest issue is hair GROWTH though because my scalp is highly visible.</li>
            <li>The quality of this product is so high that even its competitors praise it.</li>
            <li>Depending on your hair problem, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Did read a comment about horsetail and the liver and am going to check that out.</li>
            <li>i had high expectations for this</li>
            <li>Have high blood pressure made my heart speed up, I stopped using.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product for anyone with thinning hair</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it😊👍</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it... Blessed</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I was also taking a high dose of Biotin but that didn&#x27;t help either.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend it....</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>one star is way too high for this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Abusing my hair with the over-use of clip-in extensions had caused a particular area of my head to feel pretty bare (as a result of the extensions rubbing against my scalp and breaking hair when I pulled them out), but the section of hair there has since began to feel thicker!</li>
            <li>At this point, I can honestly say that the hair loss has been sharply reduced--maybe one quarter of what it was initially.  </li>
            <li>- I took it for 6 months and after about 6 weeks noticed  less hair on my bathroom floor and more new hair growing on my hair line.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad they&#x27;ve lowered the price a little on this.</li>
            <li>Within one week of taking Viviscal, for the first time in my 63 years, I had a major ocular migrane.  </li>
            <li>and I was like WOW !!</li>
            <li>I will say my hair is softer and feels like it has a little more body.</li>
            <li>Yet to see the result which will take a little more usage.</li>
            <li>My hair still growed in length and got a little better over time but still had the receeding hair line.</li>
            <li>I gave it a 4 rating because I still don&#x27;t see (or has little, if any) improvement on the top of my head where it has the thinnest hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair&#x27;s long and fine but with that loss, if I put it up in a ponytail there was clearly a bald ring around my head.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this product after seeing it on Dr. Oz, but I didn&#x27;t have much hope since many other shampoos and topical products did not seem to help my very thinning hair.  </li>
            <li>I will certainly check back and provide a follow up review after about 2-3 months when results should be evident.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for several months and my hair is growing very fast and is much thicker as well.  </li>
            <li>Took about three months to see a difference; when I let up in taking them for about two weeks, I noticed more hair going down the drain!</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t made much difference in fingernails as far as I can see.    </li>
            <li>people say when you get old, hair starts growing from places you don&#x27;t want, but it&#x27;s just too much of a coincidence</li>
            <li>Still really too early to tell,</li>
            <li>I should preface by saying I&#x27;m sadly very prone to adult acne, which probably didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li>WORKS GREAT EXPENSIVE</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to be proven wrong like this.</li>
            <li>It was really damaged from dying it a bunch, but I have had it natural for three years; i use no heat or anything on it, and it still just breaks.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been taking it for a month but can&#x27;t see much difference so far</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really surprised that this product actually really works.</li>
            <li>I will know more in a few months.</li>
            <li>My hair began to grow within a few weeks of use and continues to grow at a more rapid pace than before.  </li>
            <li>Was it worth the price for an extra inch of length - nawh.  </li>
            <li>I still shed, but it is normal shedding.</li>
            <li>I am not sure I want to spend more money just to test this out, it would end up costing way too much.</li>
            <li>Normal is anywhere from 0 to 40.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>I used this for a year and my hair is long and full of body.</li>
            <li>- so let me use it for a few more times and we shell see</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update more in a few months.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t been taking it long enough to k ow for sure--</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s ok as long as my hair finally grows!!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s normal 1/2 inch.  </li>
            <li>, tooth comb that I normally use when I am going to use my curling iron.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it for a few months more and then change to the Viviscal \\&quot;nourish\\&quot; tablets.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think that is long enough to know for sure if it helps.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been taking Viviscal for a few months now and love the results I&#x27;m gotten from it.</li>
            <li>All my tests have returned normal.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure it was working after being on it for a few months.  </li>
            <li>So my hair still feels thinner than normal</li>
            <li>Hairs that were not thinning are still growing faster than normal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed my hair grew faster than normal.</li>
            <li>so if your like me but your hesitant to try a product you should definitely give Viviscal a try its worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I used this for a full year hoping it would help over the long term, all it did was drain my wallet.</li>
            <li>i rated it a five star because i have been using this product for about 5 months now, hair has grown faster than normal.</li>
            <li>You have to take it regularly, but it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>At this point, I think I will continue with this product for a few more months and see what happens.</li>
            <li>After the first package I did notice my nails were growing faster, and my hair was growing faster and getting more thick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been taking the product for 7 months and while I will admit that my hair did grow longer faster, it did NOT stop my hair from falling at its normal pace.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as soft and shiny, and I know this may sound strange, but the grays are noticeable again.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as soft and shiny, and I know this may sound strange, but the grays are noticeable again.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth a try, definitely.</li>
            <li>I think it is important to take this product everyday and may take a couple of months to first see results.  </li>
            <li>As normal though.</li>
            <li>hair growth has been almost 2x faster than normal.</li>
            <li>I have experienced little or no improvement of hair/nails over previous orders of Viviscal supplements.  </li>
            <li>I am a,most back to a normal!!!</li>
            <li>Love the product, but do not like the hidden agenda!,</li>
            <li>The new formuls has added biotin, zinc and a few others I guess to make it more marketable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update... July, I stopped taking these about two months ago....</li>
            <li>30+&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saw a dateline special where a man used it for a year and had no new hairs, but the existing hair was growing faster.</li>
            <li>three months later, I may not have a lion&#x27;s mane, but my hair is noticeably fuller and with the right haircut to give it volume</li>
            <li>but it was staying these tiny wispy sprouts of hair right around my face and now, with Viviscal</li>
            <li>I took them for five days but obviously had to stop, the acne went away right after too.</li>
            <li>In my picture, the one on the left is February 1st, and the one on the right is at the end of June.</li>
            <li>I am on my 3rd box right now.</li>
            <li>hair on upper lip has grown (waxing takes it right off with no</li>
            <li>If I see notice any more changes, positive or negative, I will update again.</li>
            <li>If I see notice any more changes, positive or negative, I will update again.</li>
            <li>My hair is super long and this is the area I was losing it in.</li>
            <li>There are other factors that are important in taking care of your hair, using the right products, not applying heat on a regular basis, and not bleaching your hair</li>
            <li>When you have Alopecia or any other condition it is important to talk to your doctor about treatment before taking any supplements if your hair follicle dies ie</li>
            <li>My subscription was canceled by Amazon due to lack of available product.</li>
            <li>but I also noticed I was sprouting new growth</li>
            <li>Item arrived new just as described, but it has not stopped my hair shedding in over 8 months of using this product.</li>
            <li>So the softness may be the new hair dye.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve seen some new hair along my hairline.</li>
            <li>I then realized it was new growth</li>
            <li>she said it looked as if I had about 4 inches of new growth.  </li>
            <li>I used it for about 3 months and saw some new growth.</li>
            <li>After using this product for five months I have not had any new hair growth.  </li>
            <li>but I like trying new hair dyes anyway.</li>
            <li>and she told me she could see new hair growth.</li>
            <li>Still, everything points to the new kid on the block, Viviscal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now that it is spring--I am noticing an increase in new growth around my hairline.</li>
            <li>Now I get an inch of new growth a month.</li>
            <li>Getting new growth and fuller.</li>
            <li>MY NAILS!!!I will keep on using this product, but if i did stop would the new growth come out?</li>
            <li>New growth and a shine.  </li>
            <li>lots of new hair</li>
            <li>not one new hair in a month.  </li>
            <li>I have new baby hairs growing everywhere.  </li>
            <li>and I have a ton of new growth.  </li>
            <li>and I have new growth around my edges.</li>
            <li>with new hair grown in the balding areas.  </li>
            <li>I had some areas that were thinning out at the hair line and now have a lot of new growth.</li>
            <li>So she stopped using the Viviscal for a couple months and started taking this new supplement.  </li>
            <li>I color my mom&#x27;s hair for her and after a couple months on the new supplement</li>
            <li>This does not thicken hair or help new hairs grow.</li>
            <li>but I have seen zero new hairs on my head.</li>
            <li>and  i found new growth in my hairline.  </li>
            <li>&quot; a month of new growth.</li>
            <li>but I did notice new hair growth after 6 months.  </li>
            <li>At 6 months I felt that I had a new head of hair.  </li>
            <li>The thinning parts of my scalp now have new hair growth.  </li>
            <li>The new hairs become visible after 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li>I have also been diligent about keeping it trimmed every 2 months to encourage new hair growth</li>
            <li>(I have a ton of new baby hairs all over my head)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>and then within 2 months I could feel new hair coming in.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve experience feeling new hair coming in three time in that time period.  </li>
            <li>So my hair is growing faster, but I also have new growth coming in as well.  </li>
            <li>and I do see new growth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any new growth yet</li>
            <li>I do see new hair sprouting up.</li>
            <li>have only used this product going on 2nd month, not sure if I am seeing any real results yet, but will stay on for a bit more and then check back in here.....:))</li>
            <li>3 yrs later  I now have about 1/3 of my hair left, and it is very fine, wispy, and totally different from before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for a full month so far due to losing large clumps of hair in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I did notice some hair growth, but it wasn&#x27;t as much as I had hoped for especially since I paid so much for</li>
            <li>I do see a difference as far as I am not losing near as much hair as I had been.</li>
            <li>I already have some great hair care products to make my thin hair LOOK thicker, but needed my hair to actually GET thicker and re-grow.</li>
            <li>and I want to see by just taking only Biotin everyday, if my Hair will stay looking as Nice as it does Now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on the end of the 4th month and noticed absolutely nothing until very recently, my hair seems stronger; that is, I&#x27;m not shedding nearly as much.  </li>
            <li>First off i&#x27;ve always had super long hair until I had my second child.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping to see growth, since my hair has been going through a major shedding phase.</li>
            <li>It does take a couple months to really notice but they make a major difference</li>
            <li>There is something in this formula that really upset my digestive tract and caused major bloating and discomfort.  </li>
            <li>The seller sent these pills in a very old, damaged box.</li>
            <li>Taking pills from a damaged box or container is never advised and I was very surprised</li>
            <li>have two weeks left on my first month &amp; have noticed NEW hair growth....</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, in the month that I stopped taking it, my nails were right back to peeling and being soft.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about 6 months and really feel that it is helping my hair; the overall texture is better and it appears to be getting a little thicker.</li>
            <li>My nails don&#x27;t break as easy, and my hair has FINALLY gotten long.</li>
            <li>I did experience some mild itching for the first few days and now it is gone.</li>
            <li>I probably have to wait a few months before I can see the full effect, but I am noticing a positive change in the way my hair feels after three weeks.</li>
            <li>I have been using VIVISCAL for a year with good results, but since my last order of 120 tablets it is important that I stress it is now extremely disappointing..  </li>
            <li>But I swear these pills make my skin CLEAR!</li>
            <li>skin got Clear! :</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so clearly snake oil!</li>
            <li>Nothing better but use it regularly layer and throw all your other stuff out</li>
            <li>I had to stop taking the pills and within a month my skin started to look clear and normal again...</li>
            <li>The only downside is I agree with other reviews that it makes your hair more oily..</li>
            <li>other than that I am a total convert..works better than anything I have EVER tried.</li>
            <li>First of all i&#x27;m 27 and my hair loss started when i was just a teen.</li>
            <li>I have used many hair strengtheners in the past, pantogar, pilfood and priorin amongst others.  </li>
            <li>only my first month taking the supplement haven&#x27;t  noticed  increased hair growth.</li>
            <li>I am giving this product an honest review because my experience with it was not good but the product itself is not at fault.</li>
            <li>and it is MINOR, short-lived and definitely worth the pay off.  </li>
            <li>While I&#x27;ve only been taking Viviscal for a short time, in three short weeks, the texture of my hair was softer and had a better sheen.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going through menopause and my hair is falling out more than usual.  </li>
            <li>Although they are in the priced end, they are better than any other similar type product I have purchased.</li>
            <li>Lastly,  there is a loading dose of two pills per day for the first 30 days; therefore, keep this in mind when you make your purchase.</li>
            <li>My hair grew back much faster!  </li>
            <li>I used this in the past, but I needed more help.</li>
            <li>I have been using Viviscal Extra Strength Hair Nutrient tablets, 60-tablets/package for the last three months and my hair is actually getting thicker and you can&#x27;t see the bald spots any more.  </li>
            <li>my hair strands are sure enough starting to slip out of my scalp while im in the shower or brushing my hair now that Viviscal is no longer in my daily supplement</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Horsetail also contains silica apparently... and too much can cause kidney problems.</li>
            <li>and wow!</li>
            <li>This means that the rate at which my nails are growing has nearly doubled!</li>
            <li>Especially if my husband knew just how much I was spending!</li>
            <li>My girlfriend tried it too and she feels EXACTLY the same!  </li>
            <li>After 3 months I have noticed a pretty big increase in volume around my scalp.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft!</li>
            <li>No medical reason for this, thought it was age, years of coloring, hot irons, etc.  </li>
            <li>So far I think this is working well!  </li>
            <li>I have been using Viviscal for about 26 days pretty religiously twice a day..</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Now first keep in mind everyone is different and what works for some may not work for others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>feel energized more than usual as well&lt;</li>
            <li>hair loss has proven results to me so far !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m stuck with a full box minus 4 pills and no refund in sight....</li>
            <li>I know thicker hair and older hair doesn&#x27;t need to be washed as much, but using this you may have to wash daily.  </li>
            <li>As stated in my previous review, my hair barely reaches 1/2 inch in a month, so I am extremely pleased so far.</li>
            <li>The new baby hairs that grew further down on my forehead make me look lots better.  </li>
            <li>I had such high hopes when I bought the Viviscal, and now I feel very hopeless.</li>
            <li>WOW WOW WOW!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyone wanting to work on regrowing hair should better spend the money seeing a professional, possibly getting FUE (Folicle Unit Extraction) or a version of Minoxidil or other treatments available.ot do anything.  </li>
            <li>I have yet to see results as far as my hair is concerned, other than that my eyebrows and upper lip are a bit more hirsute.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it for a little more than a month, but is has highly improved the texture of my hair.</li>
            <li>Previous review: I&#x27;ve been using Viviscal for about 5 months now, and have seen a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I have super fine, thin hair</li>
            <li>IT COSTS MORE, THE SAVINGS ARE NOT WORTH POSSIBLY PUTTING MY HEALTH AT RISK.</li>
            <li>My hair definitely feels thicker and healthier, and I think it has been growing much faster than normal.</li>
            <li>Small area of hair had fallen out beneath the top layers near the crown.</li>
            <li>The only down side is my hair on legs, arms, and ovr lip grows faster also, so now I&#x27;m shaving more.</li>
            <li>I had not been able to part my hair down the middle in over 25 years.</li>
            <li>More hairs growing on the scalp, so I can part my hair down the middle.</li>
            <li>I worried that longer hair would weigh down and that it would be more obvious that my scalp was thinning, but that has not happened.</li>
            <li>I take one per night, and I have definitely noticed positive changes in both my hair and my nails -</li>
            <li>I did not see much of a change the first three months, but now, after taking Vivical twice a day for the last six months, there is a very definite improvement.  </li>
            <li>(I estimate I began the last week of January), and my hair is soft, full, and the male pattern baldness around my temples has begun to fill in.</li>
            <li>I did and I noticed new growth and my hair now, 8-9 months later feels much thicker and healthier.</li>
            <li>Since starting this, my hair has stopped shedding as much and there seems to be some new growth.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, within a month from my last highlighting touch up, most of my hair had grown a full 1 inch, with some areas at 3/4 and baby hair areas a bit less (different areas of hair naturally grow at different rates).</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, within a month from my last highlighting touch up, most of my hair had grown a full 1 inch, with some areas at 3/4 and baby hair areas a bit less (different areas of hair naturally grow at different rates).</li>
            <li>I have a lot less hair in my drain now &amp; I am starting to see some thicker hair growth at the top of my head.</li>
            <li>Whether a thyroid issue, stress, nutrient imbalance, slight iron deficiency, there were many possible options but no conclusions.</li>
            <li>and my nails are very long right now.  </li>
            <li>I bought a few boxes from Target, and they were fine,.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any other changes for awhile, only my hair was becoming healthier.</li>
            <li>To the point of large dime sized cystic spots that stuck out 1/8th of an inch off my forehead and took weeks to go away, only to reappear after a month or so.</li>
            <li>After taking these for about 6 months, the little bald spot had filled in.  </li>
            <li>this product might work for someone who already has super lush healthy hair, to help maintain the quality, but people with gorgeous hair, probably don&#x27;t waste their money on crap like this.</li>
            <li>My hair is definitely growing at a steady rate!</li>
            <li>After 3 months, my hair stylist said she did think my hair had grown (after previously asking if I had the kind of hair that never really grew!).  </li>
            <li>and I am excited to see the results by the way I&#x27;m black with natural hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these to other women in similar situations-definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li>have had to invent new hair styles to look have way decent and hide my thin hair on top.</li>
            <li>This was a huge waste of money for me</li>
            <li>My skin was always really clear before so</li>
            <li>I was losing hair in clumps so that my scalp was clearly visible.  </li>
            <li>but I also have been taking Shizandra once a day and that seems to help clear my skin.</li>
            <li>As soon as I quit it, my skin was clear.</li>
            <li>I would have my face clear</li>
            <li>And the blackheads around/on my nose and on my chin clear up</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a clear difference when I run my hand through my hair</li>
            <li>Amazon offers them for sale directly at a much cheaper rate than the third parties.</li>
            <li>The negative is if you have gray hair coming in, you will have to dye your hair on a more frequent basis.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m getting some results - hair isn&#x27;t breaking as much, but I&#x27;m not noting extra growth.</li>
            <li>So far, I do like these hair vitamins.  </li>
            <li>They tout how natural the products are, while hiding the fact that AminoMar is shark cartilage.  </li>
            <li>Been taking it for nearly two months and haven&#x27;t seen results</li>
            <li>Cant wait for 6 months in to see how much hair I get back</li>
            <li>By the way, there&#x27;s nothing like being told you&#x27;re too young to lose your hair, because then you think you&#x27;re being paranoid.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m taking pictures of my progress and so far I can tell you that if you can change your diet and take vitamins this will work for you.</li>
            <li>and it being an all natural pill</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so pleasantly surprised that I have to write a review.</li>
            <li>Too early to tell.  </li>
            <li>So far no effect.  </li>
            <li>Update as of March 10th: I was doing very well taking these regularly for a while.</li>
            <li>and I really think that it has helped thicken and lengthen not only my hair but also my nails.</li>
            <li>I am 63 years old, post-menopausal with thinning hair.  </li>
            <li>and wow, I now see a difference.  </li>
            <li>As far as the supplements are concerned, it&#x27;s too early to comment on their efficacy.</li>
            <li>I had a section of hair near my temple that kept breaking off and would not grow for a year or so.</li>
            <li>My hair had been really damaged from wearing clip-in hair extensions, and I recently vowed to stop wearing them and grow my real hair back.</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my hair loss.  </li>
            <li>I am a 60 year old woman who is experiencing hair loss for who knows why.</li>
            <li>I think it is too early to rate this product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just a regular person who wants you know it works.</li>
            <li>Just do not take if you have an allergy to shellfish, as this is the basis of the all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Soooooo, ladies, these are pricey and don&#x27;t work as well as a complete vitamin paired with bioton...</li>
            <li>I think I will continue to use it for at least 3 more months.  </li>
            <li>Of course, adult men are not even supposed to take iron at all.</li>
            <li>I can no longer deny that I am seeing enough reasonable growth.</li>
            <li>I have been using Viviscal for nearly 9 months along with Walmart brand of women&#x27;s rogaine called Equate</li>
            <li>But I am a bit sensitive to iron.  </li>
            <li>I have always been sensitive, so</li>
            <li>started May 2011 with the tablets, head lotion, and the HairMax LaserComb Professional 12.  </li>
            <li>That seems to do more, at least for my nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li>only question is, what is really in this stuff?</li>
            <li>For what it is, the price is completely overblown.</li>
            <li>if amazon would not required so may works for a feedback, us extreamly busy people would leave a</li>
            <li>I was really hopeful with the product based on prior reviews</li>
            <li>I do have acne-prone/oily skin but have not had a break out like that since my early teens.</li>
            <li>As far as a pimple around my nose (???)</li>
            <li>So far, I have been taking this supplement for almost a month</li>
            <li>I am 22 years old and I am under a lot of stress at work in the shipyard.</li>
            <li>I lost so much hair after stopping birth control pills a year ago and wasn&#x27;t noticing it growing back.</li>
            <li>I have been taking 1 a day for 2 months (only on weekdays) and I&#x27;ve noticed my hair grows SO much faster.</li>
            <li>I worked for a dermatologist for many years and know that it takes at least  4 months for a supplement to even reach the scalp.  </li>
            <li>but the product saids it will take several months to see a real difference...  </li>
            <li>What I have noticed so far is a reduction in shedding.</li>
            <li>forgot to mention that my hair is very oily, I don&#x27;t mind that because it actually feels healthier</li>
            <li>really wild</li>
            <li>It is too early to tell if there is any effect on my hair growth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 52 years old and had started to experience thinning hair about 4 or so years ago.  </li>
            <li>Although he&#x27;s using the men&#x27;s Viviscal, I thought I&#x27;d post his progress pictures here so that you can see how well it&#x27;s working for him so far.    </li>
            <li>My hair stopped growing when I hit 32 years old.</li>
            <li>MY PICTURE IS 4 MONTHS OLD, MY HAIR IS LONGER THAN THAT</li>
            <li>My dad is nearly sixty</li>
            <li>The only problem is I have to get my nails done every 2 weeks they grow so fast.  </li>
            <li>WOW and Holy potato</li>
            <li>Let me also tell you all that I am 29 yrs old, and do not have thinning hair problems.</li>
            <li>It brought a natural sheen to my head of hair and strengthens the follicles..</li>
            <li>but I seem to like it so far.</li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone who wants to put Life back into their locks...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 19 years old.</li>
            <li>I figure if it doesn&#x27;t help a 19 year old with with hair loss</li>
            <li>I am hypothyroid and tried both synthetic and natural hormones, none of those helped my hair either.  </li>
            <li>So, I will keep up my experiment and see how far this supplement will take me.</li>
            <li>&amp; for the people saying if you have a sensitive stomach</li>
            <li>I am in my early 40&#x27;s with a grandmother with baldness and a mother with baldness.  </li>
            <li>so I am currently natural and</li>
            <li>but I cut my hair completely off where you could see my scalp</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t noticed increase in thickness, just hair loss is considerably less.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how fast my nails get thin (obviously since they grow faster it&#x27;s easier to judge that the hair).</li>
            <li>and I thought it might help me keep my thinning hair as a 62 year old woman.  </li>
            <li>My review has nothing to do with Vivescal itself, which I still use and buy directly off their website.  </li>
            <li>Also my facial hair has thickened, along with my nails growing annoyingly fast.</li>
            <li>So far, I have received no damage from these.</li>
            <li>I WILL GET THEM DIRECTLY FROM THE MANUFACTURER OR FROM MY DOCTOR.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 22 and in nursing school with a 2 yr old son.</li>
            <li>So far I have used it for about one month.</li>
            <li>I used it dilligently for nearly 2 years, and noticed it working after about 4 months.</li>
            <li>No signs of improvement thus far after 3 mos.</li>
            <li>I still recommend giving it a try if you don&#x27;t have a pre-existing sensitive stomach like I do.</li>
            <li>I have no complaints thus far...</li>
            <li>So far taking tabs twice day for</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much thicker, has alot of body and doesn&#x27;t need to be washed on a daily basis anymore.  </li>
            <li>old aunt on the regimen this summer</li>
            <li>Also gave me headaches frequently</li>
            <li>It was so natural.</li>
            <li>My hair did stop falling out as much but not enough for me to keep spending money each month.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 50 plus years old and a couple</li>
            <li>however I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 1/2 months so far</li>
            <li>After having permanents for over 30 years, I decided about seven years ago to go natural.  </li>
            <li>(I think completely from what I see.</li>
            <li>So far I give it one star because it&#x27;s not doing anything for me at all.  </li>
            <li>After two weeks of using Viviscal twice daily, I noticed my nails were growing much faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Into my third month of taking this supplement and haven&#x27;t seen any real results, but I&#x27;m optimistic.  </li>
            <li>they&#x27;re already, will not help anything thats completely gone</li>
            <li>Buy them directly from the website or even target/riteaide.</li>
            <li>(Yes I went that far</li>
            <li>but if you study yourself 8 hours a day and take this for 2 months you will notice a difference by up to 40% so far I should say with myself.</li>
            <li>Well, so far I can say that it has added moisture to my hair and made the brittleness go away.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really soft and straighter now.</li>
            <li>I developed a rash on my legs and acne.</li>
            <li>they might complain a bit about the price, but I believe in it so much that I told them I&#x27;d give them their money back if they used it for a month and saw no difference.  </li>
            <li>So just within 3 years ive seen my head of hair completely transformed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After 3 weeks my hair does feel soft, but it does not feel any thicker and my hair is still falling out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not a fan of misleading product info and while getting the correct item shipped from them was OK, the return process was a pain in the butt, to say the least.</li>
            <li>Hair is soft and just feels healthier too.</li>
            <li>I religiously used this product for about 4 months and absolutely saw a difference in the thickness of my hair.</li>
            <li>Not to mention that my hair definitely stopped falling out as much as it used to.</li>
            <li>As far as my hair</li>
            <li>In March, I bought the supplement directly from Viviscal.  </li>
            <li>My hair is natural but I choose to wear it straighten.</li>
            <li>Love these wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive but worth it</li>
            <li>I am slowly but surely regaining my confidence.</li>
            <li>so everyone that have some kind of hair loss or their hair  getting thin, will benefit from this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Anyway I wanted my hair to always be lush and thick and healthy until death comes to claim me.</li>
            <li>but I want long hair down to my waist and this product is working, I will order more</li>
            <li>My nails have always been very thin and brittle, now they are growing long and beautiful.</li>
            <li>I would say the packaging is sleek and the tablets are small and easy to swallow,</li>
            <li>My hair is shinier, full of life and noticing less fall out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost through my first month and will repost when I complete the second month, but so far, I&#x27;m a big fan.</li>
            <li>At 43, I went too short about 6 months ago and decided to grow it long for the first time since high school and knew I needed help, so I decided to try Viviscal.  </li>
            <li>My nails are growing so quick I have to cut them all the way down once a week</li>
            <li>While it has not been long enough to see any real hair growth differences, I can tell you with 100% certainty that my nails, which are made of keratin just like hair, are growing at a much faster rate.</li>
            <li>but considering how much other eye lash product cost-and the adverse side effects associated with them, I felt it was worth mentioning.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally blonde and curly, it&#x27;s healthy but pretty thin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve taken it for almost 5 months now and not a single new hair.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine thinning blonde hair that has been coming out heavily in the shower daily for 2 years.</li>
            <li>At about 4 weeks my hair stylist asked me if I was doing something different because she couldnt believe the amount of new hair I had!  </li>
            <li>I actually grew a new hair!</li>
            <li>Now I use Biotin 10,000 mcg and its like $8 for a 3 month supply and is actually making new hairs grow!</li>
            <li>At my last hair appointment, my stylist commented on how quickly my hair is growing - she estimated nine weeks of growth when it had only been six weeks since my last highlights appointment.  </li>
            <li>But, small price to pay to have my hair grow not only longer an thicker, but also looks an feels healthy.</li>
            <li>My length has definitely increased over the past 15 months of use, most noticeably since October (a result of lots of summer sunlight and Vitamin D exposure).  </li>
            <li>, I drink lots if water, but I did have some pimples pop on my face for the first few days which is rather unusual for my skin, but it goes off after a week</li>
            <li>skin is smoother and fine lines are less deep.</li>
            <li>First of all let me start by saying I am an African American woman.  </li>
            <li>i have been taking the pills for 23 days and just in the past couple of days have started to sense that my thin, fine hair feels bouncier with more volume than normal.</li>
            <li>I realized that the pills I just bought from CVS were like my first batch but the second batch that I bought from Amazon was different.</li>
            <li>First and foremost, while I likely couldn&#x27;t tell unless I was doing a side-by-side comparison (which I did), the pills are different sizes.  </li>
            <li>These are amazing my hair has grown sooooo long and thick since I&#x27;ve started taking them.</li>
            <li>have been taking this supplement for the past 30 days and just purchased more for the next cycle.</li>
            <li>.it was recommended to me by my very expensive newport beach ca hair stylist who says she recommends it to all her clients with astounding success.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why the product has such a high review..</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product to anyone that&#x27;s looking to increase their hair&#x27;s current growth rate....</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, it is the ONLY thing that works!</li>
            <li>Two years before this, I quit my stable high paying corporate job to return to school for my credential.</li>
            <li>That must mean there is more hair growth too in general</li>
            <li>instead of 2 previously, hair filled my comb every morning, 3-5 strains of hair come off every time I run my finger over it, hair all over the floor n sofa,  hair clog my drain, loss about 1/3 of my volume over the last 3-4 yrs.</li>
            <li>I started taking viviscal and noticed considerably less hair in my hands when shampooing within the first month,  after 6 months my hair loss was at a normal rate</li>
            <li>To fix this, I would make sure to avoid putting cream on the problem area and only take the product every other day or so, instead of every single day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I hesitated buying this product because many of the positive reviews are FAKE.</li>
            <li>The positive reviews were numerous and the negative/side effects really only centered around breakouts.  </li>
            <li>Not so much regrowth, but at least I&#x27;m not losing as much hair as much as I was before taking the vitamins.</li>
            <li>So I bought this stuff and within about 2-3 months everyone was commenting on how fast my hair had been growing and how long it looked.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I decided to buy some biotin and my hair still grows long fast.</li>
            <li>I normally have very short lashes.</li>
            <li>now I shed the normal amount of hair daily--</li>
            <li>Everything seemed normal, but was asked if I was doing anything,or taking anything different.  </li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s back to a normal shedding).</li>
            <li>but I will keep taking Viviscal until my hair gets back to normal.</li>
            <li>Not only was the packaging different, the ingredients listed on the last order was different when compared to my original order of Viviscal.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m African American women in my twenties who suffered from shedding due to perms and birth control, but more than likely</li>
            <li>I have long hair, and the only way I have been able to wear it down is with a LOT of product to boost the volume</li>
            <li>hair before I became pregnant was a little on the thicker side.</li>
            <li>At 2 1/2 months now I feel it&#x27;s pretty much the same - less hair loss and still thicker and stronger.  </li>
            <li>The pills are relatively easy to take but sometimes hard to remember to take the required two a day.</li>
            <li>I have been dealing with hair shedding/thinning due to hormonal changes and it hasn&#x27;t helped with that, but it does make the new hair that&#x27;s coming in grow much faster.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had thin fine hair, And my hair slightly thicker and definitely stronger because its able to grow longer now without breaking.</li>
            <li>At 55 my African American hair is to the middle of my back and almost as full as it was when I was in my 20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I take only one a day, and after three months I began to see new hair around the crown of my head.  </li>
            <li>Two months ago I went to a new hair stylist who dyed my hair darker, and I must say it was instantly healthier after that.  </li>
            <li>guy an update as the result was completely different with the new formula.</li>
            <li>By the second month, my stylist pointed out how much new hair growth I had - and</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t think the product actually thickens or grows new hair</li>
            <li>I have only been using this product for about 3 weeks, so I can&#x27;t speak to any new hair growth.  </li>
            <li>New hair growth started coming in around hair line after only a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>for hair growth, I definitely can see the new hairs growing in at my temples.  </li>
            <li>I had my haircolor refreshed and one week later had new growth showing.</li>
            <li>I do see short new hairs but the amount hasn&#x27;t changed.</li>
            <li>It does take time, I&#x27;m finishing 2nd month and just now seeing the new hairs popping out.</li>
            <li>Do not trust that the new pills are actually viciscal.</li>
            <li>Within my third month of taking Viviscal, I  started to notice new baby hair at the front hairline, something I had not seen in years.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been on the vitamins quite 3 months, and I&#x27;ve gained over an inch of new growth since starting the vitamins.</li>
            <li>new growth, same amount of hair shedding.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>Within the next 3 months my hair feels thicker, although I could not see any new growth.  </li>
            <li>I have a new shipment coming next week</li>
            <li>my hair seems fuller, thicker, and i can actually see new hair growth on my head.  </li>
            <li>New packs I ordered have pills of different colour!</li>
            <li>an incompetent new colourist I was trying out re-highlighted all of my fine straight/slightly wavy hair instead of doing just the roots, which caused severe damage and my hair started breaking off.</li>
            <li>and I would straight it alot and alot for school and made it really dry</li>
            <li>I was in a panic so my recently deceased Mother is actually the one responsible for my using the product.</li>
            <li>I am African American and it made my hair grow out fast.</li>
            <li>Over the last few yrs my hair has been falling out like crazy and started noticing more and more scalp visible  and was very worried I was gonna be bald soon.  </li>
            <li>In fact, my hair has started growing so fast that I&#x27;ve had to cut back on the dosage and take only one vitamin a day.</li>
            <li>I am 25 and after some different medications and stress I noticed my hair was really thinning around the crown with my part seeming larger and scalp showing in the front.</li>
            <li>it worked fast and my hair is definitely thicker after using for only a month.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get to use it long enough to see if it helped my hair loss, but be aware if you start a rash that it may be caused by this product.</li>
            <li>My hair is definitely getting longer, I don&#x27;t know about getting much thicker, but it only got 4 stars for the price.</li>
            <li>If you naturally have thin hair I don&#x27;t think this will give you more hair but will give you length.</li>
            <li>and now I am almost back to my old length!</li>
            <li>and I attribute this factor to my not seeing anything major happen in the thickness department.</li>
            <li>I started Viviscal first in 2012 for 2 months, didn&#x27;t see a difference and gave up due to the steep price.</li>
            <li>, I see no other side affects.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried it for almost 3 mos., but I don&#x27;t see any major improvement.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a normal 22 year old African Male that just wanted quicker and thicker hair growth and</li>
            <li>I have had no other side effects.</li>
            <li>The packaging says it can take 6 months, so I am not concerned that I am not seeing major results yet....</li>
            <li>I started using Philip Kingsley Elasticizer Extreme on recommendation from a salon in London.&lt;br /&gt;September 2012: Consistently taking Viviscal.</li>
            <li>and I have noticed a major change in the manageability and texture of my hair.</li>
            <li>and I have noticed a major change in the manageability and texture of my hair.</li>
            <li>This quantity has diminished significantly over the past 5 years...</li>
            <li>Shd have known better but it was a weak moment.  </li>
            <li>I was suffering from a major embracement.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After getting pregnant with my son and him being born 16 weeks premature is when I first noticed that my hair was beginning to thin out.</li>
            <li>not sure if ill ever be able to stop taking it..maybe wispy dead hair will be in fashion one day soon :P</li>
            <li>My dr. noticed new hair growth in various spots on my head, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m as thin on top as I used to be.</li>
            <li>Although I eat a diet rich in nutrients, fruits, vegetables, and fatty acids the simple act of losing weight was causing distressing hair loss.</li>
            <li>I know I can stick with - and the only potential side effect I&#x27;ve seen - is actually a really positive one impacting my personal life.</li>
            <li>I have always had fairly fine hair, but for the past several years I feel like my hair sheds like crazyyyyy and just keeps getting thinner and thinner.</li>
            <li>(2) daily there after 1 vitamin daily just to keep the results steady.</li>
            <li>Dag, getting older sure is expensive...</li>
            <li>With this product slow and steady wins the race.  </li>
            <li>I used to have very thick hair, so I&#x27;m trying NOT to lose any more.</li>
            <li>but after using vivascal for about week my hairfall out instensified and my hair got very dry and brittle, exactly the opposite of what i heard.</li>
            <li>I had taken this last year for about 6 months to stop my fine, thin hair from falling out so fast, ran out, and didn&#x27;t repurchase.  </li>
            <li>I lost hair as part of the aging process and when I started using red yeast rice pills for high cholesterol and didn&#x27;t realize it thins hair the same as the statin drugs like Lipitor.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s hard to say exactly how much longer it is, but I can see the difference.  </li>
            <li>This is my second order; it seems to work better than any other supplement that I&#x27;ve previously used eg.</li>
            <li>so I decided to try this product based on other positive reviews.</li>
            <li>is sharks - this from their website:  &#x27;AminoMar®: The groundbreaking, clinically proven marine complex available exclusively in Viviscal supplements.</li>
            <li>but now I realize you must take at least 90 days to see some results after that you are home free with hair strength and growth.</li>
            <li>My hair feels nicer in general.</li>
            <li>So far, I have been pleasantly surprised and will continue taking Viviscal and work the cost into my budget as long as I can.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>but clearly this is must be the cause of my recent acne</li>
            <li>and I am only 23 years old</li>
            <li>Used only two months so far.  </li>
            <li>I started to increase my protein intake, use all natural shampoo and conditioner, And left a stressful job...</li>
            <li>44 yr old female</li>
            <li>It also helps with my skin, my face barely ever gets pimples anymore</li>
            <li>I alternate with this one &amp;amp; the professional grade.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t figure out why, at 38 years old, all of the sudden I was breaking out.  </li>
            <li>I use only natural oils on my hair like, jajoba, castor oil, rosemary and lavender oils.</li>
            <li>I do plan to continue use of viviscal for the near future.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything to get my lush hair back--</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only taken this product for a week but developed an itchy rash on my forearms and neck the day after I started taking it.</li>
            <li>The big thing to me is the texture being so soft.</li>
            <li>I personally have not tried them out yet, but my 24 year old says they are a winner.</li>
            <li>: It seemed like it may have helped though the results were  not obvious -- and ultimately I developed an allergic reaction to it</li>
            <li>Btw she will need to take it twice a day after meal they told me.&lt;br /&gt;Shockingly after 4-5 days only the hair loss stopped completely .</li>
            <li>My current hair color is a lot darker than my natural strawberry blond</li>
            <li>so the regrowth is easily apparent.</li>
            <li>Had to style my hair so the bare area wouldn&#x27;t show.</li>
            <li>So far after 1 month of taking tables, I notice nothing different.  </li>
            <li>I believe I can see a difference as the bare spots on my scalp are no longer so noticeable..</li>
            <li>but so far I think they are starting to halt hair breakage.</li>
            <li>I am a 27 year old female diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (known as PCOS).</li>
            <li>so on there&#x27;s barely any time for sleep and lots of time for stress.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it for two months so far.</li>
            <li>I had been using Nioxin Follicle Booster but then developed an allergic reaction to the topical product so had to give it up.  </li>
            <li>Please bring back the old version.</li>
            <li>I have as allergic reactions to shellfish in the past and should have read the label more carefully.</li>
            <li>I break out more with biotin, so considering it could have been worse, it was just a hassle.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the ingredients dont list what kind of shark.  </li>
            <li>and he&#x27;s just now beginning to have a thin spot on top.</li>
            <li>Better texture..used to be thin haired...</li>
            <li>Takes a few months, so don&#x27;t expect overnight success.</li>
            <li>okay I have been using viviscal for 1 month and my thin hair has been getting a lot thicker,</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine, thin, and damaged from coloring, straightening and simply not taking care of it as well as I needed to.</li>
            <li>This is a very subjective opinion, I am not certain of it.</li>
            <li>It improves the overall health of hair (This is a very important factor for me because who cares if your hair is long if it looks dull &amp; stringy?</li>
            <li>I am also losing less hair everyday, I am really pleased with the results I am getting.</li>
            <li>The new hair growth I have now is about 3 to 4 inches long</li>
            <li>Viviscal helped me and now I have  about 9-10 inches long new hair.</li>
            <li>I should mention that my scalp and skin are usually dry to normal.  </li>
            <li>i like the product because it is working , it work better than any other supplements i have tried in the past</li>
            <li>My hair was originally about 23 inches long, I never had trouble growing my hair out</li>
            <li>I usually wait 5-6 weeks between relaxers, but when I take 2 vitamins a day the hair grows so quickly that I need a relaxer in 3.5-4 weeks</li>
            <li>It was dry, lifeless and i became nervous my hair was thinning after seeing more than usual in the bottom of my shower and in my hairbrush!</li>
            <li>I have been steadily using biotin for the past couple years and did not see much of an improvement.</li>
            <li>I have fine thin hair from when I was young</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really give this product any reliable stars, as I couldn&#x27;t continue taking them due to the taste.</li>
            <li>My mother, who is in her 70&#x27;s wants to give it a try, but I&#x27;m worried that itmay not work for her due to age and menopause.  </li>
            <li>This really works, it regrew my hair from loss due to stress and then chemo.</li>
            <li>To bet rid of the old permed hair, I cut my hair on three different occasions to a very short bob, right at my ears and began to take Viviscal - twice a day as directed, but back then, I was purchasing it at the original price, which was quite expensive.  </li>
            <li>as for the growth rate.. I didn&#x27;t notice a huge growth spurt at first but in 5 weeks my hair grew an inch when it usually grows half that !!</li>
            <li>Needless to say, it was most definitely Viviscal since I have not added anything new to my routine in years except this.</li>
            <li>I would love to find a hair supplement that doesn&#x27;t have dangerous ingredients and really works for hair loss.</li>
            <li>Sadly, I have to shave my legs way more frequent now too.</li>
            <li>I am an African American woman in her early 30&#x27;s with bald patches.</li>
            <li>I finally grew it all out and have my natural color back.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m praying that the viviscal hasn&#x27;t suddenly lost potency and also worried that simple illnesses can reverse the gain that I&#x27;ve had with the pills so far.</li>
            <li>This product is by far the most expensive, but after reading the reviews it seemed I had to try</li>
            <li>I have to shave my legs twice as much which is annoying but still a good sign.</li>
            <li>Viviscal Extra Strength hair vitamins:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have used Viviscal Hair Vitamins 9 months or more, Very little results, unsure why I keep taking them, other than hoping to see some results for my thinning hair on the crown of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have taken this 3 months and thought my hair thickened a little at first, but now I can&#x27;t see any improvement.  </li>
            <li>I did get a little bit of cystic acne the first couple months</li>
            <li>It contains biotin which can make some people break out a little at first, stick to it for a while</li>
            <li>I think I am beginning to see new, fine hair growing in the thin batches above my temples (I am female).  </li>
            <li>I am on my second box and have not really seen much improvement but still keeping my hopes up i have very fine hair and a few thin spots at the front of my head of which i mainly need to grow</li>
            <li>Prior to me using these , my hair was breaking and thinning, mainly due to a certain medication I&#x27;m taking.</li>
            <li>My hair grows in so fine around my temples and this is the only thing that helped fill that in, plus my hair grows so slow and this definitely speeds up the process.</li>
            <li>I am not sure how much growth I have since I already have plenty of hair, but I notice that I have new growth all around the hair line.</li>
            <li>I already had some new growth because I just had a baby about a year ago, and that&#x27;s pretty common</li>
            <li>I cut my hair to a little above my shoulders to have a fresh start, so I am trying to grow it back out again.</li>
            <li>The most frustrating thing is all of the little hairs that are growing and sticking straight up and not obeying the blow dryer commands.  </li>
            <li>Although shark powder (aka cartilage as labelled by previous Viviscal packaging) seems pretty innocuous, recent studies has found that shark cartilage contains a neurotoxin called BMAA which leads to neurodegenerative disease.</li>
            <li>The only new thing added was shortly after my last physical was the Viviscal.  </li>
            <li>After dealing with major hair loss for the last 7 years due to change of life, two major surgeries and high level of stress I went to a dermatologist last year and had every blood test known to man and a scalp biopsy all inconclusive.</li>
            <li>My hair thinning is due to age and probably genetics, and this product has made me feel confident that at least I&#x27;ll keep what I have.</li>
            <li>My hair was thinning due to a vitamin deficiency, but this really helped it grow back faster and thicker.</li>
            <li>It was hideous and people were obviously looking at my bare scalp.</li>
            <li>I admit I was not careful enough before I used it</li>
            <li>is long and soft</li>
            <li>I am a 41 year old African American female.  </li>
            <li>Near the end of the month, I had a 1/4 inch trim at a long hair salon.&lt;br /&gt;October</li>
            <li>wow my hair has grown long.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about 1 1/2 inches long with some coming in my natural brown color vs my gray.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Today, I take them because due to stress, my hair is starting to thin and fall out much more than normal.</li>
            <li>I have to giggle at people who complain that their hair does not feel thicker, etc within the first few weeks.  </li>
            <li>I am almost completely out and had to order a more expensive box from another vendor to supplement me until this order of four boxes of Viviscal is finally shipped.  </li>
            <li>otherwise you may have an upset stomach (this happened a few times to me when I forgot to eat something first).</li>
            <li>My stylist asked me what I had done to my hair because it was so healthy, shiny, long and thick!</li>
            <li>My hair is Thick and Full.</li>
            <li>I thought I saw a slight reduction in hair loss after about two or three months, but wasn&#x27;t certain.  </li>
            <li>When I was younger (30ish), I was able to grow my hair past my shoulders down to about my bra-line.  </li>
            <li>Re: the eyebrows, a little better, but very little.</li>
            <li>I have extremely thin nails that become transparent when they get wet, they peel and split very easily.</li>
            <li>Not sure why, I&#x27;ve even clicked on a previous order to make sure I received the same one, but didn&#x27;t happen.  </li>
            <li>Seriously, these are worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Because I am seeing new hair growth, minimal shedding and hair getting longer</li>
            <li>was not sure it’s the right one for her</li>
            <li>but I started taking this one instead since the biotin count is so high per serving, plus has the other ingredients for hair growth; [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m considering using half the dosage to see if that reduces the breakouts because this product really did work for me</li>
            <li>My hair grows fast and sheds a lot less when I use this.  </li>
            <li>Since taking this box I really have noticed less fall out</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about a month and a half and have found a drastic change on how much my hair sheds.</li>
            <li>But definitely thicker and worth buying again to get past this grow out stage.</li>
            <li>For some reason I&#x27;ve been loosing more hair than the past these few years.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how this could be, since the ends of my hair are old hair, not new.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference after only two and a half months of use (I&#x27;m on my third package), I don&#x27;t lose less hairs</li>
            <li>(These had thinned over time due to normal aging.)  </li>
            <li>The only real downside is that you see minimal results for the first 4 months of use, so it can be hard to justify spending the money at first...but trust me...</li>
            <li>I am seeing a lot of growth in the hairline, parts were I had lost hair are now fillling in, the texture of my hair has not changed much, but I have only been using the viamins for less that three months.</li>
            <li>By now, I&#x27;ve got my long bangs back and the rest of the new hair is almost 5 inches long.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li>I have fine and thin hair.  </li>
            <li>I have fine thin hair.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend if your hair is thin or fine.</li>
            <li>hair was thin and super short from being cut to blend the extensions in with my natural hair.</li>
            <li>I noticed a little bare spot (about 1/4 cm) on my part about 3 years ago, and my hairline has definitely been much sparser in the widows peaks, and my scalp was visible thoughout if I didn&#x27;t brush my hair flat against my head.  </li>
            <li>I have bangs and they were getting very wispy, but now they are a little easier to style.  </li>
            <li>Worked a little but not as much as I thought.</li>
            <li>I cannot say that it has created new growth, but I will comment that other existing hair on my body has increased in the growth rate, as well.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair, but was starting to lose a lot of hair.  </li>
            <li>Now when I get my hair highlighted, I turn down the free blow dry, and I warm/cool blow dry it myself at the salon using my fingers or comb with the dryer at a distance, without subjecting my hair to the extremely damaging brushes used on wet hair aside from the infernal heat that salons normally set dryers to.</li>

            <li>And I must say that it is, I am very sad that after 2-3 month of vibrant hair grow the shedding starts again after I started the new formula, I continue with it since I have bought so much of it, my hair continue to drop, even those newly grew hairs are falling off!</li>
            <li>There has been a definite decrease in the amount of hair I am losing (due to various medical issues) and I am seeing new growth as well.</li>
            <li>where you want the vitamins to go towards, so if you have to shave everyday, be aware that it might make it a little worse, or make you just shave/wax more frequently in general).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of a bummer  - hard to pay so much for a product that only gives mediocre results.</li>
            <li>: you lose your hair without a new hair growing in it&#x27;s place, then it is too late for treatment of that particular</li>
            <li>It does work, I also take 1000mg MSM, use Nexxus Pro-Mend Split End Binding Overnight Creme maintaining my ends and cutting hair by the Morrocco Method Lunar chart  so seeing amazing results.</li>
            <li>and I have a bad stomach, so that is good.  </li>
            <li>There were broken pieces in huge chunks all along the hairline.  </li>

            <li> People tell me I have beautiful hair now, where as before I use to look like I had a disease..</li>
            <li> so I thought, but I&#x27;d rather wait 6 months, than 6 years for my hair to be beautiful</li>

            <li> great product.</li>

            <li> Great product, helps grows hair about two inches.</li>
            <li> It also sees to have a great effect on my skin, could be the marine life that they use in the pill.</li>

            <li> This stuff works great.  </li>

            <li> I heard great things about it .</li>
            <li> my skin looked great.  </li>
            <li> If you want to grow your hair thicker and longer this is a great product for you.</li>
            <li> so happy i bought them.</li>
            <li> However it also made my skin break out with huge cyctic acne!!!  </li>
            <li> Love it!!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> I have been in Viviscal for seven months, my hair has stopped falling out, breaking; it now has a very nice texture.</li>
            <li> (and my nails look amazing!</li>
            <li> and this stuff is truly amazing!  </li>
            <li> This product has been amazing!</li>
            <li> It was amazing!</li>
            <li> Good luck!! :)</li>
            <li> and i can honestly say it WORKS!</li>
            <li> (her hair has become thicker, but it&#x27;s not as if she became Rapunzel :p).</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery, arrived in perfect condition and fully satisfied.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even stand my own company!  </li>
            <li> i have 3 kids and cannot justify spending that kind of money on my hair!</li>
            <li> i heard all the ads and saw a lot of good reviews, i have been using propecia for years and had great results up till about 3 years ago.</li>
            <li> It is worth it!!!!</li>
            <li> I think that this is a good supplement.</li>
            <li> well actually it&#x27;s a good thing because if this grows my nose hair it should grow my head hair also</li>
            <li> Good vitamin, but takes time to see the difference.</li>
            <li> i took viviscal for 3 months and it didnt give me good results like biotin</li>
            <li> AND biotin would make my hair look beyond gorgeous.</li>
            <li> I still think they are good pills though, for a non-vegetarian who doesn&#x27;t have an issue downing fishy tasting pills.</li>
            <li> I heard good reviews about his product and decided to try it.</li>
            <li> My hair grew out nicely and looks great.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> I thought they were gone for good.  </li>
            <li> I read about this product in an article written by Dr. Leslie Baumann who said it was good for both hair and nails.</li>
            <li> like almost never) but wanted to share my experience with this product because i have just been searching and searching for a good hair growth product and thought this may have been it.  </li>
            <li> A friend told me the biotin was good for hair growth as well, so I looked and found 10,000 mcg on Amazon, and take that as a supplement as well.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Through it all my hair never stopped looking good.</li>
            <li> She followed the instructions as directed, and after 3 months you could see a good difference on her.  </li>
            <li> It had good reviews like Viviscal.  </li>
            <li> Both are a good deal.</li>
            <li> I never had bald patches or thinning isolated areas, but now I can see that the wispy hair is thickening and thats good.</li>
            <li> and I heard this was a good product.  </li>
            <li> (that&#x27;s a good roblem to have).&lt;br</li>
            <li> My beatician really loved how this product made my hair healthier.</li>
            <li> Biotin gave it a good jump start.</li>
            <li> In good shape and eat as well as I can.</li>
            <li> It is a good product.</li>
            <li> my skin did&#x27;t look as good.</li>
            <li> I am hoping for good results from my hair as well as time goes on.</li>
            <li> seems to be a good product, does not upset my stomach</li>
            <li> I saw Viviscal in an ad in a magazine, and looked online to see what the reviews of it were, and they were really good</li>
            <li> its a good product my hair has improved dramtically ..</li>
            <li> It is really good.</li>
            <li> Good.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to try everything out there with a good review, so I ordered books and researched every body part and how to maintain it.</li>
            <li> always check thyroid levels and get an anxiety medication and pour vitamins and good food and watch your hair turn around.</li>
            <li> Work relly good</li>
            <li> I waited 6 months to give it a fair review.  </li>
            <li> so this was surprising to me.</li>
            <li> It just takes a good six months  to notice any results</li>
            <li> All is good....</li>
            <li> I started using Viviscal, because of really good reviews in Internet.</li>
            <li> and it sounded good</li>
            <li> these are really good</li>
            <li> Within no time at all it became almost as good as when I was a teenager.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> it more beautiful and shiny- and for that reason alone I have ordered another batch.</li>

            <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than using this product, I&#x27;ve been exercising, eating healthy and use organic shampoo and rogaine.</li>
            <li> It may indeed help most people a great deal</li>
            <li> I started using Viviscal confident that it would do what it said and I am amazingly happy with the results.  </li>

            <li> and I have been very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased this this product.</li>
            <li> my fine curly hair is much more manageable, thicker, and shiny, a great investment for your hair skin and nails!</li>
            <li> So yesterday I compared a picture of my hair from about 4 months ago and it was a HUGE difference !!</li>
            <li> My Dermatologist recommended this for my toe nails, but I would love thicker hair!</li>
            <li> love these!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> I love this product !  </li>
            <li> and I feel like my hair is falling out so much more since I&#x27;ve started taking it!</li>
            <li> Update!&lt;br /&gt;Viviscal has lost its magic!</li>
            <li> I am so glad to have found this product!</li>
            <li> with means more waxing and shaving, ugh!</li>
            <li> I Love it!</li>
            <li> This is magic!</li>
            <li> Sure, so believeable!</li>
            <li> love being on the plan where they send it to me automatically!</li>
            <li> but I know I surely will not be buying this product again!</li>
            <li> Recommended to me by top hair colorist in NYC - there is a noticeable change after just one month!</li>
            <li> If I just get great nails and eyebrows from using this product, I would be thrilled, but to think that it will improve the appearance of my hair, as well, wow, what a wonderful find!</li>
            <li> After taking it for 2-3 months, my hair has grown more than it has in years!</li>
            <li> So glad I found out about these two products!</li>
            <li> I will continue to take these as I love the results!</li>
            <li> I just bought 60 more!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> My hair has definitely filled in!!</li>
            <li> I love the viviscal hair vitamins, but the product is exspensive!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m one of the fortunate ones for whom it works beautifully (age 69).   </li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> made my hair grow for sure!  </li>
            <li> okay problem to have!  </li>
            <li> Will have to order more, but I think it did the trick!</li>
            <li> I will reorder for sure!</li>
            <li> Also I&#x27;m a hair stylist and have most of my customers using it too !</li>
            <li> I am going to continue this for 5 more months!</li>
            <li> I would recommend it for sure!</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> After taking this product, my hair is so much more healthier and it is no longer shedding and growing again!</li>
            <li> and I love this product!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I was at my ideal weight and fairly quickly without any change to my diet</li>
            <li> and i have to pay the ship&#x27;s price which isn&#x27;t cheap at all and by this great raising</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing product and has truly changed my hair and my confidence!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Switched to these about a month ago and they are amazing.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.  </li>
            <li> But I got amazing results.</li>
            <li> I had gotten amazing results and my hair has become thicker than what it ever has been before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i havent noticed my nails getting stronger or growing faster, but the change in my hair is amazing.  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve seen amazing results yet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> it’s amazing .</li>
            <li> Its quite amazing.</li>
            <li> this is soo amazing for me...</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> A friend, who is in beauty culture field, has told me about this amazing product.  </li>
            <li> I liked this product and think it helped while I was anemic.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m  loving 😍</li>
            <li> So, works for my hair, not so nice on my skin.</li>
            <li> I am thinking my hair and nails look a good bit better.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s nice, too.</li>
            <li> with this I have really noticed a wonderful difference.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t want longer, thicker, more gorgeous hair?</li>
            <li> I am genuinely thrilled.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it is a great product -- as most everyone else says.  </li>
            <li> but I honestly thought I could notice that it was helping out.</li>
            <li> But my hair has shown growth which is really nice.</li>
            <li> My hair is quite thicker than it used to be thanks to this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> The coupon in the box was a nice surprise also.  </li>
            <li> Should I spend this kind of money?</li>
            <li> It was not the company&#x27;s fault and I emailed them and they kindly refunded me.</li>
            <li> Loving my thicker</li>
            <li> but I was greatly appreciative once they were.</li>
            <li> Just didn&#x27;t seem liked it worked for me at all</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for making this wonderful product</li>
            <li> PER MONTH.&lt;br /&gt;I DON&#x27;T WORK FOR AMAZON OR VIVISCAL, JUST AN HONEST CONSUMER,</li>
            <li> Really effective product.</li>
            <li> But I honestly don&#x27;t see any difference in my hair</li>
            <li> SO I was terrified to take these pills and honestly I had them sit in my cupboard for two months before trying.</li>
            <li> I took this for months, honestly cant say I saw any difference</li>
            <li> Just started taking this ,I liked them hope they work for me .</li>
            <li> Excellent hair product, it really works to thicken hair</li>
            <li> Intense Grow Hair Vitamins is the best on the market</li>
            <li> Honestly did not see a change in hair growth or strenght.  </li>
            <li> I have recommended them to a bunch of hair dressers for their clients and my own friends and family.</li>
            <li> There are plenty of alternative products with iron and biotin that are effective without shark powder.</li>
            <li> Hopefully in a couple more months I will have good results and can rate the product five stars...</li>
            <li> Good stuff, my hair feels better.</li>
            <li> My part is filling in nicely.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with Viviscal and plan on using it again for a much longer period of time.</li>
            <li> After about 7 months, I honestly don&#x27;t know if this supplement has made any difference.</li>
            <li> I would give it a try for 3 months and see what kind of results you get...</li>
            <li> and I honestly thought I would be bald in no time at all.</li>
            <li> I decided to tackle this on my own.</li>
            <li> I am not even kidding you when I honestly tell you this THE NIGHT I started taking Viviscal my hair loss in the shower</li>
            <li> I honestly thought that this product would not work on my hair.</li>
            <li> We both color our hair, and our roots were significantly showing!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these off and on since they were first released and still find them the best supplement to promote hair growth and to obtain a healthy head of hair.</li>
            <li> Like most vitamins, they need to be taken consistently for best results.  </li>
            <li> The product is very good if used consistently.</li>
            <li> so excited to be seeing so much healthy growth!!</li>
            <li> much longer as your hormones (which control hair growth) are depleted greatly.  ONTO the the GOOD stuff.  </li>
            <li> and they are very easy to swallow .</li>
            <li> very strong.  </li>
            <li> The product is very easily digestible and never&lt;br /&gt;hurts</li>
            <li> My nails also got got very strong and is growing faster that they ever did before.  </li>
            <li> Been using for about a week now can&#x27;t tell a difference yet, but it is very easy to take for those of you like me who dont like pills.</li>
            <li> my hair is on the way to becoming like it used to be!</li>
            <li> It seems a bit more moist than before which was ok!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 5 months and have not experience any problems, the best thing about Viviscal is that it is a  natural product.</li>
            <li> This is the most effective, it reduces hair loss, and helps grow the hair faster.  </li>
            <li> By far the best hair supplement that I have come across.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve seen best results after taking Viviscal for 3 months.</li>
            <li> The best so far for ingested aid.</li>
            <li> far, I am very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to be able to purchase this item online.  </li>
            <li> so I think I&#x27;ll still to biotin or prenatals which I think are more effective.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say I&#x27;m so glad I never have to worry about this problem again.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best.</li>
            <li> but so far I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> So far ive been really impressed</li>
            <li> I have always had very fine hair, but in quantity.  </li>
            <li> My nails have never been so strong!</li>
            <li> Great and super fast shipping!!!!</li>
            <li> good ingredient, over priced, did not get any significant thickening ...</li>
            <li> I have turned on many of my friends to this product and it works great for absolutely everyone!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled for everyone who sees great results and really wanted this to work, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> First shipment was great</li>
            <li> (I have had very fine hair all of my life, but had managed to style it and use volumizing products, so I&#x27;m used to having to spend money to maintain healthy looking hair).</li>
            <li> My hair is shiny, healthy and strong!</li>
            <li> I started using a magnesium drink every night which helped with that and is super good for you anyway.  </li>
            <li> good price and quick delivery</li>
            <li> Excellent prices and super fast shipping on this top of the line product that helps hair shedding and encourages hair growth.</li>
            <li> and I see a HUGE difference in the thickness of my hair and the texture!</li>
            <li> Yes, it is tempting - we all want that luxurious, sexy hair.</li>
            <li> ok, you can decide for youself.</li>
            <li> This stuff does work magic.  </li>
            <li> I used it for quite a while, until I discovered Hairfinity, which works better and is cheaper.</li>
            <li> Plus, I&#x27;m sure the health benefits are even better for you too.</li>
            <li> Even if this product dose work for you and you like or even love it, save you money and get prenatal.</li>
            <li> It was progressively thinning on top and I was told to try bcps to \\&quot;balance my hormones\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> My latest experiment was progesterone cream which i started 3 months ago.</li>
            <li> But I read everyone else&#x27;s to help make my decisions in most purchases I make online.</li>
            <li> Which is fantastic!</li>
            <li> the condition seems to be getting better.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> What is the deal with so many words??</li>
            <li> I think :) no biggie.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be sure if it was tied to the pills, but it did subside.</li>
            <li> more voluminous hair.  </li>
            <li> Love the results I got after just a month but not a fan of the taste of the pills or the way they make my stomach feel.</li>
            <li> I find more hair on the floor..</li>
            <li> That was my primary reason for purchasing the item!</li>
            <li> Seems like these issues are much better.</li>
            <li> I think it may have helped improve the quality of my hair as well, but I can&#x27;t be sure.  </li>
            <li> Maybe in 3 to 6 months time a better assessment or commentary of Viviscal products will be appropriate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try it for 6 months to see if more areas of my forehead have improvement.</li>
            <li> , I was certainly impressed and actually reordered for another 6 month supply.</li>
            <li> I have to give it some more time.</li>
            <li> maybe abt inch or so, mostly I&#x27;ve notice the thickness.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure that is playng a role also.</li>
            <li> I do believe my hair is healthier (and my skin a bit more oily)</li>
            <li> This product is great and really helps hair grow faster.</li>
            <li> You will notice that your hair will not fall out, you will also notice your skin texture changing for the better.  </li>
            <li> Outstanding product.</li>
            <li> Thank you.  :)</li>
            <li> I have received so many compliments on my hair.</li>
            <li> I ended up having to cut more and more of it off which devastated me.</li>
            <li> Just glad this is working.</li>
            <li> $30.00 a month is much better than that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Just biotin mostly.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> And, P.S.-my son made it safely home.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping it will get better based on reviews</li>
            <li> and they say you should use it for 6 months, with most people seeing results in two.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s making a difference on top of propecia and minoxinol.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I found that DHT blocking supplemnts, DHT blocking shampoos that also contain caffein work much better for me.</li>
            <li> give it 3 months then review it, its the best, I had many surgeries where they had to shave my head, and this was the only medication that helped regrowth</li>
            <li> And the cessation of hair loss is more than I hoped for.</li>
            <li> I love Amazon</li>
            <li> I am a hair designer always looking  for the next, best thing for hair growth.</li>
            <li> it works better and shows result faster than viviscal</li>
            <li> My hair has been looking better after a couple weeks of use...    </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s this or something else, but this sure isn&#x27;t hurting.</li>
            <li> Very impressive double blinded trial.</li>
            <li> so tat says a lot..:)</li>
            <li> I purchased this a while ago but do not use these any more.  </li>
            <li> I love Viviscal hair supplements, have used them for more than a year.</li>
            <li> and I took 2 pills most days instead of 1</li>
            <li> - my stylist has noticed and I have noticed there&#x27;s more of it.  </li>
            <li> but the fact is, it doesn&#x27;t work any better than anything else for hair.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love it and still use it.</li>
            <li> one more go &#x27;</li>
            <li> Helped keep my hair looking and feeling healthy.  </li>
            <li> More iodine than my body could handle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still weighing whether I&#x27;m going to continue for a couple more months to see if my body adjusts</li>
            <li> I hope to see more improvement.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> My hair is better and I will use these vitamins from time to time.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how much more they can grow.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the service.</li>
            <li> I love the product...</li>
            <li> I did not contact the seller and going to assume it is safe to take.</li>
            <li> Also, my hair appears healthy and stronger than ever.</li>
            <li> I noticed more nail growth than hair growth.</li>
            <li> IMPORTANT UPDATE!</li>
            <li> I have had better luck with \\&quot;other\\&quot; online sources.</li>
            <li> I wish they would offer more disclosure.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these hair vitamins.  </li>
            <li> Bottom line, I still love the product, but now I take the men&#x27;s version.</li>
            <li> ** star feedback rating more often, rather than just skip them all together</li>
            <li> Love this product have used it for a couple of years now.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for a couple years and have always been pleased.  </li>
            <li> Yes I will buy contiue to buy more of Viviscal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After about a month, it seemed like my eyelashes and eyebrows were a bit fuller, but wasn&#x27;t sure if it was my imagination/wishful thinking.  </li>
            <li> Tried for 6 months and saw MORE hair fall.</li>
            <li> I hope it works better for someone else</li>
            <li> I hope that this will give me more benefits.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t have been more pleased and I will continue to use Viviscal with the hope that improvement will continue.</li>
            <li> Also I need haircuts more often.  </li>
            <li> So hopefully I will see more improvement by the end.  </li>
            <li> I would like to see more noticeable growth on the top of my head, but I&#x27;m hopeful.</li>
            <li> While she was doing the pedicure, she noticed my nails and commented about how much better they looked.</li>
            <li> I have had problems with thinning hair at the temples and tried many things now there is the appearance of hair, hope that it lasts.</li>
            <li> and i advise you not to buy it or u be wasting money for sure</li>
            <li> I am a woman that has gone through menopause and should not have more then 8 mg of iron a day.</li>
            <li> so I could purchase it more often.</li>
            <li> I was experiencing thinning in the crown of my head, and now I see more fullness in this area.  </li>
            <li> I love it and it was cheaper online than at the drugstore, even on sale with a coupon.</li>
            <li> My hair was getting thiner on the top but not anymore.  </li>
            <li> but it sure does.</li>
            <li> Added benefits: stronger nails and better skin.  </li>
            <li> Have several friends that also had excellent results taking this product after chemo.</li>
            <li> I have been taking it for about a year and my hair has never been better.</li>
            <li> Also having to shave, wax, and cut my nails more</li>
            <li> I switched to once a day and haven&#x27;t had problems and still see results. :)</li>
            <li> I went through one pack of these and I&#x27;m not so sure they work?  </li>
            <li> I got three month&#x27;s worth and I think I gave it a fair trial.</li>
            <li> it makes your hair healthy from the inside out and it also promotes hair growth.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It takes a good 3 months or so to kick in, but it&#x27;s worth the wait.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say whether this has helped for sure, but I have been using it for three months</li>
            <li> and I truly think I see more &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; hairs growing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve re-ordered 2 more months and will keep at it.  </li>
            <li> mom reordered the product and it has been working fabulously!</li>
            <li> Have always been really pleased with everything I ever order through Amazon...</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this supplement.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed the results of using this product.</li>
            <li> I love the compliments I receive, andI love giving referrrals even more.</li>
            <li> More shaving.  </li>
            <li> I have also received many comments about how shiny my hair is.</li>
            <li> However, since I was more concerned about the thinning areas of my hair, I thought I&#x27;d try this product.</li>
            <li> There don&#x27;t seem to be many comments</li>
            <li> Quite satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Need to make sure to take it two times a day.</li>
            <li> My hair also is growing more rapidly.</li>
            <li> I will return immediately and buy from a reputable store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> will give it two more months to make it six and then</li>
            <li> and they said products are manufactured for the Portuguese market and they can verify if it&#x27;s an authentic product by emailing the product lot number and expiration date found on the bottom of the box to  viviscalcare@viviscal.com.  </li>
            <li> And she told me that she was noticing more hair on her brush and in the shower.  </li>
            <li> (Okay, I figure out how to post a picture here.  </li>
            <li> It is growing faster as well, but for me, I think the thickening factor is more noticeable than growth.</li>
            <li> I agree that it has made my skin oilier, but it is definitely doing something wonderful to my hair and nails.</li>
            <li> I love the Subscribe and Save option, as well.</li>
            <li> My mom is considering taking this, too, now that she&#x27;s seen what it&#x27;s done for my hair! :)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on Viviscal for over 2 years now, and I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> every day has done a lot to help me feel better about my hair.</li>
            <li> It definitely has more softness and body now though is still very fly away from all the breakage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hopeful that Viviscal will give me even better hair.</li>
            <li> More updates to come.  </li>
            <li> so I think I may have to buy some more.</li>
            <li> great product fast shipping</li>
            <li> that is how much I love the stuff.</li>
            <li> for better results I would say that it is working and 1 side.</li>
            <li> more to work with.</li>
            <li> I notice that my nails look better &amp; are stronger.</li>
            <li> and I decided to cut it shorter so it could look more healthy.</li>
            <li> When I take the Viviscal with in a week or so the texture of my hair is soooo much better.</li>
            <li> However, I find Biosil VegCap worked better in stronger hair and better hair texture, nail growth and smoother skin texture.  </li>
            <li> but it became much more noticeable..</li>
            <li> i love this product...</li>
            <li> but overall my hair is in excellent condition since i use this</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: 3 Months.</li>
            <li> it sure wont help anyone</li>
            <li> tried many vitamins before.</li>
            <li> And once again, I love that it&#x27;s so convenient and</li>
            <li> My hair and nails are growing faster and better.</li>
            <li> Best product...Had Chemo and my hair is growing back fuller and stronger.</li>
            <li> more so i needed something.</li>
            <li> Anyway I heard about these &amp; most people found they worked &amp; i can tell you my nails grow faster..</li>
            <li> so i cant give it more stars yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep ya posted:)</li>
            <li> Will write more as I see results.</li>
            <li> then nioxin #3 conditioner on the top of my head and TIGI moisture recovery conditioner on the ends.</li>
            <li> And Even More shinier, I Would Recommend This Product To Every One.</li>
            <li> also feel like I have more energy at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i will not order any more</li>
            <li> I love your product....</li>
            <li> I just wish it were more affordable.</li>
            <li> Before Viviscal, my hair fell out by the handful after each shampooing and more during comb out and styling.</li>
            <li> the seller thought is was appropriate to send it.</li>
            <li> It looks healthy and shiny.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The tablets seem to be helping, have to use longer to be sure.</li>
            <li> and this does work :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad my stylist recommended it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know how many stars to give this.  </li>
            <li> Love Viviscal and truly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I Love this product.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m already able to tell a difference in the amount of hair that I leave in the shower.</li>
            <li> I had to cut it off to my collarbone, and would love to have longer hair</li>
            <li> I am sure the results vary from person to person--My doctor had recommended it to me.</li>
            <li> Nails are much better.</li>
            <li> It does take a couple of months to start seeing results, but then it gets so much better.  </li>
            <li> After 3 months the growth was more dense and by the end of four months there was a lot more.  </li>
            <li> but I will reorder to see if I need more time to see results.</li>
            <li> I love this vitamin for hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was being affected by so many hear meds.</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft,looks fuller and more shiney and more bounce.</li>
            <li> Also, I notice that my hair is easier to style and holds a style better.</li>
            <li> Love it and it works.</li>
            <li> I need to give it more time</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> The instructions say to use for 6 months before seeing a change, so I still have two more months to go.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser even commented on being able to feel the difference in the hair close to my scalp, and the longer hair.</li>
            <li> Its much more thicker and looks healthy.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> but this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> :) :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to continue to take Viviscal until my hair grows about 5-6 more inches, I think it works. :)</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I took a chance on this.</li>
            <li> Need more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan, and will buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li> Or I should say don’t’ see)&lt;br /&gt;For now it looks like magic.</li>
            <li> maybe my nail grew a bit more if anything.</li>
            <li> Boltin works way better</li>
            <li> I hear that chrome-domes are more aero-dynamic.</li>
            <li> so I started using viviscal to hopefully promote more hair growth on my sides and top.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair became oilier more often, but I didn&#x27;t mind.&lt;br /&gt;August</li>
            <li> I will see how much more growth will kick in after the six month period.</li>
            <li> I will see how much more growth will kick in after the six month period.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if it had done anything for me or</li>
            <li> I still wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li> and I wanted to be sure to let others know that it could be a problem for them as well.</li>
            <li> You need to continue taking it for more than a month</li>
            <li> For anyone wanting to read more about this: Environmental neurotoxins β-N-methylamino-l-alanine (BMAA) and mercury in shark cartilage dietary supplements by Mash et al.</li>
            <li> My hair was over-processed and I noticed more hair in my brush and in the shower drain then on my head.  </li>
            <li> Still waiting on more though.</li>
            <li> I love these vitamins.</li>
            <li> anyway I didnt expect much from this because my nails and hair are already in great shape and my skin considering I dye my hair with bleach and baked in the sun in my 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The more you stress over hair the more hair will fall out.</li>
            <li> but things can get better.</li>
            <li> When I stop taking it, I feel better.</li>
            <li> it is.growing in so much better with no snapping and breaking ...</li>
            <li> I love  what this product did for me:  </li>
            <li> My hair feels softer &amp; more moisturized compared to before I started to taking the pills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This may not be an advertised side effect, but it sure is</li>
            <li> the most benefits)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> Eyelashes are fuller and look better with and without mascara, but I did not see any improvement with nails</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t feel as if more hair grew in, it did stop my hair from falling after about 3-4 weeks of using it.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think more hair grew in.  </li>
            <li> I pray you have better luck and find a product that works for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I hope it turns out better than the vitamins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I have had thinning hair for many years.</li>
            <li> maybe the Viviscal didn&#x27;t grow more hair, but prevented some of the loss?</li>
            <li> Would love if they came out with a vegetarian option.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve told so many of my girlfriends about it...</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know that there were this many Americans suffering from thinning hair or it falling out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gotten thicker with more body!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gotten thicker with more body!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess I just had a moment of hair loss desperation that eclipsed my better judgment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now taking Biotin from a reputable source.</li>
            <li> More than 3 times than before.</li>
            <li> It has promoted healthy hair and fingernails.</li>
            <li> We used all 60 tablets with no result and then the company wanted us to automatically buy more to insure fuller hair.</li>
            <li> Found one that&#x27;s cheaper &amp; works better</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty nice thing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 40&#x27;s and my hair was changing, and not for the best.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work</li>
            <li> and I was getting concerned because this had gone on for more than a year</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t see any more hair fall with the bulbs attached.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just glad there&#x27;s something on the market that will help me do that.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve read that you don&#x27;t notice too many changes until about 4-5 boxes into it.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> My hair is lustrous, shinier,  and the growth rate is phenomenal.  </li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I love the product.</li>
            <li> I rated I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I rated it three stars because I&#x27;ll need more time with it, I&#x27;ll re-address it at the end of the completed treatments.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Scalp health matters a lot more unless you&#x27;re starving yourself of nutrients.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> In February 2013 I will be able to give a better review.</li>
            <li> This product for sure made my hair grow faster and gave my hair shine.</li>
            <li> So when I finally broke up the news about this superb product he too wanted to use it on him.</li>
            <li> We will know better in a couple of months as it takes 4 to 6 months to see results.</li>
            <li> just keep at it :)</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll notice baby hairs at your hairline first, like cowlicks, they have a mind of their own!</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT DOES EXACTLY WHAT IT STATES!!!</li>
            <li> Very excited about that.</li>
            <li> I am very excited to continue taking these vitamins</li>
            <li> my hairdresser was very excited too.  </li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> The item i was told to take by the women who does my hair and so far so good !</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> So far - so good!  </li>
            <li> I have great hopes on this product as it was a recommendation from a friend who is enjoying the natural beauty of his hair growth!!  </li>
            <li> I love the vitamins and notice how much more strong and healthy my hair is since I&#x27;ve started using it.  </li>
            <li> I wish very much I could give a good review.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Biotin Vitamin H, promotes Healthy Hair and Strong Nails and it has been Proven to Help with Healthy Hair Growth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now taking Toji which has a few but perfect reviews and so far im impressed.</li>
            <li> My hair is as long as it has ever been, and my nails are great!</li>
            <li> My hair does seem to be becoming fuller, thicker and stronger, so for these reasons alone, I think I will continue giving it a go just to see what happens in a couple more months.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!!</li>
            <li> I have also noticed the new hairs that been growing around my temple which is also really great.</li>
            <li> I am happy I did because I have new hair sprouting up.  </li>
            <li> I get it trimmed and touched-up regularly every 8-9 weeks and have a good hair care regimen and good diet.</li>
            <li> will definitely buy this again, the price is good and the result is good.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, my hair feels and looks much better after two months on this product.</li>
            <li> i was supper happy when i got them for the price i got them they were too good to be true, but when i received the pills they looked completely different from the ones i purchased from ulta</li>
            <li> This is always more noticeable on those of us with silky fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have more fine hair and not a ton of it</li>
            <li> Though they didn&#x27;t help my nails, my hair became very full and in fact a bit unruly from the fullness.</li>
            <li> It is very, very good and definitely works!</li>
            <li> and my hair is shoulder length and very full &amp; thicker than before.</li>
            <li> I also had quit my birth control at the time, and wow my hair was greatly damaged by all of the stress and hormonal shedding.</li>
            <li> Incredible hair growth in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> Happy so far.</li>
            <li> I have only been taking this product for a month (along with Biotin supplements in the morning) and am noticing an incredible amount of growth.  </li>
            <li> And although I have not appreciated the cost increases of the product over this time, I am still very impressed with the results.  </li>
            <li> I am a 46 year old mom, in great health</li>
            <li> I am 40 years old and experienced ALOT of hair loss after the birth of my son 4 years ago.</li>
            <li> Just finishing up my first month on Viviscal and so far I&#x27;m impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> Thanks for making me feel good about</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s price is just too good not to give it a real</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product but costs too much.</li>
            <li> Tried all kinds of special shampoos and supplements from my doctor, nothing worked!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 50s and started noticing that my hair (which is very fine) was not as full as it was.  </li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite products for growing your hair out quickly and healthy.</li>
            <li> My hair has never grown so quickly and looked so much more healthy in one month&#x27;s time.  </li>
            <li> Her hair grew back and it hadn&#x27;t looked this good in many years!</li>
            <li> Makes hair soft and more manageable!!</li>
            <li> Other than that, great product!</li>
            <li> and it has grown 3-4 inches in the last 2-3 months which is good for me!  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;a head full of hair beyond belief !  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to remember.</li>
            <li> All you do is take two tablets a day and they are an easy to swallow size too.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to get caught up in something you see on TV.</li>
            <li> so it is easy to take.</li>
            <li> These supplements are easy to consume and they seem to work.</li>
            <li> I could easily get away with 5 weeks of dying my hair</li>
            <li> they grow faster, and my nails do not break as easily as they used to.</li>
            <li> arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> It does not alter the flavor of my shake which makes it easy to take the vitamin.</li>
            <li> I have been using Viviscal for a few years and am very happy with the hair results which are continued plentiful and healthy hair.</li>
            <li> Now I scrub my scalp strong while shampooing to provoke and test this product&#x27;s effects</li>
            <li> It was to strong for me.</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with biotin, horsetail, and folic acid to help my hair be strong and grow faster.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Thicker, lusher, strong hair after just 3 weeks of using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does not have strong smell either.</li>
            <li> It truly does help your hair grow strong and resilient.</li>
            <li> Strong hair or neurodegenerative disease?</li>
            <li> For me it was too strong and upset my stomach</li>
            <li> so it has been a major headache and has impacted my confidence greatly.</li>
            <li> , I have nothing but positive things to say about it (and also love that it&#x27;s cheaper to purchase on Amazon than Walgreens)!</li>
            <li> I also dont want to OD on the multi&#x27;s, since Nioxin also has many of the same ingrediants as my multi (which is whole food based) any opionons would be great!</li>
            <li> I have always had baby hair, but it was full and healthy.</li>
            <li> and now my hair is beautiful again after letting it fully grow back out.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s healthy and full.  </li>
            <li> I am African-American with pressed hair, that is fine.</li>
            <li> Like me, she has fine hair and said that these pills helped her have thicker hair.</li>
            <li> I am 41, with baby fine hair, shoulder length, color/highlight every 2-3 months.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my wife, who has fine hair, and she now claims to have the hair of Venus.  </li>
            <li> My hair is growing fine with this product.</li>
            <li> It is a fine</li>
            <li> I used the first month&#x27;s supply and my hair is already fuller, the sections that were sparse are filling in and my hair styles so much better because there&#x27;s more hair to work with.</li>
            <li> I also have baby fine hair that is coming in as well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the tablets for 3 months and still have fine growth coming in....</li>
            <li> I always had fine hair</li>
            <li> my stomach was fine.</li>
            <li> For the price, I&#x27;d like more extraordinary results.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed my hair getting thicker, but it is growing more quickly.  </li>
            <li> and they take my pimples quick and these acne with this pills are lagging !</li>
            <li> My hair is growing so quickly, it is healthier and as a bonus, my eyelashes are thicker and longer, too!  </li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t the amazing, beautiful, shiny, thick hair I had at 18, but it&#x27;s much, much better than it was before I started taking it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m super happy with the result thus far.</li>
            <li> Seeing as my hairdresser ordered her own box the next day, that pretty much tells you how impressed she was by my results.</li>
            <li> I was excited the first two days because my hair was nice and shiny but it went downhill after that.  </li>
            <li> MY HAIR HAS ALWAYS BEEN HEALTHY AND NOW THAT I&#x27;VE BEEN TAKING IT OVER 3 MONTHS; MY HAIR IS GROWING SUPER FAST!!!</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t seem to be as strong as my original order.  </li>
            <li> Amazon has the best price for this product hands down!</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have a huge clump of hair with it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experience the whole eyelash growth some people have been commenting about, but i have notice a huge improvement on my nails which is really nice.</li>
            <li> Update as of December 2015 - I. Have noticed a huge difference with the use of these tablets.</li>
            <li> Another area I can see a huge difference in is my lashes.</li>
            <li> but they are huge ones</li>
            <li> - my daughter said she noticed a huge difference in the texture of her hair.  </li>
            <li> hair started falling out almost two years ago, and to this day I do not have an accurate reason why.</li>
            <li> The niacin in this product caused me to break out in a huge rash all over my body.  </li>
            <li> will help HUGE amounts with the integrity of your hair.</li>
            <li> I know that it is a huge bummer, having to wait 6 months, or</li>
            <li> and the hair has grown in there and has not broken off again which I&#x27;m thrilled about.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having waaaaaaaay more success with pairing a prenatal with biotin.</li>
            <li> I did my own test and began taking this supplement after having my hair highlighted so that I could tell how much my hair was growing.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t make an iron free version of this pill.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will say that until proven by successive retests, there is still the possibility that either Great Earth or GNC were the culprit by suddenly outsourcing their product.  </li>
            <li> but I found that it broke me out with cystic acne - a rare occasion for me since most of my skin issues are hormonal and on the surface.  </li>
            <li> Take biotin 5mg daily as well, prescribed by another great derm.</li>
            <li> NOW, 6 MONTHS LATER IM HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS, ALTHOUGH IM GOING TO HAVE TO CONTINUE TO TAKE IT</li>
            <li> Shampoo and conditioner are available, but I need a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> and I have experienced hair growth on my eyebrows only.  </li>
            <li> It may be great for hair loss related to hormones or traction alopecia, but not AGA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I enjoy it coming in the mail, so I don&#x27;t have to remember to order it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s soooo smooth.</li>
            <li> up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the primary constituents of horsetail extract is thiaminase.</li>
            <li> Recommended it to a friend who experienced the same results.  </li>
            <li> I can happily say that my hair is now about two inches above my waist.  </li>
            <li> My hair has gotten stronger, shinier and smooth</li>
            <li> My brows filled in a bit.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product.  </li>
            <li> My hairline is all filled in--</li>
            <li> Currently - my hair is in the growing stage and looks great.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much that my husband is now using it, too.  </li>
            <li> Honestly don&#x27;t think will do much to regrow hair.  </li>
            <li> I tried a gluten free diet as I have heard from others it helps.</li>
            <li> I was happy with the regular brand</li>
            <li> Fantastic product</li>
            <li> One thing I know for sure is that prenatal vitamins are the much cheaper and from what i see much better way to go.</li>
            <li> Five months later, my hair has gotten 5 inches longer, so much healthier and thicker, not to mention my eyelashes look so awesome my skin, and nails too.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> so far so good</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to, because the old ones were working so good.  </li>
            <li> I took this for 3 months straight and my hair got really good and stopped falling so much, then of course i took a month off because i was traveling and forgot to order more</li>
            <li> So far so good with this product.  </li>
            <li> Viviscal works a good bit better than Biotin with regular usage.</li>
            <li> So far so good for me.</li>
            <li> but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Even though it is only a 30 day supply, it has really kept my hair looking great, and no longer falls out when I wash or brush it!</li>
            <li> As I was shopping for furniture, the sales lady stated &amp;#34;you got beautiful hair&amp;#34; had not heard those words in a long time.</li>
            <li> I follow the package instructions and so far so good.</li>
            <li> I see a lot of new hair growth and am very pleased.</li>
            <li> The reviews read that most noticed a change in there fingernails right away, so I figured that if I saw a change in my nails I would know that it was \\&quot;doing something\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering more right now.  </li>
            <li> I researched the reviews and have noticed that people who have the best success with Viviscal once had thicker fuller hair, and went thin/fine due to an event like child birth, disease, hormone-related, etc.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really works!!!</li>
            <li> I noticed an improvement after the first month!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Super fast delivery!!!</li>
            <li> I am so excited, relieved and over joy my hair loss has significantly improvement only after taking this product over a month!</li>
            <li> It has made my nails super strong</li>
            <li> During the first month, I then purchased 3 more months on the products website, as they were running a promotion for buy 2 months, get one free.</li>
            <li> What more could i say thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I see a huge difference from the stressful event from a year ago, and it never hurts to have a positive attitude and healthy diet</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference for the first 4 days, but by the fifth, I was breaking out with a huge spattering of cystic acne!</li>
            <li> Worth the money!</li>
            <li> There is a significant difference in my hair with lots of re-growth.</li>
            <li> But worth!</li>
            <li> Will be interested to see what 3 more months does.</li>
            <li> and I feel these are not the original tablets.</li>
            <li> but Im already excited.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed significant nail growth.  </li>
            <li> Okay first off, this product would receive 10 stars a year ago before they changed the product.</li>
            <li> My original review shows below.  </li>
            <li> The original Viviscal saved my hair.</li>
            <li> Taking it twice a day can be a pain, but worth it in the end!  </li>
            <li> I think after about 6 months I started to notice the length improving, and after 1 year there was definitely a significant difference - my hair was the longest it had been in 7 years.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when it did.  </li>
            <li> I originally tried Viviscal months ago and it broke me out, so I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I saw it originally on the Dr. Oz Show.  </li>
            <li> Treatment with horsetail extract may significantly increase the amount of thiaminase in your body, which may cause a vitamin B-1 deficiency.</li>
            <li> Will order more to do the whole 3 months and see what happens!  </li>
            <li> they have the original Viviscal.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m pretty sure this stuff is working, either that or its just the Rogain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to discontinue, however hair loss returns although not at as significant of intensity, thus now using their maintenance dose recommendations and the hair loss is now normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am excited to see how my hair looks at 6 months.</li>
            <li> Make sure you are aware of this if you try it.  </li>
            <li> After the first month, I felt that my hair looked alittle healthier, and better.</li>
            <li> The items are okay but be aware this product makes hair grow everywhere.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absoutely  worth a try!</li>
            <li> I returned to my original salon with reliable hair professionals.&lt;br /&gt;March</li>
            <li> Plus has other vitamins and minerals in it that are good for you too!</li>
            <li> I still use the product hoping that given more time, I will have more hair growth especially where I need it most.</li>
            <li> and while I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant growth, I feel that my hair is a bit stronger.</li>
            <li> Totally worth a try!</li>
            <li> I have been using Viviscal for more than 6 months and it really does work!  </li>
            <li> Absolutely worth the investment!</li>
            <li> The hair fall has improved significantly.</li>
            <li> My hair has gotten significantly longer and thicker.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth seeing the growth of my hair!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try viviscal .</li>
            <li> I was wondering if anyone out there has experienced dry hair after taking the pills for any length of time?</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s worth that face peach fuzz which can easily be waxed off</li>
            <li> I think this is a excellent product, I will be purchasing it in the near future, as well as recommend to my family &amp; friends.</li>
            <li> In that time I got two haircuts, just for trims to clean up split ends.</li>
            <li> Good luck to everyone going through this depressing situation and best wishes if you decide to try Visical</li>
            <li> What a pleasant surprise my hair is actually growing.</li>
            <li> but after reading some of the reviews and finding most positive, I thought I would try.  </li>
            <li> Everyone has such good results - my hair is already healthy and pretty</li>
            <li> I have been using less products to make my hair look better (volume, shine, etc), so that&#x27;s nice too!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful product, it turns ordinary into extraordinary.</li>
            <li> I went from 1/4&amp;#34; a month to 3/4&amp;#34; a month easily and saw results right away.</li>
            <li> My home is full of my hair, each time I clean</li>
            <li> and I love that my hair is super strong and vibrant.  </li>
            <li> Im also using it with a special shampoo ,you take&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>
            <li> If the price were lower, I am almost certain more people would try it, and those of use who use it, would continue.</li>
            <li> My goal was thicker and longer hair - for years, I hadn&#x27;t been able to get it to grow longer than a certain point.</li>
            <li> More vibrant and shiny!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve got nothing to loose but more hair!! :0)</li>
            <li> OK, first I have to say I have RARELY take time to write reviews of anything.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews and expected great results</li>
            <li> Used this in combination with Biotin - 10,000 mcg (10 mg) daily, noticeable difference within 3 weeks - stronger hair with bright sheen  &amp; almost no hair loss.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really say this if conditioner or shampoo have made any real difference because I&#x27;m honestly only subscribing to all 3 Vivscal products because it&#x27;s recommended that these products be used in conjunction with the oral supplements because work best when used together.</li>
            <li> the full effect will emerge after 6 months.</li>
            <li> I took Viviscal for a full month as directed and was encouraged to see a difference in the thickness of my eyelashes, feeling that soon my hair would start to show improvements.</li>
            <li> , I read review on viviscal and think this is the most promising to try.  </li>
            <li> Really worked to make my hair grow faser and get healthy again.</li>
            <li> This really works and my hair has never grown so well or been so healthy since I started taking this supplement.</li>
            <li> I figured that if it&#x27;s her business to try and look good as much as possible, she probably knows something!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t known how good it will work only been taking for 8 weeks</li>
            <li> /&gt;Delivery was fast and I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> I used to have adolescent acne but was entirely manageable, not bad and to this day use still love using my Proactiv products, skin is clear and great, so</li>
            <li> /&gt;6 months to get full results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to give it the full 90 days though.</li>
            <li> and you can tell her hair is longer and looking full.</li>
            <li> B00MMA7W5C Hair Growth Essentials: #1 Rated Hair Loss Supplement for Women and Men - Advanced Hair Regrowth Treatment With 29 Powerful Hair Growth Vitamins &amp; Nutrients for Rapid Growth -</li>
            <li> /&gt;Between the two, I was able to begin to regain the growth I&#x27;d lost and my hair was growing in much stronger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had good luck with all 3 products, although they affected my hair problem differently.</li>
            <li> I am getting ready to order some more this month.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  </li>
            <li> I have never written a review for anything before, but this truely deserves 5 stars from me.  </li>
            <li> When I was reviewing the reviews again the 2nd time i thought about it, I saw a lot of good reviews so decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> i keep forgetting to take them 2x daily, so can&#x27;t give a fair review in that respect.</li>
            <li> and my edges are in full effect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s recommended 6 full months</li>
            <li> I am dissapointed and would like to have a full refund.  </li>
            <li> I have not taken this product for a full month yet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sticking with it for a full year to see what it does.</li>
            <li> I am going to continue for the full 90 days then</li>
            <li> This product does everything it says it does, my hair never looked better, so much shine and body.</li>
            <li> 2012.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The length of my hair is now at my lower mid-back with full, even ends, about 5 inches from my waist.</li>
            <li> 2012.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The length of my hair is now at my lower mid-back with full, even ends, about 5 inches from my waist.</li>
            <li> After just a couple months of taking them, I noticed my hair was much thicker and had more body.</li>
            <li> I also have a very strict and consistant hair routine that also has been astonishing for my hair</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference until I was taking it for about 2 months, but then there was a noticeable difference in length and even better texture.</li>
            <li> When people think of thinning or balding hairlines they think of men, yet it&#x27;s just as true for women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Many thanks.</li>
            <li> I heard of this product on Dr. Oz and tried it because my hair was coming out by the hand full.  </li>
            <li> The product seemed to help produce more very fine hair growth but not enough to warrant my continued use.</li>
            <li> Also, my nails have always been strong and grow very fast.</li>
            <li> I can not speak for others but I have tried viviscal and for me it works like magic ,I have tried other things on the market but this for me is magic in a pill it has done what it said it would do and more, im hooked on this</li>
            <li> Just recently reordered a 2-month supply since I&#x27;ve experienced a positive difference.  </li>
            <li> I have no problems swallowing them, they are pretty easy with a gulp of water.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It helps that the pills are easy to swallow and don&#x27;t smell or taste funny.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It helps that the pills are easy to swallow and don&#x27;t smell or taste funny.</li>
            <li> This product might be great for other people</li>
            <li> Like others, I also experienced rapid hair growth in other locations requiring shorter interval betweens shaving/waxing.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that my eyebrows filled in first and then started seeing more hair on the sides of my &amp;#34;bangs&amp;#34; - where it had really been thinning.</li>
            <li> I could notice more health in the new growth of my hair, but i would have appreciated MORE than what I had after couple months of using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I saw results quickly.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much improvement yet, but I was worried about having an allergic reaction and so far so good.</li>
            <li> When I became inconsistent with taking them in about month 3 and 4 the effect was quickly lost.</li>
            <li> I have noticed longer hair that&#x27;s growing quickly.</li>
            <li> I have been using viviscal for years off and on, whenever I need my hair to grow quickly and it does work</li>
            <li> I believe it also contributed to my relatively quick regrowth.  </li>
            <li> My hair grows so quickly with this product and it seems thicker -</li>
            <li> I do find it makes my hair greasy quickly, which I dislike.</li>
            <li> someone sees what I wrote and knows of another pills to grow hair quick and won&#x27;t do these effect</li>
            <li> Seems to work quick delivery</li>
            <li> I regularly take Irwin Naturals hair skin and nail formula - and it has some of the ingredients as Viviscal (most notably the Biotin).  </li>
            <li> Not only is the volume of hair better, but the over-all health of my hair is better.</li>
            <li> I also was super nauseous after taking it.</li>
            <li> I did quickly notice a difference in the thickness of my hair.</li>
            <li> quick and as described</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be able to write a better review prior to February</li>
            <li> Most definitely recommend :)</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to those who are patient and can safely take it.</li>
            <li> The last time my hair was this healthy was 20 years ago with my first pregnancy!!!  </li>
            <li> chips!!&lt;br /&gt;I now have BEAUTIFUL new growth all across my temples and the entire hairline.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist when I expressed concern that I was losing more hair than normal.  </li>
            <li> Try other products this one is the best so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually not one to leave rave reviews, but this product is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> people experienced cystic breakouts - i had never even heard of that before and when i checked out pictures online, sure enough that was what i was seeing on my back!  </li>
            <li> The result is simply brilliant and almost unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it had good reviews I justo have long hair</li>
            <li> to me having a full head of hair is worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have superfine hair that breaks easily to begin with, so when I started to lose more of it due to a thyroid condition I tried Viviscal after reading so many positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> 36 years old with very fine, thinning hair.</li>
            <li> I have even seen new hair growth at my temples where it was most noticeable.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t notice more (read new) hair growing during the 6-8 months I took this.</li>
            <li> After that time, I wasn&#x27;t sure I noticed any new hair growth, so I stopped.  </li>
            <li> Without my even telling my long-time hairdresser that I had started using Viviscal, she commented on how she could see so much more new growth when I get my hair colored.  </li>
            <li> I had previously bought Viviscal and it worked great.</li>
            <li> My hair is slightly thinning in the crown, but I&#x27;m still extremely happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I realized that the first 2 boxes I bought were the old stock, it was effective and works like a miracle</li>
            <li> Surprisingly I have also noticed my extremely dry skin disappear on my face.  </li>
            <li> I first saw ads for Viviscal about a year before I bought it, but I didn&#x27;t think there were good enough reviews at the time.  </li>
            <li> All in all, I am very satisfied and will continue taking the vitamins for a few more months until I achieve the desired hair length.</li>
            <li> The pills are easily digestible and the two pills per day is reasonable.</li>
            <li> I got lucky and found this extremely useful hair nutrient solution.</li>
            <li> THANKS!!</li>
            <li> Of all the product I tryed in the past, this is the best for my hair after about two months of use I am seeing hair grow back in the top of my head.</li>
            <li> I really want it to work!!</li>
            <li> is my first review writing!</li>
            <li> These tablets are pretty pricey but it works!  </li>
            <li> I do feel like my hair gets oiler quicker (but that could also be the hot summer weather too!).  </li>
            <li> Just be aware!</li>
            <li> this is NOTHING like i have ever experienced before and have never been so disappointed after purchasing a product with so many good reviews.  </li>
            <li> It really works!!</li>
            <li> my hair feels so much thicker now!!  </li>
            <li> and I really hope to see an improvement!!</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I first heard about viviscal.  </li>
            <li> Thanks again!!</li>
            <li> My hair came back better than ever!</li>
            <li> but hey, there&#x27;s a lot of damage to fix, and while its no where near my gorgeous hair of yesteryear, I can live with it now.</li>
            <li> Also a mild headache for a whole day and got light headed a couple of times too.</li>
            <li> I was determined to give the product 6 months, as I read somewhere ( most likely on their own website, although I can&#x27;t find what I read any more) that it took that long to start seeing results.</li>
            <li> They stop doing certain activities that they may enjoy because it can add to their hair loss or thinning hair.</li>
            <li> and I have experienced a little growth in areas where the hair stopped growing completely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started growing a few silky hairs on my elbows, lol, so</li>
            <li> I definitely saw some amazing growth while using this...</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for a few months and have been happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m doing a lot of things to get myself healthier, but I think the viviscal really played an important roll.</li>
            <li> My hair seems thicker as well, and nails are amazing especially since I removed acrylic tips when I began the Viviscal.</li>
            <li> By the end of one month the texture of my hair had improved, by the end of 2 months, you could really start seeing genuine growth at the hairline.  </li>
            <li> I use Reservage Keratin booster vitamins because it&#x27;s the cheap version of the product Kyle Richards from Real Housewives of OC uses (can&#x27;t afford the one she uses which are Nourage).  </li>
            <li> But honestly nothing was able to bring me back my old hair.&lt;br /&gt;Finally</li>
            <li> so I could start fresh.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 4 months and am satisfied with the results so far.</li>
            <li> This is worth the price for me.</li>
            <li> I heard about Viviscal through a third party endorsement - an article by a popular model listing products she likes, so that recommendation seemed worth taking.</li>
            <li> but I do believe its worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very hopeful when I read all of the great reviews here, but I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months now, and I see absolutely no change to my hair whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> Really worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month, and I can&#x27;t really tell if it&#x27;s the Viviscal or the amazing natural products I have been using in my hair.</li>
            <li> I gave the rest of my 6 month supply to my lovely 76 year old mother, who is trying to thicken her hair and gain some weight.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t worth it, to me.</li>
            <li> It is pricey, but worth it if you are in dire need like I am...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly this isn&#x27;t worth your money-but if you are exploring alternative hair growth options, and have some money to blow-you might want to give this a shot.</li>
            <li> $100.00 ((wasn&#x27;t worth it at all).  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li> I was getting it directly from Viviscal and paid more for it from them.</li>
            <li> Changed to a different kind, and with days my hair was falling out by the handfuls.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have not really given this a good trial yet but will.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied so far and will review after 60 days.    </li>
            <li> Hope this continues as worth every penny if it does.</li>
            <li> I use this product along with a natural shampoo with biotin and a potent herbal blend and the results are amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worth the money to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been coloring, as well, so since I&#x27;m really rough on my hair, I&#x27;m glad that these pills are doing wonders to keep my hair healthy.  </li>
            <li> id say its definitely worth around $40 a month.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Def it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Worth the $$ because it works.</li>
            <li> Being a woman one of the most sensitive things to talk about is weakened hair.</li>
            <li> but for me worth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll decide then if it&#x27;s worth $30 a month (for the rest of my life, I&#x27;m guessing)</li>
            <li> It is a bit pricey, but so worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I rarely use a hairbrush now.</li>
            <li> I rarely use a hairbrush now.</li>
            <li> it is worth it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Product is okay so far after about 2 months.</li>
            <li> It may work for some, but is it worth the cost?</li>
            <li> Well worth it because it truly has improved the health of my hair.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price to me</li>
            <li> My edges are growing back in nicely.</li>
            <li> they all love it and how it completely transforms your hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is appropriate for any age group between 20-80 years old.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricy but its worth it.</li>
            <li> It does cost more to go directly from the source but</li>
            <li> I took it for a week and then decided the breakout and oil wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> I think it is worth the $40 risk.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is the price since it is kind of pricey.</li>
            <li> I am almost through my second month of taking Viviscal, and I can honestly say that I have seen very positive results.  </li>
            <li> even more so that it all works together safely and didn&#x27;t counteract my other medications.</li>
            <li> Maybe overall time I&#x27;ll see a more significant difference.</li>
            <li> hair always and still does grow quickly, but has been thinning since my first pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I once again have \\&quot;good hair days\\&quot; at lot, and I like my hair for the first time in a long time!!</li>
            <li> I am very healthy conscious and mostly used organic products and minimal chemical product and rarely perm, blow or color my hair after the hair loss issue started for 4 years.</li>
            <li> To never ever have experienced something like this before, it is incredibility disheartening that a product can produce such a side effect on someone who does not normally breakout and do not consider myself to have sensitive skin (some find Proactiv incredibly sensitive to them and it has worked great for me).  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that the original volume has been restored but my hair looks much healthier.  </li>
            <li> Good product and does not repeat on me like other supliments have.</li>
            <li> Unless you know someone personally that had good luck with this exact product I highly suggest trying for hair nutrients elsewhere!</li>
            <li> now they&#x27;ve grown out and my hair feels so much healthier :) highly recommend.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right</li>
            <li> Hair stylist commented on it right away.</li>
            <li> Whatever I am doing I am doing it right now.  </li>
            <li> Unless I styled it just right, there were almost bald-looking areas that showed.  </li>
            <li> My hair never grew in right after having chemo.</li>
            <li> My right kidney area seems to hurt often, but I have no way of knowing that this is causing</li>
            <li> in the midst of using this product right about now, so, no verdict is in just yet.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s too soon right now.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t notice it right away</li>
            <li> stopped hair loss and new hair growth is strong and shiny...</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t notice a lot of new hair and my hair is still fine, but it&#x27;s worth using.  </li>
            <li> My scalp was showing easily but with the new growth it is starting to look more full, The regrowth is about 3/4 inch</li>
            <li> you can EASILY see my scalp on the whole top of my head and above my ears.  </li>
            <li> I have been taking the not pleasant tasting huge tablets of Great Earth for two decades or so, maybe even longer.  </li>
            <li> (I love having a bit more hair around my scalp), but should cost less for that.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Viviscal Extra Strength Hair Nutrient Tablets through Amazon and was extremely pleased with how quickly I received the product...  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend doing both to achieve healthy and vibrant hair.</li>
            <li> Not sure about all these great reviews.</li>
            <li> I was taking the Great Earth NSP program, GNC Women&#x27;s Hair Skin and Nails formula, and now for this past year Viviscal.  </li>
            <li> Although I have not noticed a huge difference in my hair, it does appear to be growing faster than normal.  </li>
            <li> I had completely damaged my hair from over processing, and it was becoming thinner, and my hair line started to recede.</li>
            <li> I may very well end up doing the full six months</li>
            <li> Within the first 2 weeks I could see significant improvement in how much hair I was loosing in the shower and my hair brush.  </li>
            <li> This is my second order for this product, and I must say I have absolutely fallen in love!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference.&lt;br /&gt;Its not a bad product, I just won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> I would NEVER have believed my hair could grow so long if I had not witnessed the results with my own eyes.  </li>
            <li> Nothing will make your hair grow super fast and thicken up unless you take the right vitamins, eat well, exercise, and try try to leave your hair alone with alot of blow drying and curling irons, and dont wash it every day.</li>
            <li> The only warning I have is that for me (I have very fine hair)</li>
            <li> I am still in my first month of using this product,  am looking forward to positive results!</li>
            <li> My hair was fine before, but was becoming a bit dry from lightening it some.  </li>
            <li> This product costs a lot of money per package and you do have to purchase many (a couple of months worth) to actually see results.</li>
            <li> It does not grow super fast.  </li>
            <li> I took Viviscal extra strength for about ten days and experienced severe headaches</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s only been taking if for about 5 weeks now and isn&#x27;t always great at remembering to take the second pill, but already I am seeing a difference.  </li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s not Victoria Secret model hair, it&#x27;s just really great to be free of the worry and anxiety.</li>
            <li> So far, I feel like it really helped my hair grow and stay healthy.</li>
            <li> wish it would repair hair better on top of my head, still space and missing hair,</li>
            <li> The fact that it&#x27;s natural and safe really got me hooked at the start.  </li>
            <li> It grew out at the standard length of a 1/2 inch monthly but it really thickened up nicely.  </li>
            <li> I used to shed great amounts daily, now I only lose 1/2-1/3 of what I used to shed.</li>
            <li> I just ordered my second month&#x27;s worth and hoping i will see even greater results with continued use.</li>
            <li> I used to have acne, but when I became a vegetarian my complexion became very clear and smooth.</li>
            <li> After your body goes through significant weight loss, it is normal to experience hair loss as your body is in a state of malnutrition.</li>
            <li> it looks good - is thick but very fine and naturally curly.  </li>
            <li> And it was very amenable to styling.</li>
            <li> very fast.  </li>
            <li> VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED SELLER !</li>
            <li> when auto-ordered on Amazon &amp; shipping is very fast.</li>
            <li> I had noticeable breakage around my edges which has plagued me for years due to braiding and chemical treatments but now even after years of trying many remedies my patches have filled in</li>
            <li> It is also in great shape (but I rarely ever blow dry or curl it and try to only wash once a week).</li>
            <li> Added bonus, my nails have become very strong and long which I have never had in my life</li>
            <li> After becoming a vegetarian three years ago I suffered major hair loss-losing about 3 inches of hair because of a protein deficiency.</li>
            <li> It made huge difference in my hair texture and strength..am not losing hair as much as i did before which ws my main concern...</li>
            <li> It is hard to believe it works so great</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> , this is the real deal baby!</li>
            <li> Please be safe when taking anything and following the directions</li>
            <li> I read all the great reviews even the reviews where ppl complained about it causing acne</li>
            <li> I love it, my hair is definitely growing much faster!</li>
            <li> benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product for the first time a month ago.</li>
            <li> Overall I have healthy hair.</li>
            <li> I asked my sister to gauge my hair length as compared to when I first started six months ago</li>
            <li> My hairline is still filling out more and oddly enough</li>
            <li> This stuff REALLY works!</li>
            <li> I am willing to keep trying, though, as I understand it can take 6 months to work.</li>
            <li> I started incorporating fish and more healthy fats back into my diet to try and reverse the hair loss, but my hair would never get back to what it was.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Viviscal to anyone struggling to grow their hair!!</li>
            <li> I brought this product the first time, and I feel it works.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Two, be aware if you take Viviscal in conjunction with a biotin supplement, it may cause cystic acne.  </li>
            <li> That said, I&#x27;m a total believer, and now that my bald spots have cleared up, I continue to take the Viviscal because my hair and hairline have never looked better.</li>
            <li> So even more stress but granted, this was sheer</li>
            <li> I will post a review at the top of the year and give my final opinion.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommend it and it really works!</li>
            <li> My hair has really started to fill in!</li>
            <li> Btw, I don&#x27;t get paid to write this review, as I was so encouraged by the review written by other that give me the confident to try, I now in turn hope to help others!</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work!</li>
            <li> While I know that it may be my thyroid disease at fault here, I also started getting cystic acne for the first time in my life</li>
            <li> just so you guys know, this is my first ever review on any kinds of product</li>
            <li> Just to track the growth, I colored my hair the first day of taking Viviscal to see the difference.  </li>
            <li> This happens to be the first time trying this product.  </li>
            <li> I highly highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I started taking Viviscal about a month ago, so I&#x27;m just finishing up my first box.  </li>
            <li> I may be willing to try another 30 days.</li>
            <li> I doubled my last order to make sure I don&#x27;t miss a day of my Viviscal.</li>
            <li> I first realized it and compared the boxes side by side.</li>
            <li> went for my anual physical, albeit a couple of months more than I should have gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Looking forward to more growth as I&#x27;m now on my second month!</li>
            <li> But this is the first time that the tablets appeared &amp;#34;old&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> It was gradual at first, but began to pick up speed.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and delivered on time.</li>
            <li> I am almost finished with my first pack</li>
            <li> I see absolutely no change or improvement of any kind.</li>
            <li> First, I must say I have a friend who recommended this to me since it has helped her</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that my hair seems like it has more split ends when it grows with this stuff</li>
            <li> I figured Viviscal must be worth a try, and after having a baby and losing handfuls of hair for almost 2 years straight I&#x27;d try anything.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny that the thickness didn&#x27;t stay.</li>
            <li> I love the added benefit of having my eyebrows grow thicker because they are usually very fine and hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have been using these supplements for the past 4 months and my hair is definitely more healthy.</li>
            <li> I am sure that it affects everyone different</li>
            <li> I first heard about it on one of Dr. Oz&#x27;s shows.</li>
            <li> I tried many things over the last 3-4 years but nothing seem to make a difference.</li>
            <li> I am over 50 and my hair is thinning especially on the top.  </li>
            <li> This one is advertised as &amp;#34;extra strength&amp;#34; but the &amp;#34;men&#x27;s&amp;#34; version has more of the supposed key ingredient.  </li>
            <li> It is really work!</li>
            <li> Then I ordered more and noticed the packaging was different.  </li>
            <li> I hope that all women that have gone through menopause be carefull and check with your doctor first.</li>
            <li> but I keep taking it just in case ;-)  </li>
            <li> ive finished my first pack</li>
            <li> I love it either way and have actually received comments on my hair a lot!</li>
            <li> but i decided to stop 1 min to say that it really works!</li>
            <li> I first learned about Viviscal tablets from a model on a photo shoot.  </li>
            <li> It really works!  </li>
            <li> It is growing everywhere except in the top back part of my head.  </li>
            <li> I first learned of this product on Dr. Oz&#x27;s show and wanted to give this product a try...  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my first pack and about 3 1/2 weeks in.</li>
            <li> I am strict about taking 2 pills a day, no specific time, but I make sure I take 2 a day.</li>
            <li> My hair wasn&#x27;t coming back, but it was maintaining which was better than nothing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> It performs exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I am pleased to report that the thinning areas of my hair are starting to fill in.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any improvement in the first three weeks</li>
            <li> This product really works!  </li>
            <li> mother first tried Viviscal about a year ago.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after the first month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;HOWEVER, when I first started using it</li>
            <li> My first instinct was to suspect the Viviscal</li>
            <li> I am naturally thin and have NEVER had an issue with staying at my ideal weight or taking off a couple of pounds when needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an Asian woman in my 40&#x27;s with hair that is thinning on top.</li>
            <li> I used to color my highlights every 12 weeks and most recently had to do it after 8 weeks because of the increased rate of hair growth.</li>
            <li> I started taking this product 3 months ago, the first thing I noticed was how oily my hair became, and that was within the first 24 hours of taking the supplement.</li>
            <li> I have blonde hair and put highlights in it which dries it out, and this kept it healthy.</li>
            <li> So, I finally decided to just try one more product.</li>
            <li> About 3 months ago, I bought the first box of Viviscal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What I ordered was exactly as shown.</li>
            <li> i just finished my first month on this</li>
            <li> Biotin is no wonder pill, but it works pretty well when you&#x27;re good about taking it everyday.</li>
            <li> I started taking it because I cut 5 inches off of my hair that I want back more than anticipated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with it for the three month period that they suggest and hope that I don&#x27;t go bald first.  </li>
            <li> I tried this product, for the this first month I was discouraged.</li>
            <li> I wish I had tried this product first.</li>
            <li> Really works !</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> - I emailed the company and they said that can happen the first couple months until your body gets use to it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not even two weeks later her hair was looking fuller and better than it ever has.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely recommend that you try these, but look at the seller first.</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money at first</li>
            <li> After my next set of tablets I should be sure, hair seems to be stronger than before the viviscal.</li>
            <li> I tried many different things to help my hair stop falling out, but it continued to shed</li>
            <li> I really believe this product has made a difference in my hair!  </li>
            <li> It takes time, I had baby hair at first</li>
            <li> did notice they made my stomach a bit bloated the first day</li>
            <li> &quot; my first month, now getting about 2-2.5\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Then, after about 1-1/2 months of taking the vitamins, my hair growth really increased!</li>
            <li> It is so much thicker and fuller!</li>
            <li> Still looking and doing my homework on growing back healthy hair</li>
            <li> But it does really give the hair you&#x27;ve got all it needs to prosper!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my first box.  </li>
            <li> This really does work!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It seems that I grew more hair on my upper lip than I did on my scalp!</li>
            <li> I have more hair than I know what to do with in only 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about it.:-)</li>
            <li> (I love myself blonde, since that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve always been).</li>
            <li> and I cannot tell you how fast my hair has regained strength!</li>
            <li> Funny thing is I never took Viviscal for hair growth</li>
            <li> This is the first time I write a review</li>
            <li> Ran out of Biotin, but taking Viviscal consistently.</li>
            <li> Ran out of Biotin, but taking Viviscal consistently.</li>
            <li> The product does say use for 6 months, this is the first month my hair is growing but the areas where I&#x27;m thinning or balding has shown no improvements.</li>
            <li> Absolutely works!</li>
            <li> I JUST started taking those tablets and already 5 days later my hair feels fluffier and got more shine.</li>
            <li> The first effect I noticed in the first 3 months of use was in my nails.  </li>
            <li> I just started the product last week and noticed within hour of using product my hair just looked shinier and had a better texture.</li>
            <li> After the first box of 60 tablets, I noticed nothing.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t willing to suffer any longer.</li>
            <li> So, if you think that you are getting more of any thing in the extra strength, think again.</li>
            <li> I do want to mention that when I first started using the pills, they did not have any after taste.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone that either experienced hair damages, shedding, thinning or slow hair growth.</li>
            <li> Well 3 months later off Viviscal and on Biotin alone, it seems like I have lost more hair again -</li>
            <li> My hair was exactly as it was before I started.  </li>
            <li> It had grown like a weed and was so much thicker!</li>
            <li> This product did nothing but make my bowels more regular.</li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t think anything of it because I am a graduate student and prone to headaches.</li>
            <li> It helps with hair growth, the fullness of your hair, and it&#x27;s consistent,</li>
            <li> As a first hear teacher those in the industry know that in between planning lessons, grading, teaching, meetings, ongoing trainings, school events and</li>
            <li> It really Works!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The purple/white package is made in Ireland and has a lot more ingredients (niacin, biotin, etc.) than the purple/light blue package does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a lot more fuzzies and baby hairs starting to grow.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, will order again!</li>
            <li> I just finished my first month</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after reading MANY reviews, as I have tried countless \\&quot;hair and skin\\</li>
            <li> twenty first birthday gift</li>
            <li> did break out with one or two pimples the first week</li>
            <li> so I thought the extra strength would be better.  </li>
            <li> Just finished my first box</li>
            <li> This is going to be my first review</li>
            <li> Give these at least 6 months for really great results</li>
            <li> Since I am no longer a sweet young thing - I cannot attest to my hair growing super fast as some have reported.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given this product 3 stars because I still have not seen any results as far as more new hairs growing on my head.</li>
            <li> I have had more hair loss with the new formula than with the old.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a new high school teacher and the start of this year hasn&#x27;t been easy for me.</li>
            <li> one good thing I can say about this, was that it did help my eyelashes VERY slightly.</li>
            <li> I read lots of reviews on this product before I ordered them and they were all pretty positive</li>
            <li> Thse are a fairly large size, similar to the size of most multivitamin capsules.</li>
            <li> You have to take it with other vitamins though and nothing is overnight amazing</li>
            <li> The hair along my temples had filled in a little more (I lost a lot of hair in that area after child birth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other products before and they were not as effective as this one.</li>
            <li> Just hope it is as effective as the other formulation.</li>
            <li> I have been taking these supplements for nearly a year and have seen significant thickness to my hair.</li>
            <li> Slowly but surely :-)</li>
            <li> I do attribute part of this result to a recent change in diet and eating better and much healthier foods.</li>
            <li> I have to admit it is nice to finally see results without dealing with heartburn or upset stomach as an unexpected &amp;#34;bonus&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Helped to strengthen my hair big time, getting ready to order more .</li>
            <li> Its kind of weird to be honest.  </li>
            <li> However, this product so increased the speed of growth that I see my young full head of hair again after the first box.</li>
            <li> The old was better so if you can find the old one, buy it.  </li>
            <li> thanks this is my second box hoping  for more hair</li>
            <li> I am wondering if I might not have had even better results if I had started when my hair first started thinning and my hair follicles were not dormant for so long.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to help my thinning hair grow in better, this should take at least two more months before I see that happen.</li>
            <li> Received right away and Viviscal really works fast.  </li>
            <li> I started taking this product over a year ago due to some damage from being a frequent &amp;#34;hi-lighter.&amp;#34;  I experienced a lot of new growth,</li>
            <li> I started taking Viviscal to grow my hair longer and hope for a positive effect on my nails as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although I have not been using this product for the recommended 6 months yet, it does seem to be having a positive effect on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost 2 months and am still waiting to see some positive results.</li>
            <li> I purchased a two month supply and plan to continue using it as there is so much positive feedback, and I did research before investing.  </li>
            <li> I am just about finished with the box, and I did not have any positive results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give the benefit of doubt to those who say they&#x27;ve had all the positive changes to their hair, but it didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> I have been taking this product for 2 months and noticed positive results immediately.  </li>
            <li> It takes awhile of continued use, but I believe there has been a positive change in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Hope it continues to be positive.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> rather it had some positive effect on my hair.</li>
            <li> a positive one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to take for another two months and will update my review</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notices  ANY positive result from the vitamins after 60 days.</li>
            <li> Any growth in my situation is positive.</li>
            <li> I decided to give viviscal a try after reading its mostly positive reviews on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I generally have blemish free skin.  </li>
            <li> One  the first things I noticed is that my skin and scalp  became very oily when I started using this product.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with the original and was buying a box consistently for 2.5 years from the only local store that carries it.</li>
            <li> I remain confident Viviscal will make a difference for me in the long run.</li>
            <li> As for hair growth, since I have grey hairs that I color over, I can confidently say that my hair grows about an inch a month.</li>
            <li> It was cute and sassy but I still missed my long hair.</li>
            <li> my hair is also growing pretty fast.  </li>
            <li> This product is the first one I ever heard of that really make your hair grow.</li>
            <li> The produce came pretty fast in the mail</li>
            <li> It did take a full 3 days after stopping this supplement for the headache to completely subside....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been taking good care if my hair for awhile, and although it was soft and healthy, it was still thin.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a good product to use if you have fine hair, but it&#x27;s not going to totally change from super fine to mega thick.</li>
            <li> So I was looking at my pictures of when I was pregnant with my son and shortly after then noticed that my hair was so beautiful, long thick, shinny and healthy.</li>
            <li> I took this pill for 60 days and it kind of slowed down the hair loss process for awhile.</li>
            <li> Quickly - I noticed thicker, less shedding and more manageable hair.</li>
            <li> Love the product and highly recommend - especially since</li>
            <li> suspected one of the suplements that I am taking saying that suplements are not regulated by the FDA and that many are made outside of the U.S., mostly in China, where other ingredients are added for one reason or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That is enough to keep me going for another couple months, since I want to give it the full 6 months to work like the box says!</li>
            <li> Wow, I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s working so quickly for him, and that&#x27;s with inconsistent use.  </li>
            <li> The product is in an easy to use tablet form, and can be incorporated into your daily supplement regimen.</li>
            <li> It becomes less effective after the 1st month.</li>
            <li> , my hair is only growing at its normal rate (yes i am sure because i have been literally measuring my growth with a tape measure).</li>
            <li> After just one week of usage I could easily feel the different.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, supple, and pretty much gorgeous ..</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 6 weeks  which isn&#x27;t long enough to fairly evaluate.</li>
            <li> I can say that while there&#x27;s been no dramatic thickening of the hair yet, fall out does appear to be slowing.  </li>
            <li> I have been taking Viviscal for just about a month now, so not long enough to be certain of the results, but I am seeing new hair growth along the hairline and baby fine hairs, but it is more than I had before.  </li>
            <li> It did not look any shinier and it certainly did not look any fuller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would never order it again and have certainly spread the word about it</li>
            <li> The drain would have a large pile of hair in it every time I took a shower, it was going on for months.</li>
            <li> So I am certain that Viviscal helped my hair growth.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t thinning, it wasn&#x27;t falling out in large amounts every time I&#x27;d take a shower or wash my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was then that I noticed the change in texture and again the large amounts of hair I was losing in the shower.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the first month I noticed my hair was starting to get really shiny and smooth.  </li>
            <li> :)  A few tips: one, I started taking a stand-alone iron supplement and generally felt better.  </li>
            <li> WASTE OF MONEY that I stock up so many boxes of junks!</li>
            <li> Less breakage also, I do want to add I&#x27;ve been fresh juicing and eatting healthy foods and taking multivitamins an herbs</li>
            <li> It typically doesn&#x27;t grow very fast at all, and is super fine.</li>
            <li> I have had every test done and all of my labs come back fine..</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fine, but viviscal helped the hair grow back</li>
            <li> Now, after two months, they are definitely getting more lush!</li>
            <li> I could actually tell that my hair was growing significantly, and the appearance was much thicker as well!</li>
            <li> Also, the fine hairs around my hairline are a bit thicker and facial hair grows faster too.</li>
            <li> The fine hairs around my face that used to break off and give the appearance of thinning hair seem to be gaining strength and body daily.  </li>
            <li> and it has actually help my fine, thinning hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s growing back just as quickly as the hair on the right temple.</li>
            <li> It does however make the hair you have grow long super quick, and your nails too.</li>
            <li> Good price, for hard to find item.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to those who are patient and can safely take it.inch trim at a long hair salon.&lt;br /&gt;October</li>
            <li> and I need to use it another several months before I can make an accurate evaluation.</li>
            <li> I wasted so much money before I found these amazing pills.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lol I recently got my hair chopped off because it had a ton of dead ends-</li>
            <li> I can definitely tell a huge difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> I noticed a huge difference the very next day.</li>
            <li> but about a month later I can already see a huge difference.</li>
            <li> and I really saw no difference.</li>
            <li> because when something does not work as expected I should be able to get it returned.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like the idea of taking vitamins</li>
            <li> I was losing hair by clump and shedding so much.</li>
            <li> Well I purchased a 1 month supply and within my 3rd week my bald spots on my edges were filled in it</li>
            <li> I have not noticed much hair growth yet</li>
            <li> So, I really didn&#x27;t think the Viviscal would work.  </li>
            <li> It is really too soon to determine if the product is doing what it has claimed to do</li>
            <li> This product works very well.</li>
            <li> Hair really grows faster.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> Got product fast.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much difference.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for three months now and haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference in terms of growth.</li>
            <li> My hair is growing really fast</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have nearly as much falling out.  </li>
            <li> However I will state this much at this point, my hair does not fall out as much, but I can&#x27;t say I have a lot of knew growth.</li>
            <li> It works very well</li>
            <li> and I can really tell my hair has been growing faster...</li>
            <li> This stuff really does work.</li>
            <li> However, it didn’t seem to really stop the loss or hair.</li>
            <li> Too much biotin may cause cystic acne, and once I flushed some excess biotin from my vitamin regimen, the cystic acne cleared up.  </li>
            <li> Took 2 of these for five straight months and noticed NO DIFFERENCE whatsoever.</li>
            <li> My hair is so much thicker.</li>
            <li> of biotin/day), but didn&#x27;t hold out much hope.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s all much thicker, to boot.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product twice now, I really can not tell if its working.</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t take too much, stop when your hair stop</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am in my early forties and I am awaiting thyroid test results but heard of this product&#x27;s success so wanted to try it in the meantime.</li>
            <li> Still, I&#x27;m committed to 6 months and very hopeful.</li>
            <li> AND my hair is much stronger.  </li>
            <li> I tried this supplement for 3-4 months straight</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see hair growth as fast as I used to</li>
            <li> since I have very short hair mine filled in within 3-4 months.</li>
            <li> They had the whole salon looking at my head and everyone wanted to know what I was using.</li>
            <li> The woman that cuts my hair noticed hair growth and not as much hair falling out.  </li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> I really.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Laser comb, Rogaine, Latisse (when it comes out), and a hair transplant are much safer ways of dealing with hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast forward four months.</li>
            <li> Nails grew, not so much hair.</li>
            <li> It really works</li>
            <li> no results so far,other than my nails growing fast.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if there has been much growth in my hair.</li>
            <li> I am VERY acne prone and have not had this happen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 56 and my hair was really thinning, but honestly except for the gray my hair is about the same now as later 30s.  </li>
            <li> I really notice a difference with my hair and nails.</li>
            <li> and I am not loosing too much hair</li>
            <li> and I dont see much of any difference in length.</li>
            <li> You really have to be patience with this products.  </li>
            <li> My hair is now fuller and thicker thanks to Viviscal.</li>
            <li> My hair is noticeably thicker and looks so much healthier.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s just a matter of how much growth I see.</li>
            <li> Straight up diarrhea for 2 days.</li>
            <li> Has really hep my hair</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s has gotten really thicker</li>

            <li> It is absolutely working.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much stronger and thicker.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Viviscal.</li>
            <li> This was too much iron</li>
            <li> hair loss really bothered me.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ve never suffered from acne my whole life</li>
            <li> The box package hasn&#x27;t changed since I started taking it but the pills&#x27; package comes in straight lines or diagonally.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to and really hoped this product would work for me.  </li>
            <li> I started see some whiteheads on my jawline and my checks, didn&#x27;t think too much of it - was in the sun and wearing sunscreen and thought it was the sweat.  </li>
            <li> Its summertime and with how my back looks currently, it&#x27;ll be WEEKS before i&#x27;ll be able to show my back, wear a tank top or a bathing suit.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 1.5 months and my hair feels so much healthier.  </li>
            <li> This really, really works.</li>
            <li> I know your thinking does this really work?</li>
            <li> It really has made a difference.</li>
            <li> I know it will take a while for it to really work.</li>
            <li> It really helped my hair from taking the beating from bleaching.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks much healthier in 1 month......</li>
            <li> , I did not see any postivie results, though I didn&#x27;t expect fast results.  </li>
            <li> the product really works if you use it consistently&lt;</li>
            <li> nails and hair are stronger and growing fast</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast and product was sealed as it should be.</li>
            <li> and it is really depressng.  </li>
            <li> its falling out soooo much and feels like it broke a lot.</li>
            <li> It was much stronger.</li>
            <li> how amazed she is at how much it has grown.  </li>
            <li> This product costs to much</li>
            <li> This product really seem to be doing the job.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
            <li> Very suspicious.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t lose as much hair</li>
            <li> You could still see her scalp (she&#x27;s 75), but not as much.  </li>
            <li> Very distressing.</li>
            <li> After about a month I noticed I wasn&#x27;t shedding as much...</li>
            <li> that is when I really started noticing growth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve posted reviews on this before - with continued use this really works.</li>
            <li> It really does work, but you need to give it time -</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find myself picking hairs off all my clothes throughout the day as much.</li>
            <li> and It works really well.  </li>
            <li> It has really help my hair.  </li>
            <li> I quit taking it about 2 months ago and started taking biotin since it&#x27;s much cheaper</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it to work so fast.</li>
            <li> I can NOT begin to tell you all how much hair is growing.</li>
            <li> it is so much thicker.  </li>
            <li> AND I notice that I&#x27;m not losing as much.</li>
            <li> But not as much as I did before.</li>
            <li> My hair stopped growing when I was going through some very stressful events about a year ago.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how much longer I will give it.</li>
            <li> One thought perhaps I&#x27;d changed my hairstyle since it looks so much fuller, but there is no illusion here.</li>
            <li> I believe that this does really work.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> I have now been taking the viviscal supplements, very faithfully, twice a day, for 8 months now and see no improvement.  </li>
            <li> I have been taking this for about two months, I can&#x27;t really see if it&#x27;s working or not.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very subjective.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really see much of a difference as yet.  </li>
            <li> This really seems to be helping.  </li>
            <li> Recommend from health professional useful</li>
            <li> soo i haven&#x27;t really seen any results yet..</li>
            <li> It will take about six months to see any real results.</li>
            <li> No woman wants to suffer hair loss.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  really too soon 2 tell ,but my hair seems  2 be growing  faster.</li>
            <li> It made my nails longer but not that much stronger though they still chipped.</li>
            <li> Though I did not purchase Viviscal from Amazon, It really does work.</li>
            <li> My hair is looking healthier and it&#x27;s not falling out as much.</li>
            <li> Also made my nails grow ridiculously fast.</li>
            <li> and it really works.</li>
            <li> and i really wanted it to work</li>
            <li> It really does the work.</li>
            <li> I would pay twice as much for it.</li>
            <li> That much of a difference.</li>
            <li> and then they grew and got stronger, the whole process was atleast a year.</li>
            <li> excellent...has really helped to strengthen my hair and nails  </li>
            <li> I WAS VERY UPSET</li>
            <li> Work fast</li>
            <li> It truly, truly works and I highly recommend!  </li>
            <li> i had a Mohawk i needed to grow out for work (i am a girl) and this helped speed up the process, so much</li>
            <li> After 3 months I REALLY noticed the difference - my hair had grown about 3 inches.  </li>
            <li> Give it a couple of months to really start to feel the difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> really.  </li>
            <li> Really works.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for a while now, and I do believe that it makes my hair much stronger.</li>
            <li> My hair is growing but I use so much stuff</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something that works and works FAST...</li>
            <li> and I did not see much of a difference at all.</li>
            <li> I and I can really see and feel a difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much fuller than it has ever been.  </li>
            <li> my hair was really thinning now</li>
            <li> I was a skeptic on this product and was ready to give up on all hair product</li>
            <li> real difference in my nails thati can tell at this point</li>
            <li> but I did notice an increase in the length of my eyelashes -  not what I bought it for, but appreciated.</li>
            <li> and so is the hair on my chin fast and furious.</li>
            <li> and it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> (I often get acne if I eat too much sugar/cheese etc) and my nails are growing faster.</li>
            <li> and I can grow them much longer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just about ready to save my money and stop using this product.</li>
            <li> I really think it&#x27;s helping my hair growth.</li>
            <li> I really want this to work and am committed to using it for the 6 months.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really tell.  </li>
            <li> I really recommend this and will continure to use it.  </li>
            <li> I used it a month before I could see a real difference.</li>
            <li> I had been just taking the vitamins (which really helped my hair stop falling out) and then ordered these via mail.</li>
            <li> TO BEGIN WITH - really that its</li>
            <li> I also began to supplement with Biotin as some reviewers noted it was much cheaper and worked as well.  </li>
            <li> it really does work.  </li>
            <li> it does really work.</li>
            <li> and it was very achy...</li>
            <li> I felt VERY self concious and decided to do something about it.  </li>
            <li> My hair is growing very fast--1.5 inches per month.  </li>
            <li> Her self esteem hits rock bottom and she can&#x27;t stop thinking about how much hair she has lost, or will continue to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very thankful that it wasn&#x27;t the \\&quot;patchy\\&quot; hair loss.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Today, my hair has thinned and fallen out to the point that the area where my hair parts,my scalp has really begun to show.</li>
            <li> my hair is growing twice as fast</li>
            <li> And it was really evidenced by the fact I stopped for two months</li>
            <li> Within two weeks my hair stopped falling out as much</li>
            <li> This product looks promising.</li>
            <li> I just glossed over it because I didn&#x27;t want to jinks my progress, but the comments have really backed up my opinion that this product works.</li>
            <li> - can&#x27;t tell much about hair growth.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser was amazed by how much growth occurred in three months.  </li>
            <li> before I had really noticeable results.  </li>
            <li> I probably just start buying biotin instead because it&#x27;s much cheaper.</li>
            <li> hair has gotten thicker and growing fast.</li>
            <li> I contacted Amazon, they investigated the matter of the used box of pills and handled it very well.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> My hair also seems to be getting much thicker.</li>
            <li> So, i don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m going to continue to buy this product b/c i really don&#x27;t want to grow a beard.</li>
            <li> This product hasn&#x27;t changed the texture, but since it is growing  I am happy with the results and will continue to use it until I notice a change for the worse.</li>
            <li> Your ads are very misleading.</li>
            <li> This product did absolutely nothing to improve the quality or quantity of my hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> I do have to say that I also grown hair in very unwanted places.</li>
            <li> Again, it made my hair grow fast, probably about an inch a month.</li>
            <li> and i think we started noticing about 1 month after she started using it it works really well</li>
            <li> and they really do make your hair grow faster because her hair has really gotten longer since she has been using them</li>
            <li> she really likes them</li>
            <li> they were very prompt in sending out my order</li>
            <li> and i recieved it very soon after i ordered it</li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t know if my hair is growing faster</li>
            <li> Also my Hair doesn&#x27;t fall out as much as it did before after taking all these Products.</li>
            <li> What it did was to make my hair grow fast</li>
            <li> i gave up after 4 months, but then two separate hairdressers commented on how much baby hair was all over my scalp without knowing i was taking any supplements (i was getting extensions</li>
            <li> These really work, im</li>
            <li> take time for the hair to grow to really get the results.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my edges are growing back in nicely, and I see moderate growth all over.</li>
            <li> I started losing more hair early last year, still am.  </li>
            <li> look more natural but it will be like growing a short hair cut</li>
            <li> I also have to shave more frequently (the only downside to taking vitamins for hair, it is not like you can pin point</li>
            <li> But so far 5 days later my skin is getting better</li>
            <li> It is not a miracle drug for hair loss, but it does give key nutrients that assist in growing strong vibrant hair.</li>
            <li> Before then, I had gorgeous, thick hair.</li>
            <li> but I have noticed a lot of new growth in the form of small frizzy hairs poking out which is a good sign.</li>
            <li> I get that my case might be very rare but is possible to break out from vitamins.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve had about almost a half inch of hair growth, which is really good for me, since my hair barely passes my shoulders without getting frizzy and breaking off.</li>
            <li> I gave it more than six months, but saw no positive change.</li>
            <li> I started noticing new growth after the first month.</li>
            <li> I take 2/day and within my first month had A LOT of new hair growth in my hairline.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that Viviscal works well for others, but I&#x27;ve been taking it for months and really haven&#x27;t noticed a difference between it and biotin or other hair-nail vitamins that cost a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li> In the second year, my hair hasn&#x27;t grown much longer than the length I achieved after 1 year, but I think it is significantly thicker and still improving.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use Nioxin shampoo (#3 for colored hair) which I feel really gets my hair clean (used to be very oily), then Clairol shimmer lights for my blonde hair (let that sit for 2 mins)</li>
            <li> One doctor suggested if maybe I am not in fact under stress it could possibly just be that when you get older naturally you lose more hair.</li>

            <li> Perfect Food Raw &amp; a multi-vitamin everyday).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to see what the next 2 months on this system will bring!!</li>
            <li> this is my second week of using viviscal and i am excited to continue the course ...</li>
            <li> After only two weeks of using it as directed I was amazed at the significant decrease in hair loss while showering.</li>
            <li> They say that you should take them regularly for 3 months to see any significant changes.</li>
            <li> I will NOT be recommending or buying anymore unless it goes back to the original.</li>
            <li> and I have just recently noticed a significant decrease in hair shed when I comb my hair in the mornings.</li>
            <li> I love this product for my hair, but need the other hair care products to go with the vitamins.  </li>
            <li> I think it helps but cannot say for sure since I&#x27;m also taking other supplements.  </li>
            <li> I would surely recommend this product to other amazon users.</li>
            <li> By the time I got to the last three tablets, I noticed that the hairs on the left side of my head and top was longer than when I first started taking Vivascal.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to keep going because even though I don&#x27;t notice too much more, I&#x27;ve gotten compliments from other people about my hair AND eyelashes - a bonus effect</li>
            <li> Much better than any other products I have tried before.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten many comments on how thick my hair is becoming, and I&#x27;m even noticing new growth around my temples where I normally have wispy baby hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;By this time I have been air-drying my hair on large rollers, using jojoba oil, sleeping on a satin pillowcase, and detangling with a high quality comb instead of brushing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;By this time I have been air-drying my hair on large rollers, using jojoba oil, sleeping on a satin pillowcase, and detangling with a high quality comb instead of brushing.</li>
            <li> Actual new hair growth would be amazing and the only thing missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30 years old and have been trying everything to get my hair to get thicker and longer, my hair stylist said that because of my age, how long my hair had been at that length for, and because of it not all that healthy it would not get any longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really hoping to have a completely different head of hair in the full six month period.</li>
            <li> Like I said, for older women who are pre or post menopausal, I doubt it will pack as much of a punch.</li>
            <li> I used to clean my brush several times a day.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been told it really takes several months to get the full effect</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of the vitamins but did not get to take them long enough to see if there was a response.  </li>
            <li> very rare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I searched the postings of the more critical reviewers to see if this downside is more common but didn&#x27;t find anything.</li>
            <li> I really had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big &amp;#34;fad&amp;#34; person and not normally one to spend this kind of money on a hair product, but when it works it works.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described and prompt, professional shipping.  </li>
            <li> Wearing a jacket or sweater before was full of hair in the back.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyone wanting to work on regrowing hair should better spend the money seeing a professional, possibly getting FUE (Folicle Unit Extraction) or a version of Minoxidil or other treatments available.</li>
            <li> I plan on using the full six month run to see if there are any further results and plan to update at three and six months.</li>
            <li> was never the kind of person to react easily to small portions.</li>
            <li> Even on a second day, I&#x27;m amazed how full it looks.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember exactly when I stopped taking Resveratrol, but it was sometime in early</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember exactly when I stopped taking Resveratrol, but it was sometime in early</li>
            <li> I started using this about 7 months ago it really works not only does your hair come back , but it makes it more manageable..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not until later did I find out that this might be true, but the stress was also a trigger into hair thinning.</li>
            <li> If you envy every girl that goes by with long, thick, beautiful hair, then you really should try this,  </li>
            <li> I think with a product like this, you cannot expect to see true results over-night, or even after several weeks.</li>
            <li> After hearing about Viviscal on tv, I immediately bought them at a local drug store, paying full retail.</li>
            <li> In September 2013 I switched to the Extra Strength hoping that I would really see more hair growing since the regular formula didn&#x27;t seem to do the job.  </li>
            <li> It does not work overnight -- it took time, but now, about eight months after first discovering the two bald spots, they&#x27;re both completely grown over with hair, and my biggest problem is how to make my new growth blend in with the rest of my hair instead of sticking straight out the side of my head.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve notice my hair get thicker, my hair was very fine an limp.</li>
            <li> I attached a picture of my new hair growth!</li>
            <li> Like I said, I&#x27;ve had that new growth happening for about 6 months, (after I stopped nursing), and the growth process was lagging until I started this supplement!  </li>
            <li> and I can see a lot of new hair growth around my hair line!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this product and said \\&quot;she was jealous\\&quot; of all the new growth!</li>
            <li> and I wouldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> Cannot live without this stuff!</li>
            <li> However, it did not do anything for the massive amounts of shedding I&#x27;ve experienced for over a year (due to a medical condition) nor did it help with regrowth (that i can tell).</li>
            <li> It has taken about 5 months to get a lot of new hair,especially around the front hairline,and really all over my head.</li>
            <li> I have about 6 inches of new growth and it is much shinier and healthier than before I started this product.</li>
            <li> I noticed new hair growth around my hair line after a month, I guess if I would have kept it up, it would have really took off.</li>
            <li> Biotin instead, it works much better and will cost you so much less</li>
            <li> I love this stuff--my hair had been falling out for about a year and half</li>
            <li> and I know I can&#x27;t change that but wanted to restore my hair to previous healthy condition.</li>
            <li> I combined this product with vitamin B/folic acid and biotin supplements, tried to start treating my hair better (deep conditioner treatments, better hair products, less washing and use of styling tools), and cut back (pun) on highlighting and trimming it to just once every 4-6 months.</li>
            <li> I found that taking even less than the recommended dosage helped my hair grow and stay healthy.</li>
            <li> In the month that I took Viviscal, my weight steadily increased, despite no change to my eating and exercising habits.</li>
            <li> /&gt;About 9 months ago, I read a magazine article discussing hair loss, and a particular line from one of the hairdressers caught my eye: he said something about Viviscal, \\&quot;all the models take it\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I took it for a month, nothing, I bought 3 months and now as I used the last weeks of month 4, I can tell you I am going back for more.</li>
            <li> These horse pills do not appear to be working for this healthy hair having African American woman.</li>
            <li> Sure enough, there is an obvious mg change in the amounts.</li>
            <li> If anything, my hair loss continued at a steady pace.</li>
            <li> After paying varying prices (no one keeps the price steady often), I&#x27;ll continue to do so.</li>
            <li> its not about all the hoopla it receives just ok , but not fantastic fast growing</li>
            <li> I have tried everything, particularly after having two children and going through hair loss situations after both births.  </li>
            <li> I have also noticed baby hairs growing along my hair line which I believe suggests some decent re-growth is occuring.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been steadily losing my hair, I don&#x27;t know if its age , or what, but I started taking this about 2 months ago and though it hasn&#x27;t helped my hair</li>
            <li> the prices are quite decent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had moderate thinning hair for over 2 years, ruled out medical causes and have tried the recommended supplementation of B&#x27;s and more.  </li>
            <li> I did everything possible to regain the health of my hair like when I was a younger and never had my hair felt and looked soooo healthy until I took viviscal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking Viviscal 2x daily since Feb 1st, and have been documenting my progress to make sure I wasn&#x27;t totally wasting my money.</li>
            <li> So... if you are at all sensitive like I am stick with the regular strength if it&#x27;s still available.  </li>
            <li> I have a good feeling in the next few months</li>
            <li> so when I saw the regular Vivascal ad 5 years ago in August 2011, I ordered it and faithfully bought more when my stock got low.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I strongly advice you be careful where you purchase from.</li>
            <li> (she will flat iron it for special</li>
            <li> If you are already on a regimen for healthy hair, meaning your diet is right, you exercise, and take your other vitamins and supplements, this product is the only hair vitamin you will ever need.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, stringy and lacks volume as well as gets frizzy fast, i also had an issue with my hair falling out a lot due to stress.</li>
            <li> I have used these several times, right now I don&#x27;t seem to notice my hair growing as fast but will finish up the ones I bought and move on.</li>
            <li> At least if you own a convertible, you baldies can drive with the top down.</li>
            <li> My hair has grown a CONSIDERABLE amount since then and my nails are long and strong.</li>
            <li> Highly, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> So I bought high rated bottle of the vitamins for under $20 and it was 180 count one pill a day.</li>
            <li> My biggest issue is hair GROWTH though because my scalp is highly visible.</li>
            <li> The quality of this product is so high that even its competitors praise it.</li>
            <li> Depending on your hair problem, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Did read a comment about horsetail and the liver and am going to check that out.</li>
            <li> i had high expectations for this</li>
            <li> Have high blood pressure made my heart speed up, I stopped using.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product for anyone with thinning hair</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it😊👍</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it... Blessed</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was also taking a high dose of Biotin but that didn&#x27;t help either.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend it....</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> one star is way too high for this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Abusing my hair with the over-use of clip-in extensions had caused a particular area of my head to feel pretty bare (as a result of the extensions rubbing against my scalp and breaking hair when I pulled them out), but the section of hair there has since began to feel thicker!</li>
            <li> At this point, I can honestly say that the hair loss has been sharply reduced--maybe one quarter of what it was initially.  </li>
            <li> - I took it for 6 months and after about 6 weeks noticed  less hair on my bathroom floor and more new hair growing on my hair line.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad they&#x27;ve lowered the price a little on this.</li>
            <li> Within one week of taking Viviscal, for the first time in my 63 years, I had a major ocular migrane.  </li>
            <li> and I was like WOW !!</li>
            <li> I will say my hair is softer and feels like it has a little more body.</li>
            <li> Yet to see the result which will take a little more usage.</li>
            <li> My hair still growed in length and got a little better over time but still had the receeding hair line.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 4 rating because I still don&#x27;t see (or has little, if any) improvement on the top of my head where it has the thinnest hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair&#x27;s long and fine but with that loss, if I put it up in a ponytail there was clearly a bald ring around my head.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product after seeing it on Dr. Oz, but I didn&#x27;t have much hope since many other shampoos and topical products did not seem to help my very thinning hair.  </li>
            <li> I will certainly check back and provide a follow up review after about 2-3 months when results should be evident.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several months and my hair is growing very fast and is much thicker as well.  </li>
            <li> Took about three months to see a difference; when I let up in taking them for about two weeks, I noticed more hair going down the drain!</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t made much difference in fingernails as far as I can see.    </li>
            <li> people say when you get old, hair starts growing from places you don&#x27;t want, but it&#x27;s just too much of a coincidence</li>
            <li> Still really too early to tell,</li>
            <li> I should preface by saying I&#x27;m sadly very prone to adult acne, which probably didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT EXPENSIVE</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to be proven wrong like this.</li>
            <li> It was really damaged from dying it a bunch, but I have had it natural for three years; i use no heat or anything on it, and it still just breaks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking it for a month but can&#x27;t see much difference so far</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really surprised that this product actually really works.</li>
            <li> I will know more in a few months.</li>
            <li> My hair began to grow within a few weeks of use and continues to grow at a more rapid pace than before.  </li>
            <li> Was it worth the price for an extra inch of length - nawh.  </li>
            <li> I still shed, but it is normal shedding.</li>
            <li> I am not sure I want to spend more money just to test this out, it would end up costing way too much.</li>
            <li> Normal is anywhere from 0 to 40.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> I used this for a year and my hair is long and full of body.</li>
            <li> - so let me use it for a few more times and we shell see</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update more in a few months.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t been taking it long enough to k ow for sure--</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s ok as long as my hair finally grows!!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s normal 1/2 inch.  </li>
            <li> , tooth comb that I normally use when I am going to use my curling iron.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it for a few months more and then change to the Viviscal \\&quot;nourish\\&quot; tablets.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think that is long enough to know for sure if it helps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking Viviscal for a few months now and love the results I&#x27;m gotten from it.</li>
            <li> All my tests have returned normal.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure it was working after being on it for a few months.  </li>
            <li> So my hair still feels thinner than normal</li>
            <li> Hairs that were not thinning are still growing faster than normal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my hair grew faster than normal.</li>
            <li> so if your like me but your hesitant to try a product you should definitely give Viviscal a try its worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I used this for a full year hoping it would help over the long term, all it did was drain my wallet.</li>
            <li> i rated it a five star because i have been using this product for about 5 months now, hair has grown faster than normal.</li>
            <li> You have to take it regularly, but it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> At this point, I think I will continue with this product for a few more months and see what happens.</li>
            <li> After the first package I did notice my nails were growing faster, and my hair was growing faster and getting more thick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking the product for 7 months and while I will admit that my hair did grow longer faster, it did NOT stop my hair from falling at its normal pace.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as soft and shiny, and I know this may sound strange, but the grays are noticeable again.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as soft and shiny, and I know this may sound strange, but the grays are noticeable again.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth a try, definitely.</li>
            <li> I think it is important to take this product everyday and may take a couple of months to first see results.  </li>
            <li> As normal though.</li>
            <li> hair growth has been almost 2x faster than normal.</li>
            <li> I have experienced little or no improvement of hair/nails over previous orders of Viviscal supplements.  </li>
            <li> I am a,most back to a normal!!!</li>
            <li> Love the product, but do not like the hidden agenda!,</li>
            <li> The new formuls has added biotin, zinc and a few others I guess to make it more marketable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update... July, I stopped taking these about two months ago....</li>
            <li> 30+&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saw a dateline special where a man used it for a year and had no new hairs, but the existing hair was growing faster.</li>
            <li> three months later, I may not have a lion&#x27;s mane, but my hair is noticeably fuller and with the right haircut to give it volume</li>
            <li> but it was staying these tiny wispy sprouts of hair right around my face and now, with Viviscal</li>
            <li> I took them for five days but obviously had to stop, the acne went away right after too.</li>
            <li> In my picture, the one on the left is February 1st, and the one on the right is at the end of June.</li>
            <li> I am on my 3rd box right now.</li>
            <li> hair on upper lip has grown (waxing takes it right off with no</li>
            <li> If I see notice any more changes, positive or negative, I will update again.</li>
            <li> If I see notice any more changes, positive or negative, I will update again.</li>
            <li> My hair is super long and this is the area I was losing it in.</li>
            <li> There are other factors that are important in taking care of your hair, using the right products, not applying heat on a regular basis, and not bleaching your hair</li>
            <li> When you have Alopecia or any other condition it is important to talk to your doctor about treatment before taking any supplements if your hair follicle dies ie</li>
            <li> My subscription was canceled by Amazon due to lack of available product.</li>
            <li> but I also noticed I was sprouting new growth</li>
            <li> Item arrived new just as described, but it has not stopped my hair shedding in over 8 months of using this product.</li>
            <li> So the softness may be the new hair dye.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve seen some new hair along my hairline.</li>
            <li> I then realized it was new growth</li>
            <li> she said it looked as if I had about 4 inches of new growth.  </li>
            <li> I used it for about 3 months and saw some new growth.</li>
            <li> After using this product for five months I have not had any new hair growth.  </li>
            <li> but I like trying new hair dyes anyway.</li>
            <li> and she told me she could see new hair growth.</li>
            <li> Still, everything points to the new kid on the block, Viviscal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now that it is spring--I am noticing an increase in new growth around my hairline.</li>
            <li> Now I get an inch of new growth a month.</li>
            <li> Getting new growth and fuller.</li>
            <li> MY NAILS!!!I will keep on using this product, but if i did stop would the new growth come out?</li>
            <li> New growth and a shine.  </li>
            <li> lots of new hair</li>
            <li> not one new hair in a month.  </li>
            <li> I have new baby hairs growing everywhere.  </li>
            <li> and I have a ton of new growth.  </li>
            <li> and I have new growth around my edges.</li>
            <li> with new hair grown in the balding areas.  </li>
            <li> I had some areas that were thinning out at the hair line and now have a lot of new growth.</li>
            <li> So she stopped using the Viviscal for a couple months and started taking this new supplement.  </li>
            <li> I color my mom&#x27;s hair for her and after a couple months on the new supplement</li>
            <li> This does not thicken hair or help new hairs grow.</li>
            <li> but I have seen zero new hairs on my head.</li>
            <li> and  i found new growth in my hairline.  </li>
            <li> &quot; a month of new growth.</li>
            <li> but I did notice new hair growth after 6 months.  </li>
            <li> At 6 months I felt that I had a new head of hair.  </li>
            <li> The thinning parts of my scalp now have new hair growth.  </li>
            <li> The new hairs become visible after 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I have also been diligent about keeping it trimmed every 2 months to encourage new hair growth</li>
            <li> (I have a ton of new baby hairs all over my head)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> and then within 2 months I could feel new hair coming in.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve experience feeling new hair coming in three time in that time period.  </li>
            <li> So my hair is growing faster, but I also have new growth coming in as well.  </li>
            <li> and I do see new growth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any new growth yet</li>
            <li> I do see new hair sprouting up.</li>
            <li> have only used this product going on 2nd month, not sure if I am seeing any real results yet, but will stay on for a bit more and then check back in here.....:))</li>
            <li> 3 yrs later  I now have about 1/3 of my hair left, and it is very fine, wispy, and totally different from before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a full month so far due to losing large clumps of hair in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I did notice some hair growth, but it wasn&#x27;t as much as I had hoped for especially since I paid so much for</li>
            <li> I do see a difference as far as I am not losing near as much hair as I had been.</li>
            <li> I already have some great hair care products to make my thin hair LOOK thicker, but needed my hair to actually GET thicker and re-grow.</li>
            <li> and I want to see by just taking only Biotin everyday, if my Hair will stay looking as Nice as it does Now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the end of the 4th month and noticed absolutely nothing until very recently, my hair seems stronger; that is, I&#x27;m not shedding nearly as much.  </li>
            <li> First off i&#x27;ve always had super long hair until I had my second child.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping to see growth, since my hair has been going through a major shedding phase.</li>
            <li> It does take a couple months to really notice but they make a major difference</li>
            <li> There is something in this formula that really upset my digestive tract and caused major bloating and discomfort.  </li>
            <li> The seller sent these pills in a very old, damaged box.</li>
            <li> Taking pills from a damaged box or container is never advised and I was very surprised</li>
            <li> have two weeks left on my first month &amp; have noticed NEW hair growth....</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, in the month that I stopped taking it, my nails were right back to peeling and being soft.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 6 months and really feel that it is helping my hair; the overall texture is better and it appears to be getting a little thicker.</li>
            <li> My nails don&#x27;t break as easy, and my hair has FINALLY gotten long.</li>
            <li> I did experience some mild itching for the first few days and now it is gone.</li>
            <li> I probably have to wait a few months before I can see the full effect, but I am noticing a positive change in the way my hair feels after three weeks.</li>
            <li> I have been using VIVISCAL for a year with good results, but since my last order of 120 tablets it is important that I stress it is now extremely disappointing..  </li>
            <li> But I swear these pills make my skin CLEAR!</li>
            <li> skin got Clear! :</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so clearly snake oil!</li>
            <li> Nothing better but use it regularly layer and throw all your other stuff out</li>
            <li> I had to stop taking the pills and within a month my skin started to look clear and normal again...</li>
            <li> The only downside is I agree with other reviews that it makes your hair more oily..</li>
            <li> other than that I am a total convert..works better than anything I have EVER tried.</li>
            <li> First of all i&#x27;m 27 and my hair loss started when i was just a teen.</li>
            <li> I have used many hair strengtheners in the past, pantogar, pilfood and priorin amongst others.  </li>
            <li> only my first month taking the supplement haven&#x27;t  noticed  increased hair growth.</li>
            <li> I am giving this product an honest review because my experience with it was not good but the product itself is not at fault.</li>
            <li> and it is MINOR, short-lived and definitely worth the pay off.  </li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ve only been taking Viviscal for a short time, in three short weeks, the texture of my hair was softer and had a better sheen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going through menopause and my hair is falling out more than usual.  </li>
            <li> Although they are in the priced end, they are better than any other similar type product I have purchased.</li>
            <li> Lastly,  there is a loading dose of two pills per day for the first 30 days; therefore, keep this in mind when you make your purchase.</li>
            <li> My hair grew back much faster!  </li>
            <li> I used this in the past, but I needed more help.</li>
            <li> I have been using Viviscal Extra Strength Hair Nutrient tablets, 60-tablets/package for the last three months and my hair is actually getting thicker and you can&#x27;t see the bald spots any more.  </li>
            <li> my hair strands are sure enough starting to slip out of my scalp while im in the shower or brushing my hair now that Viviscal is no longer in my daily supplement</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Horsetail also contains silica apparently... and too much can cause kidney problems.</li>
            <li> and wow!</li>
            <li> This means that the rate at which my nails are growing has nearly doubled!</li>
            <li> Especially if my husband knew just how much I was spending!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend tried it too and she feels EXACTLY the same!  </li>
            <li> After 3 months I have noticed a pretty big increase in volume around my scalp.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft!</li>
            <li> No medical reason for this, thought it was age, years of coloring, hot irons, etc.  </li>
            <li> So far I think this is working well!  </li>
            <li> I have been using Viviscal for about 26 days pretty religiously twice a day..</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Now first keep in mind everyone is different and what works for some may not work for others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> feel energized more than usual as well&lt;</li>
            <li> hair loss has proven results to me so far !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m stuck with a full box minus 4 pills and no refund in sight....</li>
            <li> I know thicker hair and older hair doesn&#x27;t need to be washed as much, but using this you may have to wash daily.  </li>
            <li> As stated in my previous review, my hair barely reaches 1/2 inch in a month, so I am extremely pleased so far.</li>
            <li> The new baby hairs that grew further down on my forehead make me look lots better.  </li>
            <li> I had such high hopes when I bought the Viviscal, and now I feel very hopeless.</li>
            <li> WOW WOW WOW!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyone wanting to work on regrowing hair should better spend the money seeing a professional, possibly getting FUE (Folicle Unit Extraction) or a version of Minoxidil or other treatments available.ot do anything.  </li>
            <li> I have yet to see results as far as my hair is concerned, other than that my eyebrows and upper lip are a bit more hirsute.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a little more than a month, but is has highly improved the texture of my hair.</li>
            <li> Previous review: I&#x27;ve been using Viviscal for about 5 months now, and have seen a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I have super fine, thin hair</li>
            <li> IT COSTS MORE, THE SAVINGS ARE NOT WORTH POSSIBLY PUTTING MY HEALTH AT RISK.</li>
            <li> My hair definitely feels thicker and healthier, and I think it has been growing much faster than normal.</li>
            <li> Small area of hair had fallen out beneath the top layers near the crown.</li>
            <li> The only down side is my hair on legs, arms, and ovr lip grows faster also, so now I&#x27;m shaving more.</li>
            <li> I had not been able to part my hair down the middle in over 25 years.</li>
            <li> More hairs growing on the scalp, so I can part my hair down the middle.</li>
            <li> I worried that longer hair would weigh down and that it would be more obvious that my scalp was thinning, but that has not happened.</li>
            <li> I take one per night, and I have definitely noticed positive changes in both my hair and my nails -</li>
            <li> I did not see much of a change the first three months, but now, after taking Vivical twice a day for the last six months, there is a very definite improvement.  </li>
            <li> (I estimate I began the last week of January), and my hair is soft, full, and the male pattern baldness around my temples has begun to fill in.</li>
            <li> I did and I noticed new growth and my hair now, 8-9 months later feels much thicker and healthier.</li>
            <li> Since starting this, my hair has stopped shedding as much and there seems to be some new growth.</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, within a month from my last highlighting touch up, most of my hair had grown a full 1 inch, with some areas at 3/4 and baby hair areas a bit less (different areas of hair naturally grow at different rates).</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, within a month from my last highlighting touch up, most of my hair had grown a full 1 inch, with some areas at 3/4 and baby hair areas a bit less (different areas of hair naturally grow at different rates).</li>
            <li> I have a lot less hair in my drain now &amp; I am starting to see some thicker hair growth at the top of my head.</li>
            <li> Whether a thyroid issue, stress, nutrient imbalance, slight iron deficiency, there were many possible options but no conclusions.</li>
            <li> and my nails are very long right now.  </li>
            <li> I bought a few boxes from Target, and they were fine,.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any other changes for awhile, only my hair was becoming healthier.</li>
            <li> To the point of large dime sized cystic spots that stuck out 1/8th of an inch off my forehead and took weeks to go away, only to reappear after a month or so.</li>
            <li> After taking these for about 6 months, the little bald spot had filled in.  </li>
            <li> this product might work for someone who already has super lush healthy hair, to help maintain the quality, but people with gorgeous hair, probably don&#x27;t waste their money on crap like this.</li>
            <li> My hair is definitely growing at a steady rate!</li>
            <li> After 3 months, my hair stylist said she did think my hair had grown (after previously asking if I had the kind of hair that never really grew!).  </li>
            <li> and I am excited to see the results by the way I&#x27;m black with natural hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend these to other women in similar situations-definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> have had to invent new hair styles to look have way decent and hide my thin hair on top.</li>
            <li> This was a huge waste of money for me</li>
            <li> My skin was always really clear before so</li>
            <li> I was losing hair in clumps so that my scalp was clearly visible.  </li>
            <li> but I also have been taking Shizandra once a day and that seems to help clear my skin.</li>
            <li> As soon as I quit it, my skin was clear.</li>
            <li> I would have my face clear</li>
            <li> And the blackheads around/on my nose and on my chin clear up</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a clear difference when I run my hand through my hair</li>
            <li> Amazon offers them for sale directly at a much cheaper rate than the third parties.</li>
            <li> The negative is if you have gray hair coming in, you will have to dye your hair on a more frequent basis.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m getting some results - hair isn&#x27;t breaking as much, but I&#x27;m not noting extra growth.</li>
            <li> So far, I do like these hair vitamins.  </li>
            <li> They tout how natural the products are, while hiding the fact that AminoMar is shark cartilage.  </li>
            <li> Been taking it for nearly two months and haven&#x27;t seen results</li>
            <li> Cant wait for 6 months in to see how much hair I get back</li>
            <li> By the way, there&#x27;s nothing like being told you&#x27;re too young to lose your hair, because then you think you&#x27;re being paranoid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m taking pictures of my progress and so far I can tell you that if you can change your diet and take vitamins this will work for you.</li>
            <li> and it being an all natural pill</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so pleasantly surprised that I have to write a review.</li>
            <li> Too early to tell.  </li>
            <li> So far no effect.  </li>
            <li> Update as of March 10th: I was doing very well taking these regularly for a while.</li>
            <li> and I really think that it has helped thicken and lengthen not only my hair but also my nails.</li>
            <li> I am 63 years old, post-menopausal with thinning hair.  </li>
            <li> and wow, I now see a difference.  </li>
            <li> As far as the supplements are concerned, it&#x27;s too early to comment on their efficacy.</li>
            <li> I had a section of hair near my temple that kept breaking off and would not grow for a year or so.</li>
            <li> My hair had been really damaged from wearing clip-in hair extensions, and I recently vowed to stop wearing them and grow my real hair back.</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my hair loss.  </li>
            <li> I am a 60 year old woman who is experiencing hair loss for who knows why.</li>
            <li> I think it is too early to rate this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just a regular person who wants you know it works.</li>
            <li> Just do not take if you have an allergy to shellfish, as this is the basis of the all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Soooooo, ladies, these are pricey and don&#x27;t work as well as a complete vitamin paired with bioton...</li>
            <li> I think I will continue to use it for at least 3 more months.  </li>
            <li> Of course, adult men are not even supposed to take iron at all.</li>
            <li> I can no longer deny that I am seeing enough reasonable growth.</li>
            <li> I have been using Viviscal for nearly 9 months along with Walmart brand of women&#x27;s rogaine called Equate</li>
            <li> But I am a bit sensitive to iron.  </li>
            <li> I have always been sensitive, so</li>
            <li> started May 2011 with the tablets, head lotion, and the HairMax LaserComb Professional 12.  </li>
            <li> That seems to do more, at least for my nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> only question is, what is really in this stuff?</li>
            <li> For what it is, the price is completely overblown.</li>
            <li> if amazon would not required so may works for a feedback, us extreamly busy people would leave a</li>
            <li> I was really hopeful with the product based on prior reviews</li>
            <li> I do have acne-prone/oily skin but have not had a break out like that since my early teens.</li>
            <li> As far as a pimple around my nose (???)</li>
            <li> So far, I have been taking this supplement for almost a month</li>
            <li> I am 22 years old and I am under a lot of stress at work in the shipyard.</li>
            <li> I lost so much hair after stopping birth control pills a year ago and wasn&#x27;t noticing it growing back.</li>
            <li> I have been taking 1 a day for 2 months (only on weekdays) and I&#x27;ve noticed my hair grows SO much faster.</li>
            <li> I worked for a dermatologist for many years and know that it takes at least  4 months for a supplement to even reach the scalp.  </li>
            <li> but the product saids it will take several months to see a real difference...  </li>
            <li> What I have noticed so far is a reduction in shedding.</li>
            <li> forgot to mention that my hair is very oily, I don&#x27;t mind that because it actually feels healthier</li>
            <li> really wild</li>
            <li> It is too early to tell if there is any effect on my hair growth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 52 years old and had started to experience thinning hair about 4 or so years ago.  </li>
            <li> Although he&#x27;s using the men&#x27;s Viviscal, I thought I&#x27;d post his progress pictures here so that you can see how well it&#x27;s working for him so far.    </li>
            <li> My hair stopped growing when I hit 32 years old.</li>
            <li> MY PICTURE IS 4 MONTHS OLD, MY HAIR IS LONGER THAN THAT</li>
            <li> My dad is nearly sixty</li>
            <li> The only problem is I have to get my nails done every 2 weeks they grow so fast.  </li>
            <li> WOW and Holy potato</li>
            <li> Let me also tell you all that I am 29 yrs old, and do not have thinning hair problems.</li>
            <li> It brought a natural sheen to my head of hair and strengthens the follicles..</li>
            <li> but I seem to like it so far.</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone who wants to put Life back into their locks...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 19 years old.</li>
            <li> I figure if it doesn&#x27;t help a 19 year old with with hair loss</li>
            <li> I am hypothyroid and tried both synthetic and natural hormones, none of those helped my hair either.  </li>
            <li> So, I will keep up my experiment and see how far this supplement will take me.</li>
            <li> &amp; for the people saying if you have a sensitive stomach</li>
            <li> I am in my early 40&#x27;s with a grandmother with baldness and a mother with baldness.  </li>
            <li> so I am currently natural and</li>
            <li> but I cut my hair completely off where you could see my scalp</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed increase in thickness, just hair loss is considerably less.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how fast my nails get thin (obviously since they grow faster it&#x27;s easier to judge that the hair).</li>
            <li> and I thought it might help me keep my thinning hair as a 62 year old woman.  </li>
            <li> My review has nothing to do with Vivescal itself, which I still use and buy directly off their website.  </li>
            <li> Also my facial hair has thickened, along with my nails growing annoyingly fast.</li>
            <li> So far, I have received no damage from these.</li>
            <li> I WILL GET THEM DIRECTLY FROM THE MANUFACTURER OR FROM MY DOCTOR.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 22 and in nursing school with a 2 yr old son.</li>
            <li> So far I have used it for about one month.</li>
            <li> I used it dilligently for nearly 2 years, and noticed it working after about 4 months.</li>
            <li> No signs of improvement thus far after 3 mos.</li>
            <li> I still recommend giving it a try if you don&#x27;t have a pre-existing sensitive stomach like I do.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints thus far...</li>
            <li> So far taking tabs twice day for</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much thicker, has alot of body and doesn&#x27;t need to be washed on a daily basis anymore.  </li>
            <li> old aunt on the regimen this summer</li>
            <li> Also gave me headaches frequently</li>
            <li> It was so natural.</li>
            <li> My hair did stop falling out as much but not enough for me to keep spending money each month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 50 plus years old and a couple</li>
            <li> however I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 1/2 months so far</li>
            <li> After having permanents for over 30 years, I decided about seven years ago to go natural.  </li>
            <li> (I think completely from what I see.</li>
            <li> So far I give it one star because it&#x27;s not doing anything for me at all.  </li>
            <li> After two weeks of using Viviscal twice daily, I noticed my nails were growing much faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Into my third month of taking this supplement and haven&#x27;t seen any real results, but I&#x27;m optimistic.  </li>
            <li> they&#x27;re already, will not help anything thats completely gone</li>
            <li> Buy them directly from the website or even target/riteaide.</li>
            <li> (Yes I went that far</li>
            <li> but if you study yourself 8 hours a day and take this for 2 months you will notice a difference by up to 40% so far I should say with myself.</li>
            <li> Well, so far I can say that it has added moisture to my hair and made the brittleness go away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really soft and straighter now.</li>
            <li> I developed a rash on my legs and acne.</li>
            <li> they might complain a bit about the price, but I believe in it so much that I told them I&#x27;d give them their money back if they used it for a month and saw no difference.  </li>
            <li> So just within 3 years ive seen my head of hair completely transformed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks my hair does feel soft, but it does not feel any thicker and my hair is still falling out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not a fan of misleading product info and while getting the correct item shipped from them was OK, the return process was a pain in the butt, to say the least.</li>
            <li> Hair is soft and just feels healthier too.</li>
            <li> I religiously used this product for about 4 months and absolutely saw a difference in the thickness of my hair.</li>
            <li> Not to mention that my hair definitely stopped falling out as much as it used to.</li>
            <li> As far as my hair</li>
            <li> In March, I bought the supplement directly from Viviscal.  </li>
            <li> My hair is natural but I choose to wear it straighten.</li>
            <li> Love these wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive but worth it</li>
            <li> I am slowly but surely regaining my confidence.</li>
            <li> so everyone that have some kind of hair loss or their hair  getting thin, will benefit from this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Anyway I wanted my hair to always be lush and thick and healthy until death comes to claim me.</li>
            <li> but I want long hair down to my waist and this product is working, I will order more</li>
            <li> My nails have always been very thin and brittle, now they are growing long and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I would say the packaging is sleek and the tablets are small and easy to swallow,</li>
            <li> My hair is shinier, full of life and noticing less fall out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost through my first month and will repost when I complete the second month, but so far, I&#x27;m a big fan.</li>
            <li> At 43, I went too short about 6 months ago and decided to grow it long for the first time since high school and knew I needed help, so I decided to try Viviscal.  </li>
            <li> My nails are growing so quick I have to cut them all the way down once a week</li>
            <li> While it has not been long enough to see any real hair growth differences, I can tell you with 100% certainty that my nails, which are made of keratin just like hair, are growing at a much faster rate.</li>
            <li> but considering how much other eye lash product cost-and the adverse side effects associated with them, I felt it was worth mentioning.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally blonde and curly, it&#x27;s healthy but pretty thin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken it for almost 5 months now and not a single new hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine thinning blonde hair that has been coming out heavily in the shower daily for 2 years.</li>
            <li> At about 4 weeks my hair stylist asked me if I was doing something different because she couldnt believe the amount of new hair I had!  </li>
            <li> I actually grew a new hair!</li>
            <li> Now I use Biotin 10,000 mcg and its like $8 for a 3 month supply and is actually making new hairs grow!</li>
            <li> At my last hair appointment, my stylist commented on how quickly my hair is growing - she estimated nine weeks of growth when it had only been six weeks since my last highlights appointment.  </li>
            <li> But, small price to pay to have my hair grow not only longer an thicker, but also looks an feels healthy.</li>
            <li> My length has definitely increased over the past 15 months of use, most noticeably since October (a result of lots of summer sunlight and Vitamin D exposure).  </li>
            <li> , I drink lots if water, but I did have some pimples pop on my face for the first few days which is rather unusual for my skin, but it goes off after a week</li>
            <li> skin is smoother and fine lines are less deep.</li>
            <li> First of all let me start by saying I am an African American woman.  </li>
            <li> i have been taking the pills for 23 days and just in the past couple of days have started to sense that my thin, fine hair feels bouncier with more volume than normal.</li>
            <li> I realized that the pills I just bought from CVS were like my first batch but the second batch that I bought from Amazon was different.</li>
            <li> First and foremost, while I likely couldn&#x27;t tell unless I was doing a side-by-side comparison (which I did), the pills are different sizes.  </li>
            <li> These are amazing my hair has grown sooooo long and thick since I&#x27;ve started taking them.</li>
            <li> have been taking this supplement for the past 30 days and just purchased more for the next cycle.</li>
            <li> .it was recommended to me by my very expensive newport beach ca hair stylist who says she recommends it to all her clients with astounding success.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why the product has such a high review..</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product to anyone that&#x27;s looking to increase their hair&#x27;s current growth rate....</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, it is the ONLY thing that works!</li>
            <li> Two years before this, I quit my stable high paying corporate job to return to school for my credential.</li>
            <li> That must mean there is more hair growth too in general</li>
            <li> instead of 2 previously, hair filled my comb every morning, 3-5 strains of hair come off every time I run my finger over it, hair all over the floor n sofa,  hair clog my drain, loss about 1/3 of my volume over the last 3-4 yrs.</li>
            <li> I started taking viviscal and noticed considerably less hair in my hands when shampooing within the first month,  after 6 months my hair loss was at a normal rate</li>
            <li> To fix this, I would make sure to avoid putting cream on the problem area and only take the product every other day or so, instead of every single day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hesitated buying this product because many of the positive reviews are FAKE.</li>
            <li> The positive reviews were numerous and the negative/side effects really only centered around breakouts.  </li>
            <li> Not so much regrowth, but at least I&#x27;m not losing as much hair as much as I was before taking the vitamins.</li>
            <li> So I bought this stuff and within about 2-3 months everyone was commenting on how fast my hair had been growing and how long it looked.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I decided to buy some biotin and my hair still grows long fast.</li>
            <li> I normally have very short lashes.</li>
            <li> now I shed the normal amount of hair daily--</li>
            <li> Everything seemed normal, but was asked if I was doing anything,or taking anything different.  </li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s back to a normal shedding).</li>
            <li> but I will keep taking Viviscal until my hair gets back to normal.</li>
            <li> Not only was the packaging different, the ingredients listed on the last order was different when compared to my original order of Viviscal.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American women in my twenties who suffered from shedding due to perms and birth control, but more than likely</li>
            <li> I have long hair, and the only way I have been able to wear it down is with a LOT of product to boost the volume</li>
            <li> hair before I became pregnant was a little on the thicker side.</li>
            <li> At 2 1/2 months now I feel it&#x27;s pretty much the same - less hair loss and still thicker and stronger.  </li>
            <li> The pills are relatively easy to take but sometimes hard to remember to take the required two a day.</li>
            <li> I have been dealing with hair shedding/thinning due to hormonal changes and it hasn&#x27;t helped with that, but it does make the new hair that&#x27;s coming in grow much faster.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had thin fine hair, And my hair slightly thicker and definitely stronger because its able to grow longer now without breaking.</li>
            <li> At 55 my African American hair is to the middle of my back and almost as full as it was when I was in my 20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I take only one a day, and after three months I began to see new hair around the crown of my head.  </li>
            <li> Two months ago I went to a new hair stylist who dyed my hair darker, and I must say it was instantly healthier after that.  </li>
            <li> guy an update as the result was completely different with the new formula.</li>
            <li> By the second month, my stylist pointed out how much new hair growth I had - and</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t think the product actually thickens or grows new hair</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for about 3 weeks, so I can&#x27;t speak to any new hair growth.  </li>
            <li> New hair growth started coming in around hair line after only a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> for hair growth, I definitely can see the new hairs growing in at my temples.  </li>
            <li> I had my haircolor refreshed and one week later had new growth showing.</li>
            <li> I do see short new hairs but the amount hasn&#x27;t changed.</li>
            <li> It does take time, I&#x27;m finishing 2nd month and just now seeing the new hairs popping out.</li>
            <li> Do not trust that the new pills are actually viciscal.</li>
            <li> Within my third month of taking Viviscal, I  started to notice new baby hair at the front hairline, something I had not seen in years.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been on the vitamins quite 3 months, and I&#x27;ve gained over an inch of new growth since starting the vitamins.</li>
            <li> new growth, same amount of hair shedding.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Within the next 3 months my hair feels thicker, although I could not see any new growth.  </li>
            <li> I have a new shipment coming next week</li>
            <li> my hair seems fuller, thicker, and i can actually see new hair growth on my head.  </li>
            <li> New packs I ordered have pills of different colour!</li>
            <li> an incompetent new colourist I was trying out re-highlighted all of my fine straight/slightly wavy hair instead of doing just the roots, which caused severe damage and my hair started breaking off.</li>
            <li> and I would straight it alot and alot for school and made it really dry</li>
            <li> I was in a panic so my recently deceased Mother is actually the one responsible for my using the product.</li>
            <li> I am African American and it made my hair grow out fast.</li>
            <li> Over the last few yrs my hair has been falling out like crazy and started noticing more and more scalp visible  and was very worried I was gonna be bald soon.  </li>
            <li> In fact, my hair has started growing so fast that I&#x27;ve had to cut back on the dosage and take only one vitamin a day.</li>
            <li> I am 25 and after some different medications and stress I noticed my hair was really thinning around the crown with my part seeming larger and scalp showing in the front.</li>
            <li> it worked fast and my hair is definitely thicker after using for only a month.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get to use it long enough to see if it helped my hair loss, but be aware if you start a rash that it may be caused by this product.</li>
            <li> My hair is definitely getting longer, I don&#x27;t know about getting much thicker, but it only got 4 stars for the price.</li>
            <li> If you naturally have thin hair I don&#x27;t think this will give you more hair but will give you length.</li>
            <li> and now I am almost back to my old length!</li>
            <li> and I attribute this factor to my not seeing anything major happen in the thickness department.</li>
            <li> I started Viviscal first in 2012 for 2 months, didn&#x27;t see a difference and gave up due to the steep price.</li>
            <li> , I see no other side affects.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it for almost 3 mos., but I don&#x27;t see any major improvement.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a normal 22 year old African Male that just wanted quicker and thicker hair growth and</li>
            <li> I have had no other side effects.</li>
            <li> The packaging says it can take 6 months, so I am not concerned that I am not seeing major results yet....</li>
            <li> I started using Philip Kingsley Elasticizer Extreme on recommendation from a salon in London.&lt;br /&gt;September 2012: Consistently taking Viviscal.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed a major change in the manageability and texture of my hair.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed a major change in the manageability and texture of my hair.</li>
            <li> This quantity has diminished significantly over the past 5 years...</li>
            <li> Shd have known better but it was a weak moment.  </li>
            <li> I was suffering from a major embracement.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After getting pregnant with my son and him being born 16 weeks premature is when I first noticed that my hair was beginning to thin out.</li>
            <li> not sure if ill ever be able to stop taking it..maybe wispy dead hair will be in fashion one day soon :P</li>
            <li> My dr. noticed new hair growth in various spots on my head, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m as thin on top as I used to be.</li>
            <li> Although I eat a diet rich in nutrients, fruits, vegetables, and fatty acids the simple act of losing weight was causing distressing hair loss.</li>
            <li> I know I can stick with - and the only potential side effect I&#x27;ve seen - is actually a really positive one impacting my personal life.</li>
            <li> I have always had fairly fine hair, but for the past several years I feel like my hair sheds like crazyyyyy and just keeps getting thinner and thinner.</li>
            <li> (2) daily there after 1 vitamin daily just to keep the results steady.</li>
            <li> Dag, getting older sure is expensive...</li>
            <li> With this product slow and steady wins the race.  </li>
            <li> I used to have very thick hair, so I&#x27;m trying NOT to lose any more.</li>
            <li> but after using vivascal for about week my hairfall out instensified and my hair got very dry and brittle, exactly the opposite of what i heard.</li>
            <li> I had taken this last year for about 6 months to stop my fine, thin hair from falling out so fast, ran out, and didn&#x27;t repurchase.  </li>
            <li> I lost hair as part of the aging process and when I started using red yeast rice pills for high cholesterol and didn&#x27;t realize it thins hair the same as the statin drugs like Lipitor.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to say exactly how much longer it is, but I can see the difference.  </li>
            <li> This is my second order; it seems to work better than any other supplement that I&#x27;ve previously used eg.</li>
            <li> so I decided to try this product based on other positive reviews.</li>
            <li> is sharks - this from their website:  &#x27;AminoMar®: The groundbreaking, clinically proven marine complex available exclusively in Viviscal supplements.</li>
            <li> but now I realize you must take at least 90 days to see some results after that you are home free with hair strength and growth.</li>
            <li> My hair feels nicer in general.</li>
            <li> So far, I have been pleasantly surprised and will continue taking Viviscal and work the cost into my budget as long as I can.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> but clearly this is must be the cause of my recent acne</li>
            <li> and I am only 23 years old</li>
            <li> Used only two months so far.  </li>
            <li> I started to increase my protein intake, use all natural shampoo and conditioner, And left a stressful job...</li>
            <li> 44 yr old female</li>
            <li> It also helps with my skin, my face barely ever gets pimples anymore</li>
            <li> I alternate with this one &amp;amp; the professional grade.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t figure out why, at 38 years old, all of the sudden I was breaking out.  </li>
            <li> I use only natural oils on my hair like, jajoba, castor oil, rosemary and lavender oils.</li>
            <li> I do plan to continue use of viviscal for the near future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything to get my lush hair back--</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only taken this product for a week but developed an itchy rash on my forearms and neck the day after I started taking it.</li>
            <li> The big thing to me is the texture being so soft.</li>
            <li> I personally have not tried them out yet, but my 24 year old says they are a winner.</li>
            <li> : It seemed like it may have helped though the results were  not obvious -- and ultimately I developed an allergic reaction to it</li>
            <li> Btw she will need to take it twice a day after meal they told me.&lt;br /&gt;Shockingly after 4-5 days only the hair loss stopped completely .</li>
            <li> My current hair color is a lot darker than my natural strawberry blond</li>
            <li> so the regrowth is easily apparent.</li>
            <li> Had to style my hair so the bare area wouldn&#x27;t show.</li>
            <li> So far after 1 month of taking tables, I notice nothing different.  </li>
            <li> I believe I can see a difference as the bare spots on my scalp are no longer so noticeable..</li>
            <li> but so far I think they are starting to halt hair breakage.</li>
            <li> I am a 27 year old female diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (known as PCOS).</li>
            <li> so on there&#x27;s barely any time for sleep and lots of time for stress.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for two months so far.</li>
            <li> I had been using Nioxin Follicle Booster but then developed an allergic reaction to the topical product so had to give it up.  </li>
            <li> Please bring back the old version.</li>
            <li> I have as allergic reactions to shellfish in the past and should have read the label more carefully.</li>
            <li> I break out more with biotin, so considering it could have been worse, it was just a hassle.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the ingredients dont list what kind of shark.  </li>
            <li> and he&#x27;s just now beginning to have a thin spot on top.</li>
            <li> Better texture..used to be thin haired...</li>
            <li> Takes a few months, so don&#x27;t expect overnight success.</li>
            <li> okay I have been using viviscal for 1 month and my thin hair has been getting a lot thicker,</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine, thin, and damaged from coloring, straightening and simply not taking care of it as well as I needed to.</li>
            <li> This is a very subjective opinion, I am not certain of it.</li>
            <li> It improves the overall health of hair (This is a very important factor for me because who cares if your hair is long if it looks dull &amp; stringy?</li>
            <li> I am also losing less hair everyday, I am really pleased with the results I am getting.</li>
            <li> The new hair growth I have now is about 3 to 4 inches long</li>
            <li> Viviscal helped me and now I have  about 9-10 inches long new hair.</li>
            <li> I should mention that my scalp and skin are usually dry to normal.  </li>
            <li> i like the product because it is working , it work better than any other supplements i have tried in the past</li>
            <li> My hair was originally about 23 inches long, I never had trouble growing my hair out</li>
            <li> I usually wait 5-6 weeks between relaxers, but when I take 2 vitamins a day the hair grows so quickly that I need a relaxer in 3.5-4 weeks</li>
            <li> It was dry, lifeless and i became nervous my hair was thinning after seeing more than usual in the bottom of my shower and in my hairbrush!</li>
            <li> I have been steadily using biotin for the past couple years and did not see much of an improvement.</li>
            <li> I have fine thin hair from when I was young</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really give this product any reliable stars, as I couldn&#x27;t continue taking them due to the taste.</li>
            <li> My mother, who is in her 70&#x27;s wants to give it a try, but I&#x27;m worried that itmay not work for her due to age and menopause.  </li>
            <li> This really works, it regrew my hair from loss due to stress and then chemo.</li>
            <li> To bet rid of the old permed hair, I cut my hair on three different occasions to a very short bob, right at my ears and began to take Viviscal - twice a day as directed, but back then, I was purchasing it at the original price, which was quite expensive.  </li>
            <li> as for the growth rate.. I didn&#x27;t notice a huge growth spurt at first but in 5 weeks my hair grew an inch when it usually grows half that !!</li>
            <li> Needless to say, it was most definitely Viviscal since I have not added anything new to my routine in years except this.</li>
            <li> I would love to find a hair supplement that doesn&#x27;t have dangerous ingredients and really works for hair loss.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I have to shave my legs way more frequent now too.</li>
            <li> I am an African American woman in her early 30&#x27;s with bald patches.</li>
            <li> I finally grew it all out and have my natural color back.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m praying that the viviscal hasn&#x27;t suddenly lost potency and also worried that simple illnesses can reverse the gain that I&#x27;ve had with the pills so far.</li>
            <li> This product is by far the most expensive, but after reading the reviews it seemed I had to try</li>
            <li> I have to shave my legs twice as much which is annoying but still a good sign.</li>
            <li> Viviscal Extra Strength hair vitamins:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have used Viviscal Hair Vitamins 9 months or more, Very little results, unsure why I keep taking them, other than hoping to see some results for my thinning hair on the crown of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have taken this 3 months and thought my hair thickened a little at first, but now I can&#x27;t see any improvement.  </li>
            <li> I did get a little bit of cystic acne the first couple months</li>
            <li> It contains biotin which can make some people break out a little at first, stick to it for a while</li>
            <li> I think I am beginning to see new, fine hair growing in the thin batches above my temples (I am female).  </li>
            <li> I am on my second box and have not really seen much improvement but still keeping my hopes up i have very fine hair and a few thin spots at the front of my head of which i mainly need to grow</li>
            <li> Prior to me using these , my hair was breaking and thinning, mainly due to a certain medication I&#x27;m taking.</li>
            <li> My hair grows in so fine around my temples and this is the only thing that helped fill that in, plus my hair grows so slow and this definitely speeds up the process.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how much growth I have since I already have plenty of hair, but I notice that I have new growth all around the hair line.</li>
            <li> I already had some new growth because I just had a baby about a year ago, and that&#x27;s pretty common</li>
            <li> I cut my hair to a little above my shoulders to have a fresh start, so I am trying to grow it back out again.</li>
            <li> The most frustrating thing is all of the little hairs that are growing and sticking straight up and not obeying the blow dryer commands.  </li>
            <li> Although shark powder (aka cartilage as labelled by previous Viviscal packaging) seems pretty innocuous, recent studies has found that shark cartilage contains a neurotoxin called BMAA which leads to neurodegenerative disease.</li>
            <li> The only new thing added was shortly after my last physical was the Viviscal.  </li>
            <li> After dealing with major hair loss for the last 7 years due to change of life, two major surgeries and high level of stress I went to a dermatologist last year and had every blood test known to man and a scalp biopsy all inconclusive.</li>
            <li> My hair thinning is due to age and probably genetics, and this product has made me feel confident that at least I&#x27;ll keep what I have.</li>
            <li> My hair was thinning due to a vitamin deficiency, but this really helped it grow back faster and thicker.</li>
            <li> It was hideous and people were obviously looking at my bare scalp.</li>
            <li> I admit I was not careful enough before I used it</li>
            <li> is long and soft</li>
            <li> I am a 41 year old African American female.  </li>
            <li> Near the end of the month, I had a 1/4 inch trim at a long hair salon.&lt;br /&gt;October</li>
            <li> wow my hair has grown long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about 1 1/2 inches long with some coming in my natural brown color vs my gray.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Today, I take them because due to stress, my hair is starting to thin and fall out much more than normal.</li>
            <li> I have to giggle at people who complain that their hair does not feel thicker, etc within the first few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I am almost completely out and had to order a more expensive box from another vendor to supplement me until this order of four boxes of Viviscal is finally shipped.  </li>
            <li> otherwise you may have an upset stomach (this happened a few times to me when I forgot to eat something first).</li>
            <li> My stylist asked me what I had done to my hair because it was so healthy, shiny, long and thick!</li>
            <li> My hair is Thick and Full.</li>
            <li> I thought I saw a slight reduction in hair loss after about two or three months, but wasn&#x27;t certain.  </li>
            <li> When I was younger (30ish), I was able to grow my hair past my shoulders down to about my bra-line.  </li>
            <li> Re: the eyebrows, a little better, but very little.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thin nails that become transparent when they get wet, they peel and split very easily.</li>
            <li> Not sure why, I&#x27;ve even clicked on a previous order to make sure I received the same one, but didn&#x27;t happen.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, these are worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Because I am seeing new hair growth, minimal shedding and hair getting longer</li>
            <li> was not sure it’s the right one for her</li>
            <li> but I started taking this one instead since the biotin count is so high per serving, plus has the other ingredients for hair growth; [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m considering using half the dosage to see if that reduces the breakouts because this product really did work for me</li>
            <li> My hair grows fast and sheds a lot less when I use this.  </li>
            <li> Since taking this box I really have noticed less fall out</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month and a half and have found a drastic change on how much my hair sheds.</li>
            <li> But definitely thicker and worth buying again to get past this grow out stage.</li>
            <li> For some reason I&#x27;ve been loosing more hair than the past these few years.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this could be, since the ends of my hair are old hair, not new.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference after only two and a half months of use (I&#x27;m on my third package), I don&#x27;t lose less hairs</li>
            <li> (These had thinned over time due to normal aging.)  </li>
            <li> The only real downside is that you see minimal results for the first 4 months of use, so it can be hard to justify spending the money at first...but trust me...</li>
            <li> I am seeing a lot of growth in the hairline, parts were I had lost hair are now fillling in, the texture of my hair has not changed much, but I have only been using the viamins for less that three months.</li>
            <li> By now, I&#x27;ve got my long bangs back and the rest of the new hair is almost 5 inches long.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li> I have fine and thin hair.  </li>
            <li> I have fine thin hair.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend if your hair is thin or fine.</li>
            <li> hair was thin and super short from being cut to blend the extensions in with my natural hair.</li>
            <li> I noticed a little bare spot (about 1/4 cm) on my part about 3 years ago, and my hairline has definitely been much sparser in the widows peaks, and my scalp was visible thoughout if I didn&#x27;t brush my hair flat against my head.  </li>
            <li> I have bangs and they were getting very wispy, but now they are a little easier to style.  </li>
            <li> Worked a little but not as much as I thought.</li>
            <li> I cannot say that it has created new growth, but I will comment that other existing hair on my body has increased in the growth rate, as well.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair, but was starting to lose a lot of hair.  </li>
            <li> Now when I get my hair highlighted, I turn down the free blow dry, and I warm/cool blow dry it myself at the salon using my fingers or comb with the dryer at a distance, without subjecting my hair to the extremely damaging brushes used on wet hair aside from the infernal heat that salons normally set dryers to.</li>
            <li> Now when I get my hair highlighted, I turn down the free blow dry, and I warm/cool blow dry it myself at the salon using my fingers or comb with the dryer at a distance, without subjecting my hair to the extremely damaging brushes used on wet hair aside from the infernal heat that salons normally set dryers to.</li>
            <li> And I must say that it is, I am very sad that after 2-3 month of vibrant hair grow the shedding starts again after I started the new formula, I continue with it since I have bought so much of it, my hair continue to drop, even those newly grew hairs are falling off!</li>
            <li> There has been a definite decrease in the amount of hair I am losing (due to various medical issues) and I am seeing new growth as well.</li>
            <li> where you want the vitamins to go towards, so if you have to shave everyday, be aware that it might make it a little worse, or make you just shave/wax more frequently in general).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of a bummer  - hard to pay so much for a product that only gives mediocre results.</li>
            <li> : you lose your hair without a new hair growing in it&#x27;s place, then it is too late for treatment of that particular</li>
            <li> It does work, I also take 1000mg MSM, use Nexxus Pro-Mend Split End Binding Overnight Creme maintaining my ends and cutting hair by the Morrocco Method Lunar chart  so seeing amazing results.</li>
            <li> and I have a bad stomach, so that is good.  </li>
            <li> There were broken pieces in huge chunks all along the hairline.  </li>
            <li> I do get a few strands coming out when I shampoo and a few more when I comb the hair wet.  </li>
            <li> I have been doing hair for 7 years now, and I always gave Biotin such high praise for actually thickening the hair after continued usage...along with slightly faster hair growth.</li>
            <li> I can tell because the hair is a half inch long which is how much hair grows in a month.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps I am in that very small minority or just one among an unnumbered silent few who has gained weight but wasn&#x27;t sure if they could attribute it to their Viviscal usage.</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend this product to women and men who want a little extra oomph and growth for their hair.</li>
            <li> gained 11 pounds in the first three months, made my facial skin greasy, had a few pimples, developed a few chin hairs</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair and did not want to lose any more.</li>
            <li> Within a few days, my skin was starting to calm down, but it took forever to get rid of the last bits of the breakout.</li>
            <li> I only am shedding a couple of strands a day now (like normal) and I am seeing some serious new growth.</li>
            <li> As far as regrowth, I check my hair every other week</li>
            <li> My hair loss was attributed to stress due to my husband&#x27;s unexpected illness.  </li>
            <li> After about a month on Viviscal my hair was falling out less, and by month 3 my hairdresser was commenting on all the new hair that was growing all over my head.</li>
            <li> I took there before for a couple of months and noticed increased nail strength, less hair fallout but new growth,&lt;br /&gt;not</li>
            <li> I began taking product late November, and by early January, my hair resumed its normal thickness.</li>
            <li> so I can definitely notice a change in my hair growth because my blond roots are coming in much faster than usual.</li>
            <li> Butttt I was wrong, I took it for three months straight and my hair grew slowly at first.</li>
            <li> You have to give it time for your hair to grow back and it becomes long enough to notice....</li>
            <li> I am male in my mid 30&#x27;s and have been blessed by nature with long hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 42, with long term hair loss possibly from hormonal levels or genetics since its been prevalent since I was a teen.</li>
            <li> hair falls out like crazy and breaks very very easily.</li>
            <li> I see NO new hair growing in any of the bald spots but the texture of my hair seems to be much softer and my skin seems to have a little glow to it.</li>
            <li> I have very fine thin hair that breaks off &amp; hair extensions just killed my hair</li>
            <li> Due to lack of sunlight over the winter my hair doesn&#x27;t grow as much as it does during the spring/summer months in the Chicago area (lots of sunlight and being active outdoors).</li>
            <li> I do still have spells where I feel like I&#x27;m losing a lot of hair (lasts a little more than a week), but overall I don&#x27;t think the situation has gotten worse.  </li>
            <li> When I comb my hair dry, only one or two strands fall off (versus a big bunch before)</li>
            <li> I am on my second month of taking these and after having two children my hair was super thin.</li>
            <li> My hair lost is due to a divorce and stress over the last year so really need something to work as I&#x27;ve lost over half my hair...  </li>
            <li> so at least you can try first before stocking up for the minimum 6 months they claim to see results.</li>
            <li> Much of the information about them comes in the form of testimonials--- usually a sign of pseudoscience and snake oils, I think.  </li>
            <li> On the 2nd month taking Viviscal Extra Strength my scalp started to itch like crazy, and I read that many women go through this phase.</li>
            <li> Not sure it really works though.</li>
            <li> Im not sure how much it grew</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not sure yet if it really works.  </li>
            <li> My nails have grown and are stronger I haven&#x27;t noticed much hair growth that differs from my usual growth.</li>
            <li> I am not sure, but since I am really worried about my hair, I feel like I have to start taking the Viviscal again.  </li>
            <li> My hairline is filling back in, little baby hairs is better than tiny little invisible blond hairs where my dark hair was, my hair is really dark</li>
            <li> Have not taken long enough to results, but hope it helps.</li>
            <li> I take the tablets each day, however I haven&#x27;t taken it long enough to see a difference.</li>
            <li> Apparently it&#x27;s not for everyone.</li>
            <li> I did not use it long enough to notice any difference with my hair.</li>
            <li> took it  for wellover 6 months...and saw barely no improvements..</li>
            <li> I will definitely keep taking it as long as I&#x27;m on wellbutrin.</li>
            <li> I have noticed some minor pain in my left kidney area.</li>
            <li> Some say one month isn&#x27;t long enough for results</li>
            <li> My hair is about 4 inches long and there are tons of tiny half-inch strands of hair all over my head.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time &amp; recently stopped &amp; realized it was keeping me from losing weight that I needed to lose.  </li>
            <li> have not been taking it long enough for any results</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this on a regular basis as long as they continue to make it.  </li>
            <li> and you have to take the pills for such a long time:  </li>
            <li> I do color treat and flat iron</li>
            <li> I get sunburned on my scalp from standing outside too long.</li>
            <li> I haven’t used the tablets long enough to see a difference, but I will continue to use the product for the instructed time and see if I notice any difference.  </li>
            <li> I have seen nothing but length growth within the first few months and still going, and other people have noticed my hair getting longer too.</li>
            <li> I still shed a bit everyday, but I think it is a normal amount.</li>
            <li> The FIRST MONTH, within 10 seconds of sitting in her chair, she grabbed my hair and remarked how THICK it felt, and asked me if I was taking a supplement.  </li>
            <li> its full and not as thin anymore&lt;</li>
            <li> At first, I was thinking they weren&#x27;t going to work because my hair was growing so slowly.</li>
            <li> It started growing slowly in length first</li>
            <li> After being on this product for 5 months my hairdresser this week told me there are new little hairs growing all over my head.</li>
            <li> After trying a number of products unsuccessfully, I decided to try viviscal, my existing hair has grown longer, the breakage and shedding has stopped and there is new growth in the areas where there was little or no hair.</li>
            <li> So, i started taking Viviscal about a month ago and HAVE noticed new little hairs growing across my hairline and even on side of my hairline on my neck.</li>
            <li> I like to Mention that I did prefer the Older Viviscal Round Tablets, they were smaller and thinner and not as Thick and Big as the New Ones from my Third Box</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long you should take supplements to see noticeable results, but I certainly didn&#x27;t order another batch after trying it for a month.</li>
            <li> NEVER ever have i experienced an acne breakout like this and one that is a little painful.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but would highly suggest it to anyone with thinning hair.</li>
            <li> As I am doing several things, it is hard to know what is responsible for improvement.  </li>
            <li> What exactly does  (nourishes existing hair growth )mean?</li>
            <li> They review Viviscal, and on the same day a few other products--I suppose to make it seem like they are real customers.  </li>
            <li> no other reviews from any other day.  </li>
            <li> Overall though, I think I could&#x27;ve gotten the same results taking some generic biotin and other vitamins myself.</li>
            <li> I probably only took 5 or 6 pills when side effects starting occurring and now looking back on other symptoms, i had one day with a crippling headache</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am sensitive to red wine,  chocolate, aged cheese, nuts, MSG, and other foods.  </li>
            <li> And after a few months I DO have alot of new hair growth.</li>
            <li> I still have thin hair but now has new growth at my temples so I can wear my hair back without feeling self conscious of my former balding spots.  </li>
            <li> For really dry, fragile hair prone to split ends, these vitamins make a world of difference!!</li>
            <li> then I heard that Dr. Oz had an episode with this product, I tried it and so far the product seems to be working only after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve maintained the same diet and exercise level during use of this supplement and only have a #7 - 10 gain,  but it definitely is harder to shed.  </li>
            <li> and I continued to slowly thin until I stopped and got pregnant.</li>
            <li> I had unhealthy thin hair and used with Biotin for over a year and the results are really good.</li>
            <li> I still don&#x27;t have a thick head of hair, but at least it looks better.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still falling out at the same rate, and there is no new hair growth.  </li>
            <li> I had the same amount of hair loss and no new growth.  </li>
            <li> , well I have a VERY sensitive stomach &amp; if you take even just a few bites of food before you will have no probs..</li>
            <li> Holy cow have they gone from mini to major.</li>
            <li> &quot; vitamins with limited results that never seem to last.</li>
            <li> All these little new hairs are growing in the patchy areas and I can now wear my hair naturally without worrying someone will notice anything was ever missing.  </li>
            <li> As my hair stylist was blow drying my hair, she made a comment about the several new small hairs on my scalp.  </li>
            <li> I was so skeptical when my stylist first recommended it, but now I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> (the large, hard nodular under the skin pimples)</li>
            <li> I am 63 and have one eyebrow with less hair than the other and am starting to notice new growth in my problem eyebrow.</li>
            <li> Further, I recently got over 300 African hair braid extensions (all the way down to my rear end), followed direclty by sewn-in hair extensions.  </li>
            <li> Due to financial limitations I only take one pill a day.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because I was experiencing alarming shedding over a period of 3 months last year for no apparent reason.</li>
            <li> I have taken 15 so far, so roughly one every other day, and I must say that I can still see results.</li>
            <li> and i would definitely recomend them to other people and I would definitely buy from them again</li>
            <li> Despite my high protein diet, I noticed very little difference between taking these-and not taking these.</li>
            <li> Her hair was very, very thin and you could easily see her scalp.  </li>
            <li> My scalp has always been very visible and my hair fine and thin and lifeless, and very very slow growing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a major skeptic when it comes to products like this because I don&#x27;t have time or money to waste, but I noticed the difference in my hair&#x27;s thickness within 2.5 to 3 weeks after starting the Viviscal.</li>
            <li> I am 44, used to have very thick hair, excessive hair loss started 4 years ago, my fringe has never grew longer than my eyebrow and thinning on the top.</li>
            <li> Came on time but not only was packaging different (which I was prepared for), the composition/ingredients were a little different.</li>
            <li> Only taking it slightly over a month,  I see less hair clogging my drain after about a month, and for the last few hair wash, the result is consistent.</li>
            <li> I have had super thin hair since I was a teen due to an auto immune disease.</li>
            <li> At first I thought my hair was dirty with too much product but then realized I had just washed my hair the day before.</li>
            <li> I would have appreciated knowing what ingredients contained or at least mention of allergy information.</li>
            <li> I cut my hair (impulsively) and I immediately hated it lol.</li>
            <li> It was the most depressing thing ever.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say because the package says you have to take it for at least 6 months before you can expect to see any results.</li>
            <li> So far my hair seems fuller, but it may be due to other things I&#x27;m doing,shampoo,conditioner,styling products.</li>
            <li> Some were dark and looked like they had gotten wet or were old.</li>
            <li> But I want to be clear, not everyone has noticed that my hair is thicker but I have received a few comments.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t take long to show results.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a minor price to pay</li>
            <li> As a middle aged man with concerns for hair loss.</li>
            <li> Also (minor gripe)</li>
            <li> I refuse to continue using a product that long w/o results.  </li>
            <li> There is absolutely no difference in my hair on month #2 from regular growth and not taking any supplements at all.  </li>
            <li> It takes long time to restore what was damaged.</li>
            <li> But once it would start to get long, it would also start to break</li>
            <li> and I noticed a few natural hair guru&#x27;s rave about these pills.</li>
            <li> plus, nearly NO split ends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had long hair</li>
            <li> I started using castor oil long before Viviscal</li>
            <li> My stylist asked why my hair was so long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to make it grow long for my wedding in 6 months.</li>
            <li> While Biotin and Nailtiques are both helpful, I was curious enough after reading reviews to try this for my nails.</li>
            <li> I try to use a wide tooth comb whenever possible now.</li>
            <li> my hair looks and feels healthier and has grown so long, I could not grow before.  </li>
            <li> I could tell because I am a brunette with grey in the front.  </li>
            <li> As far as my skin breaking out, I had a few breakouts</li>
            <li> A complete waste of hundreds of dollars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been losing hair for 7 months, have been to numerous dr.&#x27;s and the cause is still unknown.</li>
            <li> My hair thickened up and is healthier than its been in a long time.</li>
            <li> If i use this product for 12 months that means my hair will be 12 inches long...</li>
            <li> I have a spot in my scalp where grey hair grows, and I have it colored.</li>
            <li> I never had long nails</li>
            <li> My skin /scalp are no more oily than normal.</li>
            <li> I came home and reviewed the ingredients again ,and when I looked up horstail, it says it is not to be taken long term, and also states it can cause liver problems.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to have long hair</li>
            <li> I read the reviews about potential acne and re-read the ingredients and could find no real fault -</li>
            <li> my hair has NEVER been this long in my life</li>
            <li> How long does this take?</li>
            <li> I thought I had noticed a difference within a few weeks when my husband commented on how soft my hair was.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;4) I have noticed a strange side affect-</li>
            <li> I finished and spent a year working tirelessly networking, interviewing and searching until I landed my current job.</li>
            <li> I have been taking Viviscal for a few weeks, and while I have not noticed any change in my hair (because it&#x27;s still too early to see results), I have noticed my nails are stronger and growing faster.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really long too</li>
            <li> I tried several products, most very expensive, nothing helped.  </li>
            <li> I went off that pill and my body was slowly getting back to normal, but my hair didn&#x27;t seem to be recovering.  </li>
            <li> I had had incredibly thick hair, and it was soooo much thinner.</li>
            <li> It was so thick I used to complain I had too much</li>
            <li> 3 months equals about 3/4 inches of hair growth for slow growers and 1 1/2 inches for fast growers.</li>
            <li> may come fast or slow</li>
            <li> However, I must add that I have reordered another 6 months worth of viviscal because I cannot imagine going off the product and having even worse hair fall that I&#x27;m going through now.</li>
            <li> 3 months is a good base to see a difference and measure it.  </li>
            <li> So annoying, but it&#x27;s a good sign.  </li>
            <li> Price is a little high compared to other hair vitamins on the market.</li>
            <li> two weeks later the shedding had slowed down a bit and to day 6/1/2012 a month and three days later</li>
            <li> On my second order - hair loss has definitely slowed down.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s back to almost as bad as the beginning, and frankly I&#x27;m surprised because my hair was really thicken up with the new growth.</li>
            <li> I have a nice thick ponytail at the base, near by head, where the new hair has grown in.  </li>
            <li> It might&#x27;ve helped with stopping hair loss, but there was no obvious improvement or new growth and didn&#x27;t like that I needed to get a prescription for it and that it may have some negative side effects.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the marine complex is the only thing new to me.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty bad area all on the right side of my chin and neck.  </li>
            <li> I have always had skin that was unpredictable, some days very good, some days very bad, so I don&#x27;t know if that is a side effect or not, just something to note.</li>
            <li> After the birth of my child and then turning 40 several years later, my hormones changed leaving my hair, skin and nails less than desirable.</li>
            <li> Product arrived within ten days, half the rice of our local drug store.  </li>
            <li> black current oil and prior to viviscal</li>
            <li> I loose SO MUCH HAIR and when light hits my hairline, i can see my scalp. :(</li>
            <li> so I got a new cut cheek length in a bob style this past January...</li>
            <li> I am on my second box and noticed about 4 weeks in that i have new hair growth on the crown and temples of an inch, as well as hair growth an inch all over in the past 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> So while we were happy to get a box since it is getting harder to find while on backorder, we were a disappointed to find that the box seemed a little tattered and some of the pills a darker brown than others.</li>
            <li> I am writing this so if you decide to try this product don&#x27;t buy more than one box (expensive) at a time!</li>
            <li> I will continue taking this product for as long as the manufacture it!</li>
            <li> Due to PCOS and related hormonal imbalances...?</li>
            <li> I started taking the Viviscal tablets as directed religiously, and in conjunction with some other vitamins, worked like a charm.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other products but no results.</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s hair loss is due to different causes and</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this means that I have to dye my hair a little more than I&#x27;m used to</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work and was a little skeptical.</li>
            <li> I am trying to give an extra boost to my short hair and I have noticed it growing a little quicker...</li>
            <li> I have used other hair supplements that cause side effects such as bloating and constipation.</li>
            <li> My hair starting thinning due to menopause.</li>
            <li> She went back on Viviscal and her hair loss stopped and is back to looking a little fuller again.  </li>
            <li> I also take naturethroid to help my thyroid, along with other vitamins, and try to add oil to my hair and scalp at night before I shower the next day.</li>
            <li> and I figured that since I had my other 3 supplements still left, I didn&#x27;t need to purchase Viviscal again.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I tried other products that didn&#x27;t help and finally tried this</li>
            <li> I thought it would be just like all the other hair vitamins, I had purchased (only pricier).</li>
            <li> It is not as big as other vitamins.</li>
            <li> Pros are it works and unlike other hair vitamins they are not giant horse pills.</li>
            <li> Due to the demand of this product it is taking 3 weeks to get the second box.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t changed any other aspect of my daily routine, I.e. diet, stress, exercise, etc.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had long eyelashes, but this stuff made my skimpy eyelashes fill in and grow noticeably longer!</li>
            <li> , in other words - Viviscal one day in the AM, net day in the PM.  </li>
            <li> I tried a couple of other shampoos/conditioners and am still getting the same results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken: Biotin, Nioxin, Prenatals and SEVERAL other vitamins.</li>
            <li> I was just re reading sime of the other reviews and several people mentioned their face breaking out</li>
            <li> As an engineer, I kept all other variable constant and just changed one thing...taking this supplement.  </li>
            <li> I do other daily things to strengthen and regrow my hair</li>
            <li> and she would definitely recomend them to other people i like this seller</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even noticed my middle-aged (formerly long and lush) eyelashes growing back in thick and long!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to notice a drastic difference myself, since I touch &amp; see my hair everyday, but my friends and family members have given me more compliments on my hair in the past few months than I have probably ever received in my entire life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using the product very long</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t taken it very long &amp; hope that it will make my hair come out thicker as I keep using it.</li>
            <li> and my eyelashes are very long..</li>
            <li> I started using viviscal back in October and have been very curious if I would see results.  </li>
            <li> After thyroid removal hair started to fall out, dry skin.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nothing that dry shampoo can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> I wash 2 or 3 times a week supplementing with Tresseme dry shampoo for after the gym</li>
            <li> I airdry or blow dry my hair</li>
            <li> My hair has gotten dry and breaks over time.</li>
            <li> Before, my hair was always so dry.</li>
            <li> My skin went from dry cause of winter to oily snd breakout.</li>
            <li> The secret, as simple as this sounds is fat and oils if you want hair that grows fast and stops thinning.</li>
            <li> The hair that was missing around my hair line is starting to come back.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say for sue, but I doubt these pills are real, and rather than take the chance of buying and consuming fake pills, I will be buying directly from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> My hair stayed the same and then seemed limp and actually thinner.  </li>
            <li> All the hair loss around my bangs has been growing back so fast my hairdresser has asked my secret.</li>
            <li> after religiously taking this for 2 months - this product did not do anything to slow hair loss in this 60 year old with Hashimoto&#x27;s</li>
            <li> : I missed five days of Viviscal before resuming again, and got a healthy hair cut so the damage didn&#x27;t get worse and slow progress.</li>
            <li> I took it for 4 months and saw no new baby hairs</li>
            <li> No new hair.</li>
            <li> No new hairs.</li>
            <li> limited shedding and no breakage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one product that I give a 5 star review every single time.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not taking a single one of these ever again.</li>
            <li> Not one single person was even liking it..</li>
            <li> And in the past 30 days my hair shedding has decreased by 90%, easily.</li>
            <li> Not sure what is in these tablets but may not be all natural.</li>
            <li> Just curious because that is why I am taking it, to grow back the hair I&#x27;ve lost due to hormonal imbalances</li>
            <li> The only negative thing in the regimen is the massive dose of biotin makes me break out, but if I take Zinc on a daily basis it seems to counteract that.  </li>
            <li> and I had to go back to dark and cut a lot off.</li>
            <li> A few other things I do to my hair as far as maitenance is using these products....</li>
            <li> Within the first week, my hair loss significantly decreased.</li>
            <li> Very sad, as this seems to do so well for so many~</li>
            <li> I have had this product for about a month now, but I am pretty poor at remembering to take it.</li>
            <li> I  have been getting these hair nutrient tablets for my mom  but not because she has thin hair because she has really pretty hair and lots of it</li>
            <li> I thought, heck, what do I have to loose?  </li>
            <li> I will ues it because I dont want to loose anymore hair.</li>
            <li> and this product has seriously improved the quality of my hair but only because I stopped ordering through amazon where I would get counterfeit products frequently.</li>
            <li> my hair loss has finally slowed down.</li>
            <li> The only down side is price.</li>
            <li> I may use this again in the future hopefully if the price goes down.</li>
            <li> When I went in for color, she looked at me strangely and asked if I got hair extensions!!</li>
            <li> will keep taking Viviscal as long as it&#x27;s on the market !!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve combined this treatment with a few other things such as evening primrose oil supplements and apple cider vinegar rinses in the shower and think these are definitely helping too.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair every day, so this was a shock!  </li>
            <li> My nails seem slightly stronger, but definitely still peeling and splitting.</li>
            <li> I have not yet noticed any extra hair growth in other locations on my body as other reviewers have claimed.  </li>
            <li> A lot less fragile too</li>
            <li> and I personally have small surface acne outbreaks on my chest from time to time which may be attributed to the fish oils but that is a personal reaction I always have to fish oil</li>
            <li> I now have hair past the middle of my back!</li>
            <li> The amount of niacin in the product created constant hot flashes..this was unfortunate.</li>
            <li> Now, Rapunzel I am not, but I do believe my hair fullness is back to looking how it did 10 years ago, with much less fall out in the shower and in my hair</li>
            <li> After taking this product for about 3 months now, I&#x27;ve definitely noticed less hair coming out in the shower and thicker hair.</li>
            <li> Considering trying biotin supplements to see if I can get the same results for less $.</li>
            <li> The front of my hairline has several half inch strands of hair.</li>
            <li> However, myself and many others (search the internet for &amp;#34;viviscal acne&amp;#34;), have gotten terrible acne problems from using it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was &amp;#34;wishful imagining&amp;#34; on my part, but within 2 weeks of starting these tablets, it looked to me like I was losing less hair.  </li>
            <li> Actually there was less hair in my brushes.  </li>
            <li> I had a lot less of them after starting Viviscal.  </li>
            <li> I am only a month and a half in, so in this amount of time I have seen no difference.</li>
            <li> I am also taking Biotin and Black Current.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re trimming your split ends and washing/conditioning your hair - you should see faster growth but only slightly</li>
            <li> I am only taking one tablet a day (half the recommended dose) and my hair is noticeably thicker.</li>
            <li> I only had a handfull, less than 20, and I cannot find anymore.</li>
            <li> , I can already see a slight difference even though I haven&#x27;t been using it for the entire month.</li>
            <li> , I can already see a slight difference even though I haven&#x27;t been using it for the entire month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half way through my 3rd box</li>
            <li> The ingredients were different on this package than the previous?</li>
            <li> It helped slow down hair loss, but not by much and did nothing else.&lt;br</li>
            <li> forgot to add that I have very dry hair.</li>
            <li> ( before Viviscal it was very dry and brittle)</li>
            <li> The pills I purchased through Amazon were cheaper, yes, but I started to suspect something was wrong when the packaging was so cheap that taking out one pill usually led to the backing coming off several pills.  </li>
            <li> I had a horrible experience at the hair salon, trying to go blonder and blonder from dark brown(around a 2n) and my hair stylist, who has been doing this for a long time, decided to do a \\&quot;bleach and tone\\&quot; on my hair, and broke off a lot of my beautiful hair, and ruined it.</li>
            <li> First of all, let me say that I&#x27;m 36 yrs old and my hair grows REALLY slow, and had begun to thin.  </li>
            <li> I am starting to see new growth where it was thin.</li>
            <li> (really) My nails grew at least a half and inch in 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I am a middle aged black woman who started seeing my hair thinning in the temples at age 33 (20 years</li>
            <li> I have written a few reviews in the past... but you will notice I only take the time to write a review when the product is either extremely good or extremely bad.  </li>
            <li> I tired this product out of pure desperation.</li>
            <li> This is my second box,you take two little pills aday.</li>
            <li> I think mine is genetic, and maybe a little bit of low thyroid induced, but</li>
            <li> The growth is not significant enough for me to buy again.</li>
            <li> This is my second month, so maybe it takes a little longer as the package says.  </li>
            <li> Especially with the little baby hairs around the forehead.</li>
            <li> but I started having a little acne problem on my face, chest, and back after Viviscal.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little gross, but what do you expect from a so-called \\&quot;vitamin\\&quot;?</li>
            <li> The next day as I was blow drying my hair, I noticed LOTS of little inch to two inch hairs framing my face.  </li>
            <li> It helped a little but still greasy in the back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this item for a little over a month and am only now beginning to see some affect.</li>
            <li> The first few days I felt tingling on my head seriously but haven&#x27;t since.</li>
            <li> Every womam knows how devesating it is to loose their hair!</li>
            <li> It covered my entire upper back, incredibly red and little bumps everywhere with some areas of large bumps that were painful like a bruise.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the hard truth is that with most supplements (even viviscal)...</li>
            <li> Recommended original Vivisal to friends, but will never recommend this new Viciscal formula as it is total crap and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t changed my habits otherwise, no new supplements or diet; the only other thing that I have been doing is rubbing a few drops of castor oil (sometimes coconut oil instead) in the roots of my hair the night before</li>
            <li> My hair was thinning badly and I&#x27;ve tried many products, some of which costs upwards of.</li>
            <li> Anyhow, they&#x27;ve decided to change the precious ingredients and it was a bad move on their part.</li>
            <li> The depression and lack of confidence I&#x27;ve experienced from hair loss is terrible.</li>
            <li> After several very stressful years, and being mid-forties, I was unable to grow my hair AT ALL.  </li>
            <li> this has made my skin break out horribly, usually clear skin not happy with the blister like pimples all over my arms back face and chest.</li>
            <li> I cut my hair really short because it was damaged after dying it and not only did it make my hair fuller and healthier, it made it grow at least an inch in just a month.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that this product contains iron, something women who&#x27;ve gone through menopause do not need any extra of in a supplement.  </li>
            <li> the years, I have probably tried at least 15 different hair vitamins (even Chinese herbs).</li>
            <li> AminoMar Marine Complex (Shark Powder, Mollusc Powder), Vitamin C, Niacin, Biotin, Iron, Horsetail Extract, Millet Seed Extract, Zinc, Microcrystalline Cellulose (same is in biotin), Maltodextrin, Hydroxypropyl Methyl Cellulose, Silicon Dioxide (same as in biotin), Magnesium Stearate,(same as in biotin)  </li>
            <li> After several months, I also noticed small hairs at my part and first thought they were broken off hairs.</li>
            <li> I was on it for 5 months and there was absolutely no change.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken this product a few years back.  </li>
            <li> I gave a few months back.</li>
            <li> round before i give it a final rating.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t tell my hairdresser what I was using but after about four months she commented how much thicker and healthier my hair was that she was not having to piece hair when styling to cover thin spots.</li>
            <li> Hhair that had been missing from the temples for years is now fully grown back.  </li>
            <li> my hair started falling out at an alarming rate do to hormonal changes associated with menopause. .  </li>
            <li> I only tried it for a few days</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s definitely worth taking although it is a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> Please note I did experience some sheading especially when I used a narrow comb.</li>
            <li> But then, I worked out, wore a sports bra (usual routines) and when i took it off, the amount of acne and rash that was now visible on my upper back was disgusting and nothing like i had ever seen before, let alone on my own body!</li>
            <li> Be careful if you take thyroid meds or have thyroid issue.  </li>
            <li> I have spent this money on Viviscal for 6 months.</li>
            <li> dont want to wait 6 months and lots of $$ later wasted to see it not working too.</li>
            <li> I spent a ton of money trying to stop my hair from shedding</li>
            <li> Will check back in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have no regrowth of hair in bald areas and no real feeling that taking these was helpful for my hair loss.  </li>
            <li> Is not working as well as I expected</li>
            <li> Shedding has become so minimal that I&#x27;m not loathe to see a strand of hair come out.</li>
            <li> it had absolutely no effect.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, getting older means less hair growth, and there is no miracle pill to naturally fix that...</li>
            <li> It stops hair loss and improves the quantity of hairs in few months only.  </li>
            <li> Its a shame that they say it takes 3-5 months to see results because by then you&#x27;ve already spent a ton of money before you realize there are no results...</li>
            <li> My hair is still as thin as ever, and it still falls out just as much as it used to.</li>
            <li> I did this a few times last night and once this morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be back in a few months to see if anything changes.</li>
            <li> The area of missing hair grew back in after alopecia subsided.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just curious, Does anyone got headaches using this product?</li>
            <li> and it was alarming.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely no improvement.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s gotten thinner as I&#x27;ve aged.  </li>
            <li> a few days after taking extra strength viviscal my stomach started cramping.</li>
            <li> a few days after i stopped taking extra strength viviscal</li>
            <li> and the hair loss seemed to slow considerably compared to the Viviscal.</li>
            <li> Also keep in mind that if you are a thin haired individual naturally, that it might take longer to notice.  </li>
            <li> I just think that since I didn&#x27;t do anymore treatments, what grew in was my hair in its natural thick state.  </li>
            <li> Before I would hardly get an half an inch of new growth a month.</li>
            <li> I took two pills a day for thirty days and will take a break for a few months or so, due to such an increase in the length.</li>
            <li> It grows very slowly, however there is definitely new growth!</li>
            <li> I flat iron my hair everyday since it is so poofy</li>
            <li> where it felt like i had a brain freeze all day and other days had stomach cramps that i just thought not much of.  </li>
            <li> I had a small hole of missing hair in my brow that I over tweezed that is finally growing back after almost a year (gasp!)</li>
            <li> one phrase, no positive results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s where I can visibly see the progress, those pieces now hang down a little and are noticeably longer since starting it.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s an inconvenient side effect of this product or just a phase, more like a skin cleaning that pushes the impurities inside out.</li>
            <li> only complaint I would have is that it takes a long time to see the effects of product use, but I think that when it comes to hair growth, that&#x27;s just how things are.</li>
            <li> I took this last order for a little over a month and started noticing an increase in hair loss and my skin less oily.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really say if that&#x27;s due to the vitamins, or just normal hair growth from stopping the bad medicine.  </li>
            <li> Need to take it for at least 2 months for major change.</li>
            <li> but it is what happened when poor diet meet my high stress lifestyle.</li>
            <li> What looked like new hair growth was merely hair breakage coming back in.</li>
            <li> I am 37 and have medium length wavy brown hair which has thinned out over the last few years and just won&#x27;t grow to previous length.</li>
            <li> but you will need to take this in conjunction with other things.</li>
            <li> I saw that other people were providing continual feedback as they continue to take Viviscal, so I thought I would too.</li>
            <li> I had to stop taking viviscal due to the price.</li>
            <li> Not sure about overall fullness through out.</li>
            <li> Looking to lengthen and hopefully thicken my head of hair and read about this product over the past year and decided to try it after reading user reviews on various fashion blogs.  </li>
            <li> I plan to continue with 1 daily pill for the time being, not sure if I may return to 2 supplements a day yet.</li>
            <li> It tastes extremely fishy -</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> I have been using viviscal in combination with a biotin supplement for the past year and my hair FINALLY started growing again--about four inches!!!</li>
            <li> I had two small stress-related bald spots I wanted to regrow as quickly as possible.  </li>
            <li> Three, you can buy generic Viviscal from CVS, usually at a substantial discount from the retail price of Viviscal.  </li>
            <li> In reading one other review, I think I may have found the culprit.  </li>
            <li> Will see and continue checking other peoples results.</li>
            <li> I am a vegetarian and I was not aware that this product contained fish derived ingredients at the time.</li>
            <li> Sorry I didn&#x27;t read the ingredients first.</li>
            <li> Lost hair due to stress.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to a hair doctor the other week, who looked at my hair folicles through a microscope.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I will also say that another problem with Viviscal and other DIY type of things that there is nobody to talk to or ask help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked the doctor about Viviscal and his comment was that Viviscal never went through formal testing, has never been shown to be of use, and has ingredients that do nothing, in other words a plocebo.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand--I am not yet positioned with one foot on a banana peel and the other in the grave yet either.  </li>
            <li> I just noticed this the other morning.  </li>
            <li> We took it faithfully, every day asking each other how it was going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These were recommended and I will tell you that I was skeptical at first.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> other thing to add:  </li>
            <li> my hair was falling out due to my diet &amp; this nutrient tablet</li>
            <li> A total waste of money!</li>
            <li> I have an extremely stressful life and job.</li>
            <li> I would skip all other vitamins for fear they \\&quot;MIGHT\\&quot; work but they also may not...and order this one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> (I wash my hair every other night).</li>
            <li> Other than the oilyish hair</li>
            <li> my hair began thinning due to medication</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and it works well, just give it the 90 days to definitely see results.  </li>
            <li> I might take it every other day.  </li>
            <li> I read other reviews were</li>
            <li> EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED.&lt;br</li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL!</li>
            <li> The marine complex apparently contains kelp and iodine.  </li>
            <li> I had to quit , but I know for a fact it works like a champ for a lot of other, thy-healthy people.</li>
            <li> Other than that I did not gain weight or have sleep issues.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve just lost more hair and money through the process. :-(</li>
            <li> If you are experiencing hair loss due to hypothyroidism or post GVS surgery, give this supplement a try.</li>
            <li> I also have hair growth in other areas, but</li>
            <li> Like the other reviewers my nails are growing faster.</li>
            <li> hair was thinning due to stress,chemical use and perimenopause.&lt;br /&gt;Prior to using this product, I used hair Formula 37 for a month, then I used Hairfinity for 2 months.</li>
            <li> I take them twice daily usually without food</li>
            <li> routine.&lt;br /&gt;That leads to me to believe that its possibly my OTHER 3 supplemts that don&#x27;t need to be refilled..</li>
            <li> Nd try other ones to grow my hair and won&#x27;t do that&lt;</li>
            <li> Disappointed in Viviscal for not doing more studies on the ingredients they put in their product.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first</li>
            <li> /&gt;The 4 star rating instead of 5 is due to the price.</li>
            <li> I have run into this herbs in other supplements I have tried and now will avoid any concoction which contains Horsetail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried evening primrose oil, fish oil, biotin, and other specialty hair supplements.</li>
            <li> I bought these after needing to get a haircut I didn&#x27;t want due to split ends.</li>
            <li> THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO INFORMATION IN THAT AREA!</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> They are pretty expensive</li>
            <li> My hairdresser even told her other clients about the difference it made for my hair, and urged them to take it.</li>
            <li> I lost a LOT of my hair due to S T R E S S.......</li>
            <li> Some past reviewers said it did not help their hair, or took several months.  </li>
            <li> she has used it for years to prevent hair loss due to medication.</li>
            <li> My hair started to shed excessively and I began to get bald spots around my hairline and red bumps.  </li>
            <li> but this isnt the first the has failed me.</li>
            <li> I have taken Viviscal to ward off the effects of losing hair due to the effects of menopause.  </li>
            <li> I always took the Viviscal for men which isn&#x27;t made anymore because it didn&#x27;t have other fillers like folic acid which I didn&#x27;t need.  </li>
            <li> 2011: diagnosed with alopecia due to stress and vitamin deficiency.</li>
            <li> At my wits end I read about Visical and sent for it, used it for three months then stopped feeling the hair loss stopped and my crown and sides were thin, the hair was growing but never thick in those areas again, but not thinner.</li>
            <li> will so I will continue with Visical and other hair thickners like living proof and wen and ojon shampoos.</li>
            <li> And makes alot of hair grow around stomach,Back,and other areas as well.</li>
            <li> (The product does not claim to help in these areas, but I am mentioning it since other reviewers have benefited in these areas).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In fact other than the nausea I did not notice anything at all.</li>
            <li> My hair began thinning I believe due to age and also swimming (</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am not on any type of medication (not even birth control pills), I did not change my diet, and I did not change my other supplements</li>
            <li> They feel ashamed about it, and therefore keep it to themselves- feeling reluctant to tell other people about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted to try these pills due to my hair being over processed, stressful job and life changes.</li>
            <li> but lately I have noticed that I dont have barely any hair falling out</li>
            <li> I am 34 and think the hair loss is due to stress.  </li>
            <li> and it remains the same length over past years.  </li>
            <li> Bought to help with hair thinning/hair loss due to autoimmune disease and menopause.  </li>
            <li> Then I read other reviews and this has happened to others.</li>
            <li> As far as my eyelashes, I haven&#x27;t noticed anything to dramatic, but I also have very naturally long eyelashes</li>
            <li> A little too expensive but worth the buy.</li>
            <li> The pills are a little smaller than a dime, round shaped, and are a brownish/taupe color.  </li>
            <li> Thyroid patients must be very careful with this stuff.  </li>
            <li> My hair was in such poor condition and falling out due to medical problems.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a ton of extra hair on my head yet but it is definitely growing faster and looks not as thin.</li>
            <li> and I can see tiny hair growing back in the thin areas that had receded.</li>
            <li> In the beginning it did make me constipated and gave me slight stomach upset, but that&#x27;s to be expected from the iron content.  </li>
            <li> and I decided to be pro active.</li>
            <li> I went through a time of high stress, poor diet, and as a result- lost half of my hair (no kidding).</li>
            <li> I completely noticed how thick my hairline had gotten !</li>
            <li> I did not get any other odd side effects that some customers have reported, eg stomach ache, acne, or any other problems.</li>
            <li> these tablets are much bigger and not sure if they are working as well as previous Visvical</li>
            <li> I definitely started seeing less hair in brush and in the shower in the past week, so I&#x27;m gonna stick with it and order another pack</li>
            <li> but then when I stopped taking it I started noticing my hair being less managable, not sure if its related or not.</li>
            <li> After taste is not very pleasant, but the benefits of this product outweigh that tiny con.</li>
            <li> My hair has grown quite long, but not sure if that&#x27;s due to Viviscal or just that I&#x27;ve kept it growing just to see what happens.</li>
            <li> Ive been a faithful user and my hair is now back to its long and thick norm!</li>
            <li> but this is not right.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed a little bit of eyebrow growth, however that could just be something mental.</li>
            <li> I spoke to two other friends who are also taking Viviscal, and they, too, have been having odd symptoms.  </li>
            <li> The only negatives are the cost per tablet, as well as the fact that it is hard on the GI tract.</li>
            <li> It is hard to comment, because I do not know how my hair would look like 10 months later if I did nothing or just the Viviscal or just the LaserComb.  </li>
            <li> My brain felt foggy, the pain was dull, yet deep</li>
            <li> too bad the price has gone up to $37.xx from $30.xx when i first bought it last year</li>
            <li> I have tried literally at least 20 different products to grow my hair.  </li>
            <li> I am late 30&#x27;s African-American female with chemically relaxed medium length hair.</li>
            <li> The average person experiences about 1/2 inch growth per month so for six months that would be 3 inches of length.  </li>
            <li> i think i won&#x27;t continue it&#x27;s unfair really ....</li>
            <li> Eventually I just gave up the plan of growing my hair because losing my skin and my sanity over it was just not worth it</li>
            <li> Sorry, I really wanted to believe all the reviews for Viviscal</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also having to cut my nails at least weekly, which wasn&#x27;t the case before; nail strength/growth was not a goal but its further proof that the product is working.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Instead of combing out an average of 15 hairs, I now see maybe 2.</li>
            <li> I posted a negative review a while back!  </li>
            <li> Not worth the $50-60 price tag (for 60 tablets).</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the fishy taste of the pills.</li>
            <li> Well, silly me talked her into trying a much cheaper hair supplement to try to save her some money.  </li>
            <li> my leg hairs are growing twice as fast...which is not fun.</li>
            <li> if your hair is growingslightly faster than what your average is, then its working.</li>
            <li> I have used this useless product for 6 straight months taking the tablets as instructed.</li>
            <li> (because I had several coworkers who would always stare at that spot that they could see, how rude).  </li>
            <li> Will continue to use because I like the combination of daily vitamins it provides, and I have zero complaints about how my skin and hair look lately.</li>
            <li> not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> May reduce psychological stress from hair loss because at least you feel you are \\&quot;doing something\\&quot; about it.</li>
            <li> You have to commit to this for at least 3 months, if you don&#x27;t see a difference you can walk away knowing you gave it a proper shot.</li>
            <li> I did take a 6 month break from the viviscal to see if it would make a difference, and my growth and hair health definitely was negatively impacted.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Presently, I have nothing negative to say.</li>
            <li> so i decided it was not worth all that pain and discomfort.</li>
            <li> I now have been using it for 5 months and my hair is back to being thick like it use to be.</li>
            <li> besides the bald/thin edges and just slow growth overall I but the bullet and purchased them.</li>
            <li> Having seen horrific documentaries on the shark fishing industry there&#x27;s no way I can order this product in good conscience.</li>
            <li> essentials&amp;#34; from a different website, and an additional 10,000 mcg of Biotin (natrol brand) from Amazon and my hair has never been as thick as it is now.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had thin hair all if my adult life</li>
            <li> My hair will never be thick and luxurious but this definitely helps until I submit to Rogaine someday.</li>
            <li> It definitely helped slow down the hair loss.</li>
            <li> My 3 rd and subsequent purchases are of the new boxes, which I heard from other reviews that it is useless!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from years of too-thin hair caused by medical reasons and got so sick of looking at fine, thin, flat, wispy hair everyday.</li>
            <li> I had very bad acne years ago and havent had a break out in 3years because of my day and night acne regiment so having to deal with this kind of breakouts</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect waist length hair overnight by any means,  but for myself, I&#x27;m definitely averaging at least a half inch a month.</li>
            <li> , I choke down all those pills every day in an attempt to grow out my pixie cut.  </li>
            <li> and I cut down my dose from twice a day  </li>
            <li> It has slowed down the onset of alopecia.</li>
            <li> hair loss however, and had hoped that might have slowed down by now.  </li>
            <li> Thiaminase is an enzyme that breaks down thiamine, a nutrient also known as vitamin B-1.</li>
            <li> Down to one pill a day now ..</li>
            <li> and I drop down to one tablet a day.  </li>
            <li> So after one month, I backed the dose down to once a day.  </li>
            <li> I want my hair to grow longer, say down to my butt.</li>
            <li> After about 3 weeks, I notice that it slowed down.  </li>
            <li> So I dropped down to one day and that thing went away</li>
            <li> My hair loss rate dropped down dramatically and my hair was getting thicker, stronger and longer.</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t mean like one tiny zit on my chin.  </li>
            <li> Just the other day, I wanted to run a comb through my hair and couldn&#x27;t do it!  </li>
            <li> -it&#x27;s a little pricy there are other products that work as well-shop around if you can</li>
            <li> because I only get acne when  I&#x27;m in my period if you girls know what I mean</li>
            <li> Before I began, my nails were horrible (constant peeling splitting breaking soft ect) and my hair was very dry and couldn&#x27;t stand much heat.</li>
            <li> Then after about a month and a half I noticed my eyelashes started getting really dark and full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but for now the excessive hair loss just stopped, I am soooo excited to share this review as I know how depressing to see your hair</li>
            <li> It feels thicker when I gather it in my hands, which seems impossible given that I haven&#x27;t been using it for a full hair cycle, but there it is.</li>
            <li> thinning hair is not filling in, and I don&#x27;t see an improvement in my hair condition either, and my hair seems to grow the average (half inch a month).  </li>
            <li> They are just as soft and weak as ever, and I take 1200mg of calcium everyday.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product actually works for hair growth or not because I was unable to continue to take it long enough to see what it can/can&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li> My hair became very thin &amp; brittle after using Viviscal for about 6 or 8 months my hair became so much healthier</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally very curly, so waiting for it to grow can be very frustrating.</li>
            <li> I noticed no new hair growth however, my excessive hair loss was reduced slightly.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the pills are a little costly.  </li>
            <li> The smell of the tablet is very fishy and taste a little weird, but as soon as the tablet is swallowed it&#x27;s not noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product was used for a few months when my hair thinned due to a side effect from a medicine.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lost over half of my hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s previous length.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Right now I am two and a half months into this stuff</li>
            <li> My hair is stronger and I have less breakage.</li>
            <li> I have been taking this product for about a month and an half</li>
            <li> And I have noticed slight hair growth around my hairline in the front.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference is in hair growth within a half of a month.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been almost a month and the hair fall is half or less.</li>
            <li> I get a slight fishy taste</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t care less.</li>
            <li> will not give it even half a star</li>
            <li> but I think it makes your hair grow faster - so breakage and hair falling out has less of an effect.</li>
            <li> There is less in my brush too.  </li>
            <li> They are all gone now &amp; I also seem to have less gray hair</li>
            <li> My hair seems to be thicker and definitely less breakage.</li>
            <li> I noticed less shedding while taking this product</li>
            <li> Lots less shedding.</li>
            <li> Had a slight reaction causing swelling and dryness on my eyes.</li>
            <li> hair did grow at a slightly faster rate than before as well.</li>
            <li> I would be weary to anyone looking to buy this product who even fears slightly about breaking out and thinking it can be managed...</li>
            <li> However, I did notice a slight change in the growth rate after about 3 months.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m shedding less n</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking the product less then a month</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update on my previous post.  I am almost at the end of my 6 month trial.  </li>
            <li> Been using these for three months and noticing that I am losing less hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month and a half.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;spsychological or not, but my hair is doing just fine and afraid to stop using it in fear it will fall out!</li>
            <li> It does seem like I&#x27;m noticing less hair on my clothes, when I style, etc.</li>
            <li> I have noticed less hair falling and hair also seems fuller.</li>
            <li> Half my friends are now on it,(upon my advice), and hasd now spread to France thru a friend of mine.</li>
            <li> Low vitamin B-1 levels, a condition called beriberi, may cause serious symptoms.&lt;br</li>
            <li> - I have a noticeably fuller head of hair in less than a month.</li>
            <li> I swear my hair is growing longer and thicker than it typically does.  </li>
            <li> My hair was a lot finer/weaker before its use and now its longer and stronger and slightly thicker than before.</li>
            <li> although it says 6 months to see any results I grow and inch in one month along with less shedding and some thickness.</li>
            <li> I took these for a probably a year and half</li>
            <li> The changes are subtle, but my temples, which were thinning (I&#x27;m a 43 year-old female) are now covered in again.</li>
            <li> For some reason, about a year ago I lost about half of my hair.</li>
            <li> I think she will continue taking it  until we finish the 3 month supply since we bought  it already, but seeing results less than a week after she is taking it</li>
            <li> I have already been taking biotin supplements for years which helped my nails, but they seem less brittle now since I have been taking this stuff.</li>
            <li> Recently I was shocked at how much hair I lost in the shower when combing through conditioner.  </li>
            <li> There were damaged layers in my hair that was previously all one length.</li>
            <li> Looks like hair falling less after I start taking viviscal.</li>
            <li> And I will say there is less shedding</li>
            <li> I notice my hair&#x27;s slightly healthier as well as appears darker..</li>
            <li> I saw a slight increase in hair growth rate</li>
            <li> (My hair is not drastically longer but it is slightly longer, but the product does state that you need to use for six months to see</li>
            <li> The UPS tracking showed nothing until suddenly yesterday - a month later:  delivered was attempted until December 28, to the wrong address.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product as directed for  4mos and I see less hair in my comb and brush so it must be working</li>
            <li> a woman starts experiencing hair loss, she thinks of herself less.</li>
            <li> Every time I take a shower, I&#x27;ve noticed less and less hair falling out.</li>
            <li> Every time I take a shower, I&#x27;ve noticed less and less hair falling out.</li>
            <li> Previously had been shedding some hair every day.</li>
            <li> My hair seems to be falling out less.</li>
            <li> Now if we could make it less gray.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair has gotten thicker and less is falling out.</li>
            <li> but when I comb it after shampooing, there is still some hair loss albeit less than before.</li>
            <li> Just slightly</li>
            <li> I did think that my hair was shedding less while taking this...took it for a month.</li>
            <li> and I got slightly discouraged about the thickness that the product advertised because of my hair not getting any thicker.</li>
            <li> For those skeptical I recommend looking up the NIH journal article on a study conducted on its main ingredient Aminomar.  </li>
            <li> No communication and not very cool!</li>
            <li> Also, androgenic hormones and other &#x27;toxins&#x27; are trapped in fatty tissue and release into the blood stream after they break down.</li>
            <li> I can hardly type cuz they&#x27;re so long)</li>
            <li> Even my nails are hard and long.</li>
            <li> I had read really good reviews on this product, but unfortunately it made me so sick to my stomach</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t shed all over my clothes, and lose very little when I&#x27;m combing after washing my hair (wide tooth comb).  </li>
            <li> Too bad, was hoping for better results (especially since they are so expensive).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male 18 that went through some bad shedding for a combination of stress and possible male patterned baldness.</li>
            <li> take 2 extra strength pills on a daily basis for a minimum of 3-6 months depending on how bad your hair is thinning/balding and you&#x27;ll see a big difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> take 2 extra strength pills on a daily basis for a minimum of 3-6 months depending on how bad your hair is thinning/balding and you&#x27;ll see a big difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not worth the cost or trouble</li>
            <li> 2 rating is because maybe in the long run it helped or at least I felt that I was doing something, but my vote is with the doctor.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was I was cutting my nails twice a week instead of just once.</li>
            <li> because I heard that in some cases you need to take it for at least that long to see results.  </li>
            <li> I have fake nails, and I normally get a refill every 3-4 weeks.</li>
            <li> After years of dying my hair, my hair is a mess</li>
            <li> but I am determined to have my thick, long hair again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this for a little less than 2 months.</li>
            <li> Had been on the product for more than 15 days and stopped due to very bad headaches.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sparce eyebrows and would say they&#x27;ve grown in a little and now there&#x27;s also some crazy stray hairs around them.</li>
            <li> I have used the Viviscal Extra Strength in the past for at least 6 months at a time.  </li>
            <li> It is expensive and not sure it really works.</li>
            <li> After 80 tablets, my scalp started to tingle slightly, was itching a little and needed massaging a few times a day.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t and little by little</li>
            <li> The only thing that sucks is the price!</li>
            <li> I think my hair is a little bit stronger</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a month or a little longer.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows have been looking a little thicker as well.</li>
            <li> after 1 month little change but will continue as directed to see improvement.</li>
            <li> I could notice a little hair growth after about 2 weeks of taking them.</li>
            <li> However, the taste does take a little getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used other products in the past and have not yet found the miracle for hair loss.</li>
            <li> I had little spots in my hair that just would not grow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little leery of taking something when I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in it.</li>
            <li> you will see results in as little as 8 weeks.</li>
            <li> Within 1 month I saw a little over 1/2 an inch of growth.</li>
            <li> It takes a little while to notice any change</li>
            <li> And my hair is a little thicker.</li>
            <li> Take with food or it causes a little discomfort.</li>
            <li> We will give it a little longer, then will stop.  </li>
            <li> Now at 7 months I&#x27;d say my hair is a little stronger and healthier.  </li>
            <li> and  still no significant hair growth at all.</li>
            <li> and it did not work even a little bit.  </li>
            <li> I do see little hair poking up</li>
            <li> well a little over 12 inches including what was already on my head</li>
            <li> I read about Viviscal over 3 years ago in a magazin ad, but it seemed a little pricey.</li>
            <li> If you get mad at the cost and not seeing any difference at one month I think you shouldn&#x27;t be trying a supplement in the first place.</li>
            <li> My hair has thinned out a little with age and styling products</li>
            <li> My hair is noticeably longer and thicker, but I am not sure if I can attribute its growth solely to the pills or to other supplements I have been taking as well</li>
            <li> My hair is noticeably longer and thicker, but I am not sure if I can attribute its growth solely to the pills or to other supplements I have been taking as well</li>
            <li> My eyebrows do look a little thicker.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t out my hair in a ponytail because the little rat tail that it looked like was embarrassing.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ve been loosing a little less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are a little pricey, and don&#x27;t expect miracles, but I do think they help to make hair stronger and a little healthier.</li>
            <li> Foam\\&quot; what made my Hair a little Fuller, Thicker and Shinier&lt;</li>
            <li> I had to discontinue the product due to the price not fitting into my budget, I discounted it for about a month after taking for those three months and now I&#x27;ve continued it.</li>
            <li> far as the seller GLOBALFASHION goes: They display the wrong image for the viviscal on amazon and ship the purple/blue package with less ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 27 year old female who has been experiencing extreme hair loss since I quit the pill two years ago (ladies, think twice before you commit to those crazy hormones!).  </li>
            <li> and oh, I did not mention-normally my hair falls out  every day, nothing  extreme, for the past two days its half of the amount that is falling!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to really rate this product because I was unable to tolerate it on my stomach.  </li>
            <li> Every time I use Viviscal I find changes last batch actually had an Odor and taste of fish the last batch has marine complex that I am allergic too and had a bad reaction</li>
            <li> /&gt;About 3 days into taking it as directed... twice a day with food, I developed a really bad nagging headache that felt very deep.</li>
            <li> Using these plus the F.A.S.T. brand shampoo everyday worked to get my hair to grow faster</li>
            <li> I took them for 6 months everyday and then stopped taking them because my hair was the length I wanted.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been takkng Viviscal since December, decided I would go the 6 months just to see if it helped grow my hair, i was very skeptical,  first</li>
            <li> and my skin color became uneven.</li>
            <li> Initially my hair loss got worse and frizzy and wiry.</li>
            <li> I have been taking Viviscal for 2 months(almost everyday but not as directed, twice a day)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> but it is working for me by restoring  a spot where formerly there was broken hair and bald patches.</li>
            <li> You have to take it everyday.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s terrible but can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s effective either.  </li>
            <li> then I don&#x27;t think I should waste the money.</li>
            <li> I guess it takes a few months to see results.</li>
            <li> I do not know if my fringe will grow longer, that will have to wait a few month,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Viviscal for a few months and when I went to visit a friend, she asked if I had extensions.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> This product does stop working when you stop taking it, and does take a few weeks to kick</li>
            <li> my hair was falling out everyday.</li>
            <li> I bruised on my arms heavily for months and realized what the ingredient causing this.  </li>
            <li> but if you take it twice a day for a few months, you will be amazed by the results.</li>
            <li> Also, my daughter uses it everyday for her fingernails and loves it-</li>
            <li> My hair was getting noticeably thicker after 3 months and when I stopped taking the pills my hair thinned out over a few months gradually.  </li>
            <li> I like the viviscal tablets &amp; take them everyday.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> Within just a few weeks of trying this my hair has become&lt;br /&gt;visably thicker.  </li>
            <li> I use a few products and this is one of them.  </li>
            <li> It did take a few months for my nails to start growing</li>
            <li> I took 2 everyday for 6 months and am now going to continue with 1 a day.  </li>
            <li> I had always have my lonnnnng hair and for a problem with the clorine from a pool it went green</li>
            <li> Stopped taking for few weeks and my face cleared up.</li>
            <li> No effect waste of money, buy rogaine instead.</li>
            <li> My OGBYN recommended trying a supplement to combat these effects because I was dead set on having this form of birth control.</li>
            <li> I did take a trim  on Mother&#x27; Day weekend because the shedding made my length choppy looking and uneven</li>
            <li> but my hair was still short and thin.</li>
            <li> Really a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Waste of $$$.</li>
            <li> Using it everyday ..</li>
            <li> Waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> and after a few months, that did go away.</li>
            <li> Going to give it a few months longer.</li>
            <li> it took a few weeks, but I got the desired results.</li>
            <li> My daughter has always had trouble growing her hair.  </li>
            <li> A few days before running out</li>
            <li> I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely impatient with hair growth</li>
            <li> Will update posting in a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Also, the pills were a few months from expiration and their shelf life is 3 years, so the pills were sitting on their shelf for quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I took them for a month and now have to skip a few weeks (since I have to return this box).</li>
            <li> After a few pills I noticed my hair started falling out</li>
            <li> I order this vitamins trhoug Amazon.com few days ago; but I have been taking these for months.</li>
            <li> few month she was asking me to look for something to help the hair loss stop .After</li>
            <li> wasted alot of money</li>
            <li> Also the number one thing that will destroy your hair skin nails and body is STRESS.</li>
            <li> Hair everywhere, brush, pillows, drains, clothes, no difference, just a lot of money wasted, and</li>
            <li> Because of this uncertainty I stopped taking Viviscal for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> Because of this uncertainty I stopped taking Viviscal for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> After a few weeks this faded.</li>
            <li> waste of time and money did not work.  </li>
            <li> Was a dud and a waste of time</li>
            <li> These symptoms prevented me from studying, and prevented me from doing even my everyday tasks.</li>
            <li> who wouldn&#x27;t be?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a family member that has an underactive thyroid and the medicine that person takes, has caused her hair to become thin, and Viviscal has saved her hair, so she bought it for me, and it&#x27;s doing the same for me.</li>
            <li> but I was losing a lot of hair everyday</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m going to just amp up on biotin and fatty fish oils that i read on another review.</li>
            <li> I have very coarse, kinky hair that has gotten much worse with age.</li>
            <li> Wasted money with no results.</li>
            <li> Just a few days using it</li>
            <li> In combination with Viviscal I also take Biotin 10.000 mcg 1 Tablet everyday.</li>
            <li> I feel that I have wasted all the money for a &amp;#34;hopeless dream.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;And I don&#x27;t wash it everyday.</li>
            <li> A friend I hadn&#x27;t seen for several weeks asked me if I was wearing false lashes on a day when I wasn&#x27;t even wearing mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on week 3 and not a huge change</li>
            <li> I also noticed my nails which had been splitting for the past two years have stopped splitting and are so thick and long like they were in my thirties.  </li>
            <li> Plus I feel less stressed because of the B vitamins (I think!  </li>
            <li> but NOTHING worked, i even went through a bottle of prenatal vitamins because i was so deperate to get my long thick hair back!!&lt;br /&gt;Viviscal was recommened by a stylist at ted gibson, and it WORKS!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken plain biotin supplements before and never had a reaction to those but did not see the hair growth improvement that I wanted</li>
            <li> I have had issues with my hair for the last 10 years, due to thyroid problems, and my hair had become very thin with areas of my scalp beginning to show through at my front hair line.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not yet a dramatic difference, but I can definitely tell others that it is working for me.</li>
            <li> After a few days (5) I started breaking out pretty bad.</li>
            <li> i took it for 5 months and experriced a very slight differnce.  </li>
            <li> Very sad to report that the kamikaze hair and hair fall is back after a short illness and a 3-week visit from family.</li>
            <li> I am most disappointed that this delay was not e-mailed to me so that I might find another vendor weeks ago!</li>
            <li> But I do feel like my eyebrows are a little thicker than usual.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other vitamins in the past and nothing has worked!</li>
            <li> I only wish it was less expensive</li>
            <li> but I found another product that does the same that is less expensive and is just as affective.</li>
            <li> Maybe someone who is not prone to pimples in the first place just gets the lustrous hair without any ugly side effects.</li>
            <li> and my stylist is shocked at how fast it&#x27;s growing!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll honestly be shocked at how fast your hair grows!</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of money on something I couldn&#x27;t afford with no good results.</li>
            <li> The past few years I&#x27;ve noticed my hair thinning at the crown.  </li>
            <li> so i noticed my hair slow down growing when i stopped taking them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sweeping up less hair and there is hardly any when I run my fingers through my hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean thicker as in a different texture, I mean thick as in the amount of hair, a thicker ponytail or thicker braid as a result of the increase in health and amount of hair.  </li>
            <li> I used to have very long hair but had to cut it to about shoulder length because the ends were so thin.</li>
            <li> I decided to take a break on the blonde highlights for awhile, but it was starting to look bad.</li>
            <li> after I looked in the cupboard and realized I didn&#x27;t want to waste such an expensive product.</li>
            <li> My hair is looking ragged and thin again after the last few weeks of serious hair fall.</li>
            <li> I had read about these and was anxious to try them because my nails were thin and chipping and I have long hair that I work to keep conditioned.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, the large (thick) size of the round tablets were very difficult for me to swallow because I have a throat obstruction</li>
            <li> I started out a little over a year ago with thinning spots and my hair was just under my ears and wouldn&#x27;t grow!</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this product and unfortunately it was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I still buy these just because I am afraid that my hair will go back and take them maybe once every other day.</li>
            <li> I noticed very little difference in the quality or quantity of my hair.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;BTW...have very little hair loss when washing my hair..drying my hair etc</li>
            <li> They were hard to swallow and made my face break out pretty bad</li>
            <li> Too bad, I was really hoping it would work.</li>
            <li> I really had a bad hair day every day</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately I had to give it up because it was giving me diarrhea, which is too bad because it really worked.</li>
            <li> After just three months of using it even my hair stylist was shocked by how much stronger my hair was</li>
            <li> I think I saw a small change in my hair growth over a 3 month time span.</li>
            <li> my skin began to break out heavily!</li>
            <li> and I see small hairs growing from my roots (which weren&#x27;t there before).</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with hair loss for the past 2 years now</li>
            <li> It does take some time so keep with taking 2 pills everyday even if you don&#x27;t see any changes, it will come!</li>
            <li> After dealing with an auto-immune condition for 6 months my hair began falling out excessively</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure</li>
            <li> Not sure I see any results at all</li>
            <li> In fact, I had a friend who went on a diet cutting out fat completely for a year</li>
            <li> I am a small person</li>
            <li> Maybe this product would have worked over time but it made my hair so unbelievably greasy</li>
            <li> I notice it is thicker but not sure about growth.</li>
            <li> Snce using this product the past 3 months, ordering a month&#x27;s supply at a time</li>
            <li> For two years my once mermaid like hair would not grow past my shoulders.</li>
            <li> bless!&lt;br /&gt;I will update on my fringe after a few months!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works yet.  </li>
            <li> I had an issue a couple of years ago with a birth control pill; needless to say it caused a lot of medical issues!  </li>
            <li> Sadly, think I&#x27;ll have to deal with thinner hair than a face that looks like a teenage boys.</li>
            <li> Not sure I see any hair growth.</li>
            <li> Just couldn&#x27;t do it, so not sure</li>
            <li> I dye my hair a dark brown and my hair is naturally dirty blonde</li>
            <li> Not sure this is going to work for me.</li>
            <li> I would like to add that the shipment I ordered through Viviscal was past</li>
            <li> Definitely works; too expensive, though.    </li>
            <li> A 60-day supply should cost no more than $20, period.    </li>
            <li> think this is expensive and may go back to taking Biotin instead.  </li>
            <li> WASTE of money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Biotin in the past and it works...</li>
            <li> but for the past 2 weeks I&#x27;ve been using morning and night, as directed.  </li>
            <li> but I am not glad I did.</li>
            <li> I have noticed my thinning hair for the past couple years.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if its helping because im using a serum as well.</li>
            <li> I used this in the past and had stopped.</li>
            <li> Started up the past two months</li>
            <li> usually do a month on, a month off and depending on the season</li>
            <li> Money wasted!</li>
            <li> I was taking 2 a day and got one small pimple (I never break out)</li>
            <li> but I think the second batch was fake.</li>
            <li> usually i don&#x27;t write reviews cause</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if my hair just seemed thicker because I wanted it to but def no noticeable growth :/</li>
            <li> I became ill and lost a lot of my hair, especially around the front hairline.</li>
            <li> my stomach as some hair vitamins have in the past.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to share my experience using Viviscal for the past 30 days.</li>
            <li> Not sure if its working yet for hair growth or improvement.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase this using auto-ship for at least another few months.</li>
            <li> I struggled with growing my hair out and now my hair is about 6&amp;#34; past my shoulders.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s the Viviscal or the Mane &amp; Tail</li>
            <li> I have used product in the past but will not use&lt;br /&gt;unsealed.</li>
            <li> not sure about the hair growth/hair thickening/nail strength just yet.  </li>
            <li> For women who are past menopause...</li>
            <li> br /&gt;i still have make usual hair falling out in the shower</li>
            <li> I have been trying to grow my hair for the past three years and it was just breaking and getting shorter.  </li>
            <li> recommend buying this stuff, but you gotta stick with it for at least a few months, and using Carol&#x27;s Daughter hair conditioners if you have been trying unsuccessfully to grow your hair out.</li>
            <li> It is small</li>
            <li> The results have been unbelievable.</li>
            <li> Only problem is too expensive for me to keep buying it every month...</li>
            <li> it usually does).</li>
            <li> I am unable to take it I suppose it is a one star for me, but didn&#x27;t want to hurt the overall rating for a product that may work for people not adversely affected by the ingredients.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been taking one Viviscal tablet and one Biotin tablet a day for the past 5 or so months.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also sad to think that if I stop taking this product, I&#x27;m back to the way my hair was.  </li>
            <li> so I am not sure how well it will work for me.</li>
            <li> Then, after reading about this product in beauty mags and blogs, I decided to try again this past November.</li>
            <li> In the past I would always find stray hairs (mine are gray so they show up) on my clothing, etc.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist was shocked at how long my hair had gotten since I last got it cut.</li>
            <li> I unfortunately did not take these reguralry enough and did not see results .</li>
            <li> No more hair on the drain when I wash my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thin to begin with, and I have spent years bleaching it</li>
            <li> My hair had never grown much past my shoulders without breaking.  </li>
            <li> My hair has grown faster than usual in the past month as well.</li>
            <li> Agadir Argan Oil Moisture Masque made it even worse, causing my hair to rip like wet spaghetti, so I chucked it.</li>
            <li> No more sulfate</li>
            <li> (Not sure why)..</li>
            <li> Only downside is how expensive it is.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if Viviscal gives results or not, because I had to stop taking it after two weeks.</li>
            <li> I went to a salon this past December for a relaxer and trim...</li>
            <li> sincerely do not recommend this product as it doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve never had an issue taking medicines, I know people who can&#x27;t swallow some larger pills or if they have a weird smell or taste.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve never had an issue taking medicines, I know people who can&#x27;t swallow some larger pills or if they have a weird smell or taste.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Waste of money, doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> Not sure if this works for skin contitions also.</li>
            <li> Anyways, I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll try maybe one pull a day or just take mutil vitamins I need separately .</li>
            <li> the past two years, I have had an unfortunate encounter with female pattern baldness.</li>
            <li> was the lowest I have had in the past 2 years.</li>
            <li> I usually leave it in for about an hour or two.</li>
            <li> has extremely small holes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d hoped this would at least slow the hair loss down a bit.  </li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t decide yet whether they are new growth or just the sad remnants of broken off strands.</li>
            <li> After a bad color job that left my relaxed hair dry, brittle, and shedding all the time, I needed something that would help with this problem.</li>
            <li> Given the amount of money I had spent previously, this didn&#x27;t seem too expensive.  </li>
            <li> These pills made my wife sick, so we never got to check if it really helps as a method of growing hair.</li>
            <li> whatever the cause, so much of my hair was falling out that I hated to take a shower and watch the loose hairs just coat my fingers as I shampooed.     </li>
            <li> I am taking it for a week now and noticed that there are very few falling hairs after I shower.  </li>
            <li> I also had baby hairs that were not growing back which was very frustrating when trying to fix my hair.</li>
            <li> it made my head feel very heavy like it was about to fall off.</li>
            <li> and i can tell theres alot less hair loss!!  </li>
            <li> (otherwise it looks flat and sad).  </li>
            <li> I had a HORRIBLE reaction to this stuff that I had such high hopes for!</li>
            <li> I saw subtle changes, but the biggest difference I saw was when I STOPPED using the product for a few months.</li>
            <li> See hardly any difference and not sure if I should keep talking it.  </li>
            <li> In the past 2 years I&#x27;ve lost at least 1/3 of it.</li>
            <li> I really wish I didn&#x27;t have to. :(</li>
            <li> NOT suitable for vegans, vegetarians or anyone else not wanting to consume animal products.</li>
            <li> I saw thick hairs and thin hairs and hair in between, so I am actively still losing hair.  </li>
            <li> I was embarrassed to wear my hair down because it became so thin.</li>
            <li> and my thyroid checked and the ONLY thing wrong with me was I&#x27;ve been so vitamin d deficient for the past 6 years.</li>
            <li> It is hard to tell if it&#x27;s thicker.</li>
            <li> Growing put a pixie so it&#x27;s hard to tell.</li>
            <li> and I have learned, the hard way from my mistake.</li>
            <li> Within two weeks I wasn&#x27;t losing hardly any hair in the shower or just brushing it.</li>
            <li> But all that aside, the smell of fish oil from the pill made it a bit hard to swallow.  </li>
            <li> Concerning thinning, well, it&#x27;s hard to say.</li>
            <li> hardly ever write reviews on anything i buy (</li>
            <li> (i hardly ever get them)</li>
            <li> I hardly ever write reviews</li>
            <li> My hair is no longer frizzy or dull looking.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to assess if it works.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to know</li>
            <li> /&gt;Things working for me: I hardly use products and heating appliance on my hair.</li>
            <li> and it made their job twice as hard to put them in).</li>
            <li> there is hardly any hair in the drain.</li>
            <li> and their is hardly any hair after I wash</li>
            <li> it grows a little in my thin area</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t looking for my hair to grow longer, because it&#x27;s just too thin, just wanted to retain what little hair I have and</li>
            <li> Started taking it again last week, since I had 3 mo supply, hoping it was not the case, but now my face is breaking out:( Not worth the side effect and the two deep scars I have on my face now due to acne:((</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, because $40 for hair vitamins a month sounds crazy ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I know my hair has grown at least 2 inches, and it feels thicker and fuller.  </li>
            <li> and it was almost if my hair had become immune to the negative side effects of heat styling.</li>
            <li> I tried this for at least four months.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything negative to report</li>
            <li> After 2 mos use daily, my hair&#x27;s still shedding like crazy.</li>
            <li> for side effect, I know people complaint of breakouts</li>
            <li> I used to wash my hair so delicately to avoid the loss but it wouldn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> product says to use for at least 3 months and i haven&#x27;t gotten there yet.  </li>
            <li> The instructions say you have to use for at least 6 months</li>
            <li> My hair has grown at least a quarter inch in 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> should give a zero or negative number, but I will be nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They say to give it at least 4 months to start working...</li>
            <li> After my 3rd baby and crazy hormones</li>
            <li> Could not tell at all, (in the least) it did ANY thing for my hair.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s too late</li>
            <li> but I think you have to take it consecutively for at least months before you see any results.</li>
            <li> I plan to continue using for at least the recommended 4 months before officially deciding whether or not to recommend to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s grown at least an inch in 30 days.</li>
            <li> I started taking Viviscal after my negative reaction to my prescription birth control.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really experience bad hair loss, but I do have thin curly hair.</li>
            <li> Vote isn&#x27;t in yet since you have to take these for at least 3-6 months for results.</li>
            <li> at least 4 to 5 months as recommended and hope things will change.  </li>
            <li> understand you are supposed to take these pills for at least 3 months before you should expect to see any results.  </li>
            <li> However, the ingredients note a complex called AminoMar C Marine complex</li>
            <li> but I just wanted to put it out there just in case anyone is dealing with the same problem and thinks they&#x27;re crazy.</li>
            <li> I color my hair, so I can see that every month it grows at least an inch.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a mere 5 weeks and the growth is...kind of shocking to be honest.</li>
            <li> It has be taken for at least 3 months.</li>
            <li> so this is the side effect of this pills sadly but true :(</li>
            <li> My hair was starting to look a lot thinner and was desperate to find something to help.  </li>
            <li> They recommend that you use it for at least three months before you can seed result.</li>
            <li> least 3 months so I will write again.</li>
            <li> althought the product does say use at least 6 months</li>
            <li> you must keep taking it for at least 6 months though</li>
            <li> The plan is to try for at least 3 months and see if there is a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> If you want to grow your hair thicker and longer this is the product.but be patient because you won&#x27;t see results for at least 3 months.</li>
            <li> this product a try, and give it at least three month to do its thing.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product even though it takes at least 3-6 months to see the results.</li>
            <li> After several months, not a bit of change, that&#x27;s a bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> the principal ingredient of shark powder in the AminoMar Marine Complex.</li>
            <li> Until I obtain evidence certifying without a doubt that the shark powder/cartilage in the AminoMar Complex is BMAA-free, I am staying the hell away from this product.</li>
            <li> I will keep using it for at least 6 months and give it another review.&lt;br</li>
            <li> took these for at least 6 months and saw no change</li>
            <li> This auto-ship-mistake is honestly not on my end.  </li>
            <li> my hair, so it suffers a lot on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> My cousin has been using it for months and her hair has gotten extremely thick.</li>
            <li> but after taking a box of this stuff, i started seeing some rather thick nose hair sticking out from my nostril,</li>
            <li> My hair is so thick people come up to me and ask can they feel it.  </li>
            <li> A few years ago it started to thin until you could see my scalp in some areas.</li>
            <li> It no longer looks like a thin, limp mop on my head.</li>
            <li> BUT it works really slowly.  </li>
            <li> She said she&#x27;d never seen my hair looking so thick and long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been taking Viviscal for 4 months and let me tell you, it works slowly, but it works.</li>
            <li> I have always had thick hair</li>
            <li> I already have thick hair</li>
            <li> It is a slow process, however, it is working.</li>
            <li> I noticed my hair being thicker - like seriously thick.  </li>
            <li> if you&#x27;ve got thick hair</li>
            <li> When my hairdresser commented on how thick my hair is getting, I knew this product was helping.</li>
            <li> But other reviewers have had much quicker results, so I am very disappointed at this time.  </li>
            <li> I now have a thick head of hair!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair felt thick</li>
            <li> Not too thick-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve longed for a thick head of hair since post-pregnancy seven years ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was never too worried before because my hair was thick even through</li>
            <li> I have never had particularly thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Thinning has very slightly become worse.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;ll stop taking it, maybe for a day or two</li>
            <li> To date, I am not sure if it is working, but I can&#x27;t say that it isn&#x27;t either!   </li>
            <li> By the time you turn 50 you will see what I mean.  </li>
            <li> Unbelievable !</li>
            <li> I bought this due to my hair falling out in frightening amounts.  </li>
            <li> And i do mean  everywhere.</li>
            <li> No more bald spots!</li>
            <li> mean really...Check the reviews and the amount of reviews.  </li>
            <li> no more hair falling out!</li>
            <li> also my eyelashes are looking fuller and thicker, no more Latisse for me !</li>
            <li> Seeing as how I have seen results on my eyebrows I take that to mean these pills do work.  </li>
            <li> and I have no irritation or other ill effect from taking them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mean no effect at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more receding hair line and my hair is fuller and has lots of shine !&lt;</li>
            <li> I MEAN IT JUST DISINTEGRATED.</li>
            <li> No change in shedding, if not, more shedding!</li>
            <li> No more frizz!</li>
            <li> Unbelievable!</li>
            <li> But I desperately want my long hair back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a very small person, but I was always needing something stronger for results(pain</li>
            <li> I need all the Help I can get for my Thin Hair, so I am not sure whether is Viviscal or Biotin</li>
            <li> and I see new growth at the base of my neck.</li>
            <li> but they increased the price $10 which seems ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> My nails are growing at a ridiculous rate</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never in my life had any serious acne aside from a couple of breakouts here and there.</li>
            <li> This current formula was awful -- totally ruined my hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff seriously works.</li>
            <li> After cutting and dying my hair over and over again within one year, my hair literally stopped growing and was extremely thin and short...</li>
            <li> I paid $100 every 3 months, ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Just that its a little to expensive for my taste.</li>
            <li> Now it does no good to have long, dry, brittle hair--and my hair is horribly prone to split ends and frizzies (poofs like crazy during a humid southern summer)--so I decided to try out hair vitamins/supplements.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so thick, it&#x27;s unbelievable!!</li>
            <li> Experiencing slow growth, but growth non the less after an awful hair cut and dry, harsh winter climate.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months, not that religiously because I am bad at remembering to take vitamins...</li>
            <li> I have been using extra strength viviscal for three months, and it seems that my shedding has not been as bad</li>
            <li> About 5 years ago, my hair thinning got so bad that I needed to start using those scalp coverup makeups at the front several inches of my hair on the days that I work</li>
            <li> I tried biotin but got such bad cystic acne, so had to stop that.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some really bad skin break out and didn&#x27;t realize it was related to vivascal until i read the reviews again.</li>
            <li> If it is the case, it is not good..</li>
            <li> I started Viviscal and stuck with it for the few months they suggest, despite the cost and annoyance of having to buy these expensive pills.</li>
            <li> But alas, yesterday, I decided to abandon the regimen because - without doubt - this supplement caused me to gain at least 5lbs.</li>
            <li> I am not saying that this product is not good or does not work at all - just that it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I ordered Viviscal because I was desperate, but with no real expectations as I&#x27;d tried supplements before with no results.</li>
            <li> Useless waste of money.</li>
            <li> I was so frustrated that I just went to the Viviscal website to see if weight gain was a potential side effect and to my chagrin found it listed with the disclaimer (of course) that it is but</li>
            <li> I have tried all sorts of expensive shampoos and conditioners and found them to be a waste...</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May keep using for another few months to see if anything changes, but this is an expensive supplement, so I might call it quits.</li>
            <li> I have naturally thin hair that grows extremely slow.</li>
            <li> I have already noticed my hair growing faster, and my eyebrows which were thin and sparse are now ridiculously thick and need to be plucked weekly to look neat.</li>
            <li> This helps my hair stay thick (I&#x27;ve got terribly thin hair and this has berms godsend).</li>
            <li> I tried taking it several times and every time it made me completely sick.  </li>
            <li> The next day, I tried dayquil because I thought I was getting sick...</li>
            <li> Not pleasant smell</li>
            <li> I realize that it will probably take at least 3 plus months to see dramatic results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am extremely ecstatic that I&#x27;m getting my hair back, knowing that you are losing your hair a horrible feeling, but I&#x27;ve also stopped shedding.</li>
            <li> Since I have started my hair has grown at least 4 inches!</li>
            <li> I took a gamble on this product...pretty skeptical, but anxious to try almost anything that would stop my hair from falling out.  </li>
            <li> At least I&#x27;m not LOSING  hair anymore!</li>
            <li> I bought the three month supply a while ago, and only made it through 2 weeks :(</li>
            <li> Duh!</li>
            <li> I have always had horribly weak nails and have tried all kinds of things over the years to get stronger nails.</li>
            <li> Although I was skeptical, I continued to use this product for the past 4 months and have noticed longer hair.  </li>
            <li> I suggest using once a day for weak stomachs.</li>
            <li> I finally found something to help w/hair loss &amp; then there is another problem (side effect).  :(</li>
            <li> Hair growth of at least 1 inch per month!</li>
            <li> Hopefully with Viviscal my hair will be as thick as I was one day!</li>
            <li> The don&#x27;t bend at the tips and feel really thick!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 49 and had very thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I mean I had tried everything!  </li>
            <li> I had never had this acne, but after taking the supplements twice a day for a month, I got one, Hedious, large, nasty thing.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair, but in the front, it became a bit thin as a result of autoimmune (lupus) disorder.</li>
            <li> At 77 years I expected some thinning but it was so bad</li>
            <li> I noticed that my hair had gotten so thin that my hairline was receding and all throughout my</li>
            <li> i have always had thin brittle hair</li>
            <li> I have noticed hair regrowth along the temples where my hair was extremely thin.</li>
            <li> I have a blond hair, a bit over processed and fairly thin.</li>
            <li> But still the blister-pack seems like unnecessary packaging</li>
            <li> My hair was still thin, and breaking.</li>
            <li> Also, you have to take these twice daily, which is annoying.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using  Viviscal for  approximately 5 months I see a difference in the thickness of my hair</li>
            <li> but I am NOT happy with this side effect.  </li>
            <li> All the thin spots are gone and  </li>
            <li> and I have broken out in what looks like cystic acne.</li>
            <li> Stopped purchasing as my hair got worse and worse.</li>
            <li> I suffer from thin hair and was hoping this would help.</li>
            <li> But it didn&#x27;t thicken up like I had hoped, but I am not as thin as I had been.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of thin hair but with menopause and age I have been losing it.  </li>
            <li> but my hair still looks thin.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and was hoping this product would help.</li>
            <li> Then I re-ordered, either from this company or another one, and my hair began (quickly) to thin, fall out, change texture.  </li>
            <li> Since I started taking Viviscal, I&#x27;ve noticed that my shedding has decreased.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thin, both in diameter and number of hairs.  </li>
            <li> will make you feel worse.</li>
            <li> I did notice that my thin eyebrows are getting fuller.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t noticed any softer, shinier hair or decreased shedding either...</li>
            <li> Bought the 180 ct pak from 7Skin; I wrote a poor review</li>
            <li> but I stuck it out thinking that my suspicions may have been a bit caustic and unwarranted.</li>
            <li> My hair loss has decreased dramatically.</li>
            <li> This is coming from a person who has thin hair and it took almost 1/2 a year to grow 2 inches.</li>
            <li> My hair DEFINITELY feels thicker at the base after just 5 weeks, and it&#x27;s not placebo effect.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that did not use animals unnecessarily.</li>
            <li> My hair started to thin in my 20s</li>
            <li> menopause had made my hair thin, but after taking this for 3-4weeks, my hair quit thinning</li>
            <li> A must have for ppl who have thin or thinning hair or just as a preventitive.</li>
            <li> After about 4 months of taking Viviscal, people have started to notice that may hair had gotten longer and isn&#x27;t as thin as it used to be.</li>
            <li> so i am afraid to keep using the pills waste of money</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my thin hair.</li>
            <li> I tell everyone I know who complain that their is thin, this product will help you, you just have to take it.</li>
            <li> I read in Cosomopolitan that its supermodels secret.</li>
            <li> and they told me it was pregnancy hormones making my hair thin</li>
            <li> , at 50 it was just getting worse...</li>
            <li> I see a difference in both the amount of hair and lack of broken ends.  </li>
            <li> My hair is still thin and is growing thinner.  </li>
            <li> I took it religiously for 5 months and it was worthless -</li>
            <li> and I have noticed that the shedding has decreased some what.</li>
            <li> no longer do I have to use that fake powder hair stuff because it seriously transformed my hair in just one month.</li>
            <li> seriously thought there was something wrong with me.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser was sick the other day and her colleague took over.</li>
            <li> (i hate long nails).</li>
            <li> I will say there is SOMETIMES a slightly fishy aftertaste from the fish oil, but nothing too bad</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect dramatic results, expect a realist change in the texture, thickness and/or growth rate of your hair.</li>
            <li> my widows peaks which looked as bad as the Evil Queens from Disney are completely filled in.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through radiation treatments and my hair was broken and very weak.  </li>
            <li> The taste is so bad it was like I was swallowing horse manure everyday.</li>
            <li> Made my face break out so badly I couldn&#x27;t use it after a week so my money went to waste.</li>
            <li> I am 30 years old, and dealing with hair loss is awful traumatizing (for any age).</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s sad that whoever is behind this is doing it</li>
            <li> I have been taking this for about 2 years now, ever since a devastatingly short haircut that I hated.  </li>
            <li> I am twenty two and losing my hair (to the point where scalp could be seen all the time) was not ideal</li>
            <li> hair grow real slow, and once you stop hair fall out.</li>
            <li> Rogaine, BCPs, every supplement imaginable, iron, diet changes, protein shakes, hanging upside down (don&#x27;t judge, i&#x27;m desperate!</li>
            <li> I read negative reviews as well as others here, and was very skeptical.  </li>
            <li> I agree that it is also helping my very weak nails.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed as promises were very different from results.</li>
            <li> WRONG, dead wrong!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t take a lot of medications, so I find it a little annoying.  </li>
            <li> , shocked I&#x27;m losing hardly any hair in the shower now.  </li>
            <li> Menopause was not kind to me and my hair was thinning badly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also quite expensive too.</li>
            <li> Unfortunate</li>
            <li> I tried shampoos, expensive vitamins ($100 range), products, sleeping in braids and conditioner, you name it, I did it.  </li>
            <li> Expensive but works.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product.  </li>
            <li> 4 vs 5 cause product is expensive.</li>
            <li> , I have noticed a thickening and filling in in the troubled areas.  </li>
            <li> And because I had such terrible split ends</li>
            <li> Expensive lesson learned</li>
            <li> The price is too expensive.</li>
            <li> I have some regret buying so expensive things.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the fake product reviews at all.</li>
            <li> lots of reviews look fake</li>
            <li> It depresses me.&lt;br /&gt;I am skeptical on</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, that means ALL hair, including underarms, legs, etc.</li>
            <li> Sadly I&#x27;ll have to keep hoping for a miracle pill to help my hair.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I just ordered a refill.  </li>
            <li> i guess ill have to wait and find out</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> Sadly, the pills do not do anything.  </li>
            <li> The ingredient list is vague.</li>
            <li> My skin has had some patches of stronger break outs however, it has gone away and hasn&#x27;t been that difficult to take care of.</li>
            <li> Listen, I&#x27;m as skeptical as they come.  </li>
            <li> they look fake</li>
            <li> It is too expensive to use a product for months just to find out it does not work.  </li>
            <li> Sorry to say they lost a customer from this.  </li>
            <li> They are sort of expensive</li>
            <li> I am SO sad.  </li>
            <li> I have been suffering from a horrible, itchy rash on my chest, which has now spread to my neck and now I have a swollen left eye!!!  </li>
            <li> There has GOT to be a product out there that indeed will help us with massive hair shedding...without the nasty side effects!</li>
            <li> (can&#x27;t find to update) because I was concerned it was a fake product; shipped from Portugal and info in Portuguese.</li>
            <li> With the exception of this unfortunate side effect I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> They were seriously expensive and what I was told that they would not damage my hair,</li>
            <li> and I ran out and bought it (painfully expensive)</li>
            <li> The really troubled spots (sides &amp; crown) aren&#x27;t filling in yet,</li>
            <li> It was totally useless to me..</li>
            <li> tastes horrible and my hair fall continued despite regular use with no improvement I can sense..</li>
            <li> and it won&#x27;t grow sadly,</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about using Vivascal</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda expensive.</li>
            <li> I was so unhappy because my hair was not growing and so thin.  </li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> However, once I received it, I found that it contained fish oil/ingredients &amp; I am allergic to fish &amp; was unable to consume products.</li>
            <li> Expensive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so bummed because 9 months of this product has been expensive</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to get it chopped off, but unfortunately their was nothing else to do.</li>
            <li> But really expensive.</li>
            <li> I was  skeptical this would work.  </li>
            <li> Sorry baldies.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Too expensive.  </li>
            <li> I tried it for a month, but was unable to find it again</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I couldn&#x27;t use this product as it caused me to have an upset stomach..</li>
            <li> I would have continued to take it as a maintenance plan, but it got tedious to remember to take the pills, so I stopped purchasing the product.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product was a costly mistake for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is NOT an overnight process, and it&#x27;s unrealistic to think that it would be.</li>
            <li> well, they are wrong.  </li>
            <li> But around 2 years ago, my hair was thinned to a scary point.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get what I call kamikaze hair anymore, hair which just falls off randomly during the day and tickles your arms and get stuck on your clothes.</li>
            <li> So I am hoping that it helps my thin hair!</li>
            <li> The time between fill-ins has dramatically decreased!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it seems like this product doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> it can be expensive so try to look for coupons or deals that they might offer</li>
            <li> The taste is weird</li>
            <li> Extremely expensive though.</li>
            <li> like false lashes!</li>
            <li> so I am very tough on my hair also.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very frustrating.  </li>
            <li> I had very thin hair that fell out and broke off.</li>
            <li> It was very thin, patchy and had no texture.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thin</li>
            <li> i have very thin hair</li>
            <li> I can say just wasting money and time to use this, I hate it no more product of Viviscal</li>
            <li> oh yes, I can&#x27;t forget to mention all the horrible cystic acne I developed that has left horrible scars:-(</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I had received a bad product, or if I just had a really bad reaction to it.</li>
            <li> Very sad since I miss my longer hair, but I&#x27;ll just have to wait painfully for it to grow slowly.........</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m skeptical of products, however I came across this in my desperate search to help my hair grow.</li>
            <li> I was taking it for a few weeks when I started to break out on my face very badly.</li>
            <li> very disappointed as the product is not cheap.</li>
            <li> My hair falls out at a crazy rate.</li>
            <li> I will stay on this supplement, no doubt (actually afraid to come off).</li>
            <li> I also take Evening Primrose Oil twice per day, and the combo of the two makes my nails grow like crazy, also.</li>
            <li> Like hair growing like crazy.</li>
            <li> My hair is still shedding like crazy.</li>
            <li> and i had to cut it and was extremely unhappy...</li>
            <li> My nails grow like crazy too.</li>
            <li> My hair is growing like crazy.  </li>
            <li> I started using viviscal in February, I was desperate after losing lots of hair after giving birth.</li>
            <li> Just knowing that there isn&#x27;t crazy amounts of hair bailing from my head</li>
            <li> After trying it once, I found it too inconvenient and didn&#x27;t stick with it.  </li>
            <li> I started the supplements February 10th and in one month my hair has grown like crazy</li>
            <li> and I started shedding like crazy and</li>
            <li> I have had crazy pimple breakouts.</li>
            <li> Maybe this works for some people, maybe some people just desperately want to believe its working but for me it did nothing.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s made any noticeable difference, much to my disappointment.  </li>
            <li> Then my hair started shedding like crazy.</li>
            <li> My sister thinks I&#x27;m crazy</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any crazy hair growth</li>
            <li> The biotin in this made me break out like crazy, I had to stop taking it before I could see any hair growth effects</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I was desperate after losing lots of hair during/after pregnancy.</li>
            <li> My hair started unexplainingly falling out like crazy in the shower.</li>
            <li> Sodium Carboxymethyl Cellulose, Glycerol, Artificial Orange Flavoring, Modified Starch, Contains Fish Ingredient (Shark)...</li>
            <li> I am equally appalled by the co&#x27;s efforts to hide the fact the &#x27;secret ingred.&#x27;</li>
            <li> I hate false advertising.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It cannot make me to not think about if it is a fake product?!</li>
            <li> And It&#x27;s expensive to try it too!</li>
            <li> It is a bit expensive!</li>
            <li> I am so so so sad why would they change the packing n formula!</li>
            <li> Absolutely useless!  </li>
            <li> Somewhat difficult to do for me!</li>
            <li> I was also skeptical about this product, but it works!  </li>
            <li> Sad. :(</li>
            <li> I hope this batch isn&#x27;t fake!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very expensive</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just annoying taking it 2x a day and pill has a weird taste.</li>
            <li> I was VERY SKEPTICAL to try this because I read some reviews about it</li>
            <li> trying to grow my hair out seems like mission impossible.  </li>
            <li> Which is impossible.</li>
            <li> (almost afraid I&#x27;ll grow crazy nail claws like Lady Deathstrike!)</li>
            <li> Even though i have no known allergies to shell fish (and I eat alot of it), after taking 10 pills of this product i have headaches, pimples in my forehead, sinus issues and bad sleep.</li>
            <li> Like others my hair does seem to be greasier, but not in a bad way.</li>
            <li> Just began this program on January 1st , my hair was thinning really bad -</li>
            <li> No stomach upset or bad reactions.</li>
            <li> i went through a bad period with my hair (hormonal) and</li>
            <li> I tried this for about 2 months and didnt do nothing but give me some headaches, bad acne and oily hair.</li>
            <li> They do not have any bad taste to them either.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s too bad because I was hoping this would help in hair growth.</li>
            <li> These vitamins have changed their formula as they make me break out in bad acne ..</li>
            <li> I thought if this at all happened to me, it would not be that bad and breakout i could manage.  </li>
            <li> BAD IDEA.</li>
            <li> I am 36 and have bad hormonal acne....</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t cause pimples or a bad after taste, just put a dent in my wallet.</li>
            <li> Not too bad ...</li>
            <li> but I guess I have a bad case of hair greed.</li>
            <li> The headache persisted... it felt as though I had a really bad hang over.</li>
            <li> I was terribly frustrated but</li>
            <li> After trying Rogaine and not getting anywhere except frustrated.</li>
            <li> This makes me so frustrated.  </li>
            <li> Took one tablet and got sick to my stomach.</li>
            <li> After taking Viviscal for 3 weeks, and using the elimination method to find out what was making me sick, I realized it was Viviscal.</li>
            <li> Made me have to go to the bathroom all the time made me so sick to my stomach</li>
            <li> Then it started making me nauseous and sick.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve problems with skin-got bad acne on my forehead:(</li>
            <li> how disappointing!</li>
            <li> i didnt take the pills yet but also missed my return date :(</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after taking Viviscal for 2 weeks I broke out in a miserable rash around my neck and then on my chest.  </li>
            <li> n then to use the up :(</li>
            <li> :-(  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed and went ahead and cancelled my subscription.</li>
            <li> promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I hate that the pills are blister-packed.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this for a little less than 2 months. I haven&#x27;t noticed results on my hair yet but you&#x27;re not supposed to at this point. I have noticed though that my eyelashes are longer. I normally have very short lashes. Also, my nails are growing a lot faster. I have to shave my legs twice as much which is annoying but still a good sign. I&#x27;ll update in a couple months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 30 days now and I see my hair is getting Thicker and stronger. great product.</li>
            <li> So far, I do like these hair vitamins.  This is my 2nd or third order.  I will order again.</li>
            <li> This actually works for the nails and hair, but you have to be patient.  5 months&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dermatologist had recommended them.</li>
            <li> These actually work. I tried them for the 1st time two years ago when I was trying to get my hair to grow faster. Using these plus the F.A.S.T. brand shampoo everyday worked to get my hair to grow faster but I also noticed I was sprouting new growth and my hair started to get thicker at the roots. I took them for 6 months everyday and then stopped taking them because my hair was the length I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;Today, I take them because due to stress, my hair is starting to thin and fall out much more than normal. I take these pills &amp; biotin supplements daily plus use Phyto Phytocyane on my scalp weekly. I know the Viviscal will work since it worked for me before.</li>
            <li> I used this for a year and I really saw no difference. It&#x27;s also quite expensive too. A bit disappointed!!</li>
            <li> Yes, it is tempting - we all want that luxurious, sexy hair. But if you research into the state of the world&#x27;s sharks, you might not want to  use this product. I, for one, cannot do it.    I am equally appalled by the co&#x27;s efforts to hide the fact the &#x27;secret ingred.&#x27; is sharks - this from their website:  &#x27;AminoMar®: The groundbreaking, clinically proven marine complex available exclusively in Viviscal supplements. Derived from key marine protein molecules...while never telling you what this is.    They tout how natural the products are, while hiding the fact that AminoMar is shark cartilage.  ok, you can decide for youself.</li>
            <li> This stuff does work magic.  I just wish it was cheaper.  I used it for quite a while, until I discovered Hairfinity, which works better and is cheaper.</li>
            <li> I was losing my hair by the handful and started taking this product and now I lose about 20 hairs a day! It really works!</li>
            <li> Great product. I saw results quickly.</li>
            <li> Viviscal is amazing!!!! Highly, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I think I saw a small change in my hair growth over a 3 month time span. Although; I do know that some women say they could not tell if it worked and some say it did not. One thing I know for sure is that prenatal vitamins are the much cheaper and from what i see much better way to go. I&#x27;m 30 years old and have been trying everything to get my hair to get thicker and longer, my hair stylist said that because of my age, how long my hair had been at that length for, and because of it not all that healthy it would not get any longer. So I was looking at my pictures of when I was pregnant with my son and shortly after then noticed that my hair was so beautiful, long thick, shinny and healthy. But what happened i wondered. I found out through word of mouth that it was the prenatal vitamins that had been doing that. So I bought high rated bottle of the vitamins for under $20 and it was 180 count one pill a day. Five months later, my hair has gotten 5 inches longer, so much healthier and thicker, not to mention my eyelashes look so awesome my skin, and nails too. Plus, I&#x27;m sure the health benefits are even better for you too. Even if this product dose work for you and you like or even love it, save you money and get prenatal.</li>
            <li> It works!!!!  I went from frantically buying everything out there to near-forgetting I have a hair thinning problem.  Though, listen people:  It takes a few months to really see effect.  This is a supplement therefore it literally starts at the root.  I have to giggle at people who complain that their hair does not feel thicker, etc within the first few weeks.  Think about how hair growth works...this isn&#x27;t topical.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any difference</li>
            <li> Been taking it for nearly two months and haven&#x27;t seen results</li>
            <li> I have been takkng Viviscal since December, decided I would go the 6 months just to see if it helped grow my hair, i was very skeptical,  first two mo I didnt see any difference.  4th month visible difference.  Cant wait for 6 months in to see how much hair I get back</li>
            <li> Have used this product for 6 - 8 months and I can see the difference in my hair &amp; my hair dresser is seeing the difference also</li>
            <li> 2nd time in a row and I&#x27;m shedding terribly once I started with the pills, anyone knows how viviscal can cause this? the same was at the 1st time and then I thought it might not be related , but now it happens again !!</li>
            <li> I swear this is making my hair thicker.  This product was recommended by my dermatologist when I expressed concern that I was losing more hair than normal.  At my last hair appointment, my stylist commented on how quickly my hair is growing - she estimated nine weeks of growth when it had only been six weeks since my last highlights appointment.  It probably took about 30 days before I noticed a change but I am going to keep taking this product.</li>
            <li> Nothing better but use it regularly layer and throw all your other stuff out so you won&#x27;t be tempted to use garbage anymore, this is the real deal baby!</li>
            <li> Even though i have no known allergies to shell fish (and I eat alot of it), after taking 10 pills of this product i have headaches, pimples in my forehead, sinus issues and bad sleep. Unfortunate I don&#x27;t think i am allowed to return an open product with amazon for the reasons mentioned above, this is why 2-stars because when something does not work as expected I should be able to get it returned. I am writing this so if you decide to try this product don&#x27;t buy more than one box (expensive) at a time! so at least you can try first before stocking up for the minimum 6 months they claim to see results.</li>
            <li> You have to be 18 to use this product!! I didn&#x27;t know and had it delivered and then found out</li>
            <li> So I am a 24 y/o female who has had thinning hair since I was 16. I&#x27;ve had blood work done and my thyroid checked and the ONLY thing wrong with me was I&#x27;ve been so vitamin d deficient for the past 6 years. I didn&#x27;t really like the idea of taking vitamins so I didn&#x27;t and little by little I noticed that my hair had gotten so thin that my hairline was receding and all throughout my I can see my scalp. I&#x27;ve lost over half of my hair. By the way, there&#x27;s nothing like being told you&#x27;re too young to lose your hair, because then you think you&#x27;re being paranoid. I was losing hair by clump and shedding so much. KEEP READING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been on this for 3 days as of today(KEEP READING), you may be thinking that isn&#x27;t enough time to review it but I need to tell you that I will keep buying this. You have to take it with other vitamins though and nothing is overnight amazing BUT I am taking vitamin d 5000 iu, Biotin 10,000 mcg&#x27;s, and a daily multi vitamin. My hairline is filling back in, little baby hairs is better than tiny little invisible blond hairs where my dark hair was, my hair is really dark so I know if something is working. I&#x27;m taking pictures of my progress and so far I can tell you that if you can change your diet and take vitamins this will work for you. But you have to keep up with vitamins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely ecstatic that I&#x27;m getting my hair back, knowing that you are losing your hair a horrible feeling, but I&#x27;ve also stopped shedding. I can take my hair tie out of my hair and I don&#x27;t have a huge clump of hair with it. This has changed my future. Please be safe when taking anything and following the directions but you will need to take this in conjunction with other things. Good luck!! :)</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much improvement yet, but I was worried about having an allergic reaction and so far so good. My Dermatologist recommended this for my toe nails, but I would love thicker hair! Hopefully this will do both.</li>
            <li> love these! my fine curly hair is much more manageable, thicker, and shiny, a great investment for your hair skin and nails!</li>
            <li> I read all the great reviews even the reviews where ppl complained about it causing acne but I still wanted to give it a try in hopes that I was exempt. My cousin has been using it for months and her hair has gotten extremely thick. While she was using it I was on my 3rd bottle of hairfinity and I was not noticing any change. I was going to continue but my sister was already on her 6th bottle of hairfinity and said she experienced no hair growth, just nails and lashes. So with that in mind I switched on over to viviscal. Well I purchased a 1 month supply and within my 3rd week my bald spots on my edges were filled in it was unreal!!! When I was on my last two rows my skin began to break out heavily! I had cystic acne bumps popping up everywhere and my skin color became uneven. I had very bad acne years ago and havent had a break out in 3years because of my day and night acne regiment so having to deal with this kind of breakouts was a nightmare. I had to stop taking the pills and within a month my skin started to look clear and normal again... I was so bummed cause it does make your hair grow. I mentioned to my cousin how I had to stop and she said she did have breakouts but it went away as she kept taking it but she doesn&#x27;t have acne prone skin, so I guess it all depends. I&#x27;m now taking Toji which has a few but perfect reviews and so far im impressed.</li>
            <li> I have tried every hair regrowth product under the sun from shampoos to prescription spironolactone and had not seen any results. I started using Viviscal at the end of February-Since I have started my hair has grown at least 4 inches! My nails have always been very thin and brittle, now they are growing long and beautiful. As far as regrowth, I check my hair every other week and I see small hairs growing from my roots (which weren&#x27;t there before). I have been struggling with hair loss for the past 2 years now and I am only 23 years old so it has been a major headache and has impacted my confidence greatly. I have had every test done and all of my labs come back fine.. Since taking Viviscal and noticing regrowth I am slowly but surely regaining my confidence. I will continue taking this product for as long as the manufacture it! I have had no side effects what so ever and it being an all natural pill is a big plus for me! It does take some time so keep with taking 2 pills everyday even if you don&#x27;t see any changes, it will come! Every time I purchase this product it is at my door within 3 days! Hopefully with Viviscal my hair will be as thick as I was one day!</li>
            <li> Hair looks thicker within 2 months....</li>
            <li> I started using it and is seems like it may be working. cant wait to get my next pack thank you</li>
            <li> I have been using for 2 months. .it was recommended to me by my very expensive newport beach ca hair stylist who says she recommends it to all her clients with astounding success. .she is unbiased and does not sell the product so I can trust her. For me it WORKED and thickened my hair in about 6 weeks ..I have thicker hair than I had in my teens and I am 42 now. My hair is thick, supple, and pretty much gorgeous ..i have always had thin brittle hair so this is astounding to me!! The only downside is I agree with other reviews that it makes your hair more oily..so you literally have to shampoo daily..other than that I am a total convert..works better than anything I have EVER tried.</li>
            <li> Item arrived new just as described, but it has not stopped my hair shedding in over 8 months of using this product.</li>
            <li> -african american female&lt;br /&gt;-corse texture (hair thinning with age)&lt;br /&gt;-before viviscal, hair would only grow to my shoulders&lt;br /&gt;-after viviscal, hair has grown below my shoulders&lt;br /&gt;-taking the tablets for 6months&lt;br /&gt;-only take 1 pill per day&lt;br /&gt;****does NOT make hair THICKER, just longer*****</li>
            <li> No improvement at all in hair.  Going on three months now and about $150.  Save your money.  Like some said....if this was the miracle hair growth product, everyone would have heard of it by now.</li>
            <li> working great and I see new growth at the base of my neck.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t take long to show results. I have very thick hair, but in the front, it became a bit thin as a result of autoimmune (lupus) disorder. I began taking product late November, and by early January, my hair resumed its normal thickness. The only negatives are the cost per tablet, as well as the fact that it is hard on the GI tract. So, I recommend taking it with a meal, not a glass of milk and not before bedtime, but with dinner. Viviscal does not disappoint!</li>
            <li> I just bought these tabs about a month ago and I&#x27;m so pleasantly surprised that I have to write a review. First of all i&#x27;m 27 and my hair loss started when i was just a teen. It was progressively thinning on top and I was told to try bcps to \\&quot;balance my hormones\\&quot;. I was on them for years and I continued to slowly thin until I stopped and got pregnant. After the birth, my hair fell out in handfulls!! 3 yrs later  I now have about 1/3 of my hair left, and it is very fine, wispy, and totally different from before. I have tried EVERYTHING. Rogaine, BCPs, every supplement imaginable, iron, diet changes, protein shakes, hanging upside down (don&#x27;t judge, i&#x27;m desperate! lol) nothing has worked. My latest experiment was progesterone cream which i started 3 months ago. Initially my hair loss got worse and frizzy and wiry. I decided to try viviscal and hello! my hair loss has finally slowed down. (and my nails look amazing! I can hardly type cuz they&#x27;re so long) I went from finding 40+ hairs in the drain to 4 or 5. I&#x27;m sweeping up less hair and there is hardly any when I run my fingers through my hair. My biggest issue is hair GROWTH though because my scalp is highly visible. I haven&#x27;t noticed any yet, but I will definitely come back if I do later on. The only thing that sucks is the price! But if it keeps working then i&#x27;ll probably start selling all my worldly posessions online before I stop using it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 6 weeks  which isn&#x27;t long enough to fairly evaluate.The packaging states 4-6months.So far my hair seems fuller, but it may be due to other things I&#x27;m doing,shampoo,conditioner,styling products.I will know more in a few months.</li>
            <li> I love it, my hair is definitely growing much faster! I didnt have hairloss but I want long hair down to my waist and this product is working, I will order more</li>
            <li> I have not noticed much hair growth yet but I have only been using it for 2 month&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> OK, first I have to say I have RARELY take time to write reviews of anything.  But I read everyone else&#x27;s to help make my decisions in most purchases I make online. So, here goes.  I have tried literally at least 20 different products to grow my hair.  When I was younger (30ish), I was able to grow my hair past my shoulders down to about my bra-line.  After several very stressful years, and being mid-forties, I was unable to grow my hair AT ALL.  I went on a quest to grow it back out to it&#x27;s previous length.  I have fine, thin hair.  I color it, and use heat tools every day - so I am very tough on my hair also.  I tried shampoos, expensive vitamins ($100 range), products, sleeping in braids and conditioner, you name it, I did it.  So, I read about these vitamins in some magazine, or something.  Given the amount of money I had spent previously, this didn&#x27;t seem too expensive.  Well, I am currently ordering my fourth month of these vitamins, and I can say without a doubt they work.  I read negative reviews as well as others here, and was very skeptical.  I mean I had tried everything!  So, I really didn&#x27;t think the Viviscal would work.  After 3 months, my hair stylist said she did think my hair had grown (after previously asking if I had the kind of hair that never really grew!).  I know my hair has grown at least 2 inches, and it feels thicker and fuller.  I don&#x27;t know how this could be, since the ends of my hair are old hair, not new.  Anyway......  TRY THIS PRODUCT FOR THREE MONTHS!  It works, and you will be so happy you did!  I once again have \\&quot;good hair days\\&quot; at lot, and I like my hair for the first time in a long time!!</li>
            <li> It is really too soon to determine if the product is doing what it has claimed to do and I need to use it another several months before I can make an accurate evaluation. However, I do think it may be helping and I am hopeful.</li>
            <li> My thinning hair is thicker and shinier than ever before!</li>
            <li> I bought this product after researching it for a couple of weeks.  I had cut my hair off into a pixie after years of damage so I could start fresh.  But I desperately want my long hair back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first month I noticed my hair was starting to get really shiny and smooth.  I flat iron my hair everyday since it is so poofy and it was almost if my hair had become immune to the negative side effects of heat styling. Then after about a month and a half I noticed my eyelashes started getting really dark and full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right now I am two and a half months into this stuff and I have noticed an increase in my hair growth, maybe about 1/2 to 3/4 an inch in a month?  Which is fantastic! My nails are growing so quick I have to cut them all the way down once a week (i hate long nails). And I also have not noticed any increase in the hair on my arms or legs which is a plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the only reason I gave it 4 and not 5 stars is because it has made me break out.  And I don&#x27;t mean like one tiny zit on my chin.  I have a pretty bad area all on the right side of my chin and neck.  My skin was always really clear before so this is definitely a bummer.  Doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;ll stop taking it, maybe for a day or two so I can get this cleared up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in a nut shell...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives:&lt;br /&gt;- increased the quality of my hair&lt;br /&gt;- made my eyelashes fuller and darker&lt;br /&gt;- increased nail growth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;- made me break out</li>
            <li> I saw this product on the Dr Oz show.  I&#x27;m giving it a try because my hair seemed to be breaking off or coming out.&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve been using it ....the condition seems to be getting better.  This is my 3rd month and they said it could take&lt;br /&gt;6 months to see results.  I think I have seen improvement already.  My eyelashs...are great!!!!!</li>
            <li> What a pleasant surprise my hair is actually growing. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 5 months and have not experience any problems, the best thing about Viviscal is that it is a  natural product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 4 months and am satisfied with the results so far. After dealing with an auto-immune condition for 6 months my hair began falling out excessively so I decided to try this product based on other positive reviews. Within the first week, my hair loss significantly decreased. Within a month, my hair felt noticeably thicker. My hair dresser also commented on the condition of my hair feeling fuller and stronger. As a bonus, my eyebrows and eyelashes also grew fuller!</li>
            <li> I have been taking Viviscal for 2 months(almost everyday but not as directed, twice a day) I am already seeing hair regrowth. Give it a fighting chance before you give up. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I attached a picture of my new hair growth! My hair is super long and this is the area I was losing it in. It&#x27;s growing back!!</li>
            <li> I liked this product and think it helped while I was anemic. My hair gradually got healthier and I would use it again if needed.</li>
            <li> Too early to tell.  Have only been using for three weeks.  I am hopeful.</li>
            <li> Took one tablet and got sick to my stomach. Tried again with food, same problem. Not sure what is in these tablets but may not be all natural.</li>
            <li> Love these wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive but worth it</li>
            <li> No noticeable difference</li>
            <li> This product works very well.My hair is stronger and I have less breakage.This is my second box,you take two little pills aday.So one order is for one month.I buy alot of pills and things for my hair growth.This is worth the price for me.</li>
            <li> I love it. Hair really grows faster. I like to take it with keratine hair volumizer. So i took 1 pill in the morning  of viviscal and 1 pill of keratine in the evening.  They help me to stop hair lost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure but it&#x27;s not breaking my hair off like it&#x27;s shampoo or the moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now just taking this and omega XL washing with horse 🐴 tail  shampoo and conditioner. (I&#x27;m  loving 😍 my hair and growth.</li>
            <li> I love the vitamins and notice how much more strong and healthy my hair is since I&#x27;ve started using it.  Worth the money!</li>
            <li> Not sure I see any results at all</li>
            <li> The quality of this product is so high that even its competitors praise it.</li>
            <li> Expensive but works. I have super fine, thin hair and I have noticed that my hair is growing faster and it feels fuller.  I have noticed hair regrowth along the temples where my hair was extremely thin. I have been using Viviscal for 2 months now (2 tablets/day) and plan on continuing. Amazon has the best price for this product hands down!</li>
            <li> So far no effect.  I&#x27;ll keep using it and hope.  Used only two months so far.  What is the deal with so many words??</li>
            <li> No doubt this is the very best of hair stimulation growth. It really works. After the third month your hairline is restored. Great for women over 50, like me.🙌</li>
            <li> Got product fast. Does it work....i think so but I need to use again to tell.</li>
            <li> After 60 tablets, I already see a difference in the speed in which my hair is growing. Sadly, I have to shave my legs way more frequent now too. But it&#x27;s a minor price to pay I think :) no biggie.</li>
            <li> Update as of March 10th: I was doing very well taking these regularly for a while. Though they didn&#x27;t help my nails, my hair became very full and in fact a bit unruly from the fullness. My stylist commented on the change in the quality of my hair. And it was very amenable to styling. When I became inconsistent with taking them in about month 3 and 4 the effect was quickly lost. I&#x27;m taking them again regularly and hope to regain that benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product for the first time a month ago. I saw that other people were providing continual feedback as they continue to take Viviscal, so I thought I would too. I am late 30&#x27;s African-American female with chemically relaxed medium length hair. Overall I have healthy hair. I get it trimmed and touched-up regularly every 8-9 weeks and have a good hair care regimen and good diet. I have extremely thin nails that become transparent when they get wet, they peel and split very easily. I started taking Viviscal to grow my hair longer and hope for a positive effect on my nails as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been taking it regularly for one month. Some people said they experienced changes at one month. I haven&#x27;t seen much difference. My nails seem slightly stronger, but definitely still peeling and splitting. I will continue to take as directed and provide another update at 3 months. I did experience some stomach upset for over a week. I can&#x27;t be sure if it was tied to the pills, but it did subside.</li>
            <li> I have a blond hair, a bit over processed and fairly thin. So, when I read about this product on Vogue, I thought to give it a try. About 4 weeks after I started using it (I only take 1 pill a day rather than 2) I started noticing a fuller and thicker hair. Haven&#x27;t noticed faster growth yet but def. more voluminous hair.  However, I also started breaking out at the same time. Pimples popping out on my cheeks like in my teens. Not sure if it&#x27;s an inconvenient side effect of this product or just a phase, more like a skin cleaning that pushes the impurities inside out. So, works for my hair, not so nice on my skin. Maybe someone who is not prone to pimples in the first place just gets the lustrous hair without any ugly side effects.</li>
            <li> So far so good! I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 months and I have noticed a decrease in hair loss and quicker growth in my relaxed African-American hair. Also, my edges were thinning and they have been filling in. I will continue to take two pills a day as recommended through the 6 months, after that I&#x27;ll go to 1 pill a day. My only complaint is that the pills are a little costly.  Just an update- I&#x27;ve been using this for 9-10 months and I really think that it has helped thicken and lengthen not only my hair but also my nails. After 6 months I stopped taking 2 pills a day and now I only take 1. Viviscal is definitely not a scam or \\&quot;placebo effect\\&quot; because my hair, skin and nails have returned to what they where I was in my mid 30&#x27;s. After the birth of my child and then turning 40 several years later, my hormones changed leaving my hair, skin and nails less than desirable. I wasn&#x27;t looking for a miracle product (because this isn&#x27;t it) but something that would help jumpstart my body. I think that this is a good supplement.</li>
            <li> Love the results I got after just a month but not a fan of the taste of the pills or the way they make my stomach feel. All in the name of beautiful hair I guess!</li>
            <li> My hair falls out at a crazy rate. My home is full of my hair, each time I clean I find more hair on the floor..After using 60 tablets this has stopped. One question: Do we have to keep using this in order to stop hair loss..If it is the case, it is not good..I would not use a tablet like this forever. I plan to use another month and then see..</li>
            <li> I have been in Viviscal for seven months, my hair has stopped falling out, breaking; it now has a very nice texture.</li>
            <li> I have had no side effects.  I have been susing this product as well as rogaine for women as recommended by by Dermatologist. My hair is growing back.  I still have thin hair but now has new growth at my temples so I can wear my hair back without feeling self conscious of my former balding spots.  Have to use it twice a daily.  I take with my morning vitamins/medication so I do not forget.  It is a very good product.</li>
            <li> I tried this for at least four months. I don&#x27;t have anything negative to report but it didn&#x27;t stop my hair from shedding at all. I do think it helps with growth. So if you&#x27;re looking for a product to promote growth, you should give it a try. If you&#x27;re looking to stop fall out and shedding, I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great product, helps grows hair about two inches.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for three months now and haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference in terms of growth. I think my hair is a little bit stronger but it isn&#x27;t growing any faster. That was my primary reason for purchasing the item!</li>
            <li> I have been taking this product for about a month and an half and I must say it has been working. After a bad color job that left my relaxed hair dry, brittle, and shedding all the time, I needed something that would help with this problem. I haven&#x27;t experience the whole eyelash growth some people have been commenting about, but i have notice a huge improvement on my nails which is really nice. I have also noticed the new hairs that been growing around my temple which is also really great. I would have to come back and comment on this product again after the minuium 3 mths required for this product.</li>
            <li> After thyroid removal hair started to fall out, dry skin. Seems like these issues are much better. I am thinking my hair and nails look a good bit better.</li>
            <li> I take only one a day, and after three months I began to see new hair around the crown of my head.  My hair was fine before, but was becoming a bit dry from lightening it some.  The new baby hairs that grew further down on my forehead make me look lots better.  I think it may have helped improve the quality of my hair as well, but I can&#x27;t be sure.  Two months ago I went to a new hair stylist who dyed my hair darker, and I must say it was instantly healthier after that.  So the softness may be the new hair dye.  I also have a bit faster hair growth on my eyebrows.  It hasn&#x27;t made much difference in fingernails as far as I can see.    On the minus side, these are not only a bit expensive for vitamins, but they seem kind of scammy.  Much of the information about them comes in the form of testimonials--- usually a sign of pseudoscience and snake oils, I think.  Maybe they are marginally helpful in a way that makes a big difference for me (I love having a bit more hair around my scalp), but should cost less for that.</li>
            <li> Have not taken long enough to results, but hope it helps.</li>
            <li> I took the viviscal pills faithfully for 2 months.  It is BS to take them for 6 months before you see results.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  I am 63 years old, post-menopausal with thinning hair.  What saved me was fish oil believe it or not.  I started to take salmon oil capsules, 1000 millgrams twice a day in addition to fish oil pills and wow, I now see a difference.  My hair is growing really fast and I don&#x27;t have nearly as much falling out.  The secret, as simple as this sounds is fat and oils if you want hair that grows fast and stops thinning. In fact, I had a friend who went on a diet cutting out fat completely for a year and she lost her hair.  Fat and oils gals.   The Viviscal is a scam.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really say this if conditioner or shampoo have made any real difference because I&#x27;m honestly only subscribing to all 3 Vivscal products because it&#x27;s recommended that these products be used in conjunction with the oral supplements because work best when used together. As far as the supplements are concerned, it&#x27;s too early to comment on their efficacy. I believe packet inserts states results may start showing after 3 months of consecutive use and I&#x27;m only 7 weeks into taking supplements. However I will state this much at this point, my hair does not fall out as much, but I can&#x27;t say I have a lot of knew growth. Remember this product only claims it aid in re growth of existing hair follicles, not to grow hair where there is already permanent baldness. Maybe in 3 to 6 months time a better assessment or commentary of Viviscal products will be appropriate.</li>
            <li> i saw this advertised in a magazine, and read some positve reviews so i ordered some, i never had any nose hair before in my life, but after taking a box of this stuff, i started seeing some rather thick nose hair sticking out from my nostril, well actually it&#x27;s a good thing because if this grows my nose hair it should grow my head hair also......it should not be an coinicidence even though i am 45 and people say when you get old, hair starts growing from places you don&#x27;t want, but it&#x27;s just too much of a coincidence don&#x27;t you think..... since then i have not kept up the regiment regularly but i am going to go back on this because it seems to work on my nose hair.....too bad the price has gone up to $37.xx from $30.xx when i first bought it last year</li>
            <li> I started taking Vivisical 2 months ago. I am African-American with pressed hair, that is fine. I have noticed longer hair that&#x27;s growing quickly. My eyelashes, eyebrows, and hair on my legs are also longer. I have had a lot of breakage from wearing weaves, and this seems to be helping fill in spots and it is almost back to my shoulder-length I had before over-doing it with the weaves. It is hard to tell if it&#x27;s thicker. I am going to continue taking it.</li>
            <li> I had no idea that my order would take the length of time that it is taking!  I am almost completely out and had to order a more expensive box from another vendor to supplement me until this order of four boxes of Viviscal is finally shipped.  I am most disappointed that this delay was not e-mailed to me so that I might find another vendor weeks ago!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my third month of trying Viviscal and I&#x27;ve seen some new hair along my hairline. I&#x27;m going to try it for 6 months to see if more areas of my forehead have improvement.</li>
            <li> Although I have not been using this product for the recommended 6 months yet, it does seem to be having a positive effect on my hair.  I will continue to use, and hopefully the results will continue to increase.  I am a small person so I am only taking 1 1/2 pills per day.</li>
            <li> If you are already on a regimen for healthy hair, meaning your diet is right, you exercise, and take your other vitamins and supplements, this product is the only hair vitamin you will ever need. You will see results, I only took them for 30 days and have seen noticable results.</li>
            <li> As a middle aged man with concerns for hair loss. I gave this product a try. It works very well, I was certainly impressed and actually reordered for another 6 month supply. The ingredients are very good, I did notice a difference in hair and nails. I had to stop taking viviscal due to the price.</li>
            <li> I heard about Viviscal through a third party endorsement - an article by a popular model listing products she likes, so that recommendation seemed worth taking. Like me, she has fine hair and said that these pills helped her have thicker hair. I had a section of hair near my temple that kept breaking off and would not grow for a year or so. It wasn&#x27;t that noticeable, but bothered me. I started Viviscal and stuck with it for the few months they suggest, despite the cost and annoyance of having to buy these expensive pills. But now it&#x27;s about six months later and the hair has grown in there and has not broken off again which I&#x27;m thrilled about. After several months, I also noticed small hairs at my part and first thought they were broken off hairs. I then realized it was new growth so that&#x27;s nice, too. My hair has grown quite long, but not sure if that&#x27;s due to Viviscal or just that I&#x27;ve kept it growing just to see what happens. Have not noticed the greasiness others mentioned. If you have a problem, I&#x27;d definitely recommend giving it a try. Worked for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking the pills for 2 months now.  My hair seems to be growing faster but it&#x27;s dryer than it was before. I was wondering if anyone out there has experienced dry hair after taking the pills for any length of time?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a month or a little longer. I started taking twice a day, but then cut back to just once a day. I noticed that my eye lashes are longer. And I have noticed slight hair growth around my hairline in the front. Not sure about overall fullness through out. I have to give it some more time. Like others my hair does seem to be greasier, but not in a bad way. My hair was drier before, so I do think Viviscal has been somewhat helpful. I will continue to use it for a while.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it worked.  It made me break out and it tastes horrible</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product.  But after years of stunted/slow hair growth and extensive loss I tried it and it works.  My hair began to grow within a few weeks of use and continues to grow at a more rapid pace than before.  This is my second order.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product is working for me,I&#x27;m now on my 2nd box. I&#x27;ve notice my hair get thicker, my hair was very fine an limp. I&#x27;ve notice growth also in the last 40dys maybe abt inch or so, mostly I&#x27;ve notice the thickness. The only down side is my hair on legs, arms, and ovr lip grows faster also, so now I&#x27;m shaving more. But, small price to pay to have my hair grow not only longer an thicker, but also looks an feels healthy. Less breakage also, I do want to add I&#x27;ve been fresh juicing and eatting healthy foods and taking multivitamins an herbs so I&#x27;m sure that is playng a role also.</li>
            <li> I have been taking this for about 5 months, although I only take 1 tab a day. I also supplement with a multi-vit, calcium,omegas and geletin caps. I do believe my hair is healthier (and my skin a bit more oily) and my nails have become stronger (although I do shellac every 2 weeks, so that helps) I am just wondering if anyone has a comparison to Nioxin vits? I am thinking of switching. I also dont want to OD on the multi&#x27;s, since Nioxin also has many of the same ingrediants as my multi (which is whole food based) any opionons would be great! I am 41, with baby fine hair, shoulder length, color/highlight every 2-3 months. I just would like it to grow and become thicker, do not have a problem with shedding. THANKS!!</li>
            <li> Love this product, hair growing longer, great buy. A little too expensive but worth the buy. Wll buy again. Try other products this one is the best so far.</li>
            <li> I have only used this for 6 days.  I can&#x27;t tell if anything is happening as of yet</li>
            <li> Made me break out in deep nodules of acne. Not worth the cost or trouble</li>
            <li> Love this product! This is one of my favorite products for growing your hair out quickly and healthy. I took this for four months (4 packages), taking 2 a day (one in the morning, one at night). This product is great and really helps hair grow faster. It&#x27;s very expensive but I do believe its worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money I wouldn&#x27;t recommend Viviscal. This product costs a lot of money per package and you do have to purchase many (a couple of months worth) to actually see results. Take Biotin if you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money.</li>
            <li> Have been taking this supplement for several months now and can definitely see an improvement! Slowly but surely :-) I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other products before and they were not as effective as this one. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I take the tablets each day, however I haven&#x27;t taken it long enough to see a difference.</li>
            <li> Due to lack of sunlight over the winter my hair doesn&#x27;t grow as much as it does during the spring/summer months in the Chicago area (lots of sunlight and being active outdoors). I&#x27;ve tried vitamin D supplements during the winter but it doesn&#x27;t trigger the growth I&#x27;m looking for.  Looking to lengthen and hopefully thicken my head of hair and read about this product over the past year and decided to try it after reading user reviews on various fashion blogs.  Read that noticeable growth and sometimes thickness doesn&#x27;t happen until the fourth month of use and the full effect will emerge after 6 months. I started supplements in November so will provide an update in May.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Month 4:  noticed the that hairline was filling out with silky,new growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Month 6/end of April 2012:  The average person experiences about 1/2 inch growth per month so for six months that would be 3 inches of length.  I asked my sister to gauge my hair length as compared to when I first started six months ago (she will flat iron it for special occasions)and she said it looked as if I had about 4 inches of new growth.  Was it worth the price for an extra inch of length - nawh.  My hairline is still filling out more and oddly enough I started growing a few silky hairs on my elbows, lol, so I just remove it 2x a month&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will finish out the last 2 boxes and just take one pill per day.  My hair grows quite a bit during the summer months so perhaps I&#x27;ll see a noticeable growth spurt and will post a comment in August 2012.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;February 2013&lt;br /&gt;I have been taking just 1 pill a day since April 2012 and my hair has definitely thickened around the hairline (baby hair) and is quite silky.  My length has definitely increased over the past 15 months of use, most noticeably since October (a result of lots of summer sunlight and Vitamin D exposure).  I plan to continue with 1 daily pill for the time being, not sure if I may return to 2 supplements a day yet.Yes, my elbow hair is still growing in and I continue to remove it - wish it were on my head, lol!</li>
            <li> My hair had been really damaged from wearing clip-in hair extensions, and I recently vowed to stop wearing them and grow my real hair back. I&#x27;d been taking Biotin supplements which had been helping my nails a lot, but I didn&#x27;t see any difference with my hair so I decided to try Viviscal. I&#x27;ve been using this system for only a month and I can really tell my hair has been growing faster...I get my hair highlighted every 6 weeks and I noticed my roots had grown in a lot more than usual this past time. Then I went to the hairdresser yesterday &amp; he commented on how it looked like my hair was finally getting some length!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abusing my hair with the over-use of clip-in extensions had caused a particular area of my head to feel pretty bare (as a result of the extensions rubbing against my scalp and breaking hair when I pulled them out), but the section of hair there has since began to feel thicker! My eyebrows have been looking a little thicker as well. FINALLY something that works!! I&#x27;m so excited to see what the next 2 months on this system will bring!!</li>
            <li> Maybe this product would have worked over time but it made my hair so unbelievably greasy and I broke out like a kid that just hit puberty.</li>
            <li> I had been on Topamax to treat migraine headaches for approx. 2 years.  I started to lose my hair and had to go off of it.  I started the Viviscal after reading the reviews.  I was on it for 5 months and there was absolutely no change. The reviews read that most noticed a change in there fingernails right away, so I figured that if I saw a change in my nails I would know that it was \\&quot;doing something\\&quot;.  After 5 months there was no change whatsoever in my nails.  They are just as soft and weak as ever, and I take 1200mg of calcium everyday.  I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This stuff REALLY works!</li>
            <li> Product arrived within ten days, half the rice of our local drug store.  To date, I am not sure if it is working, but I can&#x27;t say that it isn&#x27;t either!   Thank you!</li>
            <li> May not work for everyone but it is working for me by restoring  a spot where formerly there was broken hair and bald patches. 4 vs 5 cause product is expensive.</li>
            <li> I love this product !  I am 49 and I don&#x27;t have any gray hair. My hair is so thick people come up to me and ask can they feel it.  I will take this product forever.  You have to take it everyday. You will notice that your hair will not fall out, you will also notice your skin texture changing for the better.  I have zero winkles in my skin.  People tell me I look 32.  if you are around 40 start taking his now.  By the time you turn 50 you will see what I mean.  My skin doesn&#x27;t break out because I take one a day.  Wonderful Product.  One of the Beauty Secrets of the World.</li>
            <li> I hope this product would work for my thinning hair. I took it according to directions. I have noticed no improvement after four months. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I took these for over a year....they don&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> I m giving this product just 3 stars because I haven&#x27;t seen any results in the time I&#x27;ve had it. Can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s terrible but can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s effective either.  Everyone&#x27;s body is different so maybe it&#x27;s effect for me doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I have used many hair strengtheners in the past, pantogar, pilfood and priorin amongst others.  This is the most effective, it reduces hair loss, and helps grow the hair faster.  It also sees to have a great effect on my skin, could be the marine life that they use in the pill.</li>
            <li> Just began this program on January 1st , my hair was thinning really bad - Im also using it with a special shampoo ,you take&lt;br /&gt;Two tablets a day - one after breakfast and one after supper . You get a months supply- 60 tablets - and they are very easy to swallow .</li>
            <li> I have been using viviscal for years off and on, whenever I need my hair to grow quickly and it does work</li>
            <li> Outstanding product. 8 days after starting I have hundreds of tiny baby hairs sprouting in places I haven&#x27;t seen hair in years!  Receding hairline for a woman&#x3D; devastation. This stuff really works!!!</li>
            <li> This product seems to be just what I needed to help promote hair growth. There is a significant difference in my hair with lots of re-growth.</li>
            <li> after 1 month little change but will continue as directed to see improvement.</li>
            <li> I have been taking Viviscal for three weeks now.  It tastes extremely fishy - almost causes a gag reflex at times.  I am concerned about its mercury content, but cannot find any info. on that.  So far I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my hair loss.  I am willing to keep trying, though, as I understand it can take 6 months to work.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and prompt, professional shipping.  Thank you.  :)</li>
            <li> I was very hopeful when I read all of the great reviews here, but I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months now, and I see absolutely no change to my hair whatsoever.  It&#x27;s still falling out at the same rate, and there is no new hair growth.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent I have been using it for a month one and my hair is thicker stronger and longer. I have received so many compliments on my hair. Really worth the money.</li>
            <li> Of all the product I tryed in the past, this is the best for my hair after about two months of use I am seeing hair grow back in the top of my head. I am looking foward to continous hair growth.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t notice hair growth, but my nails are longer and stronger.</li>
            <li> 30 days in. I notice it is thicker but not sure about growth. Growing put a pixie so it&#x27;s hard to tell. But definitely thicker and worth buying again to get past this grow out stage.</li>
            <li> I had some thinning and receding around the front hair line.  Snce using this product the past 3 months, ordering a month&#x27;s supply at a time, I have noticed a thickening and filling in in the troubled areas.  Just recently reordered a 2-month supply since I&#x27;ve experienced a positive difference.  Depending on your hair problem, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical. Now I know this product is awsome! It works great and I am impressed. I got the best deal there is too!</li>
            <li> After becoming a vegetarian three years ago I suffered major hair loss-losing about 3 inches of hair because of a protein deficiency. I started incorporating fish and more healthy fats back into my diet to try and reverse the hair loss, but my hair would never get back to what it was. And because I had such terrible split ends I ended up having to cut more and more of it off which devastated me. For two years my once mermaid like hair would not grow past my shoulders. I have been using viviscal in combination with a biotin supplement for the past year and my hair FINALLY started growing again--about four inches!!! After just three months of using it even my hair stylist was shocked by how much stronger my hair was and now I am almost back to my old length! The only warning I have is that for me (I have very fine hair) if I take the supplement twice a day my roots tend to get greasy-but I figure that means the product is working and it&#x27;s nothing that dry shampoo can&#x27;t fix. I highly recommend Viviscal to anyone struggling to grow their hair!!</li>
            <li> After being on this product for 5 months my hairdresser this week told me there are new little hairs growing all over my head. I had seen them around the edge in the front but could obviously not see the rest of my head and I was happy to hear this. I am a 60 year old woman who is experiencing hair loss for who knows why. Could be age, could me menopause, could be stress. Just glad this is working. Actually felt like I would get a transplant but $30.00 a month is much better than that. Cannot guarantee it would work for anyone else but it did for me and grateful to have it. Also, it is not doing anything for my fingernails, but that is not why I purchased it.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does work. I used it for about 3 months and saw some new growth. However, it didn’t seem to really stop the loss or hair. I switched over to  [[ASIN:B00Q5KMX5O Mynoxidrin - Extra Strength Hair Nutrient Formula Nourishes and Strengthens Thinning Hair and Promotes Hair Growth!]] and the hair loss seemed to slow considerably compared to the Viviscal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that Viviscal works well for others, but I&#x27;ve been taking it for months and really haven&#x27;t noticed a difference between it and biotin or other hair-nail vitamins that cost a fraction of the price.  For the price, I&#x27;d like more extraordinary results.  Also (minor gripe) I hate that the pills are blister-packed.  I load up my vitamin organizer 2 weeks at a time &amp; it&#x27;s a pain pushing each pill out.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t mind if I were happier with the results!  But still the blister-pack seems like unnecessary packaging and I&#x27;d prefer a regular jar.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great.  I bought it for my wife, who has fine hair, and she now claims to have the hair of Venus.  I will not argue.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month, and I can&#x27;t really tell if it&#x27;s the Viviscal or the amazing natural products I have been using in my hair. But I must say, my hair looks and feels great, and it looks longer than what is was a couple of months ago.  The smell of the tablet is very fishy and taste a little weird, but as soon as the tablet is swallowed it&#x27;s not noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instruction state to take 2 tablets a day, I&#x27;ve been taking 1 and I think that it&#x27;s contributing nicely to my overall hair care regimen.</li>
            <li> this is my second week of using viviscal and i am excited to continue the course ... but why they increase the price !!!!!! i am out of US , i am from Saudi arabia and i have to pay the ship&#x27;s price which isn&#x27;t cheap at all and by this great raising i think i won&#x27;t continue it&#x27;s unfair really ....</li>
            <li> I brought this product the first time, and I feel it works.&lt;br /&gt;Then I brought the second time, however, the cover, size and taste of tablets are totally different than last time I brought.&lt;br /&gt;I contract with the seller, and I hear nothing from then back.&lt;br /&gt;It cannot make me to not think about if it is a fake product?!</li>
            <li> I have been taking Viviscal for about 30 days now and can&#x27;t say I notice any great  satisfying results.  I will finish my supply but won&#x27;t get a refill.</li>
            <li> Good vitamin, but takes time to see the difference. Wait unless 4 mouths. But worth! Be patient. Everyhting that means: HAIR LOST, you not gona see the result \\&quot;now\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> After 2 mos use daily, my hair&#x27;s still shedding like crazy. And It&#x27;s expensive to try it too! how disappointing!</li>
            <li> By far the best hair supplement that I have come across.  I took two pills a day for thirty days and will take a break for a few months or so, due to such an increase in the length.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference is in hair growth within a half of a month. I will continue to use it!!</li>
            <li> I bought this same brand of pills at ulta so i didnt want to spend $50 again on the pills so i check out amazon. i was supper happy when i got them for the price i got them they were too good to be true, but when i received the pills they looked completely different from the ones i purchased from ulta make up store. Any one else have this problem? i didnt take the pills yet but also missed my return date :(</li>
            <li> Does this help with hormonal hair loss? Due to PCOS and related hormonal imbalances...? Just curious because that is why I am taking it, to grow back the hair I&#x27;ve lost due to hormonal imbalances and if it&#x27;s not going to combat that then I don&#x27;t think I should waste the money. Does anyone know? Thanks! Been on it almost 3 months and see no difference.</li>
            <li> I had two small stress-related bald spots I wanted to regrow as quickly as possible.  I started taking the Viviscal tablets as directed religiously, and in conjunction with some other vitamins, worked like a charm.  It does not work overnight -- it took time, but now, about eight months after first discovering the two bald spots, they&#x27;re both completely grown over with hair, and my biggest problem is how to make my new growth blend in with the rest of my hair instead of sticking straight out the side of my head.  :)  A few tips: one, I started taking a stand-alone iron supplement and generally felt better.  I believe it also contributed to my relatively quick regrowth.  Two, be aware if you take Viviscal in conjunction with a biotin supplement, it may cause cystic acne.  Too much biotin may cause cystic acne, and once I flushed some excess biotin from my vitamin regimen, the cystic acne cleared up.  Three, you can buy generic Viviscal from CVS, usually at a substantial discount from the retail price of Viviscal.  Four, I believe religious use is key -- I never missed one pill.  That said, I&#x27;m a total believer, and now that my bald spots have cleared up, I continue to take the Viviscal because my hair and hairline have never looked better.</li>
            <li> I took Viviscal for a full month as directed and was encouraged to see a difference in the thickness of my eyelashes, feeling that soon my hair would start to show improvements. But alas, yesterday, I decided to abandon the regimen because - without doubt - this supplement caused me to gain at least 5lbs. I eat low-carb and for 18 months had maintained my target weight. In the month that I took Viviscal, my weight steadily increased, despite no change to my eating and exercising habits. I&#x27;m gutted! I gave the rest of my 6 month supply to my lovely 76 year old mother, who is trying to thicken her hair and gain some weight.</li>
            <li> only my first month taking the supplement haven&#x27;t  noticed  increased hair growth. this has made my skin break out horribly, usually clear skin not happy with the blister like pimples all over my arms back face and chest. thought they  might  go away after  my  body adjusted to the supplement but my skin still  hasn&#x27;t  cleared up. I do  not plan on buying it again</li>
            <li> Did  not  ser any  improvement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 49 and had very thick wavy hair. In the past 2 years I&#x27;ve lost at least 1/3 of it. I mentioned it to my GP, my OB/GYN as well as my hair dresser-- they all said it was hormones and heredity. I&#x27;ve tried several other products but no results. I saw Viviscal recommended on Tabatha Coffey&#x27;s FB page and decided to check it out. It works. The proof is what&#x27;s NOT all over the bathroom floor. I just ordered my 2nd box.</li>
            <li> Took 2 of these for five straight months and noticed NO DIFFERENCE whatsoever. Would not recommend. Expensive lesson learned</li>
            <li> My nails have improved somewhat so it must be doing something. I haven&#x27;t seen any difference in my hair yet. I hope I will and will continue to  take the tablets for 6 months.</li>
            <li> Worked out for me! Took a while for it to work but turned out great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these off and on since they were first released and still find them the best supplement to promote hair growth and to obtain a healthy head of hair. I use them in conjunction with Biotin. Finally, I buy the product from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how much growth I have since I already have plenty of hair, but I notice that I have new growth all around the hair line. That must mean there is more hair growth too in general</li>
            <li> my mother still use it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. Just biotin mostly. I already have that.</li>
            <li> Great product. My hair is so much thicker. Love it. It is growing faster but it could just be me.</li>
            <li> I could notice a little hair growth after about 2 weeks of taking them. They were hard to swallow and made my face break out pretty bad so I stopped taking them. It wasn&#x27;t worth it, to me.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing supplement!! I started taking the product because I wanted thicker and healthier hair. I have noticed that my edges are growing back in nicely, and I see moderate growth all over. I am about to start my third supply now, and I look forward to the end results after 6 months of use. It is a bit expensive! If the price were lower, I am almost certain more people would try it, and those of use who use it, would continue.</li>
            <li> I ordered these at 6 months postpartum because I lost a lot of hair after having my son. I am now nine months postpartum and I see a HUGE difference in the thickness of my hair and the texture! It&#x27;s like my hair is almost back to the way it was before I had my son! Truly works! It does take time so be patient but you will see results! Thank you Viviscal!</li>
            <li> After my son deployed to Afghanistan 14 months ago, I lost a TON of hair, all around my hairline. I&#x27;ve been stressed before, but never to this degree and never with this result. It was hideous and people were obviously looking at my bare scalp. My hair&#x27;s long and fine but with that loss, if I put it up in a ponytail there was clearly a bald ring around my head. So even more stress but granted, this was sheer vanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 9 months ago, I read a magazine article discussing hair loss, and a particular line from one of the hairdressers caught my eye: he said something about Viviscal, \\&quot;all the models take it\\&quot;. From there, I began researching possible solutions and again and again, the name Viviscal and the vitamin biotin came up. So I started taking both (5 mgs. of biotin/day), but didn&#x27;t hold out much hope. How often does something actually do what it says it will?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this DOES. 6 weeks into it unbelievably enough, I could detect super-fine hair growing where there had been none. And the loss was totally arrested. By now, I&#x27;ve got my long bangs back and the rest of the new hair is almost 5 inches long. And it&#x27;s all much thicker, to boot. This is one $33.00-for-two-months expense I will happily keep up! And, P.S.-my son made it safely home. God bless all of our troops!</li>
            <li> Effect can not be seen. The price is too expensive. I have some regret buying so expensive things. Anyway, I will buy the second time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost 2 months and am still waiting to see some positive results. I hope that after another month of using it as directed that I will see some results.  I think it is too early to rate this product so I just gave it 3 stars.  If anything, my hair seems to be finer.</li>
            <li> I saw this product recommended on the Dr. Oz show for thinning hair.  I&#x27;m in my 50s and started noticing that my hair (which is very fine) was not as full as it was.  I&#x27;m now on my second month and my hair feels stronger, fuller, and healthier.</li>
            <li> I am on my 4th week of taking viviscal and I feel like my hair is falling out so much more since I&#x27;ve started taking it! I&#x27;m hoping it will get better based on reviews but I&#x27;m so scared to lose all of my hair :</li>
            <li> I have taken these supplements for one year to the day! I suffered a kidney issue last year had surgeries and had lots of hair loss (lots of weight loss, as well). I also had quit my birth control at the time, and wow my hair was greatly damaged by all of the stress and hormonal shedding. It was coming out in clumps, and shedding for months. (I have had very fine hair all of my life, but had managed to style it and use volumizing products, so I&#x27;m used to having to spend money to maintain healthy looking hair). I am 30 years old, and dealing with hair loss is awful traumatizing (for any age). I needed something that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product grows hair!!! You must stay on it every month. It grows very slowly, however there is definitely new growth! The new hair growth I have now is about 3 to 4 inches long and it is all over my entire scalp. I can not wait for it to grow out longer so I can feel my hair come back to life. Patience is key. I still shed, but it is normal shedding. It is pricey, but worth it if you are in dire need like I am... I will stay on this supplement, no doubt (actually afraid to come off). I see a huge difference from the stressful event from a year ago, and it never hurts to have a positive attitude and healthy diet (that helps the hair grow too). Hope my input could help you make a decision!</li>
            <li> I took a gamble on this product...pretty skeptical, but anxious to try almost anything that would stop my hair from falling out.  I think mine is genetic, and maybe a little bit of low thyroid induced, but whatever the cause, so much of my hair was falling out that I hated to take a shower and watch the loose hairs just coat my fingers as I shampooed.     In my case, I have been using the product for almost five months.  I thought I saw a slight reduction in hair loss after about two or three months, but wasn&#x27;t certain.  At this point, I can honestly say that the hair loss has been sharply reduced--maybe one quarter of what it was initially.  I am still taking two tablets a day, and will continue to do so for the recommended time.  I haven&#x27;t noticed my hair growing in any quicker, but stopping the hair loss was my number one concern.</li>
            <li> This Is My Answer! I don&#x27;t understand the fake product reviews at all. My order was sealed and foil packaged by the manufacturer. It&#x27;s been almost a month and the hair fall is half or less. Wearing a jacket or sweater before was full of hair in the back. The pillow ughhhhh I didn&#x27;t want to look and the shower great soak for my feet and ankles! Not anymore. I&#x27;m so grateful I tried this and my seller made it affordable. I&#x27;m just a regular person who wants you know it works. I have never missed a dose because I take meds so it&#x27;s easy to remember. I get a slight fishy taste and I couldn&#x27;t care less. No stomach upset or bad reactions. I was terribly frustrated but with this I have really noticed a wonderful difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking the pills for about a month now, taking 1-2 pills a day.  I am an African American woman in her early 30&#x27;s with bald patches. I see NO new hair growing in any of the bald spots but the texture of my hair seems to be much softer and my skin seems to have a little glow to it. It might have grown some but I can not tell just yet. I am going to give this a try for about 3 months (Supposedly you must allow 6 months to see results.) I refuse to continue using a product that long w/o results.  I will post a review at the top of the year and give my final opinion.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using the product very long and they say you should use it for 6 months, with most people seeing results in two.  I just ordered my second months supply so I will keep you informed on my results.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product twice now, I really can not tell if its working. I guess it takes a few months to see results. I really want it to work!! Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> After trying a number of products unsuccessfully, I decided to try viviscal, my existing hair has grown longer, the breakage and shedding has stopped and there is new growth in the areas where there was little or no hair.</li>
            <li> the nieghbor loves it.</li>
            <li> Definitely works! Have been taking it for about 3 months and has seen my hair get thicker.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Did read a comment about horsetail and the liver and am going to check that out.</li>
            <li> I took it for a month, nothing, I bought 3 months and now as I used the last weeks of month 4, I can tell you I am going back for more. It&#x27;s making a difference on top of propecia and minoxinol. Will be interested to see what 3 more months does.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic! My dermatologist recommend it and it really works! My hair has really started to fill in!</li>
            <li> The box does not contain the mermaid in the background and I feel these are not the original tablets.Watch before you buy..!!</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any hair regrowth after taking it for 3 months but I am not sure as to what the exact cause of my hair loss is. I found that DHT blocking supplemnts, DHT blocking shampoos that also contain caffein work much better for me. Everyone&#x27;s hair loss is due to different causes and I am not saying that this product is not good or does not work at all - just that it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> give it 3 months then review it, its the best, I had many surgeries where they had to shave my head, and this was the only medication that helped regrowth</li>
            <li> I have only been taking this product for a month now, but it does seem to be helping a bit.  Still really too early to tell, but I&#x27;m going to give it a couple months.</li>
            <li> I had read really good reviews on this product, but unfortunately it made me so sick to my stomach I can&#x27;t take it.  I tried taking it several times and every time it made me completely sick.  Too bad, I was really hoping it would work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since June 2010 and found that it dramatically reduced the amount of hair that was aggressively falling out. My only regret was not learning about the existence of Viviscal earlier in my life. I can&#x27;t say that the original volume has been restored but my hair looks much healthier.  And the cessation of hair loss is more than I hoped for.</li>
            <li> They are excellent.  I notice a difference already.</li>
            <li> good ingredient, over priced, did not get any significant thickening ... lots of reviews look fake</li>
            <li> For some reason I&#x27;ve been loosing more hair than the past these few years. I&#x27;ve tried numerous products, ingested and external application. So far I&#x27;ve seen best results after taking Viviscal for 3 months. The best so far for ingested aid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken this product a few years back.  I didn&#x27;t take it for 90 days but now I realize you must take at least 90 days to see some results after that you are home free with hair strength and growth. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I think they are counterfeit because the box was not sealed. . I bought a few boxes from Target, and they were fine,.</li>
            <li> I have been taking Viviscal for just about a month now, so not long enough to be certain of the results, but I am seeing new hair growth along the hairline and baby fine hairs, but it is more than I had before.  I recommend the use of generic minoxidal along with the pills for maximum results.  I purchased a two month supply and plan to continue using it as there is so much positive feedback, and I did research before investing.  Also, this was the best price I found at $29 for 30 days.  Just do not take if you have an allergy to shellfish, as this is the basis of the all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Pass on this product. I am just about finished with the box, and I did not have any positive results.</li>
            <li> I been taking this pills for a month I have seen growth in my nails and eyebrows still waiting to look for a change  in my hair.</li>
            <li> Update!&lt;br /&gt;Viviscal has lost its magic! I realized that the first 2 boxes I bought were the old stock, it was effective and works like a miracle hence the 5 stars review I gave a few months back. I feel like I owe you guy an update as the result was completely different with the new formula. My 3 rd and subsequent purchases are of the new boxes, which I heard from other reviews that it is useless! And I must say that it is, I am very sad that after 2-3 month of vibrant hair grow the shedding starts again after I started the new formula, I continue with it since I have bought so much of it, my hair continue to drop, even those newly grew hairs are falling off! I am so so so sad why would they change the packing n formula! WASTE OF MONEY that I stock up so many boxes of junks! I want to cry now!&lt;br /&gt;I will not give it even half a star now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first review writing! I am so excited, relieved and over joy my hair loss has significantly improvement only after taking this product over a month! Unbelievable ! I am 44, used to have very thick hair, excessive hair loss started 4 years ago, my fringe has never grew longer than my eyebrow and thinning on the top. I have to bundle my pony tail in 3 loop(hair band) instead of 2 previously, hair filled my comb every morning, 3-5 strains of hair come off every time I run my finger over it, hair all over the floor n sofa,  hair clog my drain, loss about 1/3 of my volume over the last 3-4 yrs. I am very healthy conscious and mostly used organic products and minimal chemical product and rarely perm, blow or color my hair after the hair loss issue started for 4 years. It depresses me.&lt;br /&gt;I am skeptical on product n usually do extensive research before I use it especially drugs, I read review on viviscal and think this is the most promising to try.  WOW WOW WOW!! Only taking it slightly over a month,  I see less hair clogging my drain after about a month, and for the last few hair wash, the result is consistent. I am a,most back to a normal!!! I did not change shampoo or diet during this period of time, but I do start taking 10,000mg biotin at the same time, ie 2 viviscal per day (after breakfast n dinner, 1 biotin at lunch ) I do not know if my fringe will grow longer, that will have to wait a few month, but for now the excessive hair loss just stopped, I am soooo excited to share this review as I know how depressing to see your hair thinning!&lt;br /&gt;As for side effect, I know people complaint of breakouts, I drink lots if water, but I did have some pimples pop on my face for the first few days which is rather unusual for my skin, but it goes off after a week, I quests your body adjust to the supplement, I urge you to persevere!  I am so glad to have found this product! Btw, I don&#x27;t get paid to write this review, as I was so encouraged by the review written by other that give me the confident to try, I now in turn hope to help others! God bless!&lt;br /&gt;I will update on my fringe after a few months!</li>
            <li> What in the world are you doing with my order placed on Feb 4th....No communication and not very cool! I love Amazon but this is not right.  Jerry</li>
            <li> I am a hair designer always looking  for the next, best thing for hair growth. Well this is it. Incredible hair growth in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> just take biotin instead it works better and shows result faster than viviscal i had high expectations for this i took viviscal for 3 months and it didnt give me good results like biotin</li>
            <li> My hair has been looking better after a couple weeks of use...    Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s this or something else, but this sure isn&#x27;t hurting.</li>
            <li> Definitely works! But don&#x27;t take too much, stop when your hair stop lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dsa  fa er  fd fa fa sg</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  I lost hair from radiation treatments which they said would never come back.  Viviscal helped bring it back.</li>
            <li> I tried Viviscal for about 2-3 months. I did notice some hair growth, but it wasn&#x27;t as much as I had hoped for especially since I paid so much for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try Biotin instead, it works much better and will cost you so much less</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months and my hair is growing. Before using Viviscal, I had a grow out rate of about .50 inch every four weeks and as of this writing it&#x27;s about .50 inch in three weeks. My hope is that the hair strands will thicken with continued use.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work! I have very fine thinning blonde hair that has been coming out heavily in the shower daily for 2 years. I&#x27;d hoped this would at least slow the hair loss down a bit.  I have Hashimoto&#x27;s Thyroid disease and nothing they&#x27;ve tried has helped with my hair loss so this was my sort of &amp;#34;last resort&amp;#34;.  While I know that it may be my thyroid disease at fault here, I also started getting cystic acne for the first time in my life (60+). In reading one other review, I think I may have found the culprit.  So here is my review:&lt;br /&gt;A) after religiously taking this for 2 months - this product did not do anything to slow hair loss in this 60 year old with Hashimoto&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;B) it seems to have caused cystic acne in several people, including me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy again, there are several herbal supplement here on Amazon that I will try next.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t want longer, thicker, more gorgeous hair? Well I do-so I purchased Viviscal hoping that taking this AND biotin would make my hair look beyond gorgeous. I was very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took these religious until all 60 tablets were gone-then I bought another 60 tablets thinking it took longer to work into the system. Despite my high protein diet, I noticed very little difference between taking these-and not taking these. My hair was still thin, and breaking. It did not look any shinier and it certainly did not look any fuller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one good thing I can say about this, was that it did help my eyelashes VERY slightly. This is not advertised on the product in anyway-but considering how much other eye lash product cost-and the adverse side effects associated with them, I felt it was worth mentioning. I did not get any other odd side effects that some customers have reported, eg stomach ache, acne, or any other problems. However, the taste does take a little getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly this isn&#x27;t worth your money-but if you are exploring alternative hair growth options, and have some money to blow-you might want to give this a shot.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Menopause was not kind to me and my hair was thinning badly. I take 1 twice per day, EVERY day for several years. Has made a big difference. I also take Evening Primrose Oil twice per day, and the combo of the two makes my nails grow like crazy, also.</li>
            <li> nothing happening yet.  I am still considering purchasing another but am hesitant..I read all reviews before ordering and am concerned that i should have seen results by now.  Will see and continue checking other peoples results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a full month so far due to losing large clumps of hair in the shower.  I am in my early forties and I am awaiting thyroid test results but heard of this product&#x27;s success so wanted to try it in the meantime. After only two weeks of using it as directed I was amazed at the significant decrease in hair loss while showering. I used to wash my hair so delicately to avoid the loss but it wouldn&#x27;t help. Now I scrub my scalp strong while shampooing to provoke and test this product&#x27;s effects and I see 50-75% reduction still in the hair left in my hands afterwards.  I have not yet noticed any extra hair growth in other locations on my body as other reviewers have claimed.  I do notice some scalp itching but it feels to me like it is probably from increased follicle stimulation as opposed to skin irritation.  Surprisingly I have also noticed my extremely dry skin disappear on my face.  I will continue to use this product over the next 5 months to observe its effects but Im already excited.  For those skeptical I recommend looking up the NIH journal article on a study conducted on its main ingredient Aminomar.  Very impressive double blinded trial.</li>
            <li> Just started Viviscal ten days ago.  Brows &amp; nails are regrowing at a faster rate.  A big plus is my face looks younger:  skin is smoother and fine lines are less deep.</li>
            <li> my hair has never been so healty</li>
            <li> this stuff is AMZING!!!..I&#x27;ve been takin this supplement for almost 2mths and i can honestly say it WORKS! It made huge difference in my hair texture and strength..am not losing hair as much as i did before which ws my main concern...I tried phyto hair supplement before which is more expensive than viviscal; it works but it broke me out like crzy..Therefore, am so so thankful for this product because not only it works but it does not break me out..just so you guys know, this is my first ever review on any kinds of product so tat says a lot..:)</li>
            <li> I have always had baby hair, but it was full and healthy. A few years ago it started to thin until you could see my scalp in some areas. I ordered Viviscal because I was desperate, but with no real expectations as I&#x27;d tried supplements before with no results. By the second month, my stylist pointed out how much new hair growth I had - and three months later, I may not have a lion&#x27;s mane, but my hair is noticeably fuller and with the right haircut to give it volume, it looks great. It no longer looks like a thin, limp mop on my head. I am genuinely thrilled.</li>
            <li> Not done with the 6 month trial period yet, but I&#x27;m seeing a bit of improvement.  At least I&#x27;m not LOSING  hair anymore!</li>
            <li> I have fine and thin hair.  I&#x27;ve used Viviscal for a few months and when I went to visit a friend, she asked if I had extensions.  Very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about my hair because its up in twists but I can say my nails are growing.  A lot less fragile too</li>
            <li> I bought this due to my hair falling out in frightening amounts.  After taking it for 4 months, I can say my hair falls out in much smaller amounts.  For me, that is enough.  I haven&#x27;t noticed my hair getting thicker, but it is growing more quickly.  I also haven&#x27;t noticed any side effects.  I was concerned about that after reading that some people experienced oily skin and break outs from taking viviscal.</li>
            <li> have only used this product going on 2nd month, not sure if I am seeing any real results yet, but will stay on for a bit more and then check back in here.....:))</li>
            <li> I took these vitamins for 4 months and didn&#x27;t see any difference whatsoever in reducing shedding or promoting growth. They say that you should take them regularly for 3 months to see any significant changes. Also, you have to take these twice daily, which is annoying. I&#x27;m having waaaaaaaay more success with pairing a prenatal with biotin. Like hair growing like crazy. I went from 1/4&amp;#34; a month to 3/4&amp;#34; a month easily and saw results right away. Soooooo, ladies, these are pricey and don&#x27;t work as well as a complete vitamin paired with bioton...if they work at all.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a while ago but do not use these any more.  They did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I love Viviscal hair supplements, have used them for more than a year. I have medium/thick hair but it was thinning from a lot of highlights and color. Really worked to make my hair grow faser and get healthy again. Takes about 3 months to see some results though.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work and the smell is horrible</li>
            <li> I am giving this product an honest review because my experience with it was not good but the product itself is not at fault. I am a vegetarian and I was not aware that this product contained fish derived ingredients at the time. I admit I was not careful enough before I used it and I have learned, the hard way from my mistake. One  the first things I noticed is that my skin and scalp  became very oily when I started using this product. My hair did grew a bit faster, so it does work. Unfortunately, that means ALL hair, including underarms, legs, etc. with means more waxing and shaving, ugh! I used to have acne, but when I became a vegetarian my complexion became very clear and smooth. But when I started using this product I noticed that my skin became oily, coarse and pimples came back with a vengeance. Also these pills have a nasty fishy aftertaste! that made me super-nauseous. Eventually I just gave up the plan of growing my hair because losing my skin and my sanity over it was just not worth it and I gave them away. I still think they are good pills though, for a non-vegetarian who doesn&#x27;t have an issue downing fishy tasting pills. But they do work.</li>
            <li> Great Price Great Product Great Service !!! What more could i say thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any changes in my hair, neither did my dermatologist. I used this product for over a year with no gain, no added thickness, no difference at all. Sadly I&#x27;ll have to keep hoping for a miracle pill to help my hair. This wasn&#x27;t the one for me. Which is not to say that it might not work for somebody else, it may.... But for me it was a loss.</li>
            <li> I did my own test and began taking this supplement after having my hair highlighted so that I could tell how much my hair was growing.  First of all, let me say that I&#x27;m 36 yrs old and my hair grows REALLY slow, and had begun to thin.  I started off taking Biotin which was recommended by my doctor.  Biotin is great.  It works.  BUT it works really slowly.  I am always looking for something to help me with growing my hair and I saw this product featured in a magazine while at my hairdresser.  The magazine stated that this is what actresses use when they have to shave their head for movies.  I thought, heck, what do I have to loose?  I researched the product online and then placed my order.  I had my husband measure the growth of my hair by my roots.  At the 3 week mark, my hair had grown 1.25 inches.  At 4 weeks, it was at 1.5 inches.  Needless to say, I just ordered a refill.  I let all my friends on Facebook know about this prodcut and now they are all ordering it!</li>
            <li> My sister been using it for 2 months and no difference is noticed. Useless waste of money. Don&#x60;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> These horse pills do not appear to be working for this healthy hair having African American woman. Apparently it&#x27;s not for everyone. I will not order it again.</li>
            <li> The verdict is still out.  I have taken this 3 months and thought my hair thickened a little at first, but now I can&#x27;t see any improvement.  Still, I&#x27;m committed to 6 months and very hopeful.</li>
            <li> My hair was thinning badly and I&#x27;ve tried many products, some of which costs upwards of. $100.00 ((wasn&#x27;t worth it at all).  Since I&#x27;ve been using  Viviscal for  approximately 5 months I see a difference in the thickness of my hair and it&#x27;s also stopped shedding.</li>
            <li> It works! The texture and fullness of my hair greatly improved with this product and I will continue to use it as a healthy promoting supplement.</li>
            <li> I can say just wasting money and time to use this, I hate it no more product of Viviscal no</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking Viviscal for almost 2 years.  It took a year and I took 2 pills most days instead of 1 but there have definitely been results - my stylist has noticed and I have noticed there&#x27;s more of it.  Now I don&#x27;t think the product actually thickens or grows new hair but I think it makes your hair grow faster - so breakage and hair falling out has less of an effect.</li>
            <li> Sorry, I really wanted to believe all the reviews for Viviscal but the fact is, it doesn&#x27;t work any better than anything else for hair.  I&#x27;m finishing up month #2 of this and I&#x27;ve taken it every day as directed, PLUS Nature&#x27;s Bounty Hair, Skin &amp; Nails, as well as a prenatal vit.  That&#x27;s right, I choke down all those pills every day in an attempt to grow out my pixie cut.  There is absolutely no difference in my hair on month #2 from regular growth and not taking any supplements at all.  Just to track the growth, I colored my hair the first day of taking Viviscal to see the difference.  It&#x27;s still the standard amount per month as when I wasn&#x27;t taking anything.  It&#x27;s not thicker and it&#x27;s not growing any faster.  Very sad since I miss my longer hair, but I&#x27;ll just have to wait painfully for it to grow slowly.........</li>
            <li> Product is as advertised.  It arrived promptly. I love this product.  i went through a bad period with my hair (hormonal) and this has been majic.  Need to take it for at least 2 months for major change.</li>
            <li> This happens to be the first time trying this product.  It has only been 23 days, so I think I will continue to use it for at least 3 more months.  I have used other products in the past and have not yet found the miracle for hair loss.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works yet.  Its only been 3 1/2 weeks and the product recommends 6.  I will continue using it; still hoping it will work.</li>
            <li> Seems to be making a difference in my hair!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using Viviscal for a month. The product states it may take six months before seeing results. However, I had a hair appointment and the stylist said that my hair was thicker. I told her I was using Viviscal and she said it may take a while for Viviscal to work from the inside out. I plan on using this for six months and hoping that it works.</li>
            <li> I highly highly recommend this product!! I cut my hair really short because it was damaged after dying it and not only did it make my hair fuller and healthier, it made it grow at least an inch in just a month. Take 2 tablets a day and you will totally see results!</li>
            <li> Love this product. My hair is growing faster than I can keep up with dying it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking viviscal for three months, going on my fourth. These are the pros and cons I have observed while on it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grew my hair, improved hair texture in terms of manageability (shine, softness), grew my eyelashes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gained 11 pounds in the first three months, made my facial skin greasy, had a few pimples, developed a few chin hairs</li>
            <li> I had an issue a couple of years ago with a birth control pill; needless to say it caused a lot of medical issues!  One of which was hair loss.  I went off that pill and my body was slowly getting back to normal, but my hair didn&#x27;t seem to be recovering.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair to begin with and it&#x27;s fine, but viviscal helped the hair grow back AND my hair is much stronger.  There is less in my brush too.  My eyelashes and nails are also thicker!  I love it and still use it.</li>
            <li> at the moment the only thing growing are my nails.  very fast.  very strong.  product says to use for at least 3 months and i haven&#x27;t gotten there yet.  one more go &#x27;round before i give it a final rating.  i&#x27;m still holding out hope.</li>
            <li> Title says it all.  I have coarse, Afr Am hair; and my stylist and I noticed a signif faster rate of growth on Vivascal.  No side effects were noticed.</li>
            <li> I started taking Viviscal about a month ago, so I&#x27;m just finishing up my first box.  As I was taking it I was thinking &amp;#34;6 months?  Of course my hair will grow in SIX MONTHS!  I don&#x27;t need a supplement for that.&amp;#34;  But then I went and got my hair done and saw the before and afters... I just purchased my second month&#x27;s supply.  My hair has never grown so quickly and looked so much more healthy in one month&#x27;s time.  I already had some new growth because I just had a baby about a year ago, and that&#x27;s pretty common but it was staying these tiny wispy sprouts of hair right around my face and now, with Viviscal, that&#x27;s where I can visibly see the progress, those pieces now hang down a little and are noticeably longer since starting it. Like I said, I&#x27;ve had that new growth happening for about 6 months, (after I stopped nursing), and the growth process was lagging until I started this supplement!  I&#x27;m not a big &amp;#34;fad&amp;#34; person and not normally one to spend this kind of money on a hair product, but when it works it works.  I&#x27;m also having to cut my nails at least weekly, which wasn&#x27;t the case before; nail strength/growth was not a goal but its further proof that the product is working.  I will say there is SOMETIMES a slightly fishy aftertaste from the fish oil, but nothing too bad and I personally have small surface acne outbreaks on my chest from time to time which may be attributed to the fish oils but that is a personal reaction I always have to fish oil and it is MINOR, short-lived and definitely worth the pay off.  I guess I will be continuing for the initial 6 months afterall, and once I reach my desired length I will probably still take it once a day for maintenance!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Helped keep my hair looking and feeling healthy.  Bought some for my mom to see if it helps her with her bald patch.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about 4 months but I cannot tell if it is working. The instructions say you have to use for at least 6 months so I will hold on until then.</li>
            <li> I was happy with the purchase and have been purchasing monthly but they increased the price $10 which seems ridiculous.  I will be canceling my membership.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 6 months and really feel that it is helping my hair; the overall texture is better and it appears to be getting a little thicker.</li>
            <li> I noticed no difference, been taking this for a couple of weeks with no results. I am not sure I want to spend more money just to test this out, it would end up costing way too much.</li>
            <li> After using this product for five months I have not had any new hair growth.  I&#x27;m going to discontinue using this product.  It isn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li> I bought the three month supply a while ago, and only made it through 2 weeks :( I should preface by saying I&#x27;m sadly very prone to adult acne, which probably didn&#x27;t help. But this was the only thing that changed in my \\&quot;routine\\&quot;. I didn&#x27;t notice any difference for the first 4 days, but by the fifth, I was breaking out with a huge spattering of cystic acne! It was terrible, but I didn&#x27;t put two and two together yet. I went through two weeks, with the acne getting to be truely horrible, and decided to stop. Within a few days, my skin was starting to calm down, but it took forever to get rid of the last bits of the breakout. Sadly, think I&#x27;ll have to deal with thinner hair than a face that looks like a teenage boys. Very sad, as this seems to do so well for so many~</li>
            <li> I tried this supplement for 3-4 months straight and I did not see any difference. It may work for some people but for me it did not work.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for about 3 weeks, so I can&#x27;t speak to any new hair growth.  I have noticed significant nail growth.  Will have to see what results I have in 3 months.</li>
            <li> Great product, LOVE it. I had little spots in my hair that just would not grow. They are all gone now &amp; I also seem to have less gray hair</li>
            <li> Trying this product to see if it will help with Hair regrowth.</li>
            <li> This works but I think my body has become immune to it. I don&#x27;t see hair growth as fast as I used to</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about you, but I don&#x27;t like to take iron. I do not need iron. I&#x27;m not anemic, and we all know what it does to your digestive system to take iron in a pill. I realized that after about a week. Of course, adult men are not even supposed to take iron at all. I don&#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t make an iron free version of this pill. I am a woman but i still don&#x27;t like to take iron. I bought a lot of boxes of it and will not use them. Sorry I didn&#x27;t read the ingredients first.</li>
            <li> i have only been using it for a month. i dont see a change but i think im supposed to use this product longer. i am going on two months now. i guess ill have to wait and find out</li>
            <li> Had a severe allergic reaction after nine days.  More iodine than my body could handle.</li>
            <li> Will need to use it a while to show progress in the thinning.</li>
            <li> Not pleasant smell and I&#x27;ve problems with skin-got bad acne on my forehead:(</li>
            <li> I hav not seen any difference in the 30 days. I may be willing to try another 30 days. I do feel that it if pricey for not seeing any results in 30 days.</li>
            <li> Bought Viviscal in 2011 and still talking it. Do not expect results the next day or even the next year. It takes long time to restore what was damaged. Lost hair due to stress. In November 2011 all my hair simply fell. I was devastated! Viviscal helped me and now I have  about 9-10 inches long new hair. I think it works!</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ve only been taking Viviscal for a short time, in three short weeks, the texture of my hair was softer and had a better sheen. I do attribute part of this result to a recent change in diet and eating better and much healthier foods. I think the combination has done wonders for my hair and skin. My nails are growing at a ridiculous rate and I have to trim them weekly. As such, I was cautious to credit Viviscal with addition hair growth in such a short time period.  I can no longer deny that I am seeing enough reasonable growth. My hair has grown at least a quarter inch in 3 weeks. I doubled my last order to make sure I don&#x27;t miss a day of my Viviscal. So far, I have been pleasantly surprised and will continue taking Viviscal and work the cost into my budget as long as I can.[[ASIN:B002JPJ2ZS Viviscal Extra Strength Hair Nutrient Tablets, 60-Tablets]]</li>
            <li> I do seem to notice that my hair seems healthier however I have gained almost 10 pounds in the 5 months I&#x27;ve been taking it.  Nothing has changed in my lifestyle to cause this.  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m the only person this has happened to but it&#x27;s very frustrating.  I&#x27;m still weighing whether I&#x27;m going to continue for a couple more months to see if my body adjusts but I am NOT happy with this side effect.  Does the benefit outweigh this con?  Still deciding.</li>
            <li> I tried it for two months. Not sure I see any hair growth. I think it helped some.I hope to see more improvement.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really give this product any reliable stars, as I couldn&#x27;t continue taking them due to the taste. The taste is so bad it was like I was swallowing horse manure everyday. Just couldn&#x27;t do it, so not sure how well it works. Went back to Hair Anew, where there is no taste. Sorry.</li>
            <li> I definitely saw some amazing growth while using this...the only thing that happened that I didn&#x27;t like was I broke out on my face. I break out more with biotin, so considering it could have been worse, it was just a hassle. I&#x27;m considering using half the dosage to see if that reduces the breakouts because this product really did work for me</li>
            <li> My hair is definitely growing at a steady rate!</li>
            <li> Love it. Seemed to Improved hair thickness and some re growth and I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 90 days.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money. I tried this for about 2 months and didnt do nothing but give me some headaches, bad acne and oily hair.</li>
            <li> Okay first off, this product would receive 10 stars a year ago before they changed the product. I fell in love with the original and was buying a box consistently for 2.5 years from the only local store that carries it. Anyhow, they&#x27;ve decided to change the precious ingredients and it was a bad move on their part. I first realized it and compared the boxes side by side. Sure enough, there is an obvious mg change in the amounts. Whelp, there goes another reliable product and company. I will NOT be recommending or buying anymore unless it goes back to the original.</li>
            <li> For really dry, fragile hair prone to split ends, these vitamins make a world of difference!! Hair stylist commented on it right away. Makes hair soft and more manageable!! Definitely worth the money!!</li>
            <li> I heard good reviews about his product and decided to try it. after 2 weeks, I noticed severe acne breakout but continued it. I stopped it and now my face is clearing up again... I did not use it long enough to notice any difference with my hair.</li>
            <li> Absolutely useless!  I used it religiously for 6 months (buying extra from Walgreens).  I would never order it again and have certainly spread the word about it</li>
            <li> As I am doing several things, it is hard to know what is responsible for improvement.  My hair is better and I will use these vitamins from time to time.</li>
            <li> I have been using Viviscal for nearly 9 months along with Walmart brand of women&#x27;s rogaine called Equate and I am very very happy with the results I achieved.  I lost hair as part of the aging process and when I started using red yeast rice pills for high cholesterol and didn&#x27;t realize it thins hair the same as the statin drugs like Lipitor.  I didn&#x27;t tell my hairdresser what I was using but after about four months she commented how much thicker and healthier my hair was that she was not having to piece hair when styling to cover thin spots. Hhair that had been missing from the temples for years is now fully grown back.  You have to give it time for your hair to grow back and it becomes long enough to notice....since I have very short hair mine filled in within 3-4 months. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> This product definitely increases your hair growth! I dye my hair a dark brown and my hair is naturally dirty blonde so I can definitely notice a change in my hair growth because my blond roots are coming in much faster than usual. Unfortunately this means that I have to dye my hair a little more than I&#x27;m used to but I like trying new hair dyes anyway. As far as my eyelashes, I haven&#x27;t noticed anything to dramatic, but I also have very naturally long eyelashes so I don&#x27;t know how much more they can grow. I have noticed a little bit of eyebrow growth, however that could just be something mental. But I do feel like my eyebrows are a little thicker than usual. Overall, if you are looking for your hair to grow I believe this definitely works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 5 months and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.  What looked like new hair growth was merely hair breakage coming back in. I&#x27;m inclined to believe that&#x27;s what the majority are seeing. It&#x27;s just a lot of wishful hoping. It didn&#x27;t make my hair grow any faster or any stronger. I&#x27;ll give the benefit of doubt to those who say they&#x27;ve had all the positive changes to their hair, but it didn&#x27;t work for me and I won&#x27;t be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I have yused This product 6 monts now.. i have hairloss as before i started on it. It has not helped me at all.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work and was a little skeptical. After trying Rogaine and not getting anywhere except frustrated. Within two weeks I wasn&#x27;t losing hardly any hair in the shower or just brushing it. At my next hair appointment I was telling my hairdresser that I wasn&#x27;t losing so mush hair anymore and she told me she could see new hair growth. They had the whole salon looking at my head and everyone wanted to know what I was using. Thank you for a great product.</li>
            <li> I have been taking this product for 2 months and noticed positive results immediately.  Due to financial limitations I only take one pill a day.  Product still working.</li>
            <li> I have used one box of the Viviscal and already see a difference.  The woman that cuts my hair noticed hair growth and not as much hair falling out.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think these did anything for me.</li>
            <li> Great product. It really works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it is a great product -- as most everyone else says.  But I am a bit sensitive to iron.  Could only take one pill because it made my stomach hurt and affected my heartbeat rate.  But all that aside, the smell of fish oil from the pill made it a bit hard to swallow.  I did not care for that taste in my mouth.  Will have to find something else that does not have that yecky fish oil taste.  So, my search continues . . .</li>
            <li> Nothing changed with my hair. Waste of money don&#x27;t buy. 😐😑😒</li>
            <li> Yes it was excellent. I was pleased with the service.</li>
            <li> I have been taking this for three months.  No difference yet.  After reading all the reviews I started these but I have seen nothing yet, I know it says can take up to 6 months.  No greasy hair, no growth, no breakouts, nothing.  Not sure this is going to work for me. I take one a breakfast and one at lunch.  Do not miss.  Not sure about all these great reviews.</li>
            <li> First of all let me start by saying I am an African American woman.  I had what is called a sew in/extensions. I had been taking viviscal while it was in and took it out about a month later. I know for a fact it had to be the viviscal because my hair did not shed and my nails are growing great. I will give another review in about 2 months...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product as directed. This would probably be very good for my hair needs, were it not for the Iron ingredient. I have a reaction to Iron which has caused acne breakouts on my face. This is a big draw-back in my continued use of this product.</li>
            <li> I love the product... It gave beautiful newgrowth.. However i am one hairy woman.. It grows hair every where. And i do mean  everywhere.</li>
            <li> Came on time but not only was packaging different (which I was prepared for), the composition/ingredients were a little different. I have been using the product for a few months and have been happy with the results. My mom has even asked me to get her some. So while we were happy to get a box since it is getting harder to find while on backorder, we were a disappointed to find that the box seemed a little tattered and some of the pills a darker brown than others. I suspect they are just starting to oxidize but have to wonder about the conditions it was stored or age of the product. I did not contact the seller and going to assume it is safe to take. Just hope it is as effective as the other formulation.</li>
            <li> I have been taking these supplements for nearly a year and have seen significant thickness to my hair. My stylist would like to take credit but she knows it is the supplements and encourages me to keep taking them because she notices the improvement, she believes that I have 2 inches of growth. Also, my hair appears healthy and stronger than ever. I had noticeable breakage around my edges which has plagued me for years due to braiding and chemical treatments but now even after years of trying many remedies my patches have filled in and I can pull my hair back without embarrassment.</li>
            <li> This really works and my hair has never grown so well or been so healthy since I started taking this supplement. I will take it for life.</li>
            <li> I really. Have seen a difference!</li>
            <li> I gave it more than six months, but saw no positive change. If anything, my hair loss continued at a steady pace.</li>
            <li> I noticed more nail growth than hair growth. It&#x27;s just annoying taking it 2x a day and pill has a weird taste. The growth is not significant enough for me to buy again.</li>
            <li> IMPORTANT UPDATE! My original review shows below.  I have an update&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went for my anual physical, albeit a couple of months more than I should have gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my last physical, my liver ensymes were 24 and 26 or something like that.  Normal is anywhere from 0 to 40.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On this physical exam, my liver ensymes were 86 and 89.  My doctor was worried and talked of possible liver damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He suspected one of the suplements that I am taking saying that suplements are not regulated by the FDA and that many are made outside of the U.S., mostly in China, where other ingredients are added for one reason or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To shorten the story a bit, upon a retest my liver ensymes returned to 25 / 27.  I had removed the suplements that I was taking.  My doctor was right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are still reading, guess which won.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have to physically prove these, as I took three of them.  I was taking the Great Earth NSP program, GNC Women&#x27;s Hair Skin and Nails formula, and now for this past year Viviscal.  I have been taking like clockwork the GNC stuff since 2006 every day.  I have been taking the not pleasant tasting huge tablets of Great Earth for two decades or so, maybe even longer.  The only new thing added was shortly after my last physical was the Viviscal.  Everything else remained the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is unsafe.  Anyone taking this product should get tested regularly.  Not everyone is equal.  I have always been sensitive, so your liver may not act up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that until proven by successive retests, there is still the possibility that either Great Earth or GNC were the culprit by suddenly outsourcing their product.  I looked at the GNC box and they say that GNC is the distributor, not the manufacturer.  They neglect to say who the manufacturer is or where it was made.  Great Earth vitamins if I remember correctly are made here, but still not submitted for FDA approval.  Still, everything points to the new kid on the block, Viviscal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yes, my doctor said to rather spend the money on clothing, shoes, or my family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laser comb, Rogaine, Latisse (when it comes out), and a hair transplant are much safer ways of dealing with hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In one phrase, no positive results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should give a zero or negative number, but I will be nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started May 2011 with the tablets, head lotion, and the HairMax LaserComb Professional 12.  I stayed with it and tried the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:&lt;br /&gt;* I will say what others told me.  It is hard to comment, because I do not know how my hair would look like 10 months later if I did nothing or just the Viviscal or just the LaserComb.  I started losing more hair early last year, still am.  Maybe my hair now might be worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I can say is that there was an increase in hair loss followed by stagnation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to a hair doctor the other week, who looked at my hair folicles through a microscope.  I saw thick hairs and thin hairs and hair in between, so I am actively still losing hair.  The best that I can say is that nothing happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will also say that another problem with Viviscal and other DIY type of things that there is nobody to talk to or ask help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked the doctor about Viviscal and his comment was that Viviscal never went through formal testing, has never been shown to be of use, and has ingredients that do nothing, in other words a plocebo.  If it helps, it is because people think that it can and therefore does.  Viviscal has the power of suggestion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people comment on fuller hair.  I saw no thickening or anything else different.  I also use GNC&#x27;s Hair, Skin, and Nails.  That seems to do more, at least for my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 2 rating is because maybe in the long run it helped or at least I felt that I was doing something, but my vote is with the doctor.  Sadly, the pills do not do anything.  Also, the DIY approach is a turn off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone wanting to work on regrowing hair should better spend the money seeing a professional, possibly getting FUE (Folicle Unit Extraction) or a version of Minoxidil or other treatments available.ot do anything.

            <li> my hair started falling out at an alarming rate do to hormonal changes associated with menopause. .  I started taking viviscal and noticed considerably less hair in my hands when shampooing within the first month,  after 6 months my hair loss was at a normal rate and I cut down my dose from twice a day  to just once a day.  I have even seen new hair growth at my temples where it was most noticeable.  it worked well for me....I hope it does for you too.</li>
            <li> I have been taking this product for 6 months, with a month break in between. Before I began, my nails were horrible (constant peeling splitting breaking soft ect) and my hair was very dry and couldn&#x27;t stand much heat. (I have curly 3b-c hair) My hair has grown a CONSIDERABLE amount since then and my nails are long and strong. I do not know if it has made my hair grow faster but I can say this product has made it stronger and i straighten it every week with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, in the month that I stopped taking it, my nails were right back to peeling and being soft. This product does stop working when you stop taking it, and does take a few weeks to kick in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the beginning I took this product 2x a day, but now i take it 1x a day to save money. I hope they never stop making this product or ever change it I Love it!</li>
            <li> i have been taken this pill for one month and i can&#x27;t tell if it is working yet... i may get another months spply.  i want to give it a fare chance.  thank you</li>
            <li> I have been taking Viviscal since December 2011.My hairdresser and I were both alarmed at my thinning hair and felt I needed to start taking Viviscal ASAP.  My hair loss was attributed to stress due to my husband&#x27;s unexpected illness.  Well, initially--I noticed my hair stopped shedding when I combed and washed it.  Ah--a sigh of relief heard around the world! That was basically it through the winter months....limited shedding and no breakage. Now that it is spring--I am noticing an increase in new growth around my hairline. I have upped my dosage to 3x&#x27;s a day based upon my hairdresser&#x27;s recommendation. The winter months were very challenging for me and my family and I attribute this factor to my not seeing anything major happen in the thickness department. I remain confident Viviscal will make a difference for me in the long run. My skin and nails are also benefiting from Viviscal. Since I am no longer a sweet young thing - I cannot attest to my hair growing super fast as some have reported. On the other hand--I am not yet positioned with one foot on a banana peel and the other in the grave yet either.  If you are middle-aged+ -- be patient. I did find my hair does gets quite \\&quot;oily\\&quot; as others have mentioned.  This is always more noticeable on those of us with silky fine hair. I would like to add that the shipment I ordered through Viviscal was past it&#x27;s expiration date. I ordered it in April and the expiration date was March 2012. Duh! I just noticed this the other morning.  One should never assume. If you order this product--check the expiration date. I do not fault Amazon.  It was the purveyor who shipped the item through the Amazon site. I have had better luck with \\&quot;other\\&quot; online sources.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad they&#x27;ve lowered the price a little on this. Viviscal works. All my life I have wanted thicker, longer hair! But once it would start to get long, it would also start to break and then I&#x27;d go through some shedding and I&#x27;d have to cut it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read somewhere that Reese Witherspoon uses this stuff. I figured that if it&#x27;s her business to try and look good as much as possible, she probably knows something! A girlfriend and I decided to order it at the same time. We took it faithfully, every day asking each other how it was going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After around 2 or 3 weeks, there was no need to ask. We both color our hair, and our roots were significantly showing!! Our hair was growing definitely faster! When I went to my stylist, she commented on it, but I didn&#x27;t tell her I was taking the supplements. Fast forward four months. I decided to take a break on the blonde highlights for awhile, but it was starting to look bad. Unless you like the ombre look. When I went in for color, she looked at me strangely and asked if I got hair extensions!! She said she&#x27;d never seen my hair looking so thick and long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely works for me, and worked for my friend. You do have to take it though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only question is, what is really in this stuff? I wish they would offer more disclosure. I&#x27;m a little leery of taking something when I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in it. That&#x27;s why I took off one star. The ingredient list is vague. But whatever is in there does work.</li>
            <li> I was watching YouTube and I noticed a few natural hair guru&#x27;s rave about these pills. So I gave in and purchased them. I&#x27;m now on my 3rd box, and I&#x27;m now noticing that my hair is growing faster and my hairline is growing back in. Before I would hardly get an half an inch of new growth a month. Now I get an inch of new growth a month. I am so very pleased. Will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> I have had excellent results with this product. I had unhealthy thin hair and used with Biotin for over a year and the results are really good. I do take this vitamin morning and night.</li>
            <li> This product is the truth.  it works - you will see results in as little as 8 weeks.</li>
            <li> This is magic! I was getting it directly from Viviscal and paid more for it from them. I started out a little over a year ago with thinning spots and my hair was just under my ears and wouldn&#x27;t grow! Tried all kinds of special shampoos and supplements from my doctor, nothing worked! This product is amazing. I now have hair past the middle of my back! All the thin spots are gone and  it&#x27;s so thick, it&#x27;s unbelievable!! I have turned on many of my friends to this product and it works great for absolutely everyone!!  They say to give it at least 4 months to start working...I noticed an improvement after the first month!! This is the very best!!</li>
            <li> Within 1 month I saw a little over 1/2 an inch of growth. My hairdresser was impressed! After my 3rd baby and crazy hormones my hair was falling out everyday. After tons of searching I tried this. Looking forward to more growth as I&#x27;m now on my second month!</li>
            <li> I have been using Viviscal for awhile now and it works GREAT! My hair is Thick and Full. I even see a change in my nails. They are stronger! It&#x27;s an amazing product and has truly changed my hair and my confidence!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Viviscal!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for product,please, please,please, please,  STOP SENDING IT TO ME WHO EVER THIS IS COMING FROM STOP SENDING THEMMMMMM. 😡</li>
            <li> I only tried it for a few days but I honestly thought I could notice that it was helping out. I have IC so my bladder was bothered by some of the ingredients. I had to stop taking them and return them. I really wish I didn&#x27;t have to. :(</li>
            <li> I followed the plan just as directed and could see a big difference after 4 months.  The only problem is that you have to continue a maintenance program forever, in order no to start loosing hair again.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> Nails grew, not so much hair. What exactly does  (nourishes existing hair growth )mean?</li>
            <li> This product was used for a few months when my hair thinned due to a side effect from a medicine.  It works.</li>
            <li> After the birth of my daughter I started to lose my hair rapidly. The drain would have a large pile of hair in it every time I took a shower, it was going on for months. I have been taking this supplement for about 4 months now and can definitely see a difference. My scalp was showing easily but with the new growth it is starting to look more full, The regrowth is about 3/4 inch so I will still have to cut my hair often to blend the different lengths look more natural but it will be like growing a short hair cut out.&lt;br /&gt;  Here is what in my opinion should be the disclaimer in buying.&lt;br /&gt;  1. When you have Alopecia or any other condition it is important to talk to your doctor about treatment before taking any supplements if your hair follicle dies ie: you lose your hair without a new hair growing in it&#x27;s place, then it is too late for treatment of that particular hair.&lt;br /&gt;  2. Find out about your allergies, Some people have reactions like hives and can aggravate respiratory ailments.</li>
            <li> My wife was having some issues have some medical treatments. These were recommended and I will tell you that I was skeptical at first.  After paying varying prices (no one keeps the price steady often), I&#x27;ll continue to do so. Simply put, these help.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these hair vitamins.  My daughter and I both use these daily and noticed growth within one month.  I have been using them for over one year now.  My hair is definitely longer and healthier.</li>
            <li> My hair grows so quickly with this product and it seems thicker - I have strands of hair growing everywhere on my head - and the texture is \\&quot;beach-wavy\\&quot;.  I have this product on subscribe and ship.</li>
            <li> 2/12/2015 UPDATE!!!!!! WARNING TO POST MENOPAUSAL WOMEN!!!!!!!  This product is made primarily for post-menopausal women, yet each pill contains 10 MG of IRON!!!!!  This is a TERRIBLE NO-NO!!!! Post-menopausal women cannot/should not take iron supplements! Every over 50 multivitamin for women DOES NOT HAVE IRON!!!    So basically, if you are taking this, STOP. IMMEDIATELY. I wound up with elevated liver values, so I gave my doctor a list of my supplements. He freaked out when he saw this.    Bottom line, I still love the product, but now I take the men&#x27;s version. NO IRON there!!  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Definitely works; too expensive, though.    For what it is, the price is completely overblown. That&#x27;s why I took one star away. A 60-day supply should cost no more than $20, period.    Other than that, this stuff works. I had not been able to part my hair down the middle in over 25 years. Now I can. That says it all! My hair isn&#x27;t the amazing, beautiful, shiny, thick hair I had at 18, but it&#x27;s much, much better than it was before I started taking it. More hairs growing on the scalp, so I can part my hair down the middle. My lashes also grew in thicker. Re: the eyebrows, a little better, but very little.</li>
            <li> My mother had bald spots so she&#x27;s been taking Viviscal for 6 months now. No more bald spots! Her hair grew back and it hadn&#x27;t looked this good in many years! You have to give it time. It really works</li>
            <li> I have been taking Viviscal for 4 months and let me tell you, it works slowly, but it works. Don&#x27;t expect dramatic results, expect a realist change in the texture, thickness and/or growth rate of your hair. It might not do all three for everyone, just the same way that a face cream doesn&#x27;t work for everyone. My hair is fine, stringy and lacks volume as well as gets frizzy fast, i also had an issue with my hair falling out a lot due to stress. After about a month on Viviscal my hair was falling out less, and by month 3 my hairdresser was commenting on all the new hair that was growing all over my head. Needless to say, it was most definitely Viviscal since I have not added anything new to my routine in years except this. My hair feels softer and thicker and is growing almost an inch faster than it should- plus, nearly NO split ends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also- if you sign up for the monthly Amazon delivery it costs under $30. Awesome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 5 months.  I finally saw results at about 4 months.  I&#x27;m going through menopause and my hair is falling out more than usual.  It continues to fall out but it seems to be growing back and getting thicker.  If you&#x27;re patient I think it&#x27;s definitely worth taking although it is a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work...if amazon would not required so may works for a feedback, us extreamly busy people would leave a ***** star feedback rating more often, rather than just skip them all together</li>
            <li> Seems to be doing what it said it will do.  New hair growth started coming in around hair line after only a couple of weeks. Happy so far.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about this stuff.  no results so far,other than my nails growing fast.  This is my second month, so maybe it takes a little longer as the package says.  think this is expensive and may go back to taking Biotin instead.  undecided.</li>
            <li> Hairloss happens for a variety of reasons so this may affect your results.&lt;br /&gt;I started to have hair loss in my 40&#x27;s. By the time I was on Viviscal Tablets for 3 months, my hairdresser saw 1 1/2 inches of hair growth, at the top&lt;br /&gt;and back of my scalp.  As I go into my fifth month my hair is noticeably thicker throughout.  Obviously, I&#x27;m a believer.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for 4 months and just didnt get the results I read about from the product  I would not recommend this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to really rate this product because I was unable to tolerate it on my stomach.  I tried taking it at night and that didn&#x27;t help, and I tried taking it at night with no relief.  I understood I was supposed to take it 3 times a day and I could not even tolerate taking it once a day.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Could not tell at all, (in the least) it did ANY thing for my hair. Will not purchase this again. Recommend anyone else NOT to buy it. WASTE of money!</li>
            <li> There is shark cartridge in it.  I bruised on my arms heavily for months and realized what the ingredient causing this.  I&#x27;m also a vegetarian and supporter of the marine life so I duscontinued.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I have only been taking it for about a month now, so I don&#x27;t know if there has been much growth in my hair. I cut my hair to a little above my shoulders to have a fresh start, so I am trying to grow it back out again. I take them as told, twice a day. I have no problems swallowing them, they are pretty easy with a gulp of water. They do not have any bad taste to them either. What I have noticed from taking these those, is that my nails have grown faster, so I am going to assume that it is playing some effect in my hair growth. I also have to shave more frequently (the only downside to taking vitamins for hair, it is not like you can pin point where you want the vitamins to go towards, so if you have to shave everyday, be aware that it might make it a little worse, or make you just shave/wax more frequently in general). Another downside, which might not even be the problems, but I have read and heard from people that biotin can make your skin break out. My skin has had some patches of stronger break outs however, it has gone away and hasn&#x27;t been that difficult to take care of. I have always had skin that was unpredictable, some days very good, some days very bad, so I don&#x27;t know if that is a side effect or not, just something to note. I will post another update in a few months time on how fast my hair has grown if there has been progress or not.</li>
            <li> Extremely happy. I have been using this for about 3 months now, very happy with the results. I have naturally thin hair that grows extremely slow. My hair seems to be thicker and definitely less breakage. It takes a little while to notice any change but if you take it twice a day for a few months, you will be amazed by the results.</li>
            <li> Love this product have used it for a couple of years now.  My hair grew out nicely and looks great.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a couple years and have always been pleased.  But this is the first time that the tablets appeared &amp;#34;old&amp;#34;.  Some were dark and looked like they had gotten wet or were old.</li>
            <li> I saw this on Dr. Oz show and boy did this work! I used this for a year and my hair is long and full of body. The hair only grows on your head no where else like chest, chin or back which I was a bit worried that it might happen but it didn&#x27;t. Yes I will buy contiue to buy more of Viviscal.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 weeks. I have already noticed my hair growing faster, and my eyebrows which were thin and sparse are now ridiculously thick and need to be plucked weekly to look neat. I have had super thin hair since I was a teen due to an auto immune disease. My scalp has always been very visible and my hair fine and thin and lifeless, and very very slow growing. I haven&#x27;t noticed a ton of extra hair on my head yet but it is definitely growing faster and looks not as thin. Going to continue taking this twice a day and see what happens.</li>
            <li> I hesitated buying this product because many of the positive reviews are FAKE. If you check, it&#x27;s the same pattern over and over. They review Viviscal, and on the same day a few other products--I suppose to make it seem like they are real customers.  But that&#x27;s it--no other reviews from any other day.  Sure, so believeable! And I have a bridge to sell you...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to my experience! Earlier in the year I had to go on blood pressure medication that made my hair fall out. It was gradual at first, but began to pick up speed. Changed to a different kind, and with days my hair was falling out by the handfuls. I was beyond upset! Switched to a third medicine and the fallout stopped, but by then the damage was done. I had had incredibly thick hair, and it was soooo much thinner. I realize no one could tell, but it was still upsetting. Quite by accident, I was on a forum (not related to hair) and someone mentioned their hair improved by taking Viviscal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about a month, it seemed like my eyelashes and eyebrows were a bit fuller, but wasn&#x27;t sure if it was my imagination/wishful thinking.  (These had thinned over time due to normal aging.)  Now, after two months, they are definitely getting more lush! I am thrilled!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for hair growth, I definitely can see the new hairs growing in at my temples.  Can&#x27;t really say if that&#x27;s due to the vitamins, or just normal hair growth from stopping the bad medicine.  Will try to update this review over time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing to add:  I see others have mentioned getting acne while on this. I am VERY acne prone and have not had this happen.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and delivered on time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several months and my hair is growing very fast and is much thicker as well.  I&#x27;m 56 and my hair was really thinning, but honestly except for the gray my hair is about the same now as later 30s.  I&#x27;m hopeful if I continue to use this might even improve further.  Like most vitamins, they need to be taken consistently for best results.  Also to say I find a lot of price variation, so shop this!</li>
            <li> my hair was falling out due to my diet &amp; this nutrient tablet stopped that from happening. i have been using it now for 2 months &amp; can tell a difference already even though the package says you won&#x27;t see a change for 3 to 6 months. love being on the plan where they send it to me automatically! i don&#x27;t have to think about it ! absolutely great</li>
            <li> I really notice a difference with my hair and nails. My nails don&#x27;t break as easy, and my hair has FINALLY gotten long. Yay!</li>
            <li> I am using that product about 5 month and I am not loosing too much hair - so let me use it for a few more times and we shell see</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product actually works for hair growth or not because I was unable to continue to take it long enough to see what it can/can&#x27;t do. I was taking it for a few weeks when I started to break out on my face very badly. I stopped taking this product and I&#x27;m still recovering from the reaction to it. I&#x27;ve taken plain biotin supplements before and never had a reaction to those but did not see the hair growth improvement that I wanted so I decided to try these. I wish I could return these but I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s too late but I know I surely will not be buying this product again!</li>
            <li> Great and super fast shipping!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff--my hair had been falling out for about a year and half-I had been to my dermatologist and gyno as well as my family physician and an indo and all said they couldn&#x27;t find any reason for my hair loss-- started taking viviscal and within 3 months my hair stopped falling out- now I shed the normal amount of hair daily--THANK GOD Also, my daughter uses it everyday for her fingernails and loves it-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking these supplements for the last 8 days, 2x a day as instructed and I have broken out in what looks like cystic acne. I&#x27;ve never in my life had any serious acne aside from a couple of breakouts here and there. I don&#x27;t think I can continue take these supplements and it&#x27;s too bad because I was hoping this would help in hair growth.</li>
            <li> Good product. After taste is not very pleasant, but the benefits of this product outweigh that tiny con. I noticed less shedding while taking this product</li>
            <li> My wife swears by this product. Hope it was cheaper.</li>
            <li> so far so good, i think my hair quality is improving</li>
            <li> Around the three month mark, you will begin to notice growth.  My hair stylist commented the last time, &amp;#34;Your hair is growing fast!&amp;#34; as I need to get root color every 4 weeks.  This is the best product out there for hair growth.  Trust.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t known how good it will work only been taking for 8 weeks</li>
            <li> The amount of niacin in the product created constant hot flashes..this was unfortunate. I was really hopeful with the product based on prior reviews however I have stopped.</li>
            <li> The original Viviscal saved my hair. It worked SO well for a year. This current formula was awful -- totally ruined my hair. Tried for 6 months and saw MORE hair fall. Hair became thinner and my nails weaker. Stopped purchasing as my hair got worse and worse. A total waste of money! Recommended original Vivisal to friends, but will never recommend this new Viciscal formula as it is total crap and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I went through a horrible stress shed for most of the winter, on top of that I had some thyroid issues. I started to increase my protein intake, use all natural shampoo and conditioner, And left a stressful job...I ordered viviscal about a month ago. I am almost finished with my first pack and I have just recently noticed a significant decrease in hair shed when I comb my hair in the mornings. Aside from the shower, the mornings are the worst. Instead of combing out an average of 15 hairs, I now see maybe 2. What a relief. I&#x27;m doing a lot of things to get myself healthier, but I think the viviscal really played an important roll. I&#x27;ll update more in a few months.</li>
            <li> It has stopped the thinning hair that was happening daily in abundance.  Will take this from here on out.  Update after 3 months, this product works great to stop hair loss.  I see a lot of new hair growth and am very pleased. Thank you for a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Big improvement for my daughter myslef  it grows a little in my thin area I will ues it because I dont want to loose anymore hair.</li>
            <li> I see absolutely no change or improvement of any kind.</li>
            <li> My hair is still shedding like crazy. And im on my second box and I dont see much of any difference in length. Im a cosmetologist and Im not at all impressed with this product and what it cost.</li>
            <li> Would give this zero stars if I could.  I used this for 3 moths as directed with no change in my hair.</li>
            <li> These tablets are pretty pricey but it works!  I been taking it for a couple of months already and I&#x27;m starting to see alot of baby hair showing.  You really have to be patience with this products.  I was about to give up, but decided to finish up with all the one i still have in stock.  You won&#x27;t notice the result until a couple of months.  Mine has been almost 6 months already.</li>
            <li> Since using this product, my hair has grown faster and come in thicker. I noticed this after using the product for 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a year and it has transformed my hair and my life! I have an extremely stressful life and job. I had very thin hair that fell out and broke off. Since using this I have hair I had as a teenager. It has changed texture, strength everything about my hair. The girl that cuts and colors my hair recommends it to everyone now because of the difference she has seen in my hair. I&#x27;ve tried everything and I will never be without this! If I could give it 10 stars I would. The only down side is price.</li>
            <li> My hair is now fuller and thicker thanks to Viviscal. I suffer from hair loss, but after taking this medication for 2-3 months twice a day I have noticed visible results.</li>
            <li> I have been using for 3 mos and starting to see some improvement in my hair. Getting new growth and fuller. Lots less shedding. 44 yr old female</li>
            <li> Update as of December 2015 - I. Have noticed a huge difference with the use of these tablets. My hair is noticeably thicker and looks so much healthier. Although they are in the priced end, they are better than any other similar type product I have purchased. They truly work.&lt;br /&gt;Bought it at the recommendation of my hair stylist. It&#x27;s only been a couple of weeks but I&#x27;m already nothing improvement in my hair. Now it&#x27;s just a matter of how much growth I see.</li>
            <li> I noticed very little difference in the quality or quantity of my hair. But, I suppose that like with all supplements, YMMV.</li>
            <li> After 3 months, I didn&#x27;t see any difference so I stopped taking it, you just never know if it will work for you until you try and I found it didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li> Experiencing slow growth, but growth non the less after an awful hair cut and dry, harsh winter climate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Mrs. W and say:  What happened to Viviscal?  Has the formula been changed?  I have been using VIVISCAL for a year with good results, but since my last order of 120 tablets it is important that I stress it is now extremely disappointing..  I have experienced little or no improvement of hair/nails over previous orders of Viviscal supplements.  I regret that I no longer can support Viviscal as promoting hair growth.</li>
            <li> I suffer from thin hair and was hoping this would help. First, I must say I have a friend who recommended this to me since it has helped her (her hair has become thicker, but it&#x27;s not as if she became Rapunzel :p). I guess I&#x27;m in the minority here but this product made me break out, and break out bad! I do have acne-prone/oily skin but have not had a break out like that since my early teens. (the large, hard nodular under the skin pimples) I took them for five days but obviously had to stop, the acne went away right after too. I gave this product two stars since it seems to have helped my friend (who claimed it took her about 4 months before she saw improvement). I hope it works better for someone else but if you have acne prone skin, just take it with caution and monitor yourself! Best of luck to everyone else, I&#x27;ll continue on my journey for another product.</li>
            <li> This stuff seriously works. I was impressed. I got a haircut a month ago and my hair immediately started growing while using this product. And my hair is a little thicker. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that my hair seems like it has more split ends when it grows with this stuff but I guess that&#x27;s up to me to condition it. Anyway I like this product overall. It also helps with my skin, my face barely ever gets pimples anymore and I eat a lot of sugar.</li>
            <li> After taking Viviscal for 3 weeks, and using the elimination method to find out what was making me sick, I realized it was Viviscal. This product messed up my bowel movement. Straight up diarrhea for 2 days. Also a mild headache for a whole day and got light headed a couple of times too. This product might be great for other people but it&#x27;s Definitely NOT for me. I sent mine back for a refund.</li>
            <li> It was to strong for me. Had a slight reaction causing swelling and dryness on my eyes.</li>
            <li> Listen, I&#x27;m as skeptical as they come.  But I&#x27;ve been using this once daily for about 3 months and I can tell you I e a difference.  Especially with the little baby hairs around the forehead. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I am trying to give an extra boost to my short hair and I have noticed it growing a little quicker...not overnight results but I will be patient</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Biotin in the past and it works... *ahem* everywhere... but I found that it broke me out with cystic acne - a rare occasion for me since most of my skin issues are hormonal and on the surface.  I figured Viviscal must be worth a try, and after having a baby and losing handfuls of hair for almost 2 years straight I&#x27;d try anything.  Well, I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months, not that religiously because I am bad at remembering to take vitamins... but for the past 2 weeks I&#x27;ve been using morning and night, as directed.  MASSIVE cystic zit on my cheek that will not be tamed.  I have yet to see results as far as my hair is concerned, other than that my eyebrows and upper lip are a bit more hirsute.  I had to try Viviscal but I am not glad I did.</li>
            <li> Has really hep my hair it&#x27;s has gotten really thicker</li>
            <li> I have been taking this product for two months now and have not seen any hair growth. I will continue to take it for another month or so to see if that makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I posted a negative review a while back!  I said it worked, but I also had peach fuzz growing on my face so I had to stop taking Viviscal.&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you, I regret stopping!  My hair was getting noticeably thicker after 3 months and when I stopped taking the pills my hair thinned out over a few months gradually.  I think it&#x27;s worth that face peach fuzz which can easily be waxed off and now I&#x27;m starting from square one again and miss that thicker hair I was feeling. It&#x27;s funny that the thickness didn&#x27;t stay. So I guess you just have to keep taking the pills!</li>
            <li> I have been using this from 2 months..I can see my hair growth I.e only length of my hair but doesn&#x27;t control my hair fall 😔</li>
            <li> these tablets are much bigger and not sure if they are working as well as previous Visvical they look fake</li>
            <li> The best hair growth product I have ever found.  I love the added benefit of having my eyebrows grow thicker because they are usually very fine and hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li> I like the viviscal tablets &amp; take them everyday.  I haven&#x27;t taken it very long &amp; hope that it will make my hair come out thicker as I keep using it.</li>
            <li> I have been using these supplements for the past 4 months and my hair is definitely more healthy. It has become thicker and noticeably longer. I am sure that it affects everyone different but I think you have to take it consecutively for at least months before you see any results. Prior to me using these , my hair was breaking and thinning, mainly due to a certain medication I&#x27;m taking. I think it is was of the best kept secrets for hair care. I first heard about it on one of Dr. Oz&#x27;s shows.</li>
            <li> I also bought one for myself because of my thinning hair and frizziness.  My sister is so happy with the product that she recommended it to me.  She told me that it will take a month to notice something.  I am taking it for a week now and noticed that there are very few falling hairs after I shower.  I am happy with this progress and will continue to take it for the recommended 6 months.  I hope that this will give me more benefits.  I&#x27;ll just wait and see the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was fast and I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have written a few reviews in the past... but you will notice I only take the time to write a review when the product is either extremely good or extremely bad.  This product is GREAT !!  I have been using for about a month now and I can see tiny hair growing back in the thin areas that had receded. I showed this to my hair stylist and she is going to recommend it to her clients.  If you have thinning hair ..you really do want to try Viviscal extra strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I would skip all other vitamins for fear they \\&quot;MIGHT\\&quot; work but they also may not...and order this one.&lt;br /&gt;I mean really...Check the reviews and the amount of reviews.  As far as a pimple around my nose (???) which someone mentioned....I have not had any issues at all.</li>
            <li> I have noticed my thinning hair for the past couple years.  I have hypothyroidism, which does not help this situation.  I literally noticed in around 1 week about 1/4 of the hair shedding than what I used have in the shower.  It is absolutely working.</li>
            <li> I noticed that my eyebrows filled in first and then started seeing more hair on the sides of my &amp;#34;bangs&amp;#34; - where it had really been thinning. But it didn&#x27;t thicken up like I had hoped, but I am not as thin as I had been. But you have to continue taking them or you will start thinning again - and it is costly</li>
            <li> I am 37 and have medium length wavy brown hair which has thinned out over the last few years and just won&#x27;t grow to previous length. I&#x27;ve never had long hair and I know I can&#x27;t change that but wanted to restore my hair to previous healthy condition. I tried many things over the last 3-4 years but nothing seem to make a difference. I started Viviscal first in 2012 for 2 months, didn&#x27;t see a difference and gave up due to the steep price. Then my hairdresser insisted that Viviscal works but she told me give it 6 months, so I did and I noticed new growth and my hair now, 8-9 months later feels much thicker and healthier. I haven&#x27;t changed my habits otherwise, no new supplements or diet; the only other thing that I have been doing is rubbing a few drops of castor oil (sometimes coconut oil instead) in the roots of my hair the night before (I wash my hair every other night). I started using castor oil long before Viviscal so I can&#x27;t trace the changes back to the oil but it may have an effect too, although I didn&#x27;t see the difference until 3-4 months on Viviscal.</li>
            <li> after 1 month there was a difference and after 3 months there was noticeable hair thickness. Take with food or it causes a little discomfort.</li>
            <li> This product caused my face to break out. When I discontinued, the breakouts stopped. I would not recommend this product for everyone.</li>
            <li> My stylist asked why my hair was so long. 😊</li>
            <li> This stuff works.  I saw results with 3 weeks.  However it also made my skin break out with huge cyctic acne!!!  Quit after 2.5 months.</li>
            <li> After using for 1 month, I can say that I see a difference in my hair. I plan to continue using for at least the recommended 4 months before officially deciding whether or not to recommend to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  This doesn&#x27;t work, it is just another gimmick to get you to buy the product.  1 star.</li>
            <li> I order this product says 60tablets, but it only came with 40 tablets in it????? I counted two packs of 20each!!!</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product after seeing it on Dr. Oz, but I didn&#x27;t have much hope since many other shampoos and topical products did not seem to help my very thinning hair.  I did not see much of a change the first three months, but now, after taking Vivical twice a day for the last six months, there is a very definite improvement.  Even my grandaughter, who just turned 13, noticed and told me my hair was getting thicker!  I couldn&#x27;t have been more pleased and I will continue to use Viviscal with the hope that improvement will continue.</li>
            <li> Product has improved hair texture.  My problem is remembering to take the tablets every day.  I would recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I am over 50 and my hair is thinning especially on the top.  Within just a few weeks of trying this my hair has become&lt;br /&gt;visably thicker.  Also I need haircuts more often.  Even my hairdresser noticed</li>
            <li> So far, I have been taking this supplement for almost a month and I have noticed my hair is a bit thicker. I&#x27;m trying to make it grow long for my wedding in 6 months.</li>
            <li> I like it. I ordered it to grow back my eyebrows. Not sure if its helping because im using a serum as well. But my hair has shown growth which is really nice. I just had it permed and its been horrible. With the pills i see alot of a difference.</li>
            <li> Excellent prices and super fast shipping on this top of the line product that helps hair shedding and encourages hair growth. Recommended to me by top hair colorist in NYC - there is a noticeable change after just one month!</li>
            <li> I have tried using a shampoo, conditioner and leave in spray for close to 2 years, with no noticeable change.  It helped slow down hair loss, but not by much and did nothing else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been taking Viviscal for about 2 1/2 months.  Within the first 2 weeks I could see significant improvement in how much hair I was loosing in the shower and my hair brush.  Within the 1 month I could feel my hair texture change.  It&#x27;s much stronger and thicker.  At 2 1/2 months now I feel it&#x27;s pretty much the same - less hair loss and still thicker and stronger.  I have been using less products to make my hair look better (volume, shine, etc), so that&#x27;s nice too!  I do feel like my hair gets oiler quicker (but that could also be the hot summer weather too!).  I&#x27;m going to take it for the six months, like they suggest.  So hopefully I will see more improvement by the end.  Actual new hair growth would be amazing and the only thing missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I am very happy with the results.  Other than the oilyish hair, I see no other side affects.  Taking it twice a day can be a pain, but worth it in the end!  Only 4 stars for now.  If it keeps improving I&#x27;ll change it to 5!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several years. I do think my fragile hair is stronger when I use it, and notice the difference when I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> Only on it a month, but nothing is happening for me or my husband.  We will give it a little longer, then will stop.  It is too expensive to use a product for months just to find out it does not work.  This one is advertised as &amp;#34;extra strength&amp;#34; but the &amp;#34;men&#x27;s&amp;#34; version has more of the supposed key ingredient.  I don&#x27;t know what they are trying to do.  I hate false advertising.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since January (5 months) and I&#x27;ve definitely seen a big decrease in daily post-shower shedding.  I intentionally did not mention using this to my hairdresser to see if she would notice.  The FIRST MONTH, within 10 seconds of sitting in her chair, she grabbed my hair and remarked how THICK it felt, and asked me if I was taking a supplement.  I&#x27;ve even noticed my middle-aged (formerly long and lush) eyelashes growing back in thick and long!  I thought they were gone for good.  I would like to see more noticeable growth on the top of my head, but I&#x27;m hopeful.</li>
            <li> It appears to be working but I haven&#x27;t been taking it long enough to k ow for sure--my hair began thinning due to medication</li>
            <li> I used this in the past and had stopped. Started up the past two months and I already notice thicker hair!</li>
            <li> I Received the product on time, and I just started taking the pills. I will update later on my experience.</li>
            <li> I think I am beginning to see new, fine hair growing in the thin batches above my temples (I am female).  It might also be wishful thinking.  I&#x27;ve been taking it for only two months and a week or so, and it&#x27;s not enough time to see results.  Viviscal does not upset my stomach.</li>
            <li> I read about this product in an article written by Dr. Leslie Baumann who said it was good for both hair and nails. I have always had horribly weak nails and have tried all kinds of things over the years to get stronger nails. While Biotin and Nailtiques are both helpful, I was curious enough after reading reviews to try this for my nails. In just one week, I could feel that my nails were getting stronger. I went on vacation for two weeks and when I got back went in for a mani/pedi with my regular manicurist, but didn&#x27;t say anything about taking this product. While she was doing the pedicure, she noticed my nails and commented about how much better they looked. When she did the manicure she was so astounded about the improvement in my nails that we had everyone in the salon asking about the product. I am beyond elated about the improvement in my nails. i have been taking the pills for 23 days and just in the past couple of days have started to sense that my thin, fine hair feels bouncier with more volume than normal. I am 63 and have one eyebrow with less hair than the other and am starting to notice new growth in my problem eyebrow. If I just get great nails and eyebrows from using this product, I would be thrilled, but to think that it will improve the appearance of my hair, as well, wow, what a wonderful find!</li>
            <li> These vitamins have changed their formula as they make me break out in bad acne ..</li>
            <li> Viviscal definitely stopped hair loss. Concerning thinning, well, it&#x27;s hard to say. I will keep buying it though.</li>
            <li> I use to purchase viviscal when I was in Europe and you couldn&#x27;t purchase them in the USA.i watched my hair strengthen and grow several times, while using this product. No side affects, just hair growth. I recommend this product 1000percent.</li>
            <li> Thanks Viviscal.I like all products.It is really work! I am going to recommtnd it my friends</li>
            <li> Wonderful!  It makes my hair thicker.  It has slowed down the onset of alopecia.</li>
            <li> Definitely noticed my hair stopped falling out within 2weeks of starting these. Hair growth was seen within 3 months, but per dermatologist could take up to 3months. Recommended by a derm for me. Buy on Amazon since cheapest price. I alternate with this one &amp;amp; the professional grade. Take biotin 5mg daily as well, prescribed by another great derm.</li>
            <li> I bough this product after reading about it in a magazine then I heard that Dr. Oz had an episode with this product, I tried it and so far the product seems to be working only after a few weeks. will definitely buy this again, the price is good and the result is good. I have had problems with thinning hair at the temples and tried many things now there is the appearance of hair, hope that it lasts.</li>
            <li> Still working on it and not yet seen any results until end of August 2013.  I have started to take it on February 1, 2013 to see if it helps me.  But I have thyroid issues and will be seeing the endocrinologist about it.</li>
            <li> it defective pills they selling and i advise you not to buy it or u be wasting money for sure</li>
            <li> This supplement makes my face break out with cystic acne.  I couldn&#x27;t figure out why, at 38 years old, all of the sudden I was breaking out.  I eliminated almost every food that could be causing it, changed my skin regimen, etc.  finally I tried stopping this, and my acne cleared up within a month!  Blackheads, clogged pores, repeated acne spots- all caused by this supplement!  Just be aware!</li>
            <li> I was using vivisal for 4 months and it was working great.  Noticed hair growth and it was thicker.  Then I ordered more and noticed the packaging was different.  Did think anything of it.  Started taking it and was having heart palpitations.  I looked at the ingredients and they have added iron 10mg.  I am a woman that has gone through menopause and should not have more then 8 mg of iron a day. This is per Dr. Oz and WebMD and my doctor.  This was too much iron and I had to stop taking them.  I didn&#x27;t want to, because the old ones were working so good.  Now I have to find something else to use.  When things work well they should leave it along.  Sorry to say they lost a customer from this.  I hope that all women that have gone through menopause be carefull and check with your doctor first.</li>
            <li> After I started losing my hair I was in a panic so my recently deceased Mother is actually the one responsible for my using the product. I only wish it was less expensive so I could purchase it more often. My hair is quite thicker than it used to be thanks to this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I have used Viviscal for about a month and I have seen some hair growth. It is not a miraculous amount but I can now part my hair without the part looking like a bald spot. I am over fifty and my hair loss seemed to increase daily. I never considered myself a vain person but hair loss really bothered me. I plan to continue using this product. Please note I did experience some sheading especially when I used a narrow comb. I try to use a wide tooth comb whenever possible now.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of thin hair but with menopause and age I have been losing it.  trying to grow my hair out seems like mission impossible.  I swim/and run and I color my hair.  My hair has no chance with menopause/age and lifestyle.  I use a few products and this is one of them.  cant say if its the combination or just one of the following but I am not going to stop now.  my hair looks and feels healthier and has grown so long, I could not grow before.  It seems thicker.  Whatever I am doing I am doing it right now.  This is part of my regimine which includes.&lt;br /&gt;Viviscal 2 x a day&lt;br /&gt;Biotin 5 mg&lt;br /&gt;neuticell collegan II &amp; III</li>
            <li> Been trying to find something to help with my hair loss. Dr. thinks it&#x27;s female pattern baldness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice more (read new) hair growing during the 6-8 months I took this. However, it did help me retain the hair that I still had (i.e. slowed the rate of shedding.)  Once I stopped the supplements, the amount of hair that I shed returned to pre-Viviscal amounts. It was triple the amount while I was taking Viviscal. I guess it helped me hold onto hair that was in the telogen phase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair did grow at a slightly faster rate than before as well. Overall though, I think I could&#x27;ve gotten the same results taking some generic biotin and other vitamins myself. Not worth the $50-60 price tag (for 60 tablets). If it&#x27;s $25-30, maybe.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for three months, and I can truly see the difference in hair.  I was experiencing thinning in the crown of my head, and now I see more fullness in this area.  Yes, I would recommend this product to someone is experiencing the same, and someone like myself who is coming out of 25+/- years of a relaxer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m of an age and who knows if it&#x27;s working but I keep taking it just in case ;-)  I used to have very thick hair, so I&#x27;m trying NOT to lose any more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually not one to leave rave reviews, but this product is pretty amazing. I had my haircolor refreshed and one week later had new growth showing. Seeing as my hairdresser ordered her own box the next day, that pretty much tells you how impressed she was by my results.</li>
            <li> IVE BEEN TRYING TO GROW MY HAIR OUT FOREVER, TAKING EVERY VITAMIN RECOMMENDED, WHICH NEVER SEEMED TO WORK. AFTER PURCHASING THIS PRODUCT I NOTICED A DIFFERENCE IN THE RATE OF HAIR GROWTH AFTER A MONTH. NOW, 6 MONTHS LATER IM HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS, ALTHOUGH IM GOING TO HAVE TO CONTINUE TO TAKE IT TWICE A DAY TO KEEP THE RESULTS. OVERALL, IT WORKS AS PROMISED.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and it works well, just give it the 90 days to definitely see results.  The coupon in the box was a nice surprise also.  It&#x27;s nice to be able to purchase this item online.  VIVISCAL has worked for me and I would recommend it to anyone wishing to regrow their hair.  All you do is take two tablets a day and they are an easy to swallow size too.  I love it and it was cheaper online than at the drugstore, even on sale with a coupon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given this product 3 stars because I still have not seen any results as far as more new hairs growing on my head. I do have to say that the falling of hairs during washes has subsided but my hair still looks thin. I do see short new hairs but the amount hasn&#x27;t changed. I am on my 6th month and I&#x27;m still on a 2 pill per day regimen. On the 2nd month taking Viviscal Extra Strength my scalp started to itch like crazy, and I read that many women go through this phase. Also, I&#x27;ve never suffered from acne my whole life but I started having a little acne problem on my face, chest, and back after Viviscal. The box package hasn&#x27;t changed since I started taking it but the pills&#x27; package comes in straight lines or diagonally. I hope this review helps.</li>
            <li> I have been using viviscal for about 6 months. It has made my hairgrow like wildfire and also my nails.It has taken about 5 months to get a lot of new hair,especially around the front hairline,and really all over my head.My hair was getting thiner on the top but not anymore.  I used Rogaine but it did just about nothing.It is hard to believe it works so great but it sure does.I have no complaints just praise for it.Everyone with thinning hair should use this.It did take a few months for my nails to start growing but now i cannot believe these are MY NAILS!!!I will keep on using this product, but if i did stop would the new growth come out? Ihope this is not the case!</li>
            <li> After cutting and dying my hair over and over again within one year, my hair literally stopped growing and was extremely thin and short... i tried biotin and the hair skin and nail vitamins but NOTHING worked, i even went through a bottle of prenatal vitamins because i was so deperate to get my long thick hair back!!&lt;br /&gt;Viviscal was recommened by a stylist at ted gibson, and it WORKS! ive finished my first pack and im ordering my second now, my roots are two inches!!&lt;br /&gt;you will also see a difference in your eyebrows, they will definatly come in thicker.&lt;br /&gt;Im so excited to be seeing so much healthy growth!! my hair is on the way to becoming like it used to be!</li>
            <li> I started taking this product over a year ago due to some damage from being a frequent &amp;#34;hi-lighter.&amp;#34;  I experienced a lot of new growth, faster growth and my hairdresser even commented on the strength of my hair. Added benefits: stronger nails and better skin.  It&#x27;s all connected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually do a month on, a month off and depending on the season I might take it every other day.  I usually only take one tablet per day.  I highly reccomend this product to women and men who want a little extra oomph and growth for their hair.</li>
            <li> Did NOTHING for me!  Money wasted!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to and really hoped this product would work for me.  The positive reviews were numerous and the negative/side effects really only centered around breakouts.  I used to have adolescent acne but was entirely manageable, not bad and to this day use still love using my Proactiv products, skin is clear and great, so I thought if this at all happened to me, it would not be that bad and breakout i could manage.  WRONG, dead wrong!! NEVER ever have i experienced an acne breakout like this and one that is a little painful.  I started see some whiteheads on my jawline and my checks, didn&#x27;t think too much of it - was in the sun and wearing sunscreen and thought it was the sweat.  But then, I worked out, wore a sports bra (usual routines) and when i took it off, the amount of acne and rash that was now visible on my upper back was disgusting and nothing like i had ever seen before, let alone on my own body! It covered my entire upper back, incredibly red and little bumps everywhere with some areas of large bumps that were painful like a bruise.  I read other reviews were people experienced cystic breakouts - i had never even heard of that before and when i checked out pictures online, sure enough that was what i was seeing on my back!  To never ever have experienced something like this before, it is incredibility disheartening that a product can produce such a side effect on someone who does not normally breakout and do not consider myself to have sensitive skin (some find Proactiv incredibly sensitive to them and it has worked great for me).  Its summertime and with how my back looks currently, it&#x27;ll be WEEKS before i&#x27;ll be able to show my back, wear a tank top or a bathing suit. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hardly ever write reviews on anything i buy (like almost never) but wanted to share my experience with this product because i have just been searching and searching for a good hair growth product and thought this may have been it.  I probably only took 5 or 6 pills when side effects starting occurring and now looking back on other symptoms, i had one day with a crippling headache (i hardly ever get them) where it felt like i had a brain freeze all day and other days had stomach cramps that i just thought not much of.  I would be weary to anyone looking to buy this product who even fears slightly about breaking out and thinking it can be managed...this is NOTHING like i have ever experienced before and have never been so disappointed after purchasing a product with so many good reviews.  BE CAREFUL!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a problem with my hair, but when I reached 50, it seemed to be thinning. I don&#x27;t know if it was stress or age, but I needed to try and stop it. I did some research and found Viviscal. After taking it for 2-3 months, my hair has grown more than it has in years! It has thickend up as well. I intend to continue using this product. A friend told me the biotin was good for hair growth as well, so I looked and found 10,000 mcg on Amazon, and take that as a supplement as well. So glad I found out about these two products! I have NEVER written a review like this, but who know, it might help somebody! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 1.5 months and my hair feels so much healthier.  I can&#x27;t tell yet if my hair on my hairline is growing back or if it just seems fuller.  I love it either way and have actually received comments on my hair a lot!</li>
            <li> Be careful if you take thyroid meds or have thyroid issue.  This interfered with my Armour dose and my &#x27;roid crashed!  Not the fault of the supplement, but this isn&#x27;t for everyone!  The marine complex apparently contains kelp and iodine.  Thyroid patients must be very careful with this stuff.  I had to quit , but I know for a fact it works like a champ for a lot of other, thy-healthy people.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a difference</li>
            <li> This really, really works. Have several friends that also had excellent results taking this product after chemo. Hair came back shiny and thicker than before chemo treatment.</li>
            <li> It has made my hair grow a lot. It&#x27;s worth the money. I have been taking it for about a year and my hair has never been better. It works you just need to take it for a while.</li>
            <li> I am 22 years old and I am under a lot of stress at work in the shipyard. I took this pill for 60 days and it kind of slowed down the hair loss process for awhile.</li>
            <li> These vitamins work. I took phytophanere for two months and never noticed a difference. Switched to these about a month ago and they are amazing. My hair is shoulder length so it&#x27;s hard to say exactly how much longer it is, but I can see the difference.  Also having to shave, wax, and cut my nails more but that&#x27;s ok as long as my hair finally grows!!  I read they can make you break out. I was taking 2 a day and got one small pimple (I never break out) I switched to once a day and haven&#x27;t had problems and still see results. :)</li>
            <li> I went through one pack of these and I&#x27;m not so sure they work?  They are sort of expensive so I think I&#x27;ll still to biotin or prenatals which I think are more effective.</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT EXPENSIVE BUT IF YOU WANT YOUR HAIR TO GROW THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT TO SUPPLIMENT YOUR DIET</li>
            <li> its not about all the hoopla it receives just ok , but not fantastic fast growing</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.  It definitely makes your hair grow. I do not stop taking it. It is very, very good and definitely works!</li>
            <li> I know your thinking does this really work? Should I spend this kind of money? Same thing I thought. I have been taking it 2 months and I can see a lot of new hair growth around my hair line! I lost so much hair after stopping birth control pills a year ago and wasn&#x27;t noticing it growing back. If you naturally have thin hair I don&#x27;t think this will give you more hair but will give you length. I have always had thick hair so I think its just like fertilizer for the follicles! Have noticed longer nails and lashes as well. It does take time, I&#x27;m finishing 2nd month and just now seeing the new hairs popping out.</li>
            <li> I had previously bought Viviscal and it worked great. I reordered and noticed that it seemed to stop working. I went to my local CVS and bought another package. I realized that the pills I just bought from CVS were like my first batch but the second batch that I bought from Amazon was different. I think the second batch are counterfeit pills and that&#x27;s why they didn&#x27;t work. I had both batches fulfilled by Amazon but I think the second batch was fake.</li>
            <li> I have been taking 1 a day for 2 months (only on weekdays) and I&#x27;ve noticed my hair grows SO much faster. I&#x27;ve had it trimmed twice already and my stylist is shocked at how fast it&#x27;s growing! I have been dealing with hair shedding/thinning due to hormonal changes and it hasn&#x27;t helped with that, but it does make the new hair that&#x27;s coming in grow much faster. Added bonus, my nails have become very strong and long which I have never had in my life and my eyelashes are very long..like false lashes! I will continue to take these as I love the results!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waited 7 months to give this product a review.  I worked for a dermatologist for many years and know that it takes at least  4 months for a supplement to even reach the scalp.  However, I did notice a slight change in the growth rate after about 3 months. My hair was growing about 3/4 of an inch per month instead of it&#x27;s normal 1/2 inch.  I could tell because I am a brunette with grey in the front.  Now at 7 months I&#x27;d say my hair is a little stronger and healthier.  It does not grow super fast.  It had a spurt but is now back to 1/2 an inch per month.  I had a few inches cut off recently which really helped me to notice the health of the newer hair.  I have bangs and they were getting very wispy, but now they are a little easier to style.  My hairline is the same and I don&#x27;t notice a lot of new hair and my hair is still fine, but it&#x27;s worth using.  I took 2 everyday for 6 months and am now going to continue with 1 a day.  In the beginning it did make me constipated and gave me slight stomach upset, but that&#x27;s to be expected from the iron content.  I started using a magnesium drink every night which helped with that and is super good for you anyway.  I use the product &amp;#34;Calm&amp;#34; which can be purchased on Amazon as well.  Other than that I did not gain weight or have sleep issues.  That maybe placebo.  Also, if you&#x27;re not eating fiber or taking magnesium I could see mistaking the bloat for gaining weight.  Overall, it&#x27;s a good product to use if you have fine hair, but it&#x27;s not going to totally change from super fine to mega thick.</li>
            <li> Have high blood pressure made my heart speed up, I stopped using.</li>
            <li> Has strengthen my hair. Its thicker and has grown..thumbs up👍</li>
            <li> This product DOES contribute to hair health. It might not give you the glorious hair you may be looking for, but it does work. I already have thick hair so I can&#x27;t review on that aspect. However, my length has impressed my friends, family, and myself!  When you&#x27;re 40 something, face it, your hair doesn&#x27;t grow at the rate it used to.&lt;br /&gt;The best part was my experience with this seller. USPS ignored all of my inquiries regarding my package and I emailed the seller regarding this incident. The seller promptly sent me a replacement. I&#x27;m happy with the product and I&#x27;m happy with whom I gave my business to.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after taking Viviscal for 2 weeks I broke out in a miserable rash around my neck and then on my chest.  After I discontinued taking the tablets the rash receded.  Was so looking forward to thicker hair.</li>
            <li> It takes awhile of continued use, but I believe there has been a positive change in my hair.  New growth and a shine.  I have ordered additional package.</li>
            <li> This seems to be actually working! The hair that was missing around my hair line is starting to come back. I will continue taking this medicine for the recommended 3-6 months to see just how helpful it is.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as I noticed my hair thinning.  I stopped taking the product as it&#x27;s made from shark bits.  I won&#x27;t buy it again.  Instead, I take biotin and omega three fish oil.  Yeah, I&#x27;m taking a fish product but it&#x27;s not shark.  Sharks are now overfished.</li>
            <li> I started using viviscal 3 months ago. I do see a difference as far as I am not losing near as much hair as I had been. It recommends using&lt;br /&gt;6 months to get full results. The delivery is speedy and I am very happy with this seller and this product.</li>
            <li> After years of hair loss issues, I have finally found something that works! I have tried everything, particularly after having two children and going through hair loss situations after both births.  I have only been taking this product for a month (along with Biotin supplements in the morning) and am noticing an incredible amount of growth.  I was losing hair in clumps so that my scalp was clearly visible.  All these little new hairs are growing in the patchy areas and I can now wear my hair naturally without worrying someone will notice anything was ever missing.  I never thought I&#x27;d find a solution.  I can honestly say I&#x27;m so glad I never have to worry about this problem again.  I hope!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working wonderfully!!  My hair is shiny, healthy and strong!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about 2 months now and haven&#x27;t seen any difference :(&lt;br /&gt;will keep on using it hopefully I will see something soon.</li>
            <li> great service and great price</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever had a problem with thinning hair, you have to give this a try. It restores volume and health to your hair.</li>
            <li> I took Viviscal extra strength for about ten days and experienced severe headaches</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and was hoping this product would help. I got three month&#x27;s worth and I think I gave it a fair trial. It did nothing for me so I was very disappointed in it.</li>
            <li> Txs for the prompt shipping.  I have great hopes on this product as it was a recommendation from a friend who is enjoying the natural beauty of his hair growth!!  I hope I&#x27;m next!!!  Txs!</li>
            <li> It really has made a difference.</li>
            <li> Tried these for over a year and they didn&#x27;t seem to improve my hair growth.  Too bad, was hoping for better results (especially since they are so expensive).</li>
            <li> It does what it says...it makes your hair healthy from the inside out and it also promotes hair growth. Great product!</li>
            <li> I believe I have noticed a difference in my hair.  Easier to manage someone, texture seems a tad looser?  Perhaps it is the over all health of the hair that has improved.  I will keep using the product.</li>
            <li> I have spent this money on Viviscal for 6 months. I was really hoping to see growth, since my hair has been going through a major shedding phase. Sadly, I&#x27;ve just seen more shedding...this product might work for someone who already has super lush healthy hair, to help maintain the quality, but people with gorgeous hair, probably don&#x27;t waste their money on crap like this. Maybe it will work for someone else, I&#x27;ve just lost more hair and money through the process. :-(</li>
            <li> Three weeks in, and I can already tell a difference. There has been a definite decrease in the amount of hair I am losing (due to various medical issues) and I am seeing new growth as well. Another area I can see a huge difference in is my lashes. Holy cow have they gone from mini to major. A friend I hadn&#x27;t seen for several weeks asked me if I was wearing false lashes on a day when I wasn&#x27;t even wearing mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the pills themselves, no gastrointestinal problems from the supplements, and I verified that nothing in formula would interact with any of the medications I take. I have to admit it is nice to finally see results without dealing with heartburn or upset stomach as an unexpected &amp;#34;bonus&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything to happen until after several weeks of taking this supplement, and even then didn&#x27;t think it would work as well as it did. It&#x27;s great to be proven wrong like this. If you are experiencing hair loss due to hypothyroidism or post GVS surgery, give this supplement a try.</li>
            <li> This works from inside out...lots of new hair</li>
            <li> Yes it works!  My hair for the last 10 years has only grown just below my shoulders and than it stops growing.  I have been taking Viviscal for only 30 days and my hair since being cut 3 weeks ago has preceding below my shoulders. It&#x27;s grown at least an inch in 30 days. I&#x27;m impressed and will continue taking in hopes that my hair will continue to grow</li>
            <li> Great as part of a healthy hair regimen. I didn&#x27;t measure hair growth with a ruler but along with deep conditioning and virgin coconut oil, my hair grew like weeds. I am African American and it made my hair grow out fast.</li>
            <li> Made me have to go to the bathroom all the time made me so sick to my stomach I couldn&#x27;t even take one pill every now n then to use the up :(</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It works</li>
            <li> My stylist said she does see a difference in my hair. I know it will take a while for it to really work. Good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been taking it for a month but I&#x27;m shedding less n my hair looks thicker .I&#x27;ve tried lots of things but this is the only thing I&#x27;ve seen a difference with.</li>
            <li> I keep writing a review for this. Don&#x27;t know why its not getting posted. Great product, works, on time. will buy again.</li>
            <li> usually i don&#x27;t write reviews cause i do not have time. but i decided to stop 1 min to say that it really works! I had taken 60 tablets and my hair had grown a lot! I had always have my lonnnnng hair and for a problem with the clorine from a pool it went green and i had to cut it and was extremely unhappy... now I am starting to feel my hair is back! just after 1 month!!! I just bought 60 more!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen results yet but still hopeful.  I&#x27;ve only used this for 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> IN SIX MONTHS MY HAIR HAS DOUBLED IN VOLUME. I;VE TRIED EVERY PRODUCT ON THE MARKET AND VIVISCAL WORKS !!!</li>
            <li> I first learned about Viviscal tablets from a model on a photo shoot.  Having not seen her in a year, then she came strolling in with this great head of hair.  She spoke of using Viviscal daily.  Seeing the difference in her hair prompted me to try it.  I have to say my hair looks and feels great!  I have been using Viviscal for three years now and I love that my hair is super strong and vibrant.  In 2013 I bleached my hair to bone white and kept it that way through the following year, all the while using Viviscal.  It really helped my hair from taking the beating from bleaching.  That and keeping it trimmed.  I finally grew it all out and have my natural color back.  Through it all my hair never stopped looking good.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It does what it says it will and it makes your lashes beautiful too.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  It really works!  Not only is my hair getting healthier and fuller, but my skin is nicer!  I decided to get automatic shipping every month so I don&#x27;t ever run out, and it&#x27;s way cheaper!  My hair stylist says she can even tell my hair has gotten healthier.  It takes a good 3 months or so to kick in, but it&#x27;s worth the wait.  I&#x27;ll never go without it!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been almost 3 months and o see no hair growth</li>
            <li> not one new hair in a month.  dont want to wait 6 months and lots of $$ later wasted to see it not working too.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say whether this has helped for sure, but I have been using it for three months and I truly think I see more &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; hairs growing.  I&#x27;ve re-ordered 2 more months and will keep at it.  I&#x27;ll write again!  ( I have noticed my hair is probably growing a bit faster).</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with biotin, horsetail, and folic acid to help my hair be strong and grow faster.  I think this stuff works wonders.  I can notice a difference when I stopped using it for a short time.  My hair grows fast and sheds a lot less when I use this.  It is also in great shape (but I rarely ever blow dry or curl it and try to only wash once a week).</li>
            <li> After finding out severe anemia was causing hair loss I found this product and have been taking it for almost a year.  After about two weeks on this I started to notice a LOT of baby hairs growing back!  At about 4 weeks my hair stylist asked me if I was doing something different because she couldnt believe the amount of new hair I had!  Ive been a faithful user and my hair is now back to its long and thick norm!</li>
            <li> I love this product for my hair, but need the other hair care products to go with the vitamins.  Shampoo and conditioner are available, but I need a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product!! It really works!! My hair has definitely filled in!! I will continue to buy this product!</li>
            <li> I am SO sad.  I used Viviscal for about 3 years, had GREAT luck growing more hair.  Then I re-ordered, either from this company or another one, and my hair began (quickly) to thin, fall out, change texture.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the fault of this company, from what I hear it is the fault of Viviscal, which changed the formula somehow.  Whatever, it&#x27;s a rip off now and it&#x27;s sad that whoever is behind this is doing it/allowing it to happen.</li>
            <li> I love the viviscal hair vitamins, but the product is exspensive!</li>
            <li> Tried it for two months, have not seen results, but what it did is give me horrible cystic acne on my face. Stopped taking for few weeks and my face cleared up. Started taking it again last week, since I had 3 mo supply, hoping it was not the case, but now my face is breaking out:( Not worth the side effect and the two deep scars I have on my face now due to acne:((</li>
            <li> Since I started taking Viviscal, I&#x27;ve noticed that my shedding has decreased.  Not so much regrowth, but at least I&#x27;m not losing as much hair as much as I was before taking the vitamins.</li>
            <li> Very good supplement ..My hair looks much healthier in 1 month......</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s working. I have new baby hairs growing everywhere.  However, it has made my skin so oily and break out. I&#x27;m going to give it the full 90 days though. I will update.</li>
            <li> Good product and does not repeat on me like other supliments have.</li>
            <li> Almost immediately upon taking Viviscal I began to feel tightness in my head and over my ears. headachy.  Within one week of taking Viviscal, for the first time in my 63 years, I had a major ocular migrane.  I kept taking Viviscal, but wondered if there was a link.  A week later, another ocular migrane.  I saw my PCP and also my Opthamologist.  Everything seemed normal, but was asked if I was doing anything,or taking anything different.  I stopped taking the Viviscal, and the symptoms have disappeared.  I spoke to two other friends who are also taking Viviscal, and they, too, have been having odd symptoms.  In the short month or so I took Viviscal, I did not see any postivie results, though I didn&#x27;t expect fast results.  But I would caution anyone from taking a supplement with a &amp;#34;trademark&amp;#34; product that is not well defined.</li>
            <li> I must like it because I keep buying it.  My hair is thin, both in diameter and number of hairs.  Unless I styled it just right, there were almost bald-looking areas that showed.  While I&#x27;ve used the product (three years), those areas have improved.  I still don&#x27;t have a thick head of hair, but at least it looks better.  At age 64, I guess I&#x27;ll have to settle for that.</li>
            <li> the product really works if you use it consistently&lt;br /&gt;My nails and hair are stronger and growing fast&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product for anyone with thinning hair</li>
            <li> I have taken these supplements for about three months and I can report a noticeable amount of hair growth, texture, and fullness. I have used other hair supplements that cause side effects such as bloating and constipation. That is not the case with these supplements. Thse are a fairly large size, similar to the size of most multivitamin capsules. If you have issues with capsules ingestion, you may need to consider another alternative. Additionally, I do recommend taking these with food to maximize the benefits. Lastly,  there is a loading dose of two pills per day for the first 30 days; therefore, keep this in mind when you make your purchase.</li>
            <li> I have been taking this for about 2 years now, ever since a devastatingly short haircut that I hated.  My hair grew back much faster!  I take one pill per day instead of the recommended two because two a day makes my skin greasy and break out.  One per day still gives me results though!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking the product less then a month and I&#x27;m losing hair but \\&quot;they\\&quot; say it takes about 3 months for the product to start working.  I&#x27;ll continue to take it and will see what happens.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of the vitamins but did not get to take them long enough to see if there was a response.  My subscription was canceled by Amazon due to lack of available product.</li>
            <li> I have not really given this a good trial yet but will.  The price for the product and the reviews for it is great.</li>
            <li> My hair is growing fine with this product. However, the spot in the back of my head is still thinning and balding. It is growing everywhere except in the top back part of my head.  I have used I for 4 months. for 2 years before that I kept losing hair. So I am certain that Viviscal helped my hair growth.</li>
            <li> Good price, for hard to find item. Delivery was fast and product was sealed as it should be. Not sure it really works though.</li>
            <li> Gave me terrible stomach pains</li>
            <li> I ordered this item and it says it was delivered but I never received it. It was not the company&#x27;s fault and I emailed them and they kindly refunded me. I&#x27;m giving 5 stars for the service!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom reordered the product and it has been working fabulously! It&#x27;s been about a month and you can tell her hair is longer and looking full.</li>
            <li> I am almost through my second month of taking Viviscal, and I can honestly say that I have seen very positive results.  Just the other day, I wanted to run a comb through my hair and couldn&#x27;t do it!  It is a fine, tooth comb that I normally use when I am going to use my curling iron. At first I thought my hair was dirty with too much product but then realized I had just washed my hair the day before. My hair is fuller and is growing faster.  I intend to continue using this product.  After my chemotherapy experience (8 years ago), my hair was never the same.  Loving my thicker hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update on my previous post.  I am almost at the end of my 6 month trial.  And although I have not appreciated the cost increases of the product over this time, I am still very impressed with the results.  I will continue to use it for a few months more and then change to the Viviscal \\&quot;nourish\\&quot; tablets.  But I want to be clear, not everyone has noticed that my hair is thicker but I have received a few comments. Having said that, my opinion is the only one that matters and I love it!</li>
            <li> I have only been taking viviscal for 3 1/2 weeks, and had to stop taking it yesterday.  I have been suffering from a horrible, itchy rash on my chest, which has now spread to my neck and now I have a swollen left eye!!!  I have never suffered from an allergic reaction after eating seafood, and I have no idea why I am having such an adverse reaction.  Not enough time has elapsed for me to tell any difference, except my hair seems softer, which makes it look even thinner.  I am a 46 year old mom, in great health and I exercise regularly.  I have been suffering from overall thinning for about 3 1/2 years now and it is really depressng.  I had such high hopes when I bought the Viviscal, and now I feel very hopeless.</li>
            <li> This is my second order for this product, and I must say I have absolutely fallen in love! I&#x27;ve tried other vitamins in the past and nothing has worked! A friend recommended this product to me a couple months ago, and I finally decided to try it! I am so impressed. I could actually tell that my hair was growing significantly, and the appearance was much thicker as well! I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I first learned of this product on Dr. Oz&#x27;s show and wanted to give this product a try...  I&#x27;ve used it for over 2 weeks and can&#x27;t tell any difference but the product saids it will take several months to see a real difference...  My hair lost is due to a divorce and stress over the last year so really need something to work as I&#x27;ve lost over half my hair...  I ordered the Viviscal Extra Strength Hair Nutrient Tablets through Amazon and was extremely pleased with how quickly I received the product...  Have always been really pleased with everything I ever order through Amazon...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my first pack and about 3 1/2 weeks in. What I have noticed so far is a reduction in shedding. I definitely started seeing less hair in brush and in the shower in the past week, so I&#x27;m gonna stick with it and order another pack</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m skeptical of products, however I came across this in my desperate search to help my hair grow. I&#x27;m on week 3 and not a huge change but I&#x27;ve had about almost a half inch of hair growth, which is really good for me, since my hair barely passes my shoulders without getting frizzy and breaking off. I&#x27;m satisfied so far and will review after 60 days.    UPDATE! I started this product on August 28th and October 26th will be day 60. I can say that I&#x27;ve had almost 2 inches of hair growth since I started. As stated in my previous review, my hair barely reaches 1/2 inch in a month, so I am extremely pleased so far. I am strict about taking 2 pills a day, no specific time, but I make sure I take 2 a day. My nails grow like crazy too. I didn&#x27;t see an instant change, as this takes time, but I will be taking these until month 6, as recommended by the program. I&#x27;m happy with 3/4 inch of hair growth per month, so to have 2 inches of growth is really awesome. As far as my skin breaking out, I had a few breakouts but I also have been taking Shizandra once a day and that seems to help clear my skin.</li>
            <li> No effect waste of money, buy rogaine instead.</li>
            <li> I started taking Viviscal after my negative reaction to my prescription birth control. Hair loss is associated with mirena and I was hoping it wouldn&#x27;t affect me but it did. My OGBYN recommended trying a supplement to combat these effects because I was dead set on having this form of birth control. It definitely helped slow down the hair loss. It took about 3 weeks before the results were noticeable but I was greatly appreciative once they were. My hair wasn&#x27;t coming back, but it was maintaining which was better than nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t start to regain hair until I started to taking another hair product in conjunction with the Viviscal tablets.  My sister suggested just taking biotin alone since there isn&#x27;t a lot of it in Viviscal but I started taking this one instead since the biotin count is so high per serving, plus has the other ingredients for hair growth; [[ASIN:B00MMA7W5C Hair Growth Essentials: #1 Rated Hair Loss Supplement for Women and Men - Advanced Hair Regrowth Treatment With 29 Powerful Hair Growth Vitamins &amp; Nutrients for Rapid Growth - 20 Day Supply]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between the two, I was able to begin to regain the growth I&#x27;d lost and my hair was growing in much stronger. It&#x27;s been about 5 months and the difference is truly staggering. I&#x27;m so happy I was able to find this combination and even more so that it all works together safely and didn&#x27;t counteract my other medications.</li>
            <li> Helped to strengthen my hair big time, getting ready to order more .</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I&#x27;ve been trying to grow my hair for years and finally I am close to my goal of waist length hair. I am an AA and I&#x27;ve been using Viviscal for almost 2 years. My hair is growing like crazy.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair from falling out.</li>
            <li> This product is too expensive for this amount of money there should be more than 60 vitamins. And the results should be faster than 3 to 6 months.</li>
            <li> Just started using it Will see how I come along with my hair in a couple of weeks</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t be without this. no more hair falling out!</li>
            <li> I have used this product with great results.  (really) My nails grew at least a half and inch in 2 weeks.  I have terrible nails but not now!  Although I have not noticed a huge difference in my hair, it does appear to be growing faster than normal.  I also take 1000mg of biotin WITH this product.  I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really experience bad hair loss, but I do have thin curly hair. As people with curly hair will agree, it falls out a lot and can sometimes be stressful. It&#x27;s just the nature of the hair. I love this supplement. It definitely decreases fallout and makes for thicker hair. I also notice when I take it regularly that my eye lashes are a lot longer and thicker. Also my nails grow a lot faster. My only complaint is the fishy taste of the pills.</li>
            <li> Viviscal works wonders! It performs exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I feel this is helping me even though I have used it for only 4 months. I have some areas that will never grow back.</li>
            <li> Just didn&#x27;t seem liked it worked for me at all and I used it for 3 months.i don&#x27;t know if my hair just seemed thicker because I wanted it to but def no noticeable growth :/</li>
            <li> Vote isn&#x27;t in yet since you have to take these for at least 3-6 months for results.</li>
            <li> Be warned if you have Rosacea as I do - this will inflame your face and make you ashamed to go out. Keep using vitamin D and Biotin products to nourish your hair if you have Rosacea as this product may help your hair but having a bumpy red face will make you feel worse. Do not use this product if you have Rosacea.</li>
            <li> I had read a lot about this product.  They have said to give it about 3 months, which I have.  I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference.&lt;br /&gt;Its not a bad product, I just won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> I used this in the past, but I needed more help. So I went to a Dermatologist and I&#x27;m now on a prescription medication along with using Rogaine.</li>
            <li> I became ill and lost a lot of my hair, especially around the front hairline. I have been using Viviscal faithfully for 3 months snd noticed thst my hair is growing back. It is a slow process, however, it is working.</li>
            <li> No results yet ... too soon to tell if product works</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed the results of using this product. My goal was thicker and longer hair - for years, I hadn&#x27;t been able to get it to grow longer than a certain point. I combined this product with vitamin B/folic acid and biotin supplements, tried to start treating my hair better (deep conditioner treatments, better hair products, less washing and use of styling tools), and cut back (pun) on highlighting and trimming it to just once every 4-6 months. I think after about 6 months I started to notice the length improving, and after 1 year there was definitely a significant difference - my hair was the longest it had been in 7 years. It has been 2 years now. In the second year, my hair hasn&#x27;t grown much longer than the length I achieved after 1 year, but I think it is significantly thicker and still improving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note: I noticed that whenever I took the product consistently/multiple days in a row, I would start to break out on my chin - and I don&#x27;t even have oily skin to begin with. To fix this, I would make sure to avoid putting cream on the problem area and only take the product every other day or so, instead of every single day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I would have is that it takes a long time to see the effects of product use, but I think that when it comes to hair growth, that&#x27;s just how things are.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful product, it turns ordinary into extraordinary. It&#x27;s one product that I give a 5 star review every single time. I love the compliments I receive, andI love giving referrrals even more.</li>
            <li> What an absolute waste of money... Should have just taken Biotin 5000 mg</li>
            <li> I think it definitely works, my hair gets thicker after 3 months and stops falling out as much!&lt;br /&gt;my hair falls out like crazy and breaks very very easily. I took this for 3 months straight and my hair got really good and stopped falling so much, then of course i took a month off because i was traveling and forgot to order more and .... my hair went to crap! its falling out soooo much and feels like it broke a lot. so I&#x27;ve started again I&#x27;m about a month into it and am still waiting for results. you need to be patient of course, but it does work....and keep it up. not sure if ill ever be able to stop taking it..maybe wispy dead hair will be in fashion one day soon :P</li>
            <li> VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED SELLER !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over 3 months and followed the directions and  still no significant hair growth at all.</li>
            <li> Great pills-I actually grew a new hair!</li>
            <li> Been using these for three months and noticing that I am losing less hair. Hope this continues as worth every penny if it does.</li>
            <li> This product does work.  I am 53 and my hair was thinning.  I have been using this for one month and I have a ton of new growth.  I can tell because the hair is a half inch long which is how much hair grows in a month.  I also have hair growth in other areas, but oh well. More shaving.  It is worth it!!!!</li>
            <li> I think it helps but cannot say for sure since I&#x27;m also taking other supplements.  But I feel it does cobtribute to the health of my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair starting thinning due to menopause. I just started my second month and I am already seeing results. My stylist said my hair is a lot thicker and I have new growth around my edges. I have also received many comments about how shiny my hair is. Like the other reviewers my nails are growing faster. My eyelashes are also longer.</li>
            <li> I am an African American woman.&lt;br /&gt;My hair was thinning due to stress,chemical use and perimenopause.&lt;br /&gt;Prior to using this product, I used hair Formula 37 for a month, then I used Hairfinity for 2 months. I&#x27;ve had good luck with all 3 products, although they affected my hair problem differently. With Hair Formula 37, I noticed a difference in the texture of my hair. It was much stronger. With Hairfinity,as advertised, my hair grew longer at a faster rate. However, since I was more concerned about the thinning areas of my hair, I thought I&#x27;d try this product. I have been using this product for a month and a half. I am pleased to report that the thinning areas of my hair are starting to fill in. I never ever thought I&#x27;d have hair at my hairline and temples again (I was getting a widow&#x27;s peak). But it is filling in.&lt;br /&gt;I must admit that I also take Biotin. So, that could also be contributing to my success.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to continue using this product for six months (until July), as recommended. I will then update my review.&lt;br /&gt;I forgot to add that I have very dry hair. So I have noticed that I no longer have to put oil on my hair as often. I use only natural oils on my hair like, jajoba, castor oil, rosemary and lavender oils. Also, my nails have always been strong and grow very fast. So I noticed no difference there. I did notice that my thin eyebrows are getting fuller.</li>
            <li> I started using viviscal in February, I was desperate after losing lots of hair after giving birth. I decided to give Viviscal a try and thank God I did! I am seeing a lot of growth in the hairline, parts were I had lost hair are now fillling in, the texture of my hair has not changed much, but I have only been using the viamins for less that three months. I am also losing less hair everyday, I am really pleased with the results I am getting. Will continue to use .&lt;br /&gt;Update- forgot to mention that my hair is very oily, I don&#x27;t mind that because it actually feels healthier( before Viviscal it was very dry and brittle) also my eyelashes are looking fuller and thicker, no more Latisse for me !</li>
            <li> So far so good with this product.  I started using viviscal back in October and have been very curious if I would see results.  I can say that while there&#x27;s been no dramatic thickening of the hair yet, fall out does appear to be slowing.  I have also noticed baby hairs growing along my hair line which I believe suggests some decent re-growth is occuring.  I do still have spells where I feel like I&#x27;m losing a lot of hair (lasts a little more than a week), but overall I don&#x27;t think the situation has gotten worse.  It is definitely causing the length to grow faster.  I go for trims every 2 months and my hair dresser comments every time how amazed she is at how much it has grown.  I&#x27;ve combined this treatment with a few other things such as evening primrose oil supplements and apple cider vinegar rinses in the shower and think these are definitely helping too.  I do plan to continue use of viviscal for the near future.</li>
            <li> This product costs to much and it did not work even a little bit.  I feel it is a rip off.</li>
            <li> I use this product along with a natural shampoo with biotin and a potent herbal blend and the results are amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thicker, lusher, strong hair after just 3 weeks of using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, after 3 months, I still see improvements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this formula is great for those wanting the ease of all the great vitamins in one bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, you can probably find each of these vitamins, minerals elsewhere in food source or individual vitamin supplements.</li>
            <li> Very good product. I started noticing new growth after the first month. I have been using it for &amp;#62; 3 months now and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> I have been using Viviscal for almost two months.  The product is very easily digestible and never&lt;br /&gt;hurts my stomach as some hair vitamins have in the past.  I still continue to have an abnormal amount&lt;br /&gt;of hair loss however, and had hoped that might have slowed down by now.  I will continue taking the product&lt;br /&gt;for at least 4 to 5 months as recommended and hope things will change.  There don&#x27;t seem to be many comments&lt;br /&gt;from people with androgenetic alopecia, which it was stated in the article I read, was supposed to be&lt;br /&gt;reduced with new hair grown in the balding areas.  Would appreciate comments from others.</li>
            <li> I wanted to share my experience using Viviscal for the past 30 days. This product really seem to be doing the job.  I spent a ton of money trying to stop my hair from shedding and I came across the product.  I thought what do I have to lose.  And let me tell you I started using this April 27th 2012 two weeks later the shedding had slowed down a bit and to day 6/1/2012 a month and three days later and I have no shedding at all.  When I say NO shedding...there is none!..I did take a trim  on Mother&#x27; Day weekend because the shedding made my length choppy looking and uneven so I had to take some of it off.  I also saw an improvement in my skin.  It seems a bit more moist than before which was ok! by me.  My nails also got got very strong and is growing faster that they ever did before.  The only thing I did extra was I tried to drink additional water.  But I got amazing results.</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery, arrived in perfect condition and fully satisfied. It started working already and its only been 3 days. Quite satisfied with it. would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> The pills are a little smaller than a dime, round shaped, and are a brownish/taupe color.  The smell is a little gross, but what do you expect from a so-called \\&quot;vitamin\\&quot;? I have taken the pills for a month now and I have experienced hair growth on my eyebrows only.  I have my eyebrows done every 2 weeks and after just 1 week my eyebrows have been growing back really wild and I have experienced a little growth in areas where the hair stopped growing completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand you are supposed to take these pills for at least 3 months before you should expect to see any results.  Seeing as how I have seen results on my eyebrows I take that to mean these pills do work.  However, the ingredients note a complex called AminoMar C Marine complex: what on earth is that?  I couldnt find any information on what that actually is.  Mar - meaning Sea, as in Ocean or water insinuates that the protein contains some sea creatures.  The ingredients actually list some of these sea creatures:Cod, English Whiting, Shark.  SHARK!!  Unfortunately, the ingredients dont list what kind of shark.  Not all sharks are endangered but the fact that the type of shark is not listed makes me think the worst.  So, after using the pills for 1 month I have decided not to purchase anymore because I dont know enough about the ingredients: AminoMar and the species of shark so I have decided to skip this stuff.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much of a difference. Need to make sure to take it two times a day. Somewhat difficult to do for me!</li>
            <li> I have using viviscal extra strenght now for 2 months. I can see a big difference in my hair! I had some areas that were thinning out at the hair line and now have a lot of new growth. My hair also is growing more rapidly. My hairdresser recommended this product and said \\&quot;she was jealous\\&quot; of all the new growth!</li>
            <li> AMAZON DOES NOT RETURN/REFUND....buyer beware!!!!!!! I had a HORRIBLE reaction to this stuff that I had such high hopes for! It did not upset my stomach or cause sleeplessness or acne or any of the stuff I read about. It DID however make me a nervous wreck and so cranky I couldn&#x27;t even stand my own company!  Also caused a massive outbreak of Shingles sooooooo.....I&#x27;m stuck with a full box minus 4 pills and no refund in sight....but I&#x27;m not taking a single one of these ever again. There has GOT to be a product out there that indeed will help us with massive hair shedding...without the nasty side effects!</li>
            <li> Not sure if its working yet for hair growth or improvement.  I bought it for breakage and dullness. But I have noticed my face is breaking out as others have mentioned. Will check back in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> It is too early to tell if there is any effect on my hair growth.  I have not seen any improvement in the first three weeks but I don&#x27;t think that is long enough to know for sure if it helps.</li>
            <li> I see an improvement in my hair but it is still to soon to report anything further.</li>
            <li> This product really works!  Can&#x27;t believe the difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> First shipment was great and I feel it was actually helping my hair. So I signed up to subscribe and save. The next shipment I got looked completely different (see picture) and was in a different sized package with different layout of pills. Do not trust that the new pills are actually viciscal. I will return immediately and buy from a reputable store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original pills in open package - lighter colored and bigger. 2nd shipment darker and smaller pills with different pull layout. Very suspicious.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it😊👍</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken these for 4 months, hoping to get some regrowth of bald areas.  It hasn&#x27;t happened. I take them twice daily usually without food and I have no irritation or other ill effect from taking them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed any softer, shinier hair or decreased shedding either...I mean no effect at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will give it two more months to make it six and then update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;November 28 2012 UPdate:  I&#x27;ve taken these for 8 months.  I do think it slowed the thinning but just a tiny bit.  I have no regrowth of hair in bald areas and no real feeling that taking these was helpful for my hair loss.  It may be great for hair loss related to hormones or traction alopecia, but not AGA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am moving these into the \\&quot;maintenance phase\\&quot;  of the product by just taking one daily. I have two boxes left, once I am done I will not re-purchase these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also....FYI, they&#x27;ve changed the formula.  The new formuls has added biotin, zinc and a few others I guess to make it more marketable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update... July, I stopped taking these about two months ago....and nothing happen. No shedding, no dryness...nothing. Just makes me further feels as if it was not having any effect on my hair at all.  A complete waste of hundreds of dollars.</li>
            <li> I read an article on People.com about best hair growth products &amp; I can truly say that this is helping. I used to have a massive hair shedding problem until I started taking this. I have a lot less hair in my drain now &amp; I am starting to see some thicker hair growth at the top of my head. I will continue to purchase this using auto-ship for at least another few months.</li>
            <li> 9/21/2016 UPDATE: Bought the 180 ct pak from 7Skin; I wrote a poor review (can&#x27;t find to update) because I was concerned it was a fake product; shipped from Portugal and info in Portuguese. Contacted Viviscal and they said products are manufactured for the Portuguese market and they can verify if it&#x27;s an authentic product by emailing the product lot number and expiration date found on the bottom of the box to  viviscalcare@viviscal.com.  Such a relief; now I just wait for it to show that it&#x27;s working. I&#x27;ve been taking it for years and I&#x27;m one of the fortunate ones for whom it works beautifully (age 69).   Previous review: I&#x27;ve been using Viviscal for about 5 months now, and have seen a huge difference. I don&#x27;t lose as much hair (it&#x27;s back to a normal shedding). Took about three months to see a difference; when I let up in taking them for about two weeks, I noticed more hair going down the drain! My hair thinning is due to age and probably genetics, and this product has made me feel confident that at least I&#x27;ll keep what I have. Worth the money to me. Try it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 52 years old and had started to experience thinning hair about 4 or so years ago.  I&#x27;ve been taking Viviscal for a few months now and love the results I&#x27;m gotten from it. It did take about 2 months to notice a difference on the thinning parts of my scalp filling out.  I was so excited when it did.  I truly regret not taking some before pictures so that I could post a before and after here.  Now, Rapunzel I am not, but I do believe my hair fullness is back to looking how it did 10 years ago, with much less fall out in the shower and in my hair brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother first tried Viviscal about a year ago.  Her hair was very, very thin and you could easily see her scalp.  She followed the instructions as directed, and after 3 months you could see a good difference on her.  You could still see her scalp (she&#x27;s 75), but not as much.  Well, silly me talked her into trying a much cheaper hair supplement to try to save her some money.  It had good reviews like Viviscal.  So she stopped using the Viviscal for a couple months and started taking this new supplement.  I color my mom&#x27;s hair for her and after a couple months on the new supplement, I could see that her hair was thinning again.  And she told me that she was noticing more hair on her brush and in the shower.  Lesson learned!  She went back on Viviscal and her hair loss stopped and is back to looking a little fuller again.  My only complaint is that this product contains iron, something women who&#x27;ve gone through menopause do not need any extra of in a supplement.  Hopefully, they will remove it soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I am so happy with how well this product worked for me and my mom that I&#x27;ve got my husband to start the Viviscal for men.  He&#x27;s only been taking if for about 5 weeks now and isn&#x27;t always great at remembering to take the second pill, but already I am seeing a difference.  And I remembered to take a before picture this time and just took a picture yesterday to compare the two.  Wow, I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s working so quickly for him, and that&#x27;s with inconsistent use.  Although he&#x27;s using the men&#x27;s Viviscal, I thought I&#x27;d post his progress pictures here so that you can see how well it&#x27;s working for him so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Okay, I figure out how to post a picture here.  If someone could help me out with that, I&#x27;ll come back and insert the before and after)quickly for him, and that&#x27;s with inconsistent use.  Although he&#x27;s using the men&#x27;s Viviscal, I thought I&#x27;d post his progress pictures here so that you can see how well it&#x27;s working for him so far.

            <li> Only on my second box, and still judging them.</li>
            <li> I tired this product out of pure desperation. I&#x27;ve been losing hair for 7 months, have been to numerous dr.&#x27;s and the cause is still unknown. Every time I shower or run my fingers through my hair I lose what looks like a birds nest. Very distressing. I had such high hopes for this product and unfortunately it was a disappointment. I took it for 4 months and saw no new baby hairs and it didn&#x27;t help at all with stopping my shed. I also had HORRIBLE acne from this. As soon as I quit it, my skin was clear. I&#x27;m thrilled for everyone who sees great results and really wanted this to work, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo, lotion and tablets and in 2 months I can tell a difference in the thickness of my hair.  It&#x27;s not yet a dramatic difference, but I can definitely tell others that it is working for me.</li>
            <li> I heard about this product on the Today Show so I thought I would try it. I was the biggest skeptic in the world. After having used the product faithfully for 3 months I can say, \\&quot;It works!\\&quot; I have low-thyroid and this product has helped my hair grow back.</li>
            <li> After your body goes through significant weight loss, it is normal to experience hair loss as your body is in a state of malnutrition. No matter what you diet consists of, weight loss will temporarily cause the body to behave as its malnourished. Also, androgenic hormones and other &#x27;toxins&#x27; are trapped in fatty tissue and release into the blood stream after they break down. This leads to hair loss and is an undesirable effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Viviscal has been great in combating these problems for me. Although I eat a diet rich in nutrients, fruits, vegetables, and fatty acids the simple act of losing weight was causing distressing hair loss. After taking this product for about 3 months now, I&#x27;ve definitely noticed less hair coming out in the shower and thicker hair. It is growing faster as well, but for me, I think the thickening factor is more noticeable than growth. Hey, that&#x27;s totally alright with me! Both are a good deal. I&#x27;ve gotten many comments on how thick my hair is becoming, and I&#x27;m even noticing new growth around my temples where I normally have wispy baby hair. I never had bald patches or thinning isolated areas, but now I can see that the wispy hair is thickening and thats good. I&#x27;m definitely going to continue purchasing and using this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using Viviscal Extra Strength Hair Nutrient tablets, 60-tablets/package for the last three months and my hair is actually getting thicker and you can&#x27;t see the bald spots any more.  Thank you so much for making this wonderful product and I have told all of my friends about it too. I am getting ready to order some more this month. I found about this product through my hair dresser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for over 6 months now and I can say with certainty that it definitely accelerates hair growth!!! I noticed a difference after the first month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, when I first started using it I was at my ideal weight and fairly quickly without any change to my diet I started to mysteriously put on weight. My first instinct was to suspect the Viviscal but I stuck it out thinking that my suspicions may have been a bit caustic and unwarranted. I didn&#x27;t want to discontinue using it because I was seeing such a noticeable difference in my hair growth. Yet, over 6 months later despite persistent dieting as well as upping the ante on my exercise routine I still could not point to anything else that would have caused the weight gain that I can not seem to take off! I am naturally thin and have NEVER had an issue with staying at my ideal weight or taking off a couple of pounds when needed. I was so frustrated that I just went to the Viviscal website to see if weight gain was a potential side effect and to my chagrin found it listed with the disclaimer (of course) that it is but very rare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I searched the postings of the more critical reviewers to see if this downside is more common but didn&#x27;t find anything. Perhaps I am in that very small minority or just one among an unnumbered silent few who has gained weight but wasn&#x27;t sure if they could attribute it to their Viviscal usage. There is no way of course for me to verify my accusation but I just wanted to put it out there just in case anyone is dealing with the same problem and thinks they&#x27;re crazy. With the exception of this unfortunate side effect I would give it 5 stars. Best of luck!</li>
            <li> I agree that it has made my skin oilier, but it is definitely doing something wonderful to my hair and nails. My hair feels softer and is definitely growing faster. My nails are growing in stronger than when I was just on Biotin. I cut them back last week and they&#x27;ve grown out already. The don&#x27;t bend at the tips and feel really thick! Very excited about that. I&#x27;m almost through my first month and will repost when I complete the second month, but so far, I&#x27;m a big fan. I love the Subscribe and Save option, as well. Had I known it would work this I well, I would have tried this earlier!  Update: 2/8/13  I&#x27;ve been on this for 6 months now and my hair is definitely growing faster and thicker. My stylist asked me what I had done to my hair because it was so healthy, shiny, long and thick! I&#x27;ve been coloring, as well, so since I&#x27;m really rough on my hair, I&#x27;m glad that these pills are doing wonders to keep my hair healthy.  As for hair growth, since I have grey hairs that I color over, I can confidently say that my hair grows about an inch a month. Wish I would have found this stuff before my brother&#x27;s wedding because I had tried to grow my hair out and it took forever...and didn&#x27;t get to the length I wanted. My mom is considering taking this, too, now that she&#x27;s seen what it&#x27;s done for my hair! :)  Update: 2/12/14  I&#x27;ve been on this for 18 months now. I&#x27;m an Asian woman in my 40&#x27;s with hair that is thinning on top. My grandmother and mother also thinned on their crown. What I have noticed while taking Viviscal (AND extra biotin) is that my hair is healthier, thicker and grows a lot faster. I used to color my highlights every 12 weeks and most recently had to do it after 8 weeks because of the increased rate of hair growth. I cannot say that it has created new growth, but I will comment that other existing hair on my body has increased in the growth rate, as well. For me, it seems to be working. My mother, who is in her 70&#x27;s wants to give it a try, but I&#x27;m worried that itmay not work for her due to age and menopause.  Update: 4/12/15  I&#x27;ve been on Viviscal for over 2 years now, and I LOVE this product. I take it religiously twice a day, and it does work for me. I struggled with growing my hair out and now my hair is about 6&amp;#34; past my shoulders. I color my hair, so I can see that every month it grows at least an inch. I worried that longer hair would weigh down and that it would be more obvious that my scalp was thinning, but that has not happened. As I&#x27;ve stated before, I also take additional Biotin. My nails have never been so strong!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after doing a lot of research. I had completely damaged my hair from over processing, and it was becoming thinner, and my hair line started to recede. I started taking this product 3 months ago, the first thing I noticed was how oily my hair became, and that was within the first 24 hours of taking the supplement. I didn&#x27;t notice any other changes for awhile, only my hair was becoming healthier. After about a month I noticed I wasn&#x27;t shedding as much... But now I can see a BIG difference in my  hair texture. Someone had sent me a picture of myself and it was 90 days to the day and I was like WOW !! I completely noticed how thick my hairline had gotten ! So yesterday I compared a picture of my hair from about 4 months ago and it was a HUGE difference !! No more receding hair line and my hair is fuller and has lots of shine !&lt;br /&gt;So the bottom line is YES this product works , you just have to give it time, and as for the growth rate.. I didn&#x27;t notice a huge growth spurt at first but in 5 weeks my hair grew an inch when it usually grows half that !!&lt;br /&gt;I will keep taking Viviscal as long as it&#x27;s on the market !!</li>
            <li> The product is in an easy to use tablet form, and can be incorporated into your daily supplement regimen. It restores density and shine to your hair, giving it a youthful appearance. I would highly recommend it... Blessed</li>
            <li> First off i&#x27;ve always had super long hair until I had my second child. My hair stopped growing when I hit 32 years old. I started wearing great lengths extensions...BAD IDEA. They were seriously expensive and what I was told that they would not damage my hair, well, they did!!!&lt;br /&gt;My hair was thin and super short from being cut to blend the extensions in with my natural hair. I was depressed and felt like I had \\&quot;soccer mom hair\\&quot; so I started taking biotin twice a day as well as prenatals which i&#x27;ve always taken as my multi vitamin but my hair was still short and thin. I decided to cut it short like an A line bob. It was cute and sassy but I still missed my long hair. My friend told me about Viviscal and I ran out and bought it (painfully expensive) but I am determined to have my thick, long hair again. Well, 4 months later and i&#x27;m still using it and my hair has grown 4 inches in 4 months!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;BUY IT, USE IT FOR 2 MONTHS...that is when I really started noticing growth but I&#x27;m not stopping until my hair is where I want it to be in length.&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T BUY IT AT A DRUGSTORE, AMAZON WILL SAVE YOU $12 PER PACKAGE, PER MONTH.&lt;br /&gt;I DON&#x27;T WORK FOR AMAZON OR VIVISCAL, JUST AN HONEST CONSUMER, LIKE YOU!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. MY PICTURE IS 4 MONTHS OLD, MY HAIR IS LONGER THAN THAT NOW!!!&lt;br /&gt;YAY VIVISCAL</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been steadily losing my hair, I don&#x27;t know if its age , or what, but I started taking this about 2 months ago and though it hasn&#x27;t helped my hair ( yet) I do notice I have eyelashes again!! Yay! So I would say yes it works!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;spsychological or not, but my hair is doing just fine and afraid to stop using it in fear it will fall out!</li>
            <li> I am about to begin my process with regrowing my hair. stress has taken its toll.</li>
            <li> My hair thickened up and is healthier than its been in a long time.</li>
            <li> Is not working as well as I expected</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve posted reviews on this before - with continued use this really works. My hair never grew in right after having chemo. It was very thin, patchy and had no texture. I bought this on the advice of a hairdresser. It took about 3-6 months to actually physically see results and after 1 year, everyone noticed. I purchase this on auto-ship now. It really does work, but you need to give it time - it isn&#x27;t an overnight fix.</li>
            <li> I so no change in my hair only my pocket.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 27 year old female who has been experiencing extreme hair loss since I quit the pill two years ago (ladies, think twice before you commit to those crazy hormones!).  Before then, I had gorgeous, thick hair. It was so thick I used to complain I had too much (yeah, I&#x27;d like to go back in time and kick myself for that comment). There&#x27;s no history of hair loss in my family. My dad is nearly sixty and he&#x27;s just now beginning to have a thin spot on top. I&#x27;ve tried everything to get my lush hair back-- getting my levels tested, going gluten-free, taking every vitamin that has any mention of hair-growing properties, etc.  All my tests have returned normal.  Hell, if you said that dousing my hair in Turkish imported donkey piss would grow my hair back, I&#x27;d do it. The depression and lack of confidence I&#x27;ve experienced from hair loss is terrible. I wouldn&#x27;t wish it on my worst enemy.  I originally tried Viviscal months ago and it broke me out, so I stopped using it. I also was taking only one pill.  I&#x27;ve been using Viviscal for about ten days now (2 pills per day) after I looked in the cupboard and realized I didn&#x27;t want to waste such an expensive product. No breakouts yet! I also take this in conjunction with biotin (10,000 mcg) and Vitamin D. I will say my hair is softer and feels like it has a little more body. My boyfriend asked if I had dyed my hair because it looked darker to him. I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s the Viviscal or the Mane &amp; Tail I use. I do find it makes my hair greasy quickly, which I dislike. It does seem like I&#x27;m noticing less hair on my clothes, when I style, etc. I plan on using the full six month run to see if there are any further results and plan to update at three and six months. Good luck to everyone on their hair growing journey!  EDIT 2/18 My hair loss has decreased dramatically. I don&#x27;t find myself picking hairs off all my clothes throughout the day as much. Just knowing that there isn&#x27;t crazy amounts of hair bailing from my head every day has done a lot to help me feel better about my hair. It feels thicker when I gather it in my hands, which seems impossible given that I haven&#x27;t been using it for a full hair cycle, but there it is. It definitely has more softness and body now though is still very fly away from all the breakage. I do see little hair poking up but I can&#x27;t decide yet whether they are new growth or just the sad remnants of broken off strands. I&#x27;m hoping for the former. The really troubled spots (sides &amp; crown) aren&#x27;t filling in yet, but hey, there&#x27;s a lot of damage to fix, and while its no where near my gorgeous hair of yesteryear, I can live with it now. I&#x27;m not experiencing the crippling anxiety I felt going out in public with my hair of 4-5 weeks ago. I&#x27;m hopeful that Viviscal will give me even better hair. More updates to come.  Edit 4/1/15 So I recently received a compliment on my hair from a stranger recently. THAT is big news for me, because it hasn&#x27;t happened in a loooong time. It&#x27;s been about 2.5 months since I started (I estimate I began the last week of January), and my hair is soft, full, and the male pattern baldness around my temples has begun to fill in. Shedding has become so minimal that I&#x27;m not loathe to see a strand of hair come out. I&#x27;m really hoping to have a completely different head of hair in the full six month period. I no longer feel worried that people are noticing my hair. I also take naturethroid to help my thyroid, along with other vitamins, and try to add oil to my hair and scalp at night before I shower the next day. While it&#x27;s not Victoria Secret model hair, it&#x27;s just really great to be free of the worry and anxiety.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this item for 3 months now and my hair has grown an inch each month. If i use this product for 12 months that means my hair will be 12 inches long... well a little over 12 inches including what was already on my head lol. This is coming from a person who has thin hair and it took almost 1/2 a year to grow 2 inches. I cant believe it. I will never stop using this product.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased about 4 different supplements for hair growth about 2 months ago because my hair was thinning (from what? who knows) and this was included in my daily cocktail. I had gotten amazing results and my hair has become thicker than what it ever has been before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I recently ran out of this stuff and I figured that since I had my other 3 supplements still left, I didn&#x27;t need to purchase Viviscal again.&lt;br /&gt;Well....let me tell you...my hair strands are sure enough starting to slip out of my scalp while im in the shower or brushing my hair now that Viviscal is no longer in my daily supplement routine.&lt;br /&gt;That leads to me to believe that its possibly my OTHER 3 supplemts that don&#x27;t need to be refilled..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yea, Just purchased another Pack...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why the product has such a high review.. It was totally useless to me..tastes horrible and my hair fall continued despite regular use with no improvement I can sense.. Really a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Faster hair growth has been my experience.&lt;br /&gt;I have been taking the Viviscal for a year, and I started to see a difference within 6 weeks or so. The first thing I noticed was I was cutting my nails twice a week instead of just once. I have a spot in my scalp where grey hair grows, and I have it colored. I went from coloring every 6 weeks to having to color every 4 weeks. Also, the fine hairs around my hairline are a bit thicker and facial hair grows faster too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only taken this product for a week but developed an itchy rash on my forearms and neck the day after I started taking it. I just now realized it was the product. I have as allergic reactions to shellfish in the past and should have read the label more carefully.</li>
            <li> I have been using this since April and It works really well.  The only problem is I have to get my nails done every 2 weeks they grow so fast.  It has really help my hair.  I did not have a hair cut in a year because my hair was breaking off.  I quit using a curling iron and started the pills now I get a trim every 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> So far, I feel like it really helped my hair grow and stay healthy. I have blonde hair and put highlights in it which dries it out, and this kept it healthy.</li>
            <li> My hair is thinning and I heard this was a good product.  I&#x27;ve tried it for almost 3 mos., but I don&#x27;t see any major improvement.  I plan on sticking with it for a minimum of 6 mos. because I heard that in some cases you need to take it for at least that long to see results.  If I don&#x27;t see any improvement after 6 mos. I&#x27;ll discontinue it.</li>
            <li> The product did what it claimed to do but I found another product that does the same that is less expensive and is just as affective.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  Over the last few yrs my hair has been falling out like crazy and started noticing more and more scalp visible  and was very worried I was gonna be bald soon.  I tried other products that didn&#x27;t help and finally tried this - I took it for 6 months and after about 6 weeks noticed  less hair on my bathroom floor and more new hair growing on my hair line.  At the end of the 6 months I would only have about 5 strands of hair on my bathroom floor after blowdrying compared to about 100 prior to this.  I quit taking it about 2 months ago and started taking biotin since it&#x27;s much cheaper but my hair is back to falling out so I think I may have to buy some more. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I am truly amazed at the results from Viviscal. I am a middle aged black woman who started seeing my hair thinning in the temples at age 33 (20 years ago).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since all the women on my Mother&#x27;s side have no temple hair (alopecia) by the age of 60, I assumed my problem was heredity.  By the time I was 49 I had cowlicks and started swooping my hair into comb-overs to hide the bald temples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to cut it REAL short, so no one would notice the thinning.&lt;br /&gt;Over the years, I have probably tried at least 15 different hair vitamins (even Chinese herbs). All of the vitamins made my hair longer, but none of them helped the hair loss/ thinning in my temples.  I read about Viviscal over 3 years ago in a magazin ad, but it seemed a little pricey. I thought it would be just like all the other hair vitamins, I had purchased (only pricier). So I did not try it. I told myself to stop wasting money and accept that I would look like my aunts and mother (bald temples and receding hairline).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, I started seeing all the reviews on Amazon for Viviscal. So, I finally decided to just try one more product. About 3 months ago, I bought the first box of Viviscal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  WOW and Holy potato chips!!&lt;br /&gt;I now have BEAUTIFUL new growth all across my temples and the entire hairline. I also noticed my eyelashes are getting fuller. After the 2nd box, I noticed my hair getting fuller/ thicker all over. In fact, my hair has started growing so fast that I&#x27;ve had to cut back on the dosage and take only one vitamin a day. I usually wait 5-6 weeks between relaxers, but when I take 2 vitamins a day the hair grows so quickly that I need a relaxer in 3.5-4 weeks (that&#x27;s a good roblem to have).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  It&#x27;s growing faster than a chia-pet!!!&lt;br /&gt;Since the hair loss started in my left temple at age 33, I thought the hair in that temple was gone foreever. NOT!!!  It&#x27;s growing back just as quickly as the hair on the right temple. My cowlicks are truly disappearing. I thank Heavens for Viviscal and plan to buy some for my Mom and aunts to try. I plan to start taking &#x27;before and after&#x27; photos...as I continue my hair regrowth journey through 2013. Thanks for making me feel good about may hair again!&lt;br /&gt;  GREAT Product and worth EVERY PENNY !!!!!</li>
            <li> My second time using this product.  Yet to see the result which will take a little more usage.</li>
            <li> I take this supplement twice a day.  I have fine thin hair.  I wasn&#x27;t sure it was working after being on it for a few months.  So I quit taking it.  I definately noticed a difference.  I have since been on a revolving plan.  I have found on Amazon the prices are quite decent.  I enjoy it coming in the mail, so I don&#x27;t have to remember to order it.</li>
            <li> Yes these tablets meet my expectation.  It was what I had ordered and I feel that they are making a difference.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.  What I ordered was exactly as shown.</li>
            <li> Ordered twice and arrived unsealed in manufactures packing. Have to return. I have used product in the past but will not use&lt;br /&gt;unsealed.</li>
            <li> I have noticed less hair falling and hair also seems fuller.</li>
            <li> You gotta give it time but it does work to help hair that&#x27;s thinning-it&#x27;s a little pricy there are other products that work as well-shop around if you can</li>
            <li> great product fast shipping</li>
            <li> Received right away and Viviscal really works fast.  Already I can tell my hair is growing and my nails are very long right now.  I never had long nails so I love it!!!</li>
            <li> My beatician really loved how this product made my hair healthier.</li>
            <li> **UPDATE**  i am in my 3rd month now and this stuff is truly amazing!  my hair feels so much thicker now!!  i used to use hair fibers/powder to cover some thinner spots on my head and i dont even need to use it anymore (though i do sometimes, to give my hair a \\&quot;boost\\&quot;).  my hair is also growing pretty fast.  i havent noticed my nails getting stronger or growing faster, but the change in my hair is amazing.  it is pricey but the benefit truly outweighs the cost!!!    _____________________________________________________  i just finished my first month on this and i can tell theres alot less hair loss!!  when i run my fingers through my hair and in the shower drain i see less strands, and that is DEFINITELY one of the main things i was going for. not sure about the hair growth/hair thickening/nail strength just yet.  will update at the end of my second month.  id say its definitely worth around $40 a month.  i also saw it mentioned on the \\&quot;harpaar&#x27;s bazaar\\&quot; website (some stylists swear by it), so that reinforces my faith in it.</li>
            <li> I took this for 6 months because I have female pattern baldness. This does not thicken hair or help new hairs grow. It does however make the hair you have grow long super quick, and your nails too. I paid $100 every 3 months, ridiculous. Now I use Biotin 10,000 mcg and its like $8 for a 3 month supply and is actually making new hairs grow! Don&#x27;t get this product, I recommend Biotin!</li>
            <li> I was encouraged by the majority of the reviews I read... especially just by the fact that people noticed a difference at all despite having side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well....it had absolutely no effect. Simply didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I have been doing hair for 7 years now, and I always gave Biotin such high praise for actually thickening the hair after continued usage...along with slightly faster hair growth. Biotin is no wonder pill, but it works pretty well when you&#x27;re good about taking it everyday. Unfortunately, the hard truth is that with most supplements (even viviscal)...it&#x27;s going to take extended usage to see results. For women who are past menopause...much longer as your hormones (which control hair growth) are depleted greatly.  ONTO the the GOOD stuff.  Viviscal works a good bit better than Biotin with regular usage. I have been using it for a mere 5 weeks and the growth is...kind of shocking to be honest. I didn&#x27;t expect it to work so fast. Let me also tell you all that I am 29 yrs old, and do not have thinning hair problems. I started taking it because I cut 5 inches off of my hair that I want back more than anticipated. I can NOT begin to tell you all how much hair is growing. I had a small hole of missing hair in my brow that I over tweezed that is finally growing back after almost a year (gasp!) of not growing. Its kind of weird to be honest.  Also- my leg hairs are growing twice as fast...which is not fun. This is just 5 weeks. Like I said, for older women who are pre or post menopausal, I doubt it will pack as much of a punch. Unfortunately, getting older means less hair growth, and there is no miracle pill to naturally fix that...yet.  My hair DEFINITELY feels thicker at the base after just 5 weeks, and it&#x27;s not placebo effect. Trust me..it is so much thicker.  Just be vigilant about using the stuff...like any supplement. Also keep in mind that if you are a thin haired individual naturally, that it might take longer to notice.  I have told about a dozen clients about it...that is how much I love the stuff. I say try it for 3 months before you knock it. 3 months equals about 3/4 inches of hair growth for slow growers and 1 1/2 inches for fast growers. if your hair is growingslightly faster than what your average is, then its working. 3 months is a good base to see a difference and measure it.  IT totally works!</li>
            <li> Really effective product. It stops hair loss and improves the quantity of hairs in few months only.  I would surely recommend this product to other amazon users.</li>
            <li> This actually works. It has be taken for at least 3 months. I have noticed my hair, eyebrows thicken and actually grow. Even my nails are hard and long. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I used to never get compliments on my hair...now I do all the time. It&#x27;s hard for me to notice a drastic difference myself, since I touch &amp; see my hair everyday, but my friends and family members have given me more compliments on my hair in the past few months than I have probably ever received in my entire life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product. The only real downside is that you see minimal results for the first 4 months of use, so it can be hard to justify spending the money at first...but trust me...it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> Viviscal&lt;br /&gt;  We have been using viviscal for about 6 months and now my hair dresser  is using it for her husband.&lt;br /&gt;We continue using it  because it works for both my husband and me.</li>
            <li> My hair is growing slower as I age. I just about gave up. Biotin gave it a good jump start. However, this product so increased the speed of growth that I see my young full head of hair again after the first box. I keep staring at my hair.</li>
            <li> Viviscal Extra Strength hair vitamins:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have used Viviscal Hair Vitamins 9 months or more, Very little results, unsure why I keep taking them, other than hoping to see some results for my thinning hair on the crown of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pecola Williams</li>
            <li> I can see the results. I would recommend it. Def it is worth the price. I will continue ordering this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it had good reviews I justo have long hair then I cut it short and I would straight it alot and alot for school and made it really dry and it won&#x27;t grow sadly, so I just bought this 1 month ago and been drinking two a day like it says for better results I would say that it is working and 1 side. Effect  they Are working because my hair justo fall out like alit after I shower now that I shower nothing&#x27;s falls out I would say my hair is getting stronger I haven&#x27;t seen no growth yet hopefully soon because I want my hair to grow and not use hair extensions anymore so when I curled my hair but the side effect is that I never never get acne I would have my face clear and I think by getting acne is this pills so this is the side effect of this pills sadly but true :( because I only get acne when  I&#x27;m in my period if you girls know what I mean and I just get one or two like in my forehead because there&#x27;s no night I don&#x27;t wash my face and put the cream night from neutrogina  and they take my pimples quick and these acne with this pills are lagging !

            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a month but I don&#x27;t see any improvement.  My hair actually seems to be getting thinner not thicker.  I&#x27;ll stick with it for the three month period that they suggest and hope that I don&#x27;t go bald first.  But I honestly don&#x27;t see any difference in my hair</li>
            <li> took it  for wellover 6 months...and saw barely no improvements..maybe some around the hairline growing..baby hair...decided to stop using it..too costly..i cant get the same result takin biotin 1200mg...and cheaper</li>
            <li> Came about this product when my daughters were visiting. Both had had hairloss problems. They put me on viviscal. Within 6 weeks I noticed a change. Three months and I was hooked! Half my friends are now on it,(upon my advice), and hasd now spread to France thru a friend of mine. Better texture..used to be thin haired...more to work with. Now  put my husband on it!!</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for a month. I notice that my nails look better &amp; are stronger. Haven&#x27;t  notice any changes with my hair yet. They said it can take 3-4 months before noticing the in your hair.</li>
            <li> I tried this product, for the this first month I was discouraged. I guess I expecting results too soon. I decided to hang in there waited an additional month and yes it does work. My hair was thinning in the middle and I decided to cut it shorter so it could look more healthy. I wish I had tried this product first.</li>
            <li> I hardly ever write reviews but I had to about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1. I was VERY SKEPTICAL to try this because I read some reviews about it making peoples skin/scalp/hair oily and causing breakouts. I am 36 and have bad hormonal acne.... Oily/cystic acne that I control with Sprionolactone. SO I was terrified to take these pills and honestly I had them sit in my cupboard for two months before trying. But I swear these pills make my skin CLEAR! My skin /scalp are no more oily than normal. And the blackheads around/on my nose and on my chin clear up and it&#x27;s soooo smooth. I know its the Viviscal because I took them and stopped and then took them again. Same thing happened.... skin got Clear! :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#2. My hair loss is caused by anti-depressants. (prozac/wellbutrin) And to start I don&#x27;t have great hair to begin with. When I take the Viviscal with in a week or so the texture of my hair is soooo much better. And after a few months I DO have alot of new hair growth. Like the hairs that fell out are all coming in at once. So lots of baby hairs sticking up around my hairline/part. AND I notice that I&#x27;m not losing as much. I did stop the Prozac so now I&#x27;m on just one (wellbutrin). So my hair still feels thinner than normal and I do still lose a bunch in the shower. But not as much as I did before. The big thing to me is the texture being so soft. My hair felt so brittle before Viviscal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So That&#x27;s my review! I will definitely keep taking it as long as I&#x27;m on wellbutrin. I plan on stopping Wellbutrin soon but I will keep taking Viviscal until my hair gets back to normal. And who knows... maybe I&#x27;ll keep it up after too cuz of the skin benefits. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps someone.</li>
            <li> I guess it everyone is different because I didn&#x27;t notice a difference. I&#x27;m not sure how long you should take supplements to see noticeable results, but I certainly didn&#x27;t order another batch after trying it for a month. I&#x27;m just going to stick with biotin</li>
            <li> I tried this product about two months ago.  By the time I got to the last three tablets, I noticed that the hairs on the left side of my head and top was longer than when I first started taking Vivascal.  My hair stopped growing when I was going through some very stressful events about a year ago.  I was skeptical about using Vivascal but after reading some of the reviews and finding most positive, I thought I would try.  So yes, by the end of the product there was some growth to existing hair.  However, I find Biosil VegCap worked better in stronger hair and better hair texture, nail growth and smoother skin texture.  If I took both Vivascal and Biosil I wonder what the result would be?  I think I will try and give feedback after results.</li>
            <li> I have been taking the Extra Strength Hair Nutrient for over 6 mos and will say the immediate improvement was with my nails and increase body hair. I was not hairy to begin with but it became much more noticeable.. If you want hair.. this is the product for you.. It brought a natural sheen to my head of hair and strengthens the follicles.. Love the product and highly recommend - especially since \\&quot;us\\&quot; women but our hair thru torture with the perm, heat, dyes, etc.. It&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any difference since I began using this product. Waste of $$$.</li>
            <li> i love this product...my hair has gotten very healthy since i use it ...its full and not as thin anymore&lt;br /&gt;i still have make usual hair falling out in the shower but overall my hair is in excellent condition since i use this</li>
            <li> My hair became very thin &amp; brittle after using Viviscal for about 6 or 8 months my hair became so much healthier&lt;br /&gt;and began to get thicker. I&#x27;m so happy with product, now I take just one tablet a day &amp; will use it forever!</li>
            <li> I am on my second month of taking these and after having two children my hair was super thin. I also had baby hairs that were not growing back which was very frustrating when trying to fix my hair. After taking this product for a month, my hairdresser has noticed them growing and so have I! I will continue to take these because it works!!!!</li>
            <li> I have only been taking this product for a month but I seem to like it so far. I&#x27;m hoping to see big results in another couple of months and will review again at that time.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this product.  I saw it originally on the Dr. Oz Show.  It was feature to aide in thinning &amp; hair loss.  I can truly say I will continue to take this supplement. After turning 42 y/o, my hair became brittle, started thinning &amp; breaking.  I thought it may have been hormonal, or my thyroid. After, ruling my thyroid out, I started taking Viviscal.  It saw hair growth, &amp; increase strength in my hair.  I also saw an improvement with my skin &amp; nails!  I am very pleased!!!</li>
            <li> I have been trying to grow my hair for the past three years and it was just breaking and getting shorter.  It was really damaged from dying it a bunch, but I have had it natural for three years; i use no heat or anything on it, and it still just breaks.  So I bought this stuff and within about 2-3 months everyone was commenting on how fast my hair had been growing and how long it looked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend buying this stuff, but you gotta stick with it for at least a few months, and using Carol&#x27;s Daughter hair conditioners if you have been trying unsuccessfully to grow your hair out.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that did not use animals unnecessarily. This product has &amp;#34;Fish Ingredients.  (SHARK),&amp;#34; in it. NOT suitable for vegans, vegetarians or anyone else not wanting to consume animal products.</li>
            <li> This supplement is the BOMB!  My hair was in such poor condition and falling out due to medical problems.  In June, I began taking these and along with using Rogaine, I am very pleased with transformation of my hair.  Would recommend to anyone who wants to put Life back into their locks...</li>
            <li> Really works ! Takes about 3 months initially, but stay with it, twice each day.</li>
            <li> It is easy to get caught up in something you see on TV. That is what happen when I bought this product. No visible changes.</li>
            <li> The product is very good if used consistently.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Thanks!</li>
            <li> THIRD UPDATE: 5 months and about a week since I started. No new hair. Thinning has very slightly become worse. Hairs that were not thinning are still growing faster than normal. I will say on this for another month. My right kidney area seems to hurt often, but I have no way of knowing that this is causing that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 3 Months. Still no noticeable change in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been using it for 2.5 months. Haven&#x27;t seen any results. Hair loss that has not changed at all since I started. It&#x27;s kinda expensive. I&#x27;ve read you should only take horsetail for short periods of time. Once you are done with the six months you need to keep taking this to keep the effects. So this isn&#x27;t a permanent solution to anything. My hair has grown faster since using this but I have seen zero new hairs on my head. Hair isn&#x27;t thicker or anything. Just grows faster. I may very well end up doing the full six months but I&#x27;m not getting my hopes up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the primary constituents of horsetail extract is thiaminase. Thiaminase is an enzyme that breaks down thiamine, a nutrient also known as vitamin B-1. Treatment with horsetail extract may significantly increase the amount of thiaminase in your body, which may cause a vitamin B-1 deficiency. Low vitamin B-1 levels, a condition called beriberi, may cause serious symptoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Google the side effects of horsetail...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Horsetail also contains silica apparently... and too much can cause kidney problems. I have noticed some minor pain in my left kidney area. But that could be nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update at 6 months. I&#x27;m 19 years old. Male. Have a receded hairline. In good shape and eat as well as I can. I figure if it doesn&#x27;t help a 19 year old with with hair loss it sure wont help anyone 30+&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saw a dateline special where a man used it for a year and had no new hairs, but the existing hair was growing faster. Look it up.</li>
            <li> I have been using extra strength viviscal for three months, and it seems that my shedding has not been as bad, however, I went for blood work and got my results back yesterday, and my liver enzymes were elevated. I came home and reviewed the ingredients again ,and when I looked up horstail, it says it is not to be taken long term, and also states it can cause liver problems. I would love to find a hair supplement that doesn&#x27;t have dangerous ingredients and really works for hair loss. Disappointed in Viviscal for not doing more studies on the ingredients they put in their product.</li>
            <li> It seems to be working.  Will update post in the future, after I&#x27;ve taken it for a longer time.</li>
            <li> I have yet to see the results of using this product but since using it I found my scalp and skin has a glow to it. I have read all the reviews and researched it online. Looking forward to my results. So far so good for me. No side effects.</li>
            <li> tried many vitamins before. This is by far the best. It is not as big as other vitamins. It is small so it is easy to take. It does not have strong smell either. Most importantly, my hair feels and looks much better after two months on this product.</li>
            <li> The old was better so if you can find the old one, buy it.  I have had more hair loss with the new formula than with the old. Wish they didn&#x27;t change formulas- stick with what works.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome.  I was so unhappy because my hair was not growing and so thin.  At 77 years I expected some thinning but it was so bad I did not want to go out of the house.  Since using Viviscal I have received compliments from my stylist as to the difference in my hair texture.  I would not go without this product.  Thank you Viviscal.</li>
            <li> This really works, it regrew my hair from loss due to stress and then chemo. I really like this product!</li>
            <li> It does work, I also take 1000mg MSM, use Nexxus Pro-Mend Split End Binding Overnight Creme maintaining my ends and cutting hair by the Morrocco Method Lunar chart  so seeing amazing results.</li>
            <li> Works great ... Using it everyday .. Down to one pill a day now ..</li>
            <li> I have not seen any results at all, I don&#x27;t recommend it. I use to take appearex and I definitely saw results but with this product, I see nothing different. Waste of money and time. Sorry. It may work for someone else but definitely not me.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was experiencing alarming shedding over a period of 3 months last year for no apparent reason. My hair was starting to look a lot thinner and was desperate to find something to help.  This was the 3rd type of hair vitamin I tried (each with different ingredients) and the most expensive. I was also taking a high dose of Biotin but that didn&#x27;t help either.  I think this did make my exisiting hair grow and possibly helped some hair grow back but did nothing to help the hair fall stop.  FINALLY, I started taking Inositol [[ASIN:B0001TNL3I Jarrow Formulas Inositol,  750 mg, 100 Vegetarian capsules]]1 cap twice per day and it stopped the hair fall within DAYS.  Recommended it to a friend who experienced the same results.  So I think this product works to grow hair but won&#x27;t stop hair loss.  Use it with the Inositol and hopefully it will give you the same results as me.  Cons are price, although it is cheaper on Amazon than anywhere else, and it tends to make my skin break out, hair is oilier.  Pros are it works and unlike other hair vitamins they are not giant horse pills.</li>
            <li> I am experiencing severe hair loss and have been on this product for over 4 months. I have yet to see any improvement in the &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34; and thinning. It is pricey as well, so I don&#x27;t know how much longer I will give it.</li>
            <li> This product grew my hair but seem to make it feel crunchy and it does make it oily besides that it did grow my hair</li>
            <li> These work great - my daughter said she noticed a huge difference in the texture of her hair.  I personally have not tried them out yet, but my 24 year old says they are a winner.</li>
            <li> Worked a little but not as much as I thought. I&#x27;ve been taking it 2 months. It becomes less effective after the 1st month.</li>
            <li> I have had issues with my hair for the last 10 years, due to thyroid problems, and my hair had become very thin with areas of my scalp beginning to show through at my front hair line.  I am a licensed Cosmetologist, and know just by experience, that nothing is a miracle for thinning hair.  I eat well, take supplements such as Biotin, and was beginning to give up.  Within my third month of taking Viviscal, I  started to notice new baby hair at the front hairline, something I had not seen in years.  I also noticed the overall texture and shine was improving.  I am now into my 5th month, and I will never go back.  I have never written a review for anything before, but this truely deserves 5 stars from me.  I had been using a hair coverup in my thinning areas, and now I don&#x27;t have to use anything at all.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for almost a year now and I wouldn&#x27;t live without it! It has helped my hair grow faster, and longer, and I take a medication that has a side effect of hair loss and without Viviscal I would have to wear wigs.</li>
            <li> I was also skeptical about this product, but it works!  I started using it in September 2012 and my hair grew A LOT from September-December.  I went back home to my stylist and she was stunned!!  So was I!  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> For several years, I&#x27;ve had thinning hair and I&#x27;ve tried multiple treatments for it:&lt;br /&gt;-Propecia:  It might&#x27;ve helped with stopping hair loss, but there was no obvious improvement or new growth and didn&#x27;t like that I needed to get a prescription for it and that it may have some negative side effects.&lt;br /&gt;-Rogain: It seemed like it may have helped though the results were  not obvious -- and ultimately I developed an allergic reaction to it and so could no longer take it.&lt;br /&gt;-iGrow: This is one of those laser things you wear.  After trying it once, I found it too inconvenient and didn&#x27;t stick with it.  I ended up returning as I almost never used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, my stylist mentioned Viviscal, and so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try especially as it&#x27;s something off-the-shelf and that I can conveniently get by simply ordering online (no need for a prescription) and that it&#x27;s simply a pill and so not a hassle to use like the iGrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what can I say?! The results have been unbelievable. I&#x27;ve noticed a clear difference when I run my hand through my hair - I have a noticeably fuller head of hair in less than a month. My hair also seems to be growing faster.  People around me have noticed a difference. One thought perhaps I&#x27;d changed my hairstyle since it looks so much fuller, but there is no illusion here. I actually have thicker hair.  And once again, I love that it&#x27;s so convenient and so something I know I can stick with - and the only potential side effect I&#x27;ve seen - is actually a really positive one impacting my personal life.</li>
            <li> My hair had been thinning for several years before I found this product.  I now have been using it for 5 months and my hair is back to being thick like it use to be.</li>
            <li> I have used this useless product for 6 straight months taking the tablets as instructed. It did NOTHING. No new hairs. No healthier hairs, WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> I believe that this does really work. I have curly hair that is thinning in front.  I feel that my hair is fuller than b4 V</li>
            <li> i like the product because it is working , it work better than any other supplements i have tried in the past</li>
            <li> Started feeling dizzy and &amp;#34;air headed&amp;#34;. Stopped using and the feeling went away.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product as instructed for about 3 weeks and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the yielded results!&lt;br /&gt;Aside from accelerating my current growth rate, these vitamins have done wonders for my skin!&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product to anyone that&#x27;s looking to increase their hair&#x27;s current growth rate....it&#x27;s one of the best hair vitamins since Nioxin!!</li>
            <li> It stopped my hair thinning.  It is now fuller and in excellent condition.  I recomend this product for thinning hair.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  Helps you hair grow and stay  shiney results work if you take as directed! Good product, I would recommend this product to customers!</li>
            <li> I feel like I have seen a difference in the thickness of my hair.  Baby hair has grown from the front of my head.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this product.  I am a 34-year-old woman.  My hair started to thin in my 20s and so I tried different hair supplements (GNC and Andrew Lessman).  those didn&#x27;t work after a couple years so I tried upping my protein intake since I don&#x27;t eat a lot of meat, that didn&#x27;t help.  About 5 years ago, my hair thinning got so bad that I needed to start using those scalp coverup makeups at the front several inches of my hair on the days that I work (because I had several coworkers who would always stare at that spot that they could see, how rude).  you can EASILY see my scalp on the whole top of my head and above my ears.  I am hypothyroid and tried both synthetic and natural hormones, none of those helped my hair either.  I tried biotin but got such bad cystic acne, so had to stop that.  I first saw ads for Viviscal about a year before I bought it, but I didn&#x27;t think there were good enough reviews at the time.  When I was reviewing the reviews again the 2nd time i thought about it, I saw a lot of good reviews so decided to give it a try.  I have now been taking the viviscal supplements, very faithfully, twice a day, for 8 months now and see no improvement.  thinning hair is not filling in, and I don&#x27;t see an improvement in my hair condition either, and my hair seems to grow the average (half inch a month).  very disappointed that it didn&#x27;t help my thinning hair.  :-(  also, it did not make my hair oilier as others said.  I did get a little bit of cystic acne the first couple months - I emailed the company and they said that can happen the first couple months until your body gets use to it.  and after a few months, that did go away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only taken this one month.  The most frustrating thing is all of the little hairs that are growing and sticking straight up and not obeying the blow dryer commands.  However, the thing I noticed almost immediately is that my hair is not coming out in the shower, I don&#x27;t shed all over my clothes, and lose very little when I&#x27;m combing after washing my hair (wide tooth comb).  It&#x27;s shiny and smoother, too.  So, I will keep up my experiment and see how far this supplement will take me.</li>
            <li> I am on my second month and I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve seen amazing results yet. My hair is still falling out when I brush it or take a shower. I realize that it will probably take at least 3 plus months to see dramatic results. I will definitely keep using it.</li>
            <li> I have been taking this for about two months, I can&#x27;t really see if it&#x27;s working or not. They recommend that you use it for at least three months before you can seed result. I am will order it again.</li>
            <li> I have no idea if it&#x27;s working.  It&#x27;s very subjective. One day I think maybe it is...then I think maybe it&#x27;s just the placebo effect.</li>
            <li> After my wife heard about these on the Dr. Oz show she picked some up at the local pharmacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not even two weeks later her hair was looking fuller and better than it ever has. Even her hairdresser was impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend that you try these, but look at the seller first. Amazon offers them for sale directly at a much cheaper rate than the third parties.</li>
            <li> Everybody is different.  I guess I did not repsond.  I took two tables each day for 8 months and did not notice any improvements.</li>
            <li> It really works! My hair and nails are growing faster and better. It takes about 6 months to see results, so be patient.</li>
            <li> Best product...Had Chemo and my hair is growing back fuller and stronger.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really see much of a difference as yet.  Maybe will have to use longer.  Going to give it a few months longer.</li>
            <li> I think this stuff works. been taking it 6 months and definitely fuller hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for awhile. It works. My hair is stronger and looks great.</li>
            <li> My grandma who is 92 stopped losing hair because of these pills. She swears by them.</li>
            <li> Noticeable difference in hair and nails....it took a few weeks, but I got the desired results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a number of months and notice a change in my hair. It is a good product. I also take 5 mg of biotin and silica which probably adds to the benefits of this product.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally very curly, so waiting for it to grow can be very frustrating. This helped! Thank you.</li>
            <li> menopause had made my hair thin, but after taking this for 3-4weeks, my hair quit thinning and  i found new growth in my hairline.  I&#x27;ll use it forever.</li>
            <li> I have very fine thin hair that breaks off &amp; hair extensions just killed my hair more so i needed something. BTW wear a wig instead &amp; its cheaper.Anyway I heard about these &amp; most people found they worked &amp; i can tell you my nails grow faster..if only i&#x27;d stop biting them.I&#x27;ve been taking it for a month but can&#x27;t see much difference so far so i cant give it more stars yet.The first few days I felt tingling on my head seriously but haven&#x27;t since. You have to take it @ least 3 months so I will write again. &amp; for the people saying if you have a sensitive stomach beware, well I have a VERY sensitive stomach &amp; if you take even just a few bites of food before you will have no probs..like the directions say. I&#x27;ll keep ya posted:)</li>
            <li> Seems to be working!  Will continue using as recommend, I&#x27;m keeping my fingers crossed.</li>
            <li> no idea if this works or not.  i keep forgetting to take them 2x daily, so can&#x27;t give a fair review in that respect.</li>
            <li> My daughter has always had trouble growing her hair.  This really seems to be helping.  Will order more to do the whole 3 months and see what happens!  Has horrible taste though.</li>
            <li> Just bought it. Will write more as I see results.</li>
            <li> Love it!  I swear my hair is growing longer and thicker than it typically does.  I combine this with Biotin to double up.</li>
            <li> Recommend from health professional useful</li>
            <li> Someone recommended this to me and I&#x27;m so happy I tried it. I&#x27;ve suffered from years of too-thin hair caused by medical reasons and got so sick of looking at fine, thin, flat, wispy hair everyday. I already have some great hair care products to make my thin hair LOOK thicker, but needed my hair to actually GET thicker and re-grow. Well, this stuff seems to do the job it claims to do. I used the first month&#x27;s supply and my hair is already fuller, the sections that were sparse are filling in and my hair styles so much better because there&#x27;s more hair to work with. It&#x27;s also growing faster than before. I just purchased my second box and am going to continue to use it. I&#x27;m a major skeptic when it comes to products like this because I don&#x27;t have time or money to waste, but I noticed the difference in my hair&#x27;s thickness within 2.5 to 3 weeks after starting the Viviscal. I also received comments about my hair from others who know me as well. Worth the $$ because it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using this about a month ago... soo i haven&#x27;t really seen any results yet.. althought the product does say use at least 6 months so i&#x27;ll continue using it and see where it goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used it for a while. I&#x27;ve noticed my hair grew faster than normal. Usuall I might get an inch in 3 months with this I noticed about an inch growth in 6 weeks. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product is the first one I ever heard of that really make your hair grow. This is not just to make your hair grow but also to make it healthier.  I have only been using this product for one month.It will take about six months to see any real results. My hair is looking healthier than it did before I started using it.</li>
            <li> I have been taking Viviscal for three weeks already and my hair feels thicker or just different.  I truly like it and am buying another 60 tablets.  I probably have to wait a few months before I can see the full effect, but I am noticing a positive change in the way my hair feels after three weeks.</li>
            <li> These supplements are easy to consume and they seem to work. Being a woman one of the most sensitive things to talk about is weakened hair. No woman wants to suffer hair loss. This product has been used by celebrities and who better to be able to have the best to prevent or to help with health issues. So I would say that I agree with them. This product works.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my mother who is experiencing hair loss. 1 box gone (1 month supply)and no visible improvement. I purchased a second box since I understand this is not an overnight miracle treatment. Due to the demand of this product it is taking 3 weeks to get the second box. Wish we could get it quicker so that she can continue the treatment uninterrupted. Will order 2 boxes going forward so that she does not run out and have to wait for the next shipment. Price is a little high compared to other hair vitamins on the market.</li>
            <li> I am 25 and after some different medications and stress I noticed my hair was really thinning around the crown with my part seeming larger and scalp showing in the front. I am on my second box and noticed about 4 weeks in that i have new hair growth on the crown and temples of an inch, as well as hair growth an inch all over in the past 2 weeks! I use Nioxin shampoo (#3 for colored hair) which I feel really gets my hair clean (used to be very oily), then Clairol shimmer lights for my blonde hair (let that sit for 2 mins) then nioxin #3 conditioner on the top of my head and TIGI moisture recovery conditioner on the ends. I wash 2 or 3 times a week supplementing with Tresseme dry shampoo for after the gym so I don&#x27;t over wash. My hair seems thicker as well, and nails are amazing especially since I removed acrylic tips when I began the Viviscal. Would definetly recommend!</li>
            <li> i Saw The Results And After The Forth Month My Hair Got Fuller And Healthier And Even More shinier, I Would Recommend This Product To Every One.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 months and see great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no side effects and my hair appears to be growing faster and falls out less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also feel like I have more energy at the end of the day. Great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than using this product, I&#x27;ve been exercising, eating healthy and use organic shampoo and rogaine.</li>
            <li> i used this product for 4 or 5 months and could not tell if it worked or not&lt;br /&gt;i will not order any more</li>
            <li> I am in my early 40&#x27;s with a grandmother with baldness and a mother with baldness.  With that being said, I&#x27;d say I will also be there.  I&#x27;m always looking for items to thicken and grow my hair. I was a bit skeptical at first but I took this once a day and then I ran out.  A few days before running out I noticed my hair being thicker - like seriously thick.  I&#x27;m ordering more right now.  The negative is if you have gray hair coming in, you will have to dye your hair on a more frequent basis.  I could easily get away with 5 weeks of dying my hair but now it&#x27;s every 3 weeks.  I also have baby fine hair that is coming in as well.  This is just with 2 months of usage.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Seems to work quick delivery</li>
            <li> only used one month haven&#x27;t seen any changes yet</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money at first but I watched a 3 month review and update vlog given by Denim Pixie on YouTube and it seem like every update her hair was getting longer and longer including nails. Still I didn&#x27;t buy them ($$$) so I am currently natural and besides the bald/thin edges and just slow growth overall I but the bullet and purchased them. Some say one month isn&#x27;t long enough for results but I cut my hair completely off where you could see my scalp I started the supplements February 10th and in one month my hair has grown like crazy it&#x27;s thickening up and my edges are in full effect. I&#x27;m on my 2 pack month 2 and I am excited to see the results by the way I&#x27;m black with natural hair. It&#x27;s recommended 6 full months (2) daily there after 1 vitamin daily just to keep the results steady. Everyone is different keep that in mind and your results will vary may come fast or slow</li>
            <li> I can not speak for others but I have tried viviscal and for me it works like magic ,I have tried other things on the market but this for me is magic in a pill it has done what it said it would do and more, im hooked on this and I will stick with it my hair in one month is long and soft all I no is that it works wonderful for me so thank you viviscal I love your product....5***** in my book...</li>
            <li> After just two weeks, it&#x27;s made a difference. My hair feels thicker and has grown like a weed! Even my husband noticed it looked longer and healthier!</li>
            <li> After about 6 weeks my hair appears to be growing again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  really too soon 2 tell ,but my hair seems  2 be growing  faster.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the last 6 months and I&#x27;m super happy with the result thus far. I started seeing hair growth after 3 months of taking the tablets daily. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> thanks this is my second box hoping  for more hair</li>
            <li> I read lots of reviews on this product before I ordered them and they were all pretty positive but I took these tablets for well over 6 months and did not see any difference in the thickness of my hair.  They might work for some people but they did not work for me.  Maybe it makes a difference what the cause of each person&#x27;s thinning hair is - just know it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for one month. I have not seen any results yet, but everything I have read online suggests that it takes about 4 months of regular use to see a benefit. That said, I will continue to use it. I just wish it were more affordable.</li>
            <li> I used this for the three months it suggested and my nails and hair grew. It made my nails longer but not that much stronger though they still chipped. My hair was a lot finer/weaker before its use and now its longer and stronger and slightly thicker than before. It didn&#x27;t cause pimples or a bad after taste, just put a dent in my wallet. I may use this again in the future hopefully if the price goes down.</li>
            <li> After a few days (5) I started breaking out pretty bad. I get that my case might be very rare but is possible to break out from vitamins. I discontinued the use of the pills. And might try the hair products instead</li>
            <li> After just a couple of months on Viviscal I could tell a big difference in the amount of hair I was losing. Before Viviscal, my hair fell out by the handful after each shampooing and more during comb out and styling. With Viviscal hair loss is at a minimum. I haven&#x27;t changed any other aspect of my daily routine, I.e. diet, stress, exercise, etc.  if you want to keep the hair you have, I recommend this nutrient. Haven&#x27;t noticed increase in thickness, just hair loss is considerably less.&lt;br /&gt;The 4 star rating instead of 5 is due to the price. Considering trying biotin supplements to see if I can get the same results for less $.</li>
            <li> Before ordering this item I searched trying to find out ingredients. Took a chance &amp; ordered it anyway. However, once I received it, I found that it contained fish oil/ingredients &amp; I am allergic to fish &amp; was unable to consume products. I wasted my money. I would have appreciated knowing what ingredients contained or at least mention of allergy information.</li>
            <li> I took this for months, honestly cant say I saw any difference but then when I stopped taking it I started noticing my hair being less managable, not sure if its related or not. I personally would not spend the money again.</li>
            <li> Though I did not purchase Viviscal from Amazon, It really does work. I&#x27;m a normal 22 year old African Male that just wanted quicker and thicker hair growth and although it says 6 months to see any results I grow and inch in one month along with less shedding and some thickness. I&#x27;m extremely impatient with hair growth so if your like me but your hesitant to try a product you should definitely give Viviscal a try its worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I used this for a while and my skin and hair looked great, stopped using it and I started shedding like crazy and my skin did&#x27;t look as good. I started using again and the shedding stopped and skin looks health again.</li>
            <li> Definitely effective...due to stress my hair had literally not grown for over 3 yrs, and after taking this for about 2 months not only did i notice lenghth finally, but outrageous shine! Only problem is too expensive for me to keep buying it every month...i have 3 kids and cannot justify spending that kind of money on my hair! But if you got the cash, it works...you must keep taking it for at least 6 months though</li>
            <li> This helps my hair stay thick (I&#x27;ve got terribly thin hair and this has berms godsend). And even makes my fingernails thicker and stronger. Takes time to start working - but nothing else replaces it. It&#x27;s amazing how fast my nails get thin (obviously since they grow faster it&#x27;s easier to judge that the hair). Expensive but for me worth it- if you&#x27;ve got thick hair then I wouldn&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> My hair is looking healthier and it&#x27;s not falling out as much. The produce came pretty fast in the mail</li>
            <li> I used this for a full year hoping it would help over the long term, all it did was drain my wallet. Save your money and just take something cheaper.</li>
            <li> I cut my hair (impulsively) and I immediately hated it lol. I specifically bought this product to help with length and to grow back a bit faster and it definitely serves its purpose!! I have seen nothing but length growth within the first few months and still going, and other people have noticed my hair getting longer too. Awesome! HAPPY CUSTOMER :-D</li>
            <li> Just started taking this ,I liked them hope they work for me .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this for 3 months now and just started my 4th box. I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s stopped or slowed my hair from falling out. My hair is still coming out in handfuls. I just started taking zinc picolinate about a week ago as I heard that helps hair actually grow back (as opposed to just stopping it from falling out). Hoping that will help. Will update posting in a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I can say, though, is that my eyelashes are growing fuller and longer! I&#x27;ve never had long eyelashes, but this stuff made my skimpy eyelashes fill in and grow noticeably longer!</li>
            <li> It works...enough said.</li>
            <li> ^What I said there. Waste of money. Do not recommend unless you want to throw your money away like I did.</li>
            <li> My hair is thinning and I&#x27;m always looking for something to help. I wish this product had been the one, but it wasn&#x27;t the one for me.</li>
            <li> The seller sent these pills in a very old, damaged box. The box was covered with stains and was torn. Taking pills from a damaged box or container is never advised and I was very surprised the seller thought is was appropriate to send it. Also, the pills were a few months from expiration and their shelf life is 3 years, so the pills were sitting on their shelf for quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of the product itself, I am still in the process of seeing how it works. I took them for a month and now have to skip a few weeks (since I have to return this box). In that month, I didn&#x27;t see a change. But, I think it&#x27;s still too soon to tell.</li>
            <li> I read about this product in a recent Vogue article that mentioned the models use it to grow out their hair.  Although I was skeptical, I continued to use this product for the past 4 months and have noticed longer hair.  I have recommended it to friends and family.</li>
            <li> My hair is no longer frizzy or dull looking.  It looks healthy and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;However, I don&#x27;t think it has made any additional hair grow.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to take it.  I started taking 2 tablets a day four months ago&lt;br /&gt;and now I take 1 or 2 tablets a day.</li>
            <li> The tablets seem to be helping, have to use longer to be sure. After my next set of tablets I should be sure, hair seems to be stronger than before the viviscal.</li>
            <li> I cut my hair a month ago.. Im not sure how much it grew but it definitely grew back!! and it did not grow all back in split ends(like it usually does). My hair is in a renewing process lol. I am dominican and i have coarse hair. I do get perms done every 2-3 months or so! the point is.. my hair grew! and this does work :)</li>
            <li> i rated it a five star because i have been using this product for about 5 months now, hair has grown faster than normal. wish it would repair hair better on top of my head, still space and missing hair, have had to invent new hair styles to look have way decent and hide my thin hair on top. product was recommend on dr oz show by a well known hair dresser. i would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t count on this product to increase the thickness of your hair.  It will however increase the length, which is still makes this a great product.  I&#x27;m glad my stylist recommended it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know how many stars to give this.  It may indeed help most people a great deal and I thought it might help me keep my thinning hair as a 62 year old woman.  However, it gave me headaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sensitive to red wine,  chocolate, aged cheese, nuts, MSG, and other foods.  I believe it is the Horsetail herb in these that causes migraines for me.  I have run into this herbs in other supplements I have tried and now will avoid any concoction which contains Horsetail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I am unable to take it I suppose it is a one star for me, but didn&#x27;t want to hurt the overall rating for a product that may work for people not adversely affected by the ingredients.</li>
            <li> Excellent hair product, it really works to thicken hair</li>
            <li> I believe this product is counterfeit.  My review has nothing to do with Vivescal itself, which I still use and buy directly off their website.  The pills I purchased through Amazon were cheaper, yes, but I started to suspect something was wrong when the packaging was so cheap that taking out one pill usually led to the backing coming off several pills.  So I decided to purchased my next batch through the manufacturer itself.  First and foremost, while I likely couldn&#x27;t tell unless I was doing a side-by-side comparison (which I did), the pills are different sizes.  Second, the material used for the backing of the pills is a bit thicker and thus doesn&#x27;t run when you try to take one pill out.  I can&#x27;t say for sue, but I doubt these pills are real, and rather than take the chance of buying and consuming fake pills, I will be buying directly from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> My hair and nails were never healthier while I was taking Viviscal. I found that taking even less than the recommended dosage helped my hair grow and stay healthy. I would often forget to take the second pill. Love Viviscal and truly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Not only was the packaging different, the ingredients listed on the last order was different when compared to my original order of Viviscal.  I took this last order for a little over a month and started noticing an increase in hair loss and my skin less oily.  It just doesn&#x27;t seem to be as strong as my original order.  I am now getting it thru Walgreens...they have the original Viviscal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try to keep this short. I&#x27;m a male 18 that went through some bad shedding for a combination of stress and possible male patterned baldness. I&#x27;ve been using Rogain and Viviscal twice a day for a month now. My hair is about 4 inches long and there are tons of tiny half-inch strands of hair all over my head. So, I&#x27;m pretty sure this stuff is working, either that or its just the Rogain. The front of my hairline has several half inch strands of hair. Also my facial hair has thickened, along with my nails growing annoyingly fast. Have any questions leave a comment.</li>
            <li> My hair started falling out from medication. Decided to try this...made my hair thicker, longer, and stopped shedding. Also made my nails grow ridiculously fast. This all happened within about four months. However, after about four months this product made my hair and skin so greasy it looked like someone spilled water on me. Then it started making me nauseous and sick. My suggestion would be take it for 3-4 months and then take a break for a month or two before continuing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had moderate thinning hair for over 2 years, ruled out medical causes and have tried the recommended supplementation of B&#x27;s and more.  Tried this product at the recommended dosage and wow! It worked. I&#x27;ve tried to discontinue, however hair loss returns although not at as significant of intensity, thus now using their maintenance dose recommendations and the hair loss is now normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen chatter about an upwards of #30 weight gain.  I&#x27;ve maintained the same diet and exercise level during use of this supplement and only have a #7 - 10 gain,  but it definitely is harder to shed.  Something one should consider before purchasing this supplement.</li>
            <li> I have been only taking this product for a month now and ever since I have started taking it I have had crazy pimple breakouts. Especially on my forehead!! And I have never had breakouts like this ever, not even in my teen years!</li>
            <li> I Love this product. It is a must have and it really works. I could not find it at my neighborhood beauty salon, so I had to order it. I heard about it on the Dr. Oz show</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve been on this for 9 months now and i have not noticed a difference at all, my hair is only growing at its normal rate (yes i am sure because i have been literally measuring my growth with a tape measure). I&#x27;m so bummed because 9 months of this product has been expensive and i really wanted it to work but nothing noticeable has happened.  Maybe this works for some people, maybe some people just desperately want to believe its working but for me it did nothing. Its a shame that they say it takes 3-5 months to see results because by then you&#x27;ve already spent a ton of money before you realize there are no results...</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not sure yet if it really works.  I&#x27;ll probably need to do this 4 2-3 months as is recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for about a week but I&#x27;m already able to tell a difference in the amount of hair that I leave in the shower. The plan is to try for at least 3 months and see if there is a noticeable difference. May have to get back at that time to update my review. Hope it continues to be positive.</li>
            <li> I had taken this last year for about 6 months to stop my fine, thin hair from falling out so fast, ran out, and didn&#x27;t repurchase.  Well - a month or so later, I noticed my hair was falling out in the shower and also when I&#x27;d comb it after coming out of the shower.  I immediately repurchased Viviscal and also purchased 5000 mg tablets of Biotin and I&#x27;ve been taking one Viviscal tablet and one Biotin tablet a day for the past 5 or so months.  I&#x27;m happy to report that my hair loss has stopped.  I wasn&#x27;t looking for my hair to grow longer, because it&#x27;s just too thin, just wanted to retain what little hair I have and the supplements are helping. I won&#x27;t make the mistake of not taking these again.  Dag, getting older sure is expensive...</li>
            <li> My hair seems to have become stronger and healthier since I started taking these supplements several months ago.  I get them every month.</li>
            <li> It really does the work. My hair and the strength of my nails improved 100%. It is a great product.</li>
            <li> Product contains shark which is endangered! Do not support this if you care about the environment and ocean ecosystems.</li>
            <li> If you want to grow your hair thicker and longer this is the product.but be patient because you won&#x27;t see results for at least 3 months.</li>
            <li> hair is thicker after&lt;br /&gt;3 months</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking them for about 3 weeks but i think its still to soon to tell.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes the pills make my stomach hurt even when taken with food.</li>
            <li> UPDATE Jan 20 2014:&lt;br /&gt;I have reached 1 year using this product, and I am still happy with it. I have about 6 inches of new growth and it is much shinier and healthier than before I started this product. I still shed a bit everyday, but I think it is a normal amount. I have also recently started thyroid medication within the last month, so I&#x27;m hoping that will help as well. The ends were so damaged I had to cut it off to my collarbone, and would love to have longer hair but the time summer gets here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previous review April 2013:&lt;br /&gt;My hair started falling out almost two years ago, and to this day I do not have an accurate reason why. Whether a thyroid issue, stress, nutrient imbalance, slight iron deficiency, there were many possible options but no conclusions. (I am 24). I tried many different things to help my hair stop falling out, but it continued to shed and I had lost about 70% of my hair before I found viviscal. I tried evening primrose oil, fish oil, biotin, and other specialty hair supplements. NO luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have almost reached the end of three months with viviscal and my hair has made a magnificent turnaround. I only am shedding a couple of strands a day now (like normal) and I am seeing some serious new growth. My roots look healthier, shinier as well. I am excited to see how my hair looks at 6 months. I used to have very long hair but had to cut it to about shoulder length because the ends were so thin. I can&#x27;t wait to have long hair again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has literally turned my life around. I would pay twice as much for it. I used to cry and cry about my thinning hair, convinced I would need a wig one day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give this product a try, and give it at least three month to do its thing. Hopefully it works for you too!</li>
            <li> The product seemed to help produce more very fine hair growth but not enough to warrant my continued use. I am sure the results vary from person to person--My doctor had recommended it to me.</li>
            <li> I really believe this product has made a difference in my hair!  The fine hairs around my face that used to break off and give the appearance of thinning hair seem to be gaining strength and body daily.  I would recommend this product even though it takes at least 3-6 months to see the results.</li>
            <li> I bought these after needing to get a haircut I didn&#x27;t want due to split ends. So far I&#x27;m getting some results - hair isn&#x27;t breaking as much, but I&#x27;m not noting extra growth. Nails are much better.</li>
            <li> Great result!!  Saw results after using only four weeks.  Hair is thicker and longer.  Will continue to use Viviscal for life.</li>
            <li> After a few pills I noticed my hair started falling out so I stooped taking the pills immediately. I have very thin hair and did not want to lose any more.</li>
            <li> well It took about 5 months, but it works...gave it 4 stars because of price! Other than that, great product!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s made any noticeable difference, much to my disappointment.  I&#x27;ve been using religiously for about 3-4 months.  Was hoping my hairdresser would say something but she hasn&#x27;t made a comment either.  After I finish this supply, son&#x27;t buy anymore.</li>
            <li> I went through a time of high stress, poor diet, and as a result- lost half of my hair (no kidding). It was the most depressing thing ever. I took these for a probably a year and half and now my hair is beautiful again after letting it fully grow back out. People tell me I have beautiful hair now, where as before I use to look like I had a disease.. That much of a difference. It takes time, I had baby hair at first and then they grew and got stronger, the whole process was atleast a year. I still buy these just because I am afraid that my hair will go back and take them maybe once every other day. HIGHLY recommend it....</li>
            <li> So far, I have received no damage from these. Together with Bosley shamppoo my hair has stopped falling in great quantities. This is a very subjective opinion, I am not certain of it. So, only a &amp;#34;3&amp;#34; , no scientific proof of this. I have ordered twice. I suggest using once a day for weak stomachs.</li>
            <li> I used this product with the claim that it would thicken and grow my hair.  I used the product along with the shampoo, conditioner and scalp cleaner for 1 year and it has not lived up to its claim.  I am dissapointed and would like to have a full refund.  I cancelled my auto shipment and would like to be contacted and compensated.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> excellent...has really helped to strengthen my hair and nails  will continue to keep purchasing product-def. works.  A must have for ppl who have thin or thinning hair or just as a preventitive.</li>
            <li> WHEN I WENT TO TAKE ONE OF THESE PILLS, IT JUST CRUMBLED- I MEAN IT JUST DISINTEGRATED. ALARMED THAT THIS PROBABLY WAS AN EXPIRED PRODUCT, I TOOK OUT THE BOX TO CHECK THE EXPIRATION DATE. LO AND BEHOLD, THE &amp;#34;USE BY&amp;#34; DATE HAD BEEN REMOVED. THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO INFORMATION IN THAT AREA! I BELIEVE THAT I WAS SOLD A PRODUCT THAT HAD EXPIRED AND THAT IS WHY THE PILL DISINTEGRATED. I WAS VERY UPSET AS SOME EXPIRED SUPPLEMENTS CAN BE HARMFUL IF TAKEN. I IMMEDIATELY CONTACTED AMAZON AND THEY SENT A RETURN LABEL AND WILL REFUND ME. I WILL NO LONGER ORDER ANY TYPE OF SUPPLEMENTS OR VITAMINS FROM AMAZON. I WILL GET THEM DIRECTLY FROM THE MANUFACTURER OR FROM MY DOCTOR. EVEN THOUGH IT COSTS MORE, THE SAVINGS ARE NOT WORTH POSSIBLY PUTTING MY HEALTH AT RISK. LESSON?  ALWAYS ALWAYS CHECK THE EXPIRATION INFORMATION ON EVERYTHIN YOU BUY, REGARDLESS OF WHERE YOU BUY IT FROM.</li>
            <li> I think you need to take them for a while to actually see results ... but it has been almost a month and I have noticed a difference</li>
            <li> I am still in my first month of using this product,  am looking forward to positive results! I had a subscription thinking it would lock me into the low price.  To my surprise, my next order had already had a price tag in excess of 5$ ! I am disappointed and went ahead and cancelled my subscription. Amazon should let the consumer know of the flexible subscription rates! Love the product, but do not like the hidden agenda!,</li>
            <li> The item i was told to take by the women who does my hair and so far so good ! i can not wait to see the results in 1 month</li>
            <li> These are great! Work fast</li>
            <li> I am a 31 year-old female who has always had fine/thin hair.  I have long hair, and the only way I have been able to wear it down is with a LOT of product to boost the volume (otherwise it looks flat and sad).  I started taking this product about 2.5 months ago, which was 6.5 months after the birth of my son (which made my hair even thinner).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 2 months after taking the product as directed, I noticed my eyelashes were longer when I went to curl them.  I didn&#x27;t purchase the product for this reason, but it&#x27;s a great side effect!  The next day as I was blow drying my hair, I noticed LOTS of little inch to two inch hairs framing my face.  I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair every day, so this was a shock!  The length isn&#x27;t noticeable (thankfully), but it has added volume to my hair, and I know they&#x27;ll only become longer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A week later, I went to the hair salon.  As my hair stylist was blow drying my hair, she made a comment about the several new small hairs on my scalp.  That sealed the deal for me that this product works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like that this product needs to be taken twice daily.  I don&#x27;t take a lot of medications, so I find it a little annoying.  It&#x27;s also sad to think that if I stop taking this product, I&#x27;m back to the way my hair was.  Other than that, I have nothing but positive things to say about it (and also love that it&#x27;s cheaper to purchase on Amazon than Walgreens)!</li>
            <li> LOOK AT THE NUTRITION PERCENTAGES!!&lt;br /&gt;I was never the kind of person to react easily to small portions. I am a very small person, but I was always needing something stronger for results(pain killers/. I could notice more health in the new growth of my hair, but i would have appreciated MORE than what I had after couple months of using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though the product claims to be &amp;#34;Extra Strength&amp;#34; the percentages tell a different story. I advise future consumers to compare ingredients and amounts.</li>
            <li> This stuff is GREAT!  It truly, truly works and I highly recommend!  It does take a couple of months to start seeing results, but then it gets so much better.  By the end of one month the texture of my hair had improved, by the end of 2 months, you could really start seeing genuine growth at the hairline.  After 3 months the growth was more dense and by the end of four months there was a lot more.  I highly recommend this product, it is the ONLY thing that works!</li>
            <li> I have been using them for 30-45 days but I have been taking 2 one day and 1 the next day. They are pretty expensive so I was trying to conserve them a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice they made my stomach a bit bloated the first day but it went away shortly after. I have not noticed longer hair yet but I will reorder to see if I need more time to see results.</li>
            <li> I suggest you try it and keep using.  My hair and nails are growing!  I have had no other side effects.</li>
            <li> I love this vitamin for hair. My hair was being affected by so many hear meds. it worked fast and my hair is definitely thicker after using for only a month.</li>
            <li> I have not taken this product for a full month yet so I am not sure how well it will work for me.</li>
            <li> I really had a bad hair day every day and I decided to be pro active. I tried for 2 months and immediately see great results. My hair had been trimmed but I already noticed the difference after I&#x27;ve been taking the tablets every day. My hair feels soft,looks fuller and more shiney and more bounce. I did everything possible to regain the health of my hair like when I was a younger and never had my hair felt and looked soooo healthy until I took viviscal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Viviscal Extra Strength Hair Nutrient tablets for about 5 months now and I am seeing a difference. I used this product before (three months) didn&#x27;t see a change, then stopped. Then, after reading about this product in beauty mags and blogs, I decided to try again this past November. The changes are subtle, but my temples, which were thinning (I&#x27;m a 43 year-old female) are now covered in again. Also, I notice that my hair is easier to style and holds a style better. I&#x27;m going to keep going because even though I don&#x27;t notice too much more, I&#x27;ve gotten compliments from other people about my hair AND eyelashes - a bonus effect I wasn&#x27;t expecting. I&#x27;m sticking with it for a full year to see what it does. I&#x27;ll decide then if it&#x27;s worth $30 a month (for the rest of my life, I&#x27;m guessing)</li>
            <li> This product is working for me. I am using it in conjunction with Equate minoxal 2%, and had visible change within 2 weeks. I will be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for about a month now, but I am pretty poor at remembering to take it. I have taken 15 so far, so roughly one every other day, and I must say that I can still see results. While it has not been long enough to see any real hair growth differences, I can tell you with 100% certainty that my nails, which are made of keratin just like hair, are growing at a much faster rate. I have fake nails, and I normally get a refill every 3-4 weeks. I am currently on day 12 since my last refill, and I am already in need of another!! This means that the rate at which my nails are growing has nearly doubled! I am hoping for good results from my hair as well as time goes on. I will be buying this product again, as well as recommending it to my friends.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time &amp; recently stopped &amp; realized it was keeping me from losing weight that I needed to lose.  This makes me so frustrated.  I finally found something to help w/hair loss &amp; then there is another problem (side effect).  :(</li>
            <li> I order this vitamins trhoug Amazon.com few days ago; but I have been taking these for months. I used to buy them at Ulta. This is the best  product - vitamin for hair around. I&#x27;m having an Alopecia Areata episode for almost a year now, and having  this vitamins twice a day has help me A LOT with my hair. In just 4 - 5 months, has worked wonders with it.</li>
            <li> I tried this for 3 months. Got no results. I switched and finally tried it works hair skin nails and you would no believe my results! I got 3\\&quot; my first month, now getting about 2-2.5\\&quot;. It&#x27;s amazing. $33 [...]&lt;br /&gt;I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed. I wasted so much money before I found these amazing pills.&lt;br /&gt;That is my personal hair pic from 1.5 months of taking them.</li>
            <li> I started taking this 2 weeks ago and suddenly, I have acne - I read the reviews about potential acne and re-read the ingredients and could find no real fault - the marine complex is the only thing new to me. I assume this is fish oil.  I regularly take Irwin Naturals hair skin and nail formula - and it has some of the ingredients as Viviscal (most notably the Biotin).  I stopped taking this when I started taking the Viviscal.  I am trying an experiment - only 1 Viviscal a day with the 2nd pill being my Irwin product.  I am staggering the pills at different AM &amp; PM times., in other words - Viviscal one day in the AM, net day in the PM.  As for my hair, it is too soon to tell - it looks good - is thick but very fine and naturally curly.  I noticed a lot of hair fallout as did my hair stylist - so I thought I would give it a try .  I will let you all know how  my &amp;#34;experiment&amp;#34; works!</li>
            <li> made my hair grow for sure!  i had a Mohawk i needed to grow out for work (i am a girl) and this helped speed up the process, so much so i noticed my hair slow down growing when i stopped taking them.  i would have kept buying them if they were cheaper.</li>
            <li> Love it and it works.</li>
            <li> Product hasn&#x27;t done anything for my hair.</li>
            <li> These vitamins are great! At first, I was thinking they weren&#x27;t going to work because my hair was growing so slowly. Then, after about 1-1/2 months of taking the vitamins, my hair growth really increased! I went from about 1/8\\&quot; a month to 1/2\\&quot; a month of new growth. I haven&#x27;t been on the vitamins quite 3 months, and I&#x27;ve gained over an inch of new growth since starting the vitamins. I get them on Auto Ship, &amp; I plan to continue to take them for atleast the next 6-9 months. I would definitely recommend Viviscal...it works!</li>
            <li> Hey everyone! I started using this product a month ago. I used to use just Biotin vitamins, but I could not tell a difference between taking them and not taking them so I wanted to try something different and that&#x27;s when I found Viviscal. I was skeptical at first, because $40 for hair vitamins a month sounds crazy ridiculous. Especially if my husband knew just how much I was spending! Lol I recently got my hair chopped off because it had a ton of dead ends-I didn&#x27;t want to get it chopped off, but unfortunately their was nothing else to do. I can definitely tell a huge difference in my hair. It is so much thicker and fuller! More vibrant and shiny! I&#x27;m 22 and in nursing school with a 2 yr old son. My hair would fall out all the time in the shower and clog the drain. Since I started these vitamins I have yet to have a clogged drain and when I do shampoo my hair with baking soda it does not fall out. I started the &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34; shampoo and conditioner when I began this vitamin, and using no heat except for occasionally blow-drying my hair and it has worked wonders on my hair. Would highly recommend doing both to achieve healthy and vibrant hair.</li>
            <li> So far I have used it for about one month. I need to give it more time but I will stick with it.</li>
            <li> 36 years old with very fine, thinning hair. This worked like a dream to stop my horrific shedding and eventually give me fuller hair. I used it dilligently for nearly 2 years, and noticed it working after about 4 months. However, myself and many others (search the internet for &amp;#34;viviscal acne&amp;#34;), have gotten terrible acne problems from using it. To the point of large dime sized cystic spots that stuck out 1/8th of an inch off my forehead and took weeks to go away, only to reappear after a month or so. All in all, would I recommend this? Only with that info presented upfront, and still with hesitiation. Two weeks after I stopped taking it, I started shedding again. Sad. :(</li>
            <li> It works! Great price!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I was already 3 months in taking this product before I ordered the 60 tablet box. After about 4 months of taking Viviscal, people have started to notice that may hair had gotten longer and isn&#x27;t as thin as it used to be. You have to take the product as directed to see results. It does work!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t trust all these vitamin companies claiming to grow hair longer etc..I took this as instructed religiously for months but it didn&#x27;t help my hair at all.. Infact it  broke me out horribly !! I had the worst case of acne ever . It may have helped others but I don&#x27;t believe it</li>
            <li> The niacin in this product caused me to break out in a huge rash all over my body.  Make sure you are aware of this if you try it.  I didn&#x27;t get to use it long enough to see if it helped my hair loss, but be aware if you start a rash that it may be caused by this product.</li>
            <li> No change in shedding, if not, more shedding! Hair still grease up hours after shampoo. After several months, not a bit of change, that&#x27;s a bit disappointing. I would say the packaging is sleek and the tablets are small and easy to swallow, wth . Still looking and doing my homework on growing back healthy hair</li>
            <li> I started using this product about 4 months ago. After the first month, I felt that my hair looked alittle healthier, and better. But now I&#x27;m not seeing any change at all. My hair is still as thin as ever, and it still falls out just as much as it used to. The instructions say to use for 6 months before seeing a change, so I still have two more months to go. I am hoping I see an improvement.</li>
            <li> No signs of improvement thus far after 3 mos. usage. Will continue through 6 mos. and monitor progress.  Will advise again post 6 mos.</li>
            <li> I started taking these vitamins 6 months ago after researching hair growth vitamins and reading Amazon user reviews.  After 3 months I REALLY noticed the difference - my hair had grown about 3 inches.  Since I started taking the vitamins my hair has grown about 6 inches; it would have taken years to achieve that growth w/o Viviscal. Like others, I also experienced rapid hair growth in other locations requiring shorter interval betweens shaving/waxing.  All in all, I am very satisfied and will continue taking the vitamins for a few more months until I achieve the desired hair length.</li>
            <li> Hair grew everywhere but on my head!</li>
            <li> seems to be a good product, does not upset my stomach and I have a bad stomach, so that is good.  have not been taking it long enough for any results</li>
            <li> Been using it for a month I&#x27;ve noticed my hair has stopped falling ..</li>
            <li> This works. You have to take it regularly, but it&#x27;s worth the money. My hairdresser even told her other clients about the difference it made for my hair, and urged them to take it.</li>
            <li> I think this is a excellent product, I will be purchasing it in the near future, as well as recommend to my family &amp; friends.</li>
            <li> I lost a LOT of my hair due to S T R E S S.......I&#x27;d tried EVERY supplement in th world. But I&#x27;m telling you that my hair has never felt thicker or healthier.  I do NOT believe it grows hair. But it does really give the hair you&#x27;ve got all it needs to prosper!  My girlfriend tried it too and she feels EXACTLY the same!  LOVE IT!! Give it a couple of months to really start to feel the difference. I took two a day until two weeks from now it will be SIX months and I drop down to one tablet a day.  You&#x27;ve got nothing to loose but more hair!! :0)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 4 or 5 months now. To stretch my supply out I take one at night and a biotin in the morning. I&#x27;ve always had thin fine hair, And my hair slightly thicker and definitely stronger because its able to grow longer now without breaking. I&#x27;m really surprised that this product actually really works. I&#x27;d highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I am 40 years old and experienced ALOT of hair loss after the birth of my son 4 years ago. I&#x27;ve always had finer hair but after his birth I was losing clumps of hair and my hair started receeding very badly.  My hair still growed in length and got a little better over time but still had the receeding hair line. I cut my hair in a short hair style (short in back and longer on sides) and by July regretted it.  I heard about Viviscal from People magazine and started using it the end of August. I take 2/day and within my first month had A LOT of new hair growth in my hairline.  I have to gel the stray short hairs or they stick straigh up all along my part line...okay problem to have!  Its been 1.5 months since I started and about a week ago I washed my hair and it felt EXTREMLY waxy and greasy. I use Aveda products so I know its not my products). I tried a couple of other shampoos/conditioners and am still getting the same results. I airdry or blow dry my hair and it looks greasy especially the back. I went online to see if others were having this problem and someone had redcommended using a clarifying shampoo and Listerine. I did this a few times last night and once this morning. It helped a little but still greasy in the back. I started reading reviews of people that take Viviscal and saw that there are others who complain of getting greasy hair once they started using this product.  Because I am seeing new hair growth, minimal shedding and hair getting longer I am going to continue for the full 90 days then change to taking 1 tablet per day to maintain.  I&#x27;ll be back in a few months to see if anything changes.</li>
            <li> Noticed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first box.  I took there before for a couple of months and noticed increased nail strength, less hair fallout but new growth,&lt;br /&gt;not really.  Maybe you need to take longer than a couple of months.  Since taking this box I really have noticed less fall out which is good, but would love to see the growth!!!  So I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars yet!</li>
            <li> Really works.  Hair growth of at least 1 inch per month!</li>
            <li> Excellent. On my second month.  Helping a lot!!</li>
            <li> This really does work! For some reason, about a year ago I lost about half of my hair. I went from having to twist my pony tail holders twice, to four times. I was embarrassed to wear my hair down because it became so thin. I saw Viviscal in an ad in a magazine, and looked online to see what the reviews of it were, and they were really good so I tried it. After 3 months I have noticed a pretty big increase in volume around my scalp. My hair dresser even commented on being able to feel the difference in the hair close to my scalp, and the longer hair. Not only is the volume of hair better, but the over-all health of my hair is better. Also, my eyelashes seem to be fuller. I will definitely continue to use this!!</li>
            <li> Some past reviewers said it did not help their hair, or took several months.  I don&#x27;t know if it was &amp;#34;wishful imagining&amp;#34; on my part, but within 2 weeks of starting these tablets, it looked to me like I was losing less hair.  Actually there was less hair in my brushes.  In the past I would always find stray hairs (mine are gray so they show up) on my clothing, etc. I had a lot less of them after starting Viviscal.  Will have to order more, but I think it did the trick!</li>
            <li> the choice of my wife.  she has used it for years to prevent hair loss due to medication.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.Been using this product 2 years now...my hair has NEVER been this long in my life and I&#x27;m 55.It does work. It was also cheaper to buy it here even considering the shipping charges than at a drug store where I had been purchasing.</li>
            <li> I have been using viviscal for almost a year now.. its a good product my hair has improved dramtically .. Its much more thicker and looks healthy.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I have been using it for a while now, and I do believe that it makes my hair much stronger.</li>
            <li> Saw this product in Cosmo an decided to try. I used to clean my brush several times a day. Today I am cleaning tit once a week. Not too bad ...</li>
            <li> On my second order - hair loss has definitely slowed down.  Time will tell.</li>
            <li> It does take longer for some to see results but I did notice new hair growth after 6 months.  WIsh they still had it.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and expected great results but I was very disappointed.  I was excited the first two days because my hair was nice and shiny but it went downhill after that.  My hair started to shed excessively and I began to get bald spots around my hairline and red bumps.  I will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Decided to start taking this because I&#x27;m 30 and I lose a lot of hair. I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference after only two and a half months of use (I&#x27;m on my third package), I don&#x27;t lose less hairs but I have noticed a lot of new growth in the form of small frizzy hairs poking out which is a good sign. Will continue to use because I like the combination of daily vitamins it provides, and I have zero complaints about how my skin and hair look lately. It contains biotin which can make some people break out a little at first, stick to it for a while and you&#x27;ll get over that. Amazon&#x27;s price is just too good not to give it a real try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE*  June 24, 2015&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I had to give it up because it was giving me diarrhea, which is too bad because it really worked. My hair stylist was shocked at how long my hair had gotten since I last got it cut. I still recommend giving it a try if you don&#x27;t have a pre-existing sensitive stomach like I do.</li>
            <li> Every time I use Viviscal I find changes last batch actually had an Odor and taste of fish the last batch has marine complex that I am allergic too and had a bad reaction</li>
            <li> The items are okay but be aware this product makes hair grow everywhere. It seems that I grew more hair on my upper lip than I did on my scalp!</li>
            <li> i took it for 5 months and experriced a very slight differnce.  not worth the money.  just going with mutlivitamins</li>
            <li> I have no complaints thus far...in the midst of using this product right about now, so, no verdict is in just yet. I did receive this order from Amazon,com in a timely fashion, so...about Amazon,com, again--no complaints.</li>
            <li> So far taking tabs twice day for about 3 weeks&lt;br /&gt;No new growth, same amount of hair shedding.&lt;br /&gt;Will continue taking, plan to give it 3 months and I really hope to see an improvement!!</li>
            <li> I started taking Viviscal in April 2012. Within 2-3 months, I was noticing that my hair was fuller.  At 6 months I felt that I had a new head of hair.  It&#x27;s much thicker, has alot of body and doesn&#x27;t need to be washed on a daily basis anymore.  Even on a second day, I&#x27;m amazed how full it looks.  I started my 96 yr. old aunt on the regimen this summer and she&#x27;s noticing regrowth as well.  The fact that it&#x27;s natural and safe really got me hooked at the start.  I will continue taking this indefinitely!</li>
            <li> Since starting this, my hair has stopped shedding as much and there seems to be some new growth. I would definitely recommend this. Also a pointer eat something beforehand otherwise you may have an upset stomach (this happened a few times to me when I forgot to eat something first).</li>
            <li> These have quality ingredients and they convenient if you don&#x27;t want to a million individual vitamins a day. I unfortunately did not take these reguralry enough and did not see results .</li>
            <li> Doctors say it&#x27;s nonsense however some of us will try anything for hair and it&#x27;s harmless. But really expensive. It&#x27;s hard to assess if it works.  My hair is growing but I use so much stuff it&#x27;s hard to know</li>
            <li> Also gave me headaches frequently so I took longer to go through box  almost thought about quitting product but I wanted longer hair!</li>
            <li> When my hairdresser commented on how thick my hair is getting, I knew this product was helping. I have noticed my nails are growing faster, too. Given the ingredients, it makes sense this product would work, and I think it does.</li>
            <li> I started using Viviscal confident that it would do what it said and I am amazingly happy with the results.  I only used it twice a day for two weeks and now only once a day.  I have more hair than I know what to do with in only 4 weeks.  I also noticed my nails which had been splitting for the past two years have stopped splitting and are so thick and long like they were in my thirties.  Can&#x27;t say enough about it.:-)</li>
            <li> Ive taken a lot of supplements for hair growth but this is my favorite. I already feel my hair is stronger and thicker! I will buy it again</li>
            <li> Noticed improvement after about 3 mos.  No more hair on the drain when I wash my hair.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Y&#x27;ALL THIS PRODUCT WORKS... My hair is thin to begin with, and I have spent years bleaching it (I love myself blonde, since that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve always been). My hair has gotten dry and breaks over time. Anyways- I&#x27;ve tried every product out there to lengthen/strengthen my hair and haven&#x27;t seen any results. I&#x27;ve taken: Biotin, Nioxin, Prenatals and SEVERAL other vitamins. If you&#x27;re looking for something that works and works FAST... buy this! NO JOKE, NO SCAMS. I take this with Mane n Tail shampoo/conditioner and I cannot tell you how fast my hair has regained strength! :) :) :)</li>
            <li> My nails have grown and are stronger I haven&#x27;t noticed much hair growth that differs from my usual growth. but I am not finished with the dosage yet.</li>
            <li> The product stopped hair loss partially at one pill a day and completely with two pills a day.  It was so natural.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s been working! I&#x27;ve been taking Viviscal 2x daily since Feb 1st, and have been documenting my progress to make sure I wasn&#x27;t totally wasting my money. My hair definitely feels thicker and healthier, and I think it has been growing much faster than normal. It typically doesn&#x27;t grow very fast at all, and is super fine. From Feb to June, my hair has grown probably 3 or 4 inches. In my picture, the one on the left is February 1st, and the one on the right is at the end of June. In that time I got two haircuts, just for trims to clean up split ends. I&#x27;m going to continue to take Viviscal until my hair grows about 5-6 more inches, I think it works. :)</li>
            <li> I had hoped this stuff would help, but I seem to be allergic to some of its ingredients.  I don&#x27;t have any seafood allergies, but two days after I started taking the Viviscal, I started to develop a rash along my hairline.  I&#x27;m bummed, but I guess I&#x27;m out of luck.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I first heard about viviscal.  My hair is very thin and I have quite a bit of fall out. I took viviscal for almost 8 months and I did not see much of a difference at all. My hair did stop falling out as much but not enough for me to keep spending money each month.</li>
            <li> I am a 41 year old African American female.  I have been using Viviscal for about 2 years now.  With this product slow and steady wins the race.  My hair had never grown much past my shoulders without breaking.  I can happily say that my hair is now about two inches above my waist.  I would NEVER have believed my hair could grow so long if I had not witnessed the results with my own eyes.  Funny thing is I never took Viviscal for hair growth but I took it to reduce shedding and prevent/ reverse hair thinning.  It has done all of the above.  It is a bit pricey, but so worth the money.  But I need to emphasize this product works from the inside and takes time to work.  Please give it a minimum of six months before you decide if it is working.  But with Viviscal, your patience will be rewarded.</li>
            <li> i heard all the ads and saw a lot of good reviews, i have been using propecia for years and had great results up till about 3 years ago. so i have tried several different things since the propecia seems to lose its effectiveness and the generic doesn&#x27;t work at all. but after using vivascal for about week my hairfall out instensified and my hair got very dry and brittle, exactly the opposite of what i heard. so i am afraid to keep using the pills waste of money but this isnt the first the has failed me. anyone who hasn&#x27;t tried propecia and can afford it definitely works but the genric i am suspect of,. I was just re reading sime of the other reviews and several people mentioned their face breaking out I didn&#x27;t even given any thought but clearly this is must be the cause of my recent acne I&#x27;ve never had a problem before my life I&#x27;m 50 plus years old and a couple weeks of taking those pills I&#x27;ve had some really bad skin break out and didn&#x27;t realize it was related to vivascal until i read the reviews again. Do not take this stuff</li>
            <li> I am only a month and a half in, so in this amount of time I have seen no difference. I plan to give this product six months. I will give an updated review then.</li>
            <li> I tried these pills for seven months, which adds up to alot of money and I was very disappointed. I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my thin hair.</li>
            <li> Finally, a product that does what it says it will.  My hair stopped falling out and started growing in stronger.  Thank you Viviscal!</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!!!! I didn&#x27; expect for my hair to grow longer however I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 1/2 months so far I and I can really see and feel a difference in my hair.  It&#x27;s much fuller than it has ever been.  The last time my hair was this healthy was 20 years ago with my first pregnancy!!!  It grew out at the standard length of a 1/2 inch monthly but it really thickened up nicely.  Before I began using this product my hair was really thinning now it&#x27;s healthy and full.  I also used this product with the Hairomega &amp; Biotin 10,000mg on a regular basis. I will continue to use this on a regular basis as long as they continue to make it.  Thank you Viviscal.  I was a skeptic on this product and was ready to give up on all hair product but I&#x27;m glad I took a chance on this.</li>
            <li> I need to use it for a longer period of time in order to give it a excellent rating.Need more.</li>
            <li> I think the product helps.  My dr. noticed new hair growth in various spots on my head, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m as thin on top as I used to be.</li>
            <li> This product has been amazing! I&#x27;ve only used it for a little more than a month, but is has highly improved the texture of my hair. No more frizz! My hair is so soft! I&#x27;ve also noticed fewer hairs in the shower and on my brush. My hair has grown faster than usual in the past month as well. I&#x27;m a fan, and will buy it again for sure. Only wish I had found it sooner.</li>
            <li> I have taken Viviscal to ward off the effects of losing hair due to the effects of menopause.  At 55 my African American hair is to the middle of my back and almost as full as it was when I was in my 20&#x27;s.  After having permanents for over 30 years, I decided about seven years ago to go natural.  To bet rid of the old permed hair, I cut my hair on three different occasions to a very short bob, right at my ears and began to take Viviscal - twice a day as directed, but back then, I was purchasing it at the original price, which was quite expensive.  So after one month, I backed the dose down to once a day.  I always took the Viviscal for men which isn&#x27;t made anymore because it didn&#x27;t have other fillers like folic acid which I didn&#x27;t need.  I have continued on Viviscal and I am VERY happy with the results.  My hair is slightly thinning in the crown, but I&#x27;m still extremely happy with the results.</li>
            <li> What they don&#x27;t also include is that they differ inside as well.  The strengths are not the same amounts for what is insdie the pill.  Not sure why, I&#x27;ve even clicked on a previous order to make sure I received the same one, but didn&#x27;t happen.  Just a heads up.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I write a review and I’m doing it now so everyone that have some kind of hair loss or their hair  getting thin, will benefit from this product.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this item for my wife after I saw lots of hair in the shower floor.(No way it could be mine since I’m bold)&lt;br /&gt;For few month she was asking me to look for something to help the hair loss stop .After some research on the net I have found this product.&lt;br /&gt;I was not sure it’s the right one for her so I called the company that making it. They told me she will need to take it for up to six month and results will take over a month to show improvement.&lt;br /&gt;So I bought this items for three month supply. Btw she will need to take it twice a day after meal they told me.&lt;br /&gt;Shockingly after 4-5 days only the hair loss stopped completely . (I think completely from what I see. Or I should say don’t’ see)&lt;br /&gt;For now it looks like magic. I think she will continue taking it  until we finish the 3 month supply since we bought  it already, but seeing results less than a week after she is taking it it’s amazing .</li>
            <li> No effect at all. May reduce psychological stress from hair loss because at least you feel you are \\&quot;doing something\\&quot; about it.</li>
            <li> This product does everything it says it does, my hair never looked better, so much shine and body. I get compliments all the time.</li>
            <li> I disappointed in the results, was of money !&lt;br /&gt;I took it for about 6 mo. maybe my nail grew a bit more if anything.Boltin works way better</li>
            <li> This is my second order; it seems to work better than any other supplement that I&#x27;ve previously used eg. Biotin etc. It&#x27;s absoutely  worth a try!</li>
            <li> So far I give it one star because it&#x27;s not doing anything for me at all.  I&#x27;ve taken it for almost 5 months now and not a single new hair.  It says you should see results after 6 months of use, so I am still taking it.  But other reviewers have had much quicker results, so I am very disappointed at this time.  I hope I am not wasting my money.</li>
            <li> I am in the middle of my 2nd month on Viviscal. I think it is too soon to tell if it is actually working for my hair but I do think my nails are stronger and growing faster. I have already been taking biotin supplements for years which helped my nails, but they seem less brittle now since I have been taking this stuff. I will report back if I notice any improvement with my hair. At this point, I think I will continue with this product for a few more months and see what happens. The packaging says it can take 6 months, so I am not concerned that I am not seeing major results yet....stay tuned.....</li>
            <li> I take one per night, and I have definitely noticed positive changes in both my hair and my nails - they grow faster, and my nails do not break as easily as they used to. I have to file them back once a week now, whereas before they would take a month or so of growing before I&#x27;d have to file them. Definitely recommended if you want longer, stronger fingernails!</li>
            <li> The past few years I&#x27;ve noticed my hair thinning at the crown.  Recently I was shocked at how much hair I lost in the shower when combing through conditioner.  No medical reason for this, thought it was age, years of coloring, hot irons, etc.  I tried several products, most very expensive, nothing helped.  I have taken Viviscal for one month.  Happy to say, shocked I&#x27;m losing hardly any hair in the shower now.  Noticed my pony tail actually feels thicker.  I was  skeptical this would work.  Now I am hopeful this will solve my problem.  Also, great price when auto-ordered on Amazon &amp; shipping is very fast.</li>
            <li> The product works. I am male in my mid 30&#x27;s and have been blessed by nature with long hair. I decided to give this a go to make my hair grow faster. However, if you are bald or balding, then it will not work for you. Just invest in baseball caps or that spray-on hair you see in the infomercials. Sorry baldies. At least if you own a convertible, you baldies can drive with the top down. I hear that chrome-domes are more aero-dynamic. Especially with gas prices these days.. sheesh...</li>
            <li> I am in week four of using viviscal. Nothing miraculous but I do already have hair growth in my  sideburn area. My current hair color is a lot darker than my natural strawberry blond so the regrowth is easily apparent. I have more fine hair and not a ton of it so I started using viviscal to hopefully promote more hair growth on my sides and top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No real difference in my nails thati can tell at this point but so far so good. Will update after 2-3 months.</li>
            <li> I have only been taking this for 1 month now heading into my 2nd month.  I haven&#x27;t noticed anything yet but the product states you need to take it for 6 monthss before noticing anything. I am also taking Biotin and Black Current.</li>
            <li> After using Viviscal for 3 months, I&#x27;ve noticed thicker and fuller hair.  The thinning parts of my scalp now have new hair growth.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I really had high hopes for this product. However, I still see lots of hair falling off every time I wash my hair. I am on my 3rd box right now. When is it going to work??</li>
            <li> I had typed a longer review but my browser crashed so here is my second and shorter attempt to submit one:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June 2011: diagnosed with alopecia due to stress and vitamin deficiency. Small area of hair had fallen out beneath the top layers near the crown. Had to style my hair so the bare area wouldn&#x27;t show. Began taking Resveratrol on dermatologist&#x27;s advice.&lt;br /&gt;November 2011: an incompetent new colourist I was trying out re-highlighted all of my fine straight/slightly wavy hair instead of doing just the roots, which caused severe damage and my hair started breaking off. Agadir Argan Oil Moisture Masque made it even worse, causing my hair to rip like wet spaghetti, so I chucked it. There were damaged layers in my hair that was previously all one length. Catastrophe.&lt;br /&gt;December 2012: Dejected, I began applying jojoba oil and wearing it in a chignon. I returned to my original salon with reliable hair professionals.&lt;br /&gt;March 2012: The area of missing hair grew back in after alopecia subsided.&lt;br /&gt;April 2012: I started taking Megafood multivitamins. I began washing and conditioning my hair with organic products. No more sulfate products.&lt;br /&gt;May 2012: I discovered Viviscal in British Elle, ordered it, and began taking it mid-month. After two weeks of using Viviscal twice daily, I noticed my nails were growing much faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point my hair was about five to six inches below my shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;July 2012: I noticed 3/4 inch of hair growth with a tape measure. My hair became oilier more often, but I didn&#x27;t mind.&lt;br /&gt;August 2012: I missed five days of Viviscal before resuming again, and got a healthy hair cut so the damage didn&#x27;t get worse and slow progress. I started using Philip Kingsley Elasticizer Extreme on recommendation from a salon in London.&lt;br /&gt;September 2012: Consistently taking Viviscal. Ran out of Megafood vitamins. I tried not to think about the length so I didn&#x27;t measure my growth.  Near the end of the month, I had a 1/4 inch trim at a long hair salon.&lt;br /&gt;October 2012: I missed another 4-5 days of Viviscal when I ran out during a trip and the local shops didn&#x27;t carry it. Nonetheless, within a month from my last highlighting touch up, most of my hair had grown a full 1 inch, with some areas at 3/4 and baby hair areas a bit less (different areas of hair naturally grow at different rates). Throughout the month I took a 3000mg Biotin supplement with and without Viviscal. No trimming.&lt;br /&gt;November 2012: Ran out of Biotin, but taking Viviscal consistently. Actually, it&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;m taking now. I trimmed 1/4 inch off myself. My hair is healthier, stronger, shinier, and definitely longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By this time I have been air-drying my hair on large rollers, using jojoba oil, sleeping on a satin pillowcase, and detangling with a high quality comb instead of brushing. I rarely use a hairbrush now. No pill can keep up with the damage a person does on the hair itself, so I believe the gentler treatment has helped the results. Now when I get my hair highlighted, I turn down the free blow dry, and I warm/cool blow dry it myself at the salon using my fingers or comb with the dryer at a distance, without subjecting my hair to the extremely damaging brushes used on wet hair aside from the infernal heat that salons normally set dryers to. I don&#x27;t remember exactly when I stopped taking Resveratrol, but it was sometime in early 2012.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The length of my hair is now at my lower mid-back with full, even ends, about 5 inches from my waist. I will see how much more growth will kick in after the six month period. It has been 6 months since I started taking Viviscal. I highly recommend it to those who are patient and can safely take it.inch trim at a long hair salon.&lt;br /&gt;October 2012: I missed another 4-5 days of Viviscal when I ran out during a trip and the local shops didn&#x27;t carry it.

            <li> Into my third month of taking this supplement and haven&#x27;t seen any real results, but I&#x27;m optimistic.  Hope it works.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading the positive reviews. The product does say use for 6 months, this is the first month my hair is growing but the areas where I&#x27;m thinning or balding has shown no improvements. My hair grew quicker when I was taking Biotin. I&#x27;m giving this product another month and if no change I&#x27;ll review my options.</li>
            <li> I take these and use the scalp serum - I am seeing results after one month!</li>
            <li> Just that its a little to expensive for my taste. BUT IT DOES WORK!!! I noticed new hair growth around my hair line after a month, I guess if I would have kept it up, it would have really took off. Good product!</li>
            <li> I have not seen any benefits from taking Viviscal yet. I will continue for a while longer to give it time to work</li>
            <li> Absolutely works! I&#x27;m on auto ship! Cannot live without this stuff!</li>
            <li> These are amazing my hair has grown sooooo long and thick since I&#x27;ve started taking them. It does take a couple months to really notice but they make a major difference</li>
            <li> Not impressed. I saw no difference. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Works for me, I&#x27;ve used this twice a day for almost 6 months, but I saw a difference at 1 month. this will work differently on others, just like everything. You have to commit to this for at least 3 months, if you don&#x27;t see a difference you can walk away knowing you gave it a proper shot. If you get mad at the cost and not seeing any difference at one month I think you shouldn&#x27;t be trying a supplement in the first place.</li>
            <li> arrived very quickly. great product</li>
            <li> Made my face break out so badly I couldn&#x27;t use it after a week so my money went to waste.</li>
            <li> Tried for three months.</li>
            <li> So far I think this is working well!  Plus has other vitamins and minerals in it that are good for you too!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any change in the hair on my head (which was why I was taking it) but I did notice an increase in the length of my eyelashes -  not what I bought it for, but appreciated. I&#x27;d still rather it had some positive effect on my hair.</li>
            <li> I took the regular strength vivisical for about a year and stopped.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if it had done anything for me or not so I decided to take a break and see what happened.  I still wasn&#x27;t sure so I decided to try the vivisical again but this time got the extra strength.  All I can say is watch out!  There is something in this formula that really upset my digestive tract and caused major bloating and discomfort.  At one point I thought I was having chest pain from the esophageal burning it produced.  So... if you are at all sensitive like I am stick with the regular strength if it&#x27;s still available.  This was a huge waste of money for me and I wanted to be sure to let others know that it could be a problem for them as well.</li>
            <li> I have been taking this product for years.  I take one in the morning &amp; an one at night. I tell everyone I know who complain that their is thin, this product will help you, you just have to take it. I am on auto ship.</li>
            <li> I  have been using this product for 3 months now and only see fuzz instead of actual hair growth. How long does this take?</li>
            <li> After dealing with major hair loss for the last 7 years due to change of life, two major surgeries and high level of stress I went to a dermatologist last year and had every blood test known to man and a scalp biopsy all inconclusive. At my wits end I read about Visical and sent for it, used it for three months then stopped feeling the hair loss stopped and my crown and sides were thin, the hair was growing but never thick in those areas again, but not thinner. Now six months later I thought I will try it again and in the last three weeks my hair is growing and so is the hair on my chin fast and furious. I can always go for electrolysis or laser so that will never bother me loss of hair on my head will so I will continue with Visical and other hair thickners like living proof and wen and ojon shampoos.I agree that it is also helping my very weak nails. Good luck to everyone going through this depressing situation and best wishes if you decide to try Visical it is worth it.</li>
            <li> My hair grows in so fine around my temples and this is the only thing that helped fill that in, plus my hair grows so slow and this definitely speeds up the process. You need to continue taking it for more than a month and it really makes a difference. I tell everyone about it. It is really good.</li>
            <li> I JUST started taking those tablets and already 5 days later my hair feels fluffier and got more shine. I understand it takes 3 to 6 month to see the result. But so far 5 days later my skin is getting better (I often get acne if I eat too much sugar/cheese etc) and my nails are growing faster. I have no problems with my nails, but the growth is visible even now. I am very excited to continue taking these vitamins and oh, I did not mention-normally my hair falls out  every day, nothing  extreme, for the past two days its half of the amount that is falling! I will post an update here in about 3 month. So far so good!</li>
            <li> I have been taking the tablets for over 9 months.  The first effect I noticed in the first 3 months of use was in my nails.  They have hardened and do not break and I can grow them much longer.  Within the next 3 months my hair feels thicker, although I could not see any new growth.  I gave it a 4 rating because I still don&#x27;t see (or has little, if any) improvement on the top of my head where it has the thinnest hair.  I still use the product hoping that given more time, I will have more hair growth especially where I need it most.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about two years after reading an article in the newspaper.  Now I think the article may have been a paid plant by the maker. I have not seen seen any visable results and notice a change in result expectations on the package.  I&#x27;m just about ready to save my money and stop using this product.</li>
            <li> This is the third time I have ordered this product. Even though it is only a 30 day supply, it has really kept my hair looking great, and no longer falls out when I wash or brush it!</li>
            <li> Good.  If you&#x27;re trimming your split ends and washing/conditioning your hair - you should see faster growth but only slightly and you have to take the pills for such a long time:  Too expensive.  Intense Grow Hair Vitamins is the best on the market and it&#x27;s only $9.95 a month for a Monthly Membership.  Your hair will grow like grass!  Within 1 to 2 weeks you will see results.</li>
            <li> I will reorder for sure! I really think it&#x27;s helping my hair growth. Having been using since March.</li>
            <li> I just started the product last week and noticed within hour of using product my hair just looked shinier and had a better texture. Then my hair started shedding like crazy. The only thing I did different was cut out my Costco brand hair vitamin when the shedding begun.&lt;br /&gt;I added it back in and am taking it with the viviscal.  The viviscal seems to enhance the effect of the Costco hair vitamin. I am wondering if anyone else had some initial increased shedding? I am hoping it will stop. I really want this to work and am committed to using it for the 6 months.</li>
            <li> I only took 2 tablets and they did not agree with me.  They have magnesium in them and I cannot take anything with magnesium.</li>
            <li> So far after 1 month of taking tables, I notice nothing different.  I am still losing hair at the same rate, no regrowth, but they said 3 months to notice a difference.  I have added Minoxidol drops daily, to try and help regrowth.  Will see what happens after 3 months.</li>
            <li> Best supplement to restore thinning or lost hair.</li>
            <li> These are repeat products for me, and will order again.</li>
            <li> I have used these several times, right now I don&#x27;t seem to notice my hair growing as fast but will finish up the ones I bought and move on.</li>
            <li> The best supplement for hair and nails. It truly does help your hair grow strong and resilient. I have been using it for years. It is not a miracle drug for hair loss, but it does give key nutrients that assist in growing strong vibrant hair. If your hair is in a dormant state it helps to grow. If you have any hair loss issues definitely see your dermatologist and use this to supplement. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I use Reservage Keratin booster vitamins because it&#x27;s the cheap version of the product Kyle Richards from Real Housewives of OC uses (can&#x27;t afford the one she uses which are Nourage).  I have used the Viviscal Extra Strength in the past for at least 6 months at a time.  The only thing I noticed is that my hair was shinier, and oily on the scalp.  So annoying, but it&#x27;s a good sign.  I had to shampoo every day, but I have waist length fine/thin hair and I am 34 - I know thicker hair and older hair doesn&#x27;t need to be washed as much, but using this you may have to wash daily.  I guess it may have made my hair grow faster?  But i don&#x27;t dye my hair so I can&#x27;t really tell.  I&#x27;m getting it again because the Reservage is boosting my growth, and I am trying to get it thicker and I will use this Viviscal in addition to the Reservage to try to get maximum growth and thickness.  Everyone has such good results - my hair is already healthy and pretty but I always want an extra boost!</li>
            <li> I have definitely noticed a difference after almost 4 months of taking Viviscal. I am only taking one tablet a day (half the recommended dose) and my hair is noticeably thicker. I used to shed great amounts daily, now I only lose 1/2-1/3 of what I used to shed. I haven&#x27;t noticed my hair growing any faster, however.</li>
            <li> After a few months there really hasn&#x27;t been any noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> Looks like hair falling less after I start taking viviscal.</li>
            <li> Seen changes in 3 months, on the food the hair that&#x27;s they&#x27;re already, will not help anything thats completely gone</li>
            <li> I have almost hip length hair. I want my hair to grow longer, say down to my butt. My sister thinks I&#x27;m crazy but I guess I have a bad case of hair greed. Now it does no good to have long, dry, brittle hair--and my hair is horribly prone to split ends and frizzies (poofs like crazy during a humid southern summer)--so I decided to try out hair vitamins/supplements. I had been taking a hair vitamin by Country Life and it was working well for me but I wasn&#x27;t achieving the growth I wanted after months of use. I stumbled upon Viviscal while browsing on Amazon and decided to try it out. I have been taking this supplement for about 2-3 weeks. It has made my nails super strong (almost afraid I&#x27;ll grow crazy nail claws like Lady Deathstrike!), and while I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant growth, I feel that my hair is a bit stronger. The reason why I won&#x27;t give this product 5 stars is for two reasons: 1) time -- need to see if in the recommended 3-6 months, this product delivers, 2) the principal ingredient of shark powder in the AminoMar Marine Complex. Although shark powder (aka cartilage as labelled by previous Viviscal packaging) seems pretty innocuous, recent studies has found that shark cartilage contains a neurotoxin called BMAA which leads to neurodegenerative disease. I was completely unaware of this bit of science until recently after watching a documentary on the shark trade. I have not found any information clearing this product, which reiterating has shark CARTILAGE (powder is a rosy-tinted word for cartilage... I should know being a biomedical science graduate student), as BMAA-free. Until I obtain evidence certifying without a doubt that the shark powder/cartilage in the AminoMar Complex is BMAA-free, I am staying the hell away from this product. Strong hair or neurodegenerative disease? You decide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR - wanted to grow hair longer, discovered Viviscal, but found, to my chagrin, that it contained shark powder/cartilage which recent research has linked to neurodegenerative disease. For anyone wanting to read more about this: Environmental neurotoxins β-N-methylamino-l-alanine (BMAA) and mercury in shark cartilage dietary supplements by Mash et al.</li>
            <li> My hairline seems to be improving so I&#x27;m ordering a second shipment. Also my hair seems ...stronger. This time I&#x27;ll take 2 a day as directed.</li>
            <li> i have very thin hair and so i deciced to try this , have been on it since june .  Honestly did not see a change in hair growth or strenght.  wasted alot of money</li>
            <li> My hairdresser has been telling me to try this. I tried it for a month, but was unable to find it again so I have not seen any results. The packaging does say to use for six months. I have a new shipment coming next week and hopefully I start to see some results. My hair has thinned out a little with age and styling products so I am hoping to see some fullness back to my hair.</li>
            <li> I am using this product with 10,000 milligrams of biotin every day. My hair is definitely getting longer, I don&#x27;t know about getting much thicker, but it only got 4 stars for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been about a month but I can definitely see a difference. My hair was over-processed and I noticed more hair in my brush and in the shower drain then on my head.  My hair has always been thing but this loss made it even thinner.  I thought I would give this a try for three months - figuring it would take time to see results.  I am happy I did because I have new hair sprouting up.  My eyebrows where I over plucked in my teens have started growing in as well.  I&#x27;m not turning into a wolfman but I can see a difference.  I really recommend this and will continure to use it.  Only downfall is the price (isn&#x27;t that always the case...) otherwise it would have been 5 stars</li>
            <li> I believe I can see a difference as the bare spots on my scalp are no longer so noticeable.. I will&lt;br /&gt;keep using Viviscal.</li>
            <li> I have been using Viviscal for about 26 days pretty religiously twice a day.. (except for like maybe 2 days I forgot the second pill)... And I will say there is less shedding and I see hair growing from the scalp. I notice my hair&#x27;s slightly healthier as well as appears darker.. (Not sure why).. But overall it has helped with the shedding.. I still don&#x27;t see all of the results however. Maybe overall time I&#x27;ll see a more significant difference. I will keep using it for at least 6 months and give it another review.&lt;br /&gt;_____________&lt;br /&gt;Product is okay so far after about 2 months. Still waiting on more though. Also don&#x27;t buy viviscal from amazon. Buy them directly from the website or even target/riteaide. The pills are packaged differently and there is a difference in color of the pills.&lt;br /&gt;See photos below. (Yes I went that far 😂😂)</li>
            <li> Because it  work great&lt;br /&gt;If it work I will like it&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend to my friends and my family</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. My hair was thinning due to a vitamin deficiency, but this really helped it grow back faster and thicker. I don&#x27;t take the recommended 2 tablets a day. I only did the one and it still worked. I have recommended them to a bunch of hair dressers for their clients and my own friends and family.</li>
            <li> My hair started growning in the front of my forhead where it was thining. When I went back to the hair dresser he said my hair looked great. My nails started growing too and are stronger. I would recommed this. I used it a month before I could see a real difference. I hope it works for you too. I have been using this product for three months.</li>
            <li> I started using this about 7 months ago it really works not only does your hair come back , but it makes it more manageable.. Also I&#x27;m a hair stylist and have most of my customers using it too ! so a big thank you</li>
            <li> I have been taking Viviscal for almost a year. After just a couple months of taking them, I noticed my hair was much thicker and had more body. I was skeptical at first, but would highly suggest it to anyone with thinning hair.</li>
            <li> good price and quick delivery</li>
            <li> After the first box of 60 tablets, I noticed nothing. After 80 tablets, my scalp started to tingle slightly, was itching a little and needed massaging a few times a day. I finished the second box (which totaled 120 tablets) with no further results. I noticed no new hair growth however, my excessive hair loss was reduced slightly.  Additionally, the large (thick) size of the round tablets were very difficult for me to swallow because I have a throat obstruction and I wasn&#x27;t willing to suffer any longer. It may work for some, but is it worth the cost? I think not.</li>
            <li> my hair is definitely thicker, and I now have hair where I had none.  Takes a few months, so don&#x27;t expect overnight success.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  The new hairs become visible after 4 weeks.  My hair is thicker and healthier.</li>
            <li> I love these vitamins. They made a difference in my hair, skin, and nails. Definitely a part of my routine. I noticed that the extra strength and regular are the same. So, if you think that you are getting more of any thing in the extra strength, think again.</li>
            <li> Only downside is how expensive it is.  I didn&#x27;t notice any crazy hair growth but I did notice that in the shower virtually no hair fell out</li>
            <li> The biotin in this made me break out like crazy, I had to stop taking it before I could see any hair growth effects</li>
            <li> This product works great.But it does make hair oily on the scalp.And makes alot of hair grow around stomach,Back,and other areas as well.I have used this for 2 months and wow my hair has grown long.It does work! I read in Cosomopolitan that its supermodels secret.I will continue using this.</li>
            <li> I heard about this on Dr Oz and decided to try it....have two weeks left on my first month &amp; have noticed NEW hair growth....It&#x27;s about 1 1/2 inches long with some coming in my natural brown color vs my gray.  Just went on auto delivery with this product.  :o)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Extra-Strength-Nutrient-Tablets-60-Tablets/dp/B002JPJ2ZS/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1_sns?m&#x3D;ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1347835659&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super fast delivery!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this to add to my daily vitamin regime and big health kick I have been going through. I wanted to try everything out there with a good review, so I ordered books and researched every body part and how to maintain it. I went nuts for about a year and my family had an intervention when they busted me putting powdered sea weed on their food. Anyway I wanted my hair to always be lush and thick and healthy until death comes to claim me. Which I hope will come to claim my husband alot sooner than myself. anyway I didnt expect much from this because my nails and hair are already in great shape and my skin considering I dye my hair with bleach and baked in the sun in my 20&#x27;s. After the first package I did notice my nails were growing faster, and my hair was growing faster and getting more thick. Its not a miracle by any means but if you study yourself 8 hours a day and take this for 2 months you will notice a difference by up to 40% so far I should say with myself. Nothing will make your hair grow super fast and thicken up unless you take the right vitamins, eat well, exercise, and try try to leave your hair alone with alot of blow drying and curling irons, and dont wash it every day. If your hair looks cruddy around the house, who cares? Who is there to see? Your husband? Screw him, he is replacable. Also to make your hair grow, DO not get it cut except a tiny tiny snip off the ends, and if you have female balding or patches, you can use Rogaine like my mother does around her hair line to grow the baby hair back around the temples. Also the number one thing that will destroy your hair skin nails and body is STRESS. If you are stressed and have anxiety, your hair will suffer! I have seen it. The more you stress over hair the more hair will fall out. always check thyroid levels and get an anxiety medication and pour vitamins and good food and watch your hair turn around. Its not over night but things can get better. This product is like the icing on the cake after you do a big turn around with your hair care.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking the product for 7 months and while I will admit that my hair did grow longer faster, it did NOT stop my hair from falling at its normal pace. Hair everywhere, brush, pillows, drains, clothes, no difference, just a lot of money wasted, and oh yes, I can&#x27;t forget to mention all the horrible cystic acne I developed that has left horrible scars:-(</li>
            <li> Had been on the product for more than 15 days and stopped due to very bad headaches. Just curious, Does anyone got headaches using this product?</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff about two weeks ago and I have been taking it in combination with Maxi-Hair vitamin supplements by Country Life. I had been just taking the vitamins (which really helped my hair stop falling out) and then ordered these via mail. Well, so far I can say that it has added moisture to my hair and made the brittleness go away. It&#x27;s really soft and straighter now. Before, my hair was always so dry. And yes, I&#x27;ve noticed growth...but I can&#x27;t tell whether it&#x27;s from the vitamins or viviscal. I know one thing though... I will be using this product for a loooong time. Well worth it because it truly has improved the health of my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if Viviscal gives results or not, because I had to stop taking it after two weeks. I developed a rash on my legs and acne. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> okay I have been using viviscal for 1 month and my thin hair has been getting a lot thicker, no longer do I have to use that fake powder hair stuff because it seriously transformed my hair in just one month. I am going to continue this for 5 more months!</li>
            <li> It seems every time I take this product, I feel depressed. When I stop taking it, I feel better. hmmmm. Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s related to the product, but I don&#x27;t want to keep using it to find out!</li>
            <li> Only used for a month but just starting to see an improvement I know manufacturers state you need to use for six months but so far I think they are starting to halt hair breakage.</li>
            <li> My hair was thinning and brittle... it is.growing in so much better with no snapping and breaking ...I would recommend it!!</li>
            <li> This stuff gave me one of the worst headaches I&#x27;ve ever had. I also was super nauseous after taking it. I didn&#x27;t even try again.</li>
            <li> I just wish the cost was. Lower</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I couldn&#x27;t use this product as it caused me to have an upset stomach..even when taken with food.</li>
            <li> These pills made my wife sick, so we never got to check if it really helps as a method of growing hair.</li>
            <li> be patient...but it works..... I&#x27;ve used the tablets for 3 months and still have fine growth coming in....don&#x27;t give up on1 month...it takes time for the tablets to work...once it kicks in...I have noticed a measurable difference in my hair...I have also been diligent about keeping it trimmed every 2 months to encourage new hair growth&lt;br /&gt;BTW...have very little hair loss when washing my hair..drying my hair etc&lt;br /&gt;Overall..definitely...try it...but give it time...I now have a thick head of hair!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps my eyebrows are fuller too which I definitely noticed...</li>
            <li> My hair has gotten stronger, shinier and smooth</li>
            <li> This product combined with Hair Formula 37 is excellent!!! I purchased this product to aid in the damage that was done by weaves and hormonal imbalances. This product delievered beyond my expectations. I have been using the two combined products for @ 3 weeks and the results are noticeable. I also have a very strict and consistant hair routine that also has been astonishing for my hair</li>
            <li> I have only received one shipment (30 days) so I can not see the difference yet. I am waiting on my next shipment. Hopefully, I will see a difference soon.</li>
            <li> This stuff has made my hair grow. I have been taking it for 3 months. I am carribean/afican american and take this product faithfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a change in my hair, but I did see a difference in my eyelashes/eyebrows.  My lashes were thicker and longer.  My brows filled in a bit.  My hair stayed the same and then seemed limp and actually thinner.  I quit taking the Viviscal and it perked back up.  It just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> It has shark powder in it. There are plenty of alternative products with iron and biotin that are effective without shark powder.</li>
            <li> I was desperate after losing lots of hair during/after pregnancy. I am starting to see new growth where it was thin. My hair is also looking fuller, thicker, and shinier.</li>
            <li> I had clumps of hair coming out when I washed my hair and it was alarming.  After about 3 weeks, I notice that it slowed down.  I love  what this product did for me:  stopped hair loss and new hair growth is strong and shiny...Plus I feel less stressed because of the B vitamins (I think!  LOL).</li>
            <li> Tried this product and saw zero results with it after using as the manufacturer recommended. Would not recommend wasting your money on it myself.</li>
            <li> Recibe on time . Work relly good</li>
            <li> So far - so good!  I had read about these and was anxious to try them because my nails were thin and chipping and I have long hair that I work to keep conditioned.  I thought I had noticed a difference within a few weeks when my husband commented on how soft my hair was.  He didn&#x27;t know about the Viviscal.  I&#x27;ve only been taking them for 3 weeks now and I&#x27;ve been told it really takes several months to get the full effect but so far I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to assist my hair with the growing out process. I knew I was taking a gamble based on the reviews, but I decided to purchase anyway. I have taken the product for about a month now and here is what I have noticed so far:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) My hair feels softer &amp; more moisturized compared to before I started to taking the pills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) My eye lashes seem healthier and fuller, but I have not noticed any change in the health of my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) The hair along my temples had filled in a little more (I lost a lot of hair in that area after child birth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) I cannot tell as of yet if it making my hair grow any faster, but it has only been one month so it just might be too soon to tell. I will review again in two months to see if they help in that area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) I have noticed a strange side affect- I cannot find anymore grey/white hairs! I only had a handfull, less than 20, and I cannot find anymore. This may not be an advertised side effect, but it sure is a positive one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to take for another two months and will update my review then!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****UPDATE MAY 30, 2013*****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my overall assessment of the product after three months of use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It definitely helps with re-growth (I have a ton of new baby hairs all over my head)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It improves the overall health of hair (This is a very important factor for me because who cares if your hair is long if it looks dull &amp; stringy? Viviscal made my hair softer, shinier, thicker, and easier to manage overall)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. I saw a slight increase in hair growth rate (My hair is not drastically longer but it is slightly longer, but the product does state that you need to use for six months to see the most benefits)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Eyelashes are fuller and look better with and without mascara, but I did not see any improvement with nails (The product does not claim to help in these areas, but I am mentioning it since other reviewers have benefited in these areas).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been just over three months since I started taking Viviscal. My hair is noticeably longer and thicker, but I am not sure if I can attribute its growth solely to the pills or to other supplements I have been taking as well (I take Garden of Eden&amp;iexcl;¦s Perfect Food Raw &amp; a multi-vitamin everyday). Because of this uncertainty I stopped taking Viviscal for a few weeks now and I have noticed a major change in the manageability and texture of my hair. It isn&#x27;t as soft and shiny, and I know this may sound strange, but the grays are noticeable again. I cannot say with certainty that is making my hair grow any faster, but it is definitely helping with the health of my hair -making it more beautiful and shiny- and for that reason alone I have ordered another batch. I plan on taking two a day for another month, just to build it up in my system again, and then I will taper off to just one a day and will add GNC&#x27;s Hair, Skin, &amp; Nails formula as well. If I see notice any more changes, positive or negative, I will update again. I hope this helps ºiewers have benefited in these areas).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been just over three months since I started taking Viviscal.

            <li> Been using for about a week now can&#x27;t tell a difference yet, but it is very easy to take for those of you like me who dont like pills. Totally worth a try! will be leaving another review after 3 months because that&#x27;s when you&#x27;re actually suppose to notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I used this product for about 6 months after doing a Keratin treatment on my hair.  The treatment left my scalp itchy and my hair started falling out.  While I don&#x27;t feel as if more hair grew in, it did stop my hair from falling after about 3-4 weeks of using it.  I also noticed that my hair grew longer faster.  My hair felt thick but I don&#x27;t think more hair grew in.  I just think that since I didn&#x27;t do anymore treatments, what grew in was my hair in its natural thick state.  I waited 6 months to give it a fair review.  I would have continued to take it as a maintenance plan, but it got tedious to remember to take the pills, so I stopped purchasing the product.  They were also pricey.  I decided to buy some biotin and my hair still grows long fast. I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference since I stopped using the product.  I do want to mention that when I first started using the pills, they did not have any after taste.  After several months usage, they started tasting fishy, soon after, I stopped taking them.</li>
            <li> took these for at least 6 months and saw no change and so I quit taking. Did not seem to do anything.</li>
            <li> i had my reservations, but as my part began to get thinner and thinner i knew i had to do something.  since taking this product i have noticed my hair getting fuller and thicker.  i even got compliments from my mother asking what i had done to my hair.  it&#x27;s worth a try, definitely.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone that either experienced hair damages, shedding, thinning or slow hair growth. I went to a salon this past December for a relaxer and trim...the stylist chopped up armpit length hair to neck length. Of course I tried to get her fired but that&#x27;s another story...so I got a new cut cheek length in a bob style this past January...I&#x27;ve started taking the vitamins religiously twice daily...now it&#x27;s March and my hair is shoulder length and very full &amp; thicker than before. By the way..the shedding creased to about 15-20 strains versus 50-100</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my second time order thru this supplier.  very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I took the vitamins as indicated regularly. I felt nauseous after ingesting them; I have an iron constitution so this was surprising to me. After a few weeks this faded. I didn&#x27;t notices  ANY positive result from the vitamins after 60 days. In fact other than the nausea I did not notice anything at all. I wish very much I could give a good review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I was on the auto-shipment service. The second batch was paid for December 23, 2012 and NEVER RECEIVED TO THIS DAY January 28, 2013. The UPS tracking showed nothing until suddenly yesterday - a month later:  delivered was attempted until December 28, to the wrong address.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been shopping here for 6 years without an address change or difficulty. This auto-ship-mistake is honestly not on my end.  They will not refund me unless they receive the product back from me by January 31st. Which is impossible. So I am doubly disappointed!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Unfortunately this product was a costly mistake for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Unless you know someone personally that had good luck with this exact product I highly suggest trying for hair nutrients elsewhere! I pray you have better luck and find a product that works for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sincerely do not recommend this product as it doesn&#x27;t work.  In addition, I will update this review regarding the auto-ship program Amazon has, and the customer service associated with it. I hope it turns out better than the vitamins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks For Your Attentionr service response from Amazon regarding the  second debit to my account, and their throughness in a speedy resolution. Bottom line - besides wondering HOW THIS COULD HAPPEN TO BEGIN WITH - really that its what matters.&lt;br /&gt;God Bless and Merry Christmas!</li>
            <li> Thank you for the Viviscal - I have been using for 2 1/2 months and already see a difference in my hair.  Thanks again!!</li>
            <li> I turned 40 and my hair changed.  Drastically. I always had fine hair but I had a lot of it.  My hair began thinning I believe due to age and also swimming (even tho I wear a cap).  I found Viviscal and have been taking regularly for 6 months.  My hair is growing so quickly, it is healthier and as a bonus, my eyelashes are thicker and longer, too!  Love this. Definitely worth the price to me and I will keep taking it.</li>
            <li> Used with shampoo/conditioner you will see an immediate difference. My difference was seen in 3 weeks. I have Lupus and tried everything for my balding edges. My edges are growing back in nicely.</li>
            <li> I have had thinning hair for many years. I wish I had found this product sooner. I am wondering if I might not have had even better results if I had started when my hair first started thinning and my hair follicles were not dormant for so long. As it is, I have seen moderate results.  Any growth in my situation is positive. You must commit to trying it several months (6). I signed up for automatic delivery to help with the cost.  I hope this helps someone.</li>
            <li> I have superfine hair that breaks easily to begin with, so when I started to lose more of it due to a thyroid condition I tried Viviscal after reading so many positive reviews.  I took it faithfully twice a day for around 6 months.  After that time, I wasn&#x27;t sure I noticed any new hair growth, so I stopped.  I also began to supplement with Biotin as some reviewers noted it was much cheaper and worked as well.  Well 3 months later off Viviscal and on Biotin alone, it seems like I have lost more hair again - maybe the Viviscal didn&#x27;t grow more hair, but prevented some of the loss? I am not sure, but since I am really worried about my hair, I feel like I have to start taking the Viviscal again.  It&#x27;s kind of a bummer  - hard to pay so much for a product that only gives mediocre results.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any results on my head yet but I&#x27;m hopeful.  My eyebrows do look a little thicker. Will update after 6 months.</li>
            <li> I have been using Viviscal for more than 6 months and it really does work!  My hair is very fine, thin, and damaged from coloring, straightening and simply not taking care of it as well as I needed to. I felt totally hopeless. I tried expensive shampoos and hair treatments at the top NYC salons. None of it helped my hair grow or look healthier. This supplement taken twice daily has been a lifesaver. I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference until I was taking it for about 2 months, but then there was a noticeable difference in length and even better texture. I won&#x27;t say that my hair is any thicker from using this product, but it is definitely longer and healthier. Absolutely worth the investment!</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product.  it really does work.  my hair seems fuller, thicker, and i can actually see new hair growth on my head.  my hairdresser was very excited too.  it does really work.</li>
            <li> I took this product religiously , following the instructions for 6 months.  My hair was exactly as it was before I started.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product as directed for  4mos and I see less hair in my comb and brush so it must be working I will reorder once this supply runs low.</li>
            <li> Was all set to order this and just noticed that SHARK is on the ingredient list. Having seen horrific documentaries on the shark fishing industry there&#x27;s no way I can order this product in good conscience. Would love if they came out with a vegetarian option.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable! Seriously, these are worth every penny! As soon as I started using this, my hair stylist asked what I had done to my hair! It had grown like a weed and was so much thicker! She bought it immediately and uses it month after month now.  I&#x27;ve told so many of my girlfriends about it...they might complain a bit about the price, but I believe in it so much that I told them I&#x27;d give them their money back if they used it for a month and saw no difference.  Not one single person was even liking it..they all love it and how it completely transforms your hair.  You&#x27;ll honestly be shocked at how fast your hair grows! And thickens! Don&#x27;t even hesitate if you&#x27;re worried about the price and whether or not it actually works.  It works!</li>
            <li> These supplements have helped my hair, my hair dresser swears it thicker.  It just takes a good six months  to notice any results</li>
            <li> waste of time and money did not work.  This product did not work for me. Was a dud and a waste of time</li>
            <li> This product did nothing but make my bowels more regular. I saw no hair growth or stregnthing. Maybe it will work for someone else. I purchased 4 boxes and saw no results.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I had received a bad product, or if I just had a really bad reaction to it. I am a 27 year old female diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (known as PCOS). This condition basically throws off your hormones, and for me, it caused hair loss since I was 17. I have been steadily using biotin for the past couple years and did not see much of an improvement. I decided to give viviscal a try after reading its mostly positive reviews on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 3 days into taking it as directed... twice a day with food, I developed a really bad nagging headache that felt very deep. At first, I didn&#x27;t think anything of it because I am a graduate student and prone to headaches. So...I took some advil and called it a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the Advil did not work (I had taken 600 mg of advil...basically 3 pills). The headache persisted... it felt as though I had a really bad hang over. My brain felt foggy, the pain was dull, yet deep and it was very achy...it made my head feel very heavy like it was about to fall off. These symptoms prevented me from studying, and prevented me from doing even my everyday tasks. The next day, I tried dayquil because I thought I was getting sick... this did not help either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not on any type of medication (not even birth control pills), I did not change my diet, and I did not change my other supplements and I was not having my period at the time of taking it and having the headache. The only cause of this headache  that I could think of was from something that I had recently tried...which was viviscal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been suffering with the head ache for a total of one  week (noticing it about 3 days after starting the viviscal regimen). I immediately stopped taking it. I noticed a huge difference the very next day. the foggyness had lifted, and the headache was not as achy. It did take a full 3 days after stopping this supplement for the headache to completely subside.... conclusion... never again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this has happened to u, then you should discontinue it immediately.</li>
            <li> I started this vitamin 1 month ago and I absolutely love this product. My hair seems to be stronger and shiny. I also noticed my nails are stronger and don&#x27;t chip.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> I had a horrible experience at the hair salon, trying to go blonder and blonder from dark brown(around a 2n) and my hair stylist, who has been doing this for a long time, decided to do a \\&quot;bleach and tone\\&quot; on my hair, and broke off a lot of my beautiful hair, and ruined it. I was in hysterics for 2 weeks, who wouldn&#x27;t be?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a family member that has an underactive thyroid and the medicine that person takes, has caused her hair to become thin, and Viviscal has saved her hair, so she bought it for me, and it&#x27;s doing the same for me. It helps with hair growth, the fullness of your hair, and it&#x27;s consistent, if you are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You MUST take 2 tablets a day for 6 months. This is NOT an overnight process, and it&#x27;s unrealistic to think that it would be. But it does work. Take 2 a day, for 6 months. You will see a difference. If you don&#x27;t, take a picture on day 1, and day 30, day 60, day 90, day 120, day 160 and 190 and see that it has made a difference. There are other factors that are important in taking care of your hair, using the right products, not applying heat on a regular basis, and not bleaching your hair will help HUGE amounts with the integrity of your hair. But this product will do what you want it to, you just have to give it time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I know that it is a huge bummer, having to wait 6 months, or so I thought, but I&#x27;d rather wait 6 months, than 6 years for my hair to be beautiful again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is appropriate for any age group between 20-80 years old. Another great combination to add to this regiment is taking a prenatal vitamin once a day, get the prescription strength (that&#x27;s what I did) from your doctor. It will help with your skin, nails and hair, the combination of the 2 Viviscal pills, and the 1 prenatal vitamin, you will see results.</li>
            <li> I have been taking them for a year because my hair started to fall. I have seen improvement, so I continue to take Viviscal since it is the only one who helped to stop me from going bald.</li>
            <li> I have been taking these as part of my &amp;#34;hair growth&amp;#34; regimen for a couple of years now.  I have always had very fine hair, but in quantity.  This quantity has diminished significantly over the past 5 years...I noticed a little bare spot (about 1/4 cm) on my part about 3 years ago, and my hairline has definitely been much sparser in the widows peaks, and my scalp was visible thoughout if I didn&#x27;t brush my hair flat against my head.  I felt VERY self concious and decided to do something about it.  I have always taken &amp;#34;hair skin &amp; nails&amp;#34; supplements, but they just didn&#x27;t seem to make that big of a difference.  After taking these for about 6 months, the little bald spot had filled in.  I added a &amp;#34;hair essentials&amp;#34; from a different website, and an additional 10,000 mcg of Biotin (natrol brand) from Amazon and my hair has never been as thick as it is now.  My hairline is all filled in--my widows peaks which looked as bad as the Evil Queens from Disney are completely filled in.  My hair is growing very fast--1.5 inches per month.  I did take a 6 month break from the viviscal to see if it would make a difference, and my growth and hair health definitely was negatively impacted.  The only negative thing in the regimen is the massive dose of biotin makes me break out, but if I take Zinc on a daily basis it seems to counteract that.  I do color treat and flat iron my hair, so it suffers a lot on a daily basis.  I have tried all sorts of expensive shampoos and conditioners and found them to be a waste...beauty truly comes from within!</li>
            <li> I gave it a try for about two weeks. It upset my stomach, even after taking it after a meal as directed.</li>
            <li> This product works. It&#x27;s pricy but its worth it. I would recommend if your hair is thin or fine. You will thicken up.</li>
            <li> 60 million Americans experience some form of hair loss or thinning hair. I didn&#x27;t know that there were this many Americans suffering from thinning hair or it falling out. When people think of thinning or balding hairlines they think of men, yet it&#x27;s just as true for women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a woman starts experiencing hair loss, she thinks of herself less. Her self esteem hits rock bottom and she can&#x27;t stop thinking about how much hair she has lost, or will continue to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They let their hair loss run their lives. They stop doing certain activities that they may enjoy because it can add to their hair loss or thinning hair. They feel ashamed about it, and therefore keep it to themselves- feeling reluctant to tell other people about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair before I became pregnant was a little on the thicker side. Not too thick- but just the way I like it to be. It wasn&#x27;t thinning, it wasn&#x27;t falling out in large amounts every time I&#x27;d take a shower or wash my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After getting pregnant with my son and him being born 16 weeks premature is when I first noticed that my hair was beginning to thin out. Every time I&#x27;d wash it there would be hundreds of hairs on the bottom of the shower when I was through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I seriously thought there was something wrong with me. I didn&#x27;t know what to do. I actually went to the doctor about it and they told me it was pregnancy hormones making my hair thin out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not until later did I find out that this might be true, but the stress was also a trigger into hair thinning. I&#x27;ve been very thankful that it wasn&#x27;t the \\&quot;patchy\\&quot; hair loss. Nobody seemed to notice a difference except me.  There wasn&#x27;t any bald spots, so I just kept on with my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair always and still does grow quickly, but has been thinning since my first pregnancy. Even going to the doctor welded no results to helping me. I&#x27;ve longed for a thick head of hair since post-pregnancy seven years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t help that I would dye it, blow-dry it, and straighten it- adding to the damage. I hated the washed out look my hair would get WHEN I didn&#x27;t dye it though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have found VIviscal Extra Strength, I can already see a slight difference even though I haven&#x27;t been using it for the entire month. Every time I take a shower, I&#x27;ve noticed less and less hair falling out. It&#x27;s gotten thicker with more body!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You take 2 extra strength pills on a daily basis for a minimum of 3-6 months depending on how bad your hair is thinning/balding and you&#x27;ll see a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It helps that the pills are easy to swallow and don&#x27;t smell or taste funny. Although I&#x27;ve never had an issue taking medicines, I know people who can&#x27;t swallow some larger pills or if they have a weird smell or taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to see what the results bring after I&#x27;m done with the entire box. Healthier hair? YES, Mam!I would dye it, blow-dry it, and straighten it- adding to the damage.

Healthier hair? YES, Mam!</li>
            <li> Used this in combination with Biotin - 10,000 mcg (10 mg) daily, noticeable difference within 3 weeks - stronger hair with bright sheen  &amp; almost no hair loss. Previously had been shedding some hair every day.</li>
            <li> I am on my second box and have not really seen much improvement but still keeping my hopes up i have very fine hair and a few thin spots at the front of my head of which i mainly need to grow so i am keeping my fingers cross they say some ppl. starts to get results on the third box so will keep you posted.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working. Worked great for my sister who has been using it for 6 months plus.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t find that it made any difference in my hair at all. May work for some but not for me. Not worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I think it is working. My hair seems to be falling out less. Now if we could make it less gray.</li>
            <li> it does what it said stop hair fall</li>
            <li> Waste of money, doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> What was I thinking??? It&#x27;s so clearly snake oil! I threw it away because I don&#x27;t trust the ingredients. I guess I just had a moment of hair loss desperation that eclipsed my better judgment. I&#x27;m now taking Biotin from a reputable source.</li>
            <li> I ordered this based on an article I read as well as the reviews in amazon. At this time I have noticed no difference in my hair but I have only been using it for one month. Hopefully in a couple more months I will have good results and can rate the product five stars...fingers crossed. The pills are relatively easy to take but sometimes hard to remember to take the required two a day.</li>
            <li> I have always had fairly fine hair, but for the past several years I feel like my hair sheds like crazyyyyy and just keeps getting thinner and thinner. Everytime I take a shower I feel like I am pulling clumps out of my hair. I have been using this product for about a month and a half and have found a drastic change on how much my hair sheds. I am no longer pulling out chunks everytime I take a shower. Its quite amazing. Only reason it gets 4 stars and not 5 is cuz of the price. I have never used biotin because I heard it gives you acne so I cant compare the two. I have a good feeling in the next few months my hair is going to be fuller than ever. yay</li>
            <li> Began using Viviscal after I did some research about it, and within 2 months began to notice my hair thicker.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Viviscal for 8 months and there is noticeable difference in thickness of my hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell any difference and I am on my 3rd box.....maybe it is???? It was reccommended on Dr Oz so I thought I would try it!</li>
            <li> Good stuff, my hair feels better.</li>
            <li> I have been using this since January and I have not seen any results yet.  I&#x27;m shock because i use this along with vitamine E,A,B12  &amp; biotin for hair growth and have seen nothing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a new high school teacher and the start of this year hasn&#x27;t been easy for me. Two years before this, I quit my stable high paying corporate job to return to school for my credential. I finished and spent a year working tirelessly networking, interviewing and searching until I landed my current job. As a first hear teacher those in the industry know that in between planning lessons, grading, teaching, meetings, ongoing trainings, school events and so on there&#x27;s barely any time for sleep and lots of time for stress. So just within 3 years ive seen my head of hair completely transformed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, my hair has thinned and fallen out to the point that the area where my hair parts,my scalp has really begun to show. I get sunburned on my scalp from standing outside too long. Everytime I shower I feel like I have a handful of hair each time I step out of the shower. More than 3 times than before. My ponytai has thinned and atonepoint it was so brittle that it kept breaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things working for me: I hardly use products and heating appliance on my hair. I haven&#x27;t dyed my hair in 7 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things working against me: stress, lack of sleep, genetic baldness, I swim in the pool  a lot so chlorine, I surf and play beach volleyball so sea water and sun damage,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month with Viviscal I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair has gotten thicker and less is falling out. My part is filling in nicely. I have had no reactions yet to the pills. My hair feels nicer in general. I just started month two so will be back with any updates by the end of thee months. So far ive been really impressed</li>
            <li> Have noticed a difference in falling hair.  Much better than any other products I have tried before.  I would recommend it for sure!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my daughter and she loves it. It has promoted healthy hair and fingernails. So all in all very good.</li>
            <li> We used all 60 tablets with no result and then the company wanted us to automatically buy more to insure fuller hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product but costs too much. Found one that&#x27;s cheaper &amp; works better</li>
            <li> It really Works!  I&#x27;ve had thin hair all if my adult life, at 50 it was just getting worse...I couldn&#x27;t out my hair in a ponytail because the little rat tail that it looked like was embarrassing.  I&#x27;d been taking good care if my hair for awhile, and although it was soft and healthy, it was still thin. Then I started taking this..... 6 months later and I&#x27;m blown away...my hair is growing twice as fast (I know because I dye my gray) and...this is soo amazing for me...I have a nice thick ponytail at the base, near by head, where the new hair has grown in.  As an engineer, I kept all other variable constant and just changed one thing...taking this supplement.  I don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;s working, because everyone will tell you it can&#x27;t , your hair is your hair and that&#x27;s that....well, they are wrong.  I should tell you, this cystic acne thing is real,...but don&#x27;t worry..I had never had this acne, but after taking the supplements twice a day for a month, I got one, Hedious, large, nasty thing.  So I dropped down to one day and that thing went away and I haven&#x27;t had any issues since.  I should mention that my scalp and skin are usually dry to normal.  I&#x27;ve heard that girls with oily skin, have a bigger issue with the acne.  I will be taking this forever....I never want to go back to the hair I had.  If you envy every girl that goes by with long, thick, beautiful hair, then you really should try this,  I don&#x27;t envy them anymore, I just aspire to the extra length.  It&#x27;s a pretty nice thing!</li>
            <li> Wow! Just finishing up my first month on Viviscal and so far I&#x27;m impressed with the results. I&#x27;m in my mid 40&#x27;s and my hair was changing, and not for the best. It was dry, lifeless and i became nervous my hair was thinning after seeing more than usual in the bottom of my shower and in my hairbrush! I started Viviscal in combination with taking 10,000 mcg of Biotin. My hair is shinier, full of life and noticing less fall out. I just ordered my second month&#x27;s worth and hoping i will see even greater results with continued use.</li>
            <li> I think these work great. And it was really evidenced by the fact I stopped for two months and my nails started splitting again! My hair is as long as it has ever been, and my nails are great!</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks my hair does feel soft, but it does not feel any thicker and my hair is still falling out.</li>
            <li> I like this vitamin. I did quickly notice a difference in the thickness of my hair. Its fuller and even seems longer.</li>
            <li> A friend told me about this product and I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work but I was losing a lot of hair everyday and I was getting concerned because this had gone on for more than a year and it was getting noticeable.  Since I&#x27;m a hairdresser I need to look &#x27;the part&#x27; and others had asked about hair loss so I thought I&#x27;d try it.  Within two weeks my hair stopped falling out as much and then within 2 months I could feel new hair coming in.  I&#x27;ve been on the product now for about 10 months and I&#x27;ve experience feeling new hair coming in three time in that time period.  Will not be without it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 42, with long term hair loss possibly from hormonal levels or genetics since its been prevalent since I was a teen. I was never too worried before because my hair was thick even through I used to shed everywhere. But around 2 years ago, my hair was thinned to a scary point. It&#x27;s only been 2.5 weeks on this product and there is a noticeable reduction in hair fall. When I comb my hair dry, only one or two strands fall off (versus a big bunch before) but when I comb it after shampooing, there is still some hair loss albeit less than before. I was on French hair vitamins for a year, which benefitted my nails but didn&#x27;t stop the hair loss. This product looks promising. I&#x27;m combining it with 5000mg of biotin a day, as advised by my MD. I intend to follow through with the 6 months. I will definitely update this posting in another month or two.  Update: it&#x27;s been three months now on this product. The hair fall has improved significantly. I don&#x27;t get what I call kamikaze hair anymore, hair which just falls off randomly during the day and tickles your arms and get stuck on your clothes. I also don&#x27;t see any more hair fall with the bulbs attached. I do get a few strands coming out when I shampoo and a few more when I comb the hair wet.  My hairdresser was sick the other day and her colleague took over. He made a comment about my hair being stronger and asked me what I&#x27;m doing different. I just glossed over it because I didn&#x27;t want to jinks my progress, but the comments have really backed up my opinion that this product works. I will continue using it, probably forever! I know it will take time to replace what took years to lose. I&#x27;m just glad there&#x27;s something on the market that will help me do that. I&#x27;m leaving my rating as 4 stars because I&#x27;m waiting to see if at the 6 month mark the hair fall truly stops. But I&#x27;m backing this product 100%!  8 August 2015. Very sad to report that the kamikaze hair and hair fall is back after a short illness and a 3-week visit from family. It&#x27;s back to almost as bad as the beginning, and frankly I&#x27;m surprised because my hair was really thicken up with the new growth. I&#x27;m praying that the viviscal hasn&#x27;t suddenly lost potency and also worried that simple illnesses can reverse the gain that I&#x27;ve had with the pills so far. My hair is looking ragged and thin again after the last few weeks of serious hair fall. However, I must add that I have reordered another 6 months worth of viviscal because I cannot imagine going off the product and having even worse hair fall that I&#x27;m going through now. No choice but to keep the faith and keep going.  New packs I ordered have pills of different colour! And the silver backing came off in one piece. I hope this batch isn&#x27;t fake! See photos. Can a Viviscal spokesperson please comment.</li>
            <li> I have been taking it for about 2-3 months and can tell that the nails are growing faster and stronger - can&#x27;t tell much about hair growth. Maybe I&#x27;ve been loosing a little less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the seller GLOBALFASHION goes: They display the wrong image for the viviscal on amazon and ship the purple/blue package with less ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are actually TWO Viviscal \\&quot;Extra Strength Hair Nutrient Tablets\\&quot; products out there that differ in packaging as well as in ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The purple/white package is made in Ireland and has a lot more ingredients (niacin, biotin, etc.) than the purple/light blue package does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a fan of misleading product info and while getting the correct item shipped from them was OK, the return process was a pain in the butt, to say the least. I won&#x27;t order from them again.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try these pills due to my hair being over processed, stressful job and life changes. Been taking 2 a day for two months - started pack #3 yesterday.  Quickly - I noticed thicker, less shedding and more manageable hair. Currently - my hair is in the growing stage and looks great. As I was shopping for furniture, the sales lady stated &amp;#34;you got beautiful hair&amp;#34; had not heard those words in a long time. I will continue taking pills for six months before giving 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Great vitamin that makes hair feel great and also helps the nails.  Great price, too!  I recommend</li>
            <li> I found Viviscal on U Tube some how.  I&#x27;m half way through my 3rd box and I&#x27;ve read that you don&#x27;t notice too many changes until about 4-5 boxes into it.  So I am hoping that it helps my thin hair! I do other daily things to strengthen and regrow my hair but lately I have noticed that I dont have barely any hair falling out and it has grown 3-4 inches in the last 2-3 months which is good for me!  Hair is soft and just feels healthier too.</li>
            <li> All is good....product and Amazon deliery .....great.....</li>
            <li> Without my even telling my long-time hairdresser that I had started using Viviscal, she commented on how she could see so much more new growth when I get my hair colored.  Further, I recently got over 300 African hair braid extensions (all the way down to my rear end), followed direclty by sewn-in hair extensions.  I basically destroyed my hair for the entire summer a year ago.  There were broken pieces in huge chunks all along the hairline.  One year later, the hair is growing like weeds, and I attribute the speedy recovery to Viviscal!  Great product!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about ten months.  I have fine, thin hair, but was starting to lose a lot of hair.  I am 34 and think the hair loss is due to stress.  I highlight my hair and I went for three months in between highlights.  My hairdresser was amazed by how much growth occurred in three months.  We measured about 3.5 inches.  So my hair is growing faster, but I also have new growth coming in as well.  I think it is important to take this product everyday and may take a couple of months to first see results.  I have tried different types of vitamins and biotin, but they did not work.  This product is awesome!</li>
            <li> This is not the extra strength dosage!! They need to correct the box claiming is as so. EXRTA STRENGTH CONTAINS 600 MG OF AMINOMAR. Like I used to get before. SO SNEAKY AND GREEDY.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Have been using for years and it has actually help my fine, thinning hair.  Take it twice a day</li>
            <li> I religiously used this product for about 4 months and absolutely saw a difference in the thickness of my hair. Not to mention that my hair definitely stopped falling out as much as it used to. The thing with this product is that you do have to user it for several months before seeing a difference. I saw subtle changes, but the biggest difference I saw was when I STOPPED using the product for a few months. It was then that I noticed the change in texture and again the large amounts of hair I was losing in the shower. I decided to start taking the supplement again after seeing that there was an actual change in may hair and not just in my mind. I think with a product like this, you cannot expect to see true results over-night, or even after several weeks. I am very happy with Viviscal and plan on using it again for a much longer period of time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as recommended by my hair dresser. My hair was originally about 23 inches long, I never had trouble growing my hair out but it was thinin. I have been taking this product daily, I add two pills to my morning protein shake. It does not alter the flavor of my shake which makes it easy to take the vitamin. My hair has gotten significantly longer and thicker. I don&#x27;t mean thicker as in a different texture, I mean thick as in the amount of hair, a thicker ponytail or thicker braid as a result of the increase in health and amount of hair.  It works as advertised. I just subscribed to their product in hopes to continue seeing improvement in hair growth and health.  I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a lot more fuzzies and baby hairs starting to grow. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple months now. Only issue is that it requires continued use to see effects. As normal though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been reading a lot of acne problems. But I must say, this product cleared up my face. Lol. As far as my hair it&#x27;s still brittle. It still falls out A LOT. I&#x27;ve only used it for two months so far. I will finish out the 6 hopefully I see something soon.</li>
            <li> My hair does seem to be thicker. Just slightly but I do like this and think it is helpful.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product! I was so skeptical when my stylist first recommended it, but now I can&#x27;t live without it.  My hair is lustrous, shinier,  and the growth rate is phenomenal.  Don&#x27;t expect waist length hair overnight by any means,  but for myself, I&#x27;m definitely averaging at least a half inch a month. The only downside is going for gel manicures or acrylic nails these days. The time between fill-ins has dramatically decreased! Can get a bit costly!</li>
            <li> Love this. My hair seems to have thickened since I started this vitamin. Will continue to use this forever.</li>
            <li> I have been using Viviscal for a few years and am very happy with the hair results which are continued plentiful and healthy hair.</li>
            <li> I love the product. It was delivered quickly and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have been taking Viviscal for a few weeks, and while I have not noticed any change in my hair (because it&#x27;s still too early to see results), I have noticed my nails are stronger and growing faster. I will certainly check back and provide a follow up review after about 2-3 months when results should be evident.</li>
            <li> I have been using Viviscal tablets for almost a year now and I have been very pleased with the results.  I have thinning hair and a receding hairline which runs in the family.  I had been using Nioxin Follicle Booster but then developed an allergic reaction to the topical product so had to give it up.  Read about this product and thought &amp;#34;What could I lose?&amp;#34;.  I liked it so much that my husband is now using it, too.  It took about 3 mos. before I had really noticeable results.  My hair will never be thick and luxurious but this definitely helps until I submit to Rogaine someday.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased this this product. I was told to try it and it works.</li>
            <li> this product works!!!</li>
            <li> I started using Viviscal, because of really good reviews in Internet. I am taking it four months already and don&#x27;t see any improvement. My hair is naturally blonde and curly, it&#x27;s healthy but pretty thin and it remains the same length over past years.  I wanted to grow it longer. Unfortunately, it seems like this product doesn&#x27;t work for me. I don&#x27;t know if I should continue buying it. I probably just start buying biotin instead because it&#x27;s much cheaper.</li>
            <li> It is expensive and not sure it really works.</li>
            <li> I have onlly taken for almost a month,will go the 6 months on these.&lt;br /&gt;Hair does seem to begin to thicken up and I do see new growth.&lt;br /&gt;My sister has been taking hers for 3 months and since her cancer&lt;br /&gt;her hair has gotten thicker and growing fast. I am so happy for her.&lt;br /&gt;so I rated I LOVE IT. and know mine will do the same.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.&lt;br /&gt;Trying the product to see if it works.</li>
            <li> You are eating Shark Cartilage power for your hair! You are aiding in the extinction of sharks! The FDA doesn&#x27;t agree that that helps grow hair.  Look it up! Use the internet and do some research before wasting $40 for this product.</li>
            <li> Delivery was on next day. It was amazing! As for hair, they still fall but grow faster.</li>
            <li> Bought to help with hair thinning/hair loss due to autoimmune disease and menopause.  Noticed a big difference after about three weeks.  I did take these in conjunction with extra Biotin.  I stopped these to see what would happen and the hair loss started up almost immediately.  Highly recommend these to other women in similar situations-definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> Not sure if this works for skin contitions also. But I was diagnosed with Ezema on hands and after taking  this product for 2 months  it was GONE!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this item for a little over a month and am only now beginning to see some affect. My hair does seem to be becoming fuller, thicker and stronger, so for these reasons alone, I think I will continue giving it a go just to see what happens in a couple more months. I rated it three stars because I&#x27;ll need more time with it, I&#x27;ll re-address it at the end of the completed treatments.&lt;br /&gt;However, I strongly advice you be careful where you purchase from. I used a marketer through Amazon and they sent me a box containing one tray of nine pills. I contacted Amazon, they investigated the matter of the used box of pills and handled it very well.  Thank you Amazon, you&#x27;ve got a customer here for life!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Many thanks.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  My hair came back better than ever!</li>
            <li> quick and as described</li>
            <li> Excellent!!!! Fast delivery, will order again! This product works!</li>
            <li> Honestly don&#x27;t think will do much to regrow hair.  Big problem these days after infection.  Scalp health matters a lot more unless you&#x27;re starving yourself of nutrients.  Shd have known better but it was a weak moment.  Only thru one blister-pack but have grave doubts.  Won&#x27;t hurt to try ...</li>
            <li> The product was recommended by my dermatologist, so I gave it a try. After about 7 months, I honestly don&#x27;t know if this supplement has made any difference. In March, I bought the supplement directly from Viviscal.  For price/budget reasons, subsequent purchases were made on Amazon.  I agree - the pills appeared different in shape/size.  I can&#x27;t know if there is counterfeit involved (or if this has anything to do with the supplement not working for me), but there was a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May keep using for another few months to see if anything changes, but this is an expensive supplement, so I might call it quits.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Amazing. I absolutely love this product. I have tried hairfinity and manetabolism and this is the only thing that has stopped my hair from shedding. My hair also seems to be getting much thicker. I just finished my first month and I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I decided to write a review since i bought this product based on its reviews. My hair has been falling out for a few months because of a hormonal imbalance and I can really tell especially when i shower - I loose SO MUCH HAIR and when light hits my hairline, i can see my scalp. :( Every womam knows how devesating it is to loose their hair! So, i started taking Viviscal about a month ago and HAVE noticed new little hairs growing across my hairline and even on side of my hairline on my neck. BUT I also noticed the once peach-fuzz on my face has grown! Rather alot! I have pretty sparce eyebrows and would say they&#x27;ve grown in a little and now there&#x27;s also some crazy stray hairs around them. So, i don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m going to continue to buy this product b/c i really don&#x27;t want to grow a beard. I think I&#x27;m going to just amp up on biotin and fatty fish oils that i read on another review.</li>
            <li> Been taking this product for about a year now, and I can see a big difference in the amount of hair I am losing when I wash it. Others have told me that I look like my hair is now thicker. Will use this product forever. Started out with 2 a day, now only one a day. These pills have worked for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after reading MANY reviews, as I have tried countless \\&quot;hair and skin\\&quot; vitamins with limited results that never seem to last. After hearing about Viviscal on tv, I immediately bought them at a local drug store, paying full retail. I was determined to give the product 6 months, as I read somewhere ( most likely on their own website, although I can&#x27;t find what I read any more) that it took that long to start seeing results. During the first month, I then purchased 3 more months on the products website, as they were running a promotion for buy 2 months, get one free. While running through those, I then found Viviscal on Amazon, and it seems to be the best deal that I have found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, here is my my hair&#x27;s problem....I have very coarse, kinky hair that has gotten much worse with age. I have also lost handfuls on a daily basis since I was a teenager. I have straightened, permed, colored, and flatironed my hair to death. As I am almost 50, I have been worried that since I am still losing hair on a daily basis, that it won&#x27;t grow back as well as in my youth, and have been trying various types of hair and skin vitamins from every company you can imagine. This product is by far the most expensive, but after reading the reviews it seemed I had to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still losing hair, but it seems to be growing faster, and seems thicker than before. This product hasn&#x27;t changed the texture, but since it is growing  I am happy with the results and will continue to use it until I notice a change for the worse. I never had any type of bald spots or anything like that, so I can only say that it seems to work well for me. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> It is now the fourth month I am using this product, and have not noticed any improvement in my hair growth, thickness, etc. Will continue using as product info. advises six months of use.</li>
            <li> I actually don&#x27;t have a rating as of now. I&#x27;ve been taking it for 1 month. I will have to see how it works after 90 days.</li>
            <li> I have been taking this product for 6 months and I can tell if it works.  See hardly any difference and not sure if I should keep talking it.  Any suggestions?</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I&#x27;ve gone through radiation treatments and my hair was broken and very weak.  After taking this product, my hair is so much more healthier and it is no longer shedding and growing again! No side effects!</li>
            <li> I began using this product in August and the directions indicate six months before results. In February 2013 I will be able to give a better review. Presently, I have nothing negative to say. The pills are easily digestible and the two pills per day is reasonable. I follow the package instructions and so far so good. I&#x27;ll be able to write a better review prior to February but it&#x27;s too soon right now.</li>
            <li> I received the product in a timely manner, I understand&lt;br /&gt;I need to give this product six months to work, I have&lt;br /&gt;only been trying it for four months.</li>
            <li> I have been using product for over 2 months.  Absolutely no improvement. Wasted money with no results. Your ads are very misleading.</li>
            <li> This product did absolutely nothing to improve the quality or quantity of my hair. I was very disappointed as promises were very different from results.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say because the package says you have to take it for at least 6 months before you can expect to see any results.</li>
            <li> I have been taking Viviscal for two months, twice a day.  My hair feels conditioned and looks shinier.  I bought this product to help my thinning hair grow in better, this should take at least two more months before I see that happen.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and I have recommended it to my brother in-law who noticed thinning on his head.  My hair has grown like 3 inches in the last 3 months and my hair feels a lot stronger and fuller. I do have to say that I also grown hair in very unwanted places.</li>
            <li> I am twenty two and losing my hair (to the point where scalp could be seen all the time) was not ideal twenty first birthday gift but it is what happened when poor diet meet my high stress lifestyle. With this my hair has become fuller and healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: It&#x27;s been over four months and my hair continues to fill out and grow longer over an inch since November and everyone in my personal life has told me they&#x27;ve noticed a difference and asked what I&#x27;ve done differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 2: it&#x27;s now May 2014 and this product has seriously improved the quality of my hair but only because I stopped ordering through amazon where I would get counterfeit products frequently. It does cost more to go directly from the source but to me having a full head of hair is worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/5 for the product&lt;br /&gt;2/5 for amazon screening for counterfeiters</li>
            <li> This product for sure made my hair grow faster and gave my hair shine. However, it did not do anything for the massive amounts of shedding I&#x27;ve experienced for over a year (due to a medical condition) nor did it help with regrowth (that i can tell). Again, it made my hair grow fast, probably about an inch a month. I would give it a try for 3 months and see what kind of results you get...it can be expensive so try to look for coupons or deals that they might offer</li>
            <li> When I had used Viviscal for one month (without telling my hairdresser), she commented, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s taking longer to do your hair!&amp;#34;  Then I revealed that I am using Viviscal.  I see a difference in both the amount of hair and lack of broken ends.  When I have had surgery or chemotherapy, I take two Viviscal tablets daily.  Once I am well, I reduce my intake to one daily.  The product works!</li>
            <li> I heard of this product on Dr. Oz and tried it because my hair was coming out by the hand full.  This product not only stopped that problem but also thicken my hair where it was thinning.  I would reccomend this product for any one of these problems with your hair.</li>
            <li> I  have been getting these hair nutrient tablets for my mom  but not because she has thin hair because she has really pretty hair and lots of it and it&#x27;s really long too and she wanted something that would make it grow faster and she ran across an article in a book about viviscal and it sounded good and she wanted to try it and see if it would make her hair grow faster and so I found it here on amazon and started buying it for her and she is very happy with it because it has made her hair grow faster even I noticed that it has grown alot since she started using it you don&#x27;t notice it right away but i&#x27;ve been getting it for her for about 5 or 6 months now and i think we started noticing about 1 month after she started using it it works really well these are really good and they really do make your hair grow faster because her hair has really gotten longer since she has been using them she really likes them and she would definitely recomend them to other people i like this seller they were very prompt in sending out my order and i recieved it very soon after i ordered it and i would definitely recomend them to other people and I would definitely buy from them again</li>
            <li> I am fifty three and after menopause I was suffering from severe heir loss. It was a horrible experience and I honestly thought I would be bald in no time at all. I was suffering from a major embracement. My friends and even my husband used to tease me about this. I was trying everything and anything to prevent this damage. But honestly nothing was able to bring me back my old hair.&lt;br /&gt;Finally I got lucky and found this extremely useful hair nutrient solution. A friend, who is in beauty culture field, has told me about this amazing product.  The result is simply brilliant and almost unbelievable. After just one week of usage I could easily feel the different. My hair loss rate dropped down dramatically and my hair was getting thicker, stronger and longer. Within no time at all it became almost as good as when I was a teenager.&lt;br /&gt;Even my husband couldn’t believe this change. So when I finally broke up the news about this superb product he too wanted to use it on him. Now we both are using this product and totally happy about it.</li>
            <li> I did think that my hair was shedding less while taking this...took it for a month. BUT my skin started breaking out and I generally have blemish free skin.  I then realized it is because these pills have Biotin in them and Biotin supplements always make my skin breakout, so if you have the same issue you may want to reconsider.</li>
            <li> Just started using it and I see results! The taste is weird but it&#x27;s worth seeing the growth of my hair! It&#x27;s a must buy!</li>
            <li> hair grow real slow, and once you stop hair fall out. It cost a lot of money.</li>
            <li> Have noticed a difference. Extremely expensive though.</li>
            <li> The ingredients were different on this package than the previous? Why if coming from the same company. Why would they change?</li>
            <li> I haven’t used the tablets long enough to see a difference, but I will continue to use the product for the instructed time and see if I notice any difference.  I am progress in the making!</li>
            <li> Still evaluating the product. We will know better in a couple of months as it takes 4 to 6 months to see results.</li>
            <li> These are a little pricey, and don&#x27;t expect miracles, but I do think they help to make hair stronger and a little healthier.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try viviscal . I heard great things about it . Just a few days using it he way it says on label I noticed some breakout on my cheeks ,  nose and chin. My skin went from dry cause of winter to oily snd breakout. I also take biotin&lt;br /&gt;And black current oil and prior to viviscal my skin looked great.  I took it for a week and then decided the breakout and oil wasn&#x27;t worth it. Then I read other reviews and this has happened to others. They claim it&#x27;s bromine acne which are toxins in your body. Anyways, I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll try maybe one pull a day or just take mutil vitamins I need separately .</li>
            <li> If you want to grow your hair thicker and longer this is a great product for you. Just be patient for the result. Will continue to purchase this item.</li>
            <li> Now first keep in mind everyone is different and what works for some may not work for others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the past two years, I have had an unfortunate encounter with female pattern baldness. My hair started unexplainingly falling out like crazy in the shower. People were constantly commenting on my hair being all over the place everywhere I went. I went to three doctors to find the cause as hair loss does not run in my family at all. I had the same answer from all of them.....stress. Do I believe it was caused from stress? No. One doctor suggested if maybe I am not in fact under stress it could possibly just be that when you get older naturally you lose more hair. I am only 30 and he told me this when I was 29.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to tackle this on my own. I tried a gluten free diet as I have heard from others it helps. It didn&#x27;t help me. I tried rogaine as my scalp was starting to show. However, rogaine was causing me to have heart palpitations and the pounding heart stopped the night I stopped rogaine. So I went on Amazon to check reviews of things that may have worked for others in my situation. I found Viviscal and bought it. I am not even kidding you when I honestly tell you this THE NIGHT I started taking Viviscal my hair loss in the shower was the lowest I have had in the past 2 years. Ever since the shedding has stopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been taking this supplement for the past 30 days and just purchased more for the next cycle. And in the past 30 days my hair shedding has decreased by 90%, easily. I don&#x27;t have any new growth yet and I really don&#x27;t know if my hair is growing faster but I do know that my eyelashes have grown a lot, my lip now needs waxing when I get my eyebrows waxed, and my nails are growing like they never have. I fell so relieved and I could kiss the creators of Viviscal! I am so THANKFUL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SIde effects:&lt;br /&gt;I did break out with one or two pimples the first week but it hasn&#x27;t happened again&lt;br /&gt;EAT when you take this,or you will get an upset stomach with cramping as well&lt;br /&gt;I feel energized more than usual as well&lt;br /&gt;Eyelash growth&lt;br /&gt;fine hair on upper lip has grown (waxing takes it right off with no problem)&lt;br /&gt;nail growth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may not work for you, however, it just might give you your hair back as it has improved mine. I think it is worth the $40 risk. Good luck!</li>
            <li> I have been taking \\&quot;Extra Strength Viviscal Tablets\\&quot; for several months, I am on my Third Box but I only take one Tablet per day instead of the Two Tablets Suggested Directions. In combination with Viviscal I also take Biotin 10.000 mcg 1 Tablet everyday. Biotin Vitamin H, promotes Healthy Hair and Strong Nails and it has been Proven to Help with Healthy Hair Growth. if that&#x27;s not enough, for a while I was applying \\&quot;Rogaine Foam\\&quot; to my Scalp, ... I need all the Help I can get for my Thin Hair, so I am not sure whether is Viviscal or Biotin what is working for me,... or was the \\&quot;Rogaine Foam\\&quot; what made my Hair a little Fuller, Thicker and Shinier&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never know which one worked for me or maybe was the combination of all three. I did stopped the \\&quot;Rogaine Foam\\&quot; and when Viviscal runs out I will Not Re-order it again, too Pricey and I want to see by just taking only Biotin everyday, if my Hair will stay looking as Nice as it does Now. Also my Hair doesn&#x27;t fall out as much as it did before after taking all these Products. I like to Mention that I did prefer the Older Viviscal Round Tablets, they were smaller and thinner and not as Thick and Big as the New Ones from my Third Box&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that some of the Ingredients in Viviscal Hair Growth Program are the same as in Biotin, maybe with different names and even Viviscal has Biotin in it, Viviscal Ingredients: AminoMar Marine Complex (Shark Powder, Mollusc Powder), Vitamin C, Niacin, Biotin, Iron, Horsetail Extract, Millet Seed Extract, Zinc, Microcrystalline Cellulose (same is in biotin), Maltodextrin, Hydroxypropyl Methyl Cellulose, Silicon Dioxide (same as in biotin), Magnesium Stearate,(same as in biotin)  Sodium Carboxymethyl Cellulose, Glycerol, Artificial Orange Flavoring, Modified Starch, Contains Fish Ingredient (Shark)... I am not a Chemist, however, and after reading and finding out about the Ingredients, I think I am going to give Biotin a Chance by itself and see what happens!...so there, I waited all this time to write my Experience with this Product and that is the reason why the 4 Star Rating...Thank You D.D.</li>
            <li> I was happy with the regular brand so I thought the extra strength would be better.  For me it was too strong and upset my stomach</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a year. My hair grows faster and is thicker!.Try it...you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I have fine thin hair from when I was young so when I saw the regular Vivascal ad 5 years ago in August 2011, I ordered it and faithfully bought more when my stock got low.  In September 2013 I switched to the Extra Strength hoping that I would really see more hair growing since the regular formula didn&#x27;t seem to do the job.  What it did was to make my hair grow fast but it did not make my hair &amp;#34;fuller and thicker&amp;#34; as advertised.  I am still using it but will stop after I use up my supply.  My hair is still thin and is growing thinner.  I feel that I have wasted all the money for a &amp;#34;hopeless dream.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I chose not to review this product until I&#x27;d been using it for a while.  I researched the reviews and have noticed that people who have the best success with Viviscal once had thicker fuller hair, and went thin/fine due to an event like child birth, disease, hormone-related, etc.  I have never had particularly thick hair.  I had medium texture hair growing up and it&#x27;s gotten thinner as I&#x27;ve aged.  At 43, I went too short about 6 months ago and decided to grow it long for the first time since high school and knew I needed help, so I decided to try Viviscal.  I&#x27;m on the end of the 4th month and noticed absolutely nothing until very recently, my hair seems stronger; that is, I&#x27;m not shedding nearly as much.  That is enough to keep me going for another couple months, since I want to give it the full 6 months to work like the box says!</li>
            <li> I took it religiously for 5 months and it was worthless - I had the same amount of hair loss and no new growth.  I spent a lot of money on something I couldn&#x27;t afford with no good results.</li>
            <li> Just finished my first box and I love this product! I was referred by a friend to try it out and I am surprisingly happy! After years of dying my hair, my hair is a mess and I had to go back to dark and cut a lot off. but about a month later I can already see a huge difference. Most definitely recommend :)</li>
            <li> This is going to be my first review and I will review this product again in three months. I was experiencing  lots of shedding. I bought this product based on the amazon and youtube reviews. I have been taking the product for about two weeks now and I have noticed that the shedding has decreased some what. I did experience some mild itching for the first few days and now it is gone. I take it as directed one tab in the morning and one in the evening. The only drawback is the price since it is kind of pricey. I have a three month supply and I will see what happens. I do see new hair sprouting up.</li>
            <li> just keep at it :) i gave up after 4 months, but then two separate hairdressers commented on how much baby hair was all over my scalp without knowing i was taking any supplements (i was getting extensions and it made their job twice as hard to put them in). so im back on it! :) hair growth has been almost 2x faster than normal. you&#x27;ll notice baby hairs at your hairline first, like cowlicks, they have a mind of their own! now they&#x27;ve grown out and my hair feels so much healthier :) highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American women in my twenties who suffered from shedding due to perms and birth control, but more than likely I think it was the manzi perm. I honestly thought that this product would not work on my hair. Butttt I was wrong, I took it for three months straight and my hair grew slowly at first. It started growing slowly in length first and I got slightly discouraged about the thickness that the product advertised because of my hair not getting any thicker. I had to discontinue the product due to the price not fitting into my budget, I discounted it for about a month after taking for those three months and now I&#x27;ve continued it. I&#x27;ve been taking it now for one month with Biotin 300 mcg and now in addition to growth in length I now see a change in thickness and so does my hair dresser. A few other things I do to my hair as far as maitenance is using these products.... Brace yourself (coconut oil, organix biotin conditioner, tee tree oil and Shea moisturisure hair maque) I use all of those products mixed together in addition to using an egg( for protein) and apple cider vinegar(for shine) for a deep conditioner I usually leave it in for about an hour or two. Coconut oil and tee tree oil can be applied daily. My hair is natural but I choose to wear it straighten. But it receives no heat damage when using these products.</li>
            <li> a few days after taking extra strength viviscal my stomach started cramping. i continued to take it for two weeks, twice a day after meals but the cramping became unbearable so i decided it was not worth all that pain and discomfort. a few days after i stopped taking extra strength viviscal my stomach was fine. one star is way too high for this product.</li>
            <li> Biggest mistake to change the formula.  Please bring back the old version.</li>
            <li> I bought these after my daughter was born and i had a lot of hair loss. These really work, im so happy i bought them. All the hair loss around my bangs has been growing back so fast my hairdresser has asked my secret. My hair grows longer faster. Give these at least 6 months for really great results but i started seeing a difference at 3 months.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product and it does help thicken your hair. I love it!</li>
            <li> used this product for 90 days and saw no difference in my hair.  very disappointed as the product is not cheap.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT DOES EXACTLY WHAT IT STATES!!! MY HAIR HAS ALWAYS BEEN HEALTHY AND NOW THAT I&#x27;VE BEEN TAKING IT OVER 3 MONTHS; MY HAIR IS GROWING SUPER FAST!!! I RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE SEEKING A HEALTHIER HEAD OF HAIR!!!!</li>
            <li> I do realize that it&#x27;s not an over night thing. I&#x27;m not going to wake up with&lt;br /&gt;a head full of hair beyond belief !  lol !  But I can say that when I wash my&lt;br /&gt;hair there is hardly any hair in the drain. I was my hair in the tub and the&lt;br /&gt;drain has extremely small holes and their is hardly any hair after I wash it.&lt;br /&gt;And I don&#x27;t wash it everyday. I think I see a difference in the front but it&lt;br /&gt;does take time for the hair to grow to really get the results. The stopping&lt;br /&gt;of hair loss has proven results to me so far !</li>
