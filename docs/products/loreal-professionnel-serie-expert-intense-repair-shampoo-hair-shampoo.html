            <li>Love the way it makes my hair feel, behave and look.</li>
            <li>I tried it for the first time in Germany a couple of months ago, and loved it.</li>
            <li>Good shampoo, though I feel the Absolute Repair version is even better for my texture hair.</li>
            <li>The pump is good for &amp;#34;portion control&amp;#34; and keeps me from using too much.</li>
            <li>My mom has natural hair and my sister also do chemical process on her curly hair and they loved this shampoo.</li>
            <li>It seems that is it not the original L&#x27;Oreal product, or it is out of date.</li>
            <li>I will not trust this company as having original L&#x27;Oreal products.</li>
            <li>, specially the cost too.</li>
            <li>I plan on returning it and just paying more at my salon for the real deal.</li>
            <li>At the urging of my stylist, I started using this shampoo with the Intense Repair conditioner, and I am blown away by how much softer and more manageable my hair has become!  </li>
            <li>I love this product, my hair was damage and dry do to all my highlights and coloring, with all of these prodcut lines, my hair is more silky and shine,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You seem never to be able to rinse it off completely</li>
            <li>It worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I also think my hair is healthier and the color looks better - both when I have it in a natural state and with chemical color.</li>
            <li>I have slightly wavy hair and regularly color, so my hair tends to be on the drier side, so this product is absolutely perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>The leave in didn&#x27;t leave my hair soft, silk or easy to comb.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and smooth after using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I use it really works!</li>
            <li>my hair smooth and soft and its banana scented yum</li>
            <li>First of all, the product didn&#x27;t come with an expiration date stamped on the bottle.</li>
            <li>I had an extra one thank goodness, but its a pretty important element!</li>
            <li>I have used this product for more than ten years and it continues to impress me!</li>
            <li>I bought the complete Loreal Series Expert Intense Repair line, and the shampoo I have received here in my house is not the original one.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than the salon</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Really like it.</li>
            <li>I had to go and purchase the original product at a local store.</li>
            <li>, I just thought that shampoo was only to clean and wash the hair and that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>Normally all products have this information available to the costumeR. Second, it should state</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I say that because it is a high quality shampoo, normally used in hair saloon</li>
            <li>I have been using L&#x27;oreal Professional Intense Repair shampoo for years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the extra cost!</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo, been using for a year now, my hair stays fluffy, and I don&#x27;t have to wash it</li>
            <li>Makes dull hair super shiny and clean.  </li>
            <li>This is the first shampoo that has allowed me to not have to wash my hair every night without it looking greasy the next day.</li>
            <li>I have used L&#x27;oreal Serie Expert Intense Repair Shampoo for at least 10 years for my below shoulder length, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the L&#x27;Oreal Serie Expert Intense Repair Shampoo from my regular salon - just over 8 ounces for $23.00.  </li>
            <li>MAKES YOUR HAIR FEEL SO SOFT AND SHINY.</li>
            <li>I have bleached high lighted hair and it is very damaged and dry because of the chemical process.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve spent on regular shampoo&#x27;s from regular stores for a year, this is a better value by far &amp; you only have to order it about once every 9 months to a year.</li>
            <li>But as my hair was really dry and breaking, I decided to search a little more about all kinds of products for the hair.    </li>
            <li>This was the exact product I expected.</li>
            <li>Everything shipped as expected Product was exactly as ordered.</li>
            <li>I have been using L&#x27;Oreal Shampoo and other products for ages, and I purchase this product for the first time on amazon.</li>

            <li> I have use it to wash my hair for few weeks now, it doesn&#x27;t smell like the original product, it doesn&#x27;t repair my hair as they always do, and leaves my hair dull and freeze.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s creamy and the 1500ml bottle lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> It has a slight banana smell, it&#x27;s white and creamy, whereas my bottle from the salon smelled the same as the conditioner mask</li>
            <li> They do not work the same and the other one is heavier.</li>
            <li> Lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> I am using it in conjunction with L&#x27;Oréal Professionnel Série Expert Absolut Repair Cellular Regenerating Mask With Lactic Acid For Dry And Damaged Hair.</li>
            <li> I found something that works for dry and damaged hair.</li>
            <li> and it was yellow and slightly shimmery.</li>
            <li> My hair has become very dry since I turned 50ish and this shampoo (and the matching conditioner)</li>
            <li> This bottle leaves my hair feeling stringy, hard to comb through, almost as if there&#x27;s residue left on it.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> It protects the ends and does not weigh down the hair.  </li>
            <li> This vendor is half the price</li>
            <li> There is sthg that is too creamy about it that makes hair feel too heavy.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid of the price, it is 5o.7 ounces &amp; it is minimal compared to the advantages it gives your hair &amp; when you add up all the $$&#x27;s</li>
            <li> It smells bad, it definitely has a fake consistence...</li>
            <li> It was expensive to purchase from the salon</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Maybe the formula has changed, but this is not the same shampoo as what I&#x27;ve purchased before at the salon. It has a slight banana smell, it&#x27;s white and creamy, whereas my bottle from the salon smelled the same as the conditioner mask and it was yellow and slightly shimmery. This bottle leaves my hair feeling stringy, hard to comb through, almost as if there&#x27;s residue left on it. I am using it in conjunction with L&#x27;Oréal Professionnel Série Expert Absolut Repair Cellular Regenerating Mask With Lactic Acid For Dry And Damaged Hair. The bottle did not come with a pump. I plan on returning it and just paying more at my salon for the real deal.</li>
            <li> There is sthg that is too creamy about it that makes hair feel too heavy. You seem never to be able to rinse it off completely</li>
            <li> This was the exact product I expected. I tried it for the first time in Germany a couple of months ago, and loved it. Considering the amount in this bottle and the prize I paid, this was an excellent deal!! I will purchase this again in the future.</li>
            <li> I love to use this shampoo. It&#x27;s very good for my hair and I definitely recommend. It worth every penny. Thanks</li>
            <li> I have been using L&#x27;oreal Professional Intense Repair shampoo for years. It has done the job of what it says \\&quot; repair\\&quot;. If you dye your hair or have  damaged hair, ( like me ) this is the product for you. Don&#x27;t be afraid of the price, it is 5o.7 ounces &amp; it is minimal compared to the advantages it gives your hair &amp; when you add up all the $$&#x27;s you&#x27;ve spent on regular shampoo&#x27;s from regular stores for a year, this is a better value by far &amp; you only have to order it about once every 9 months to a year.</li>
            <li> I purchased the L&#x27;Oreal Serie Expert Intense Repair Shampoo from my regular salon - just over 8 ounces for $23.00.  i got over 50 ounces for just over $35 with shipping.  Much cheaper than the salon and I got it sent in a couple of days.  I would recommend this seller to anyone who purchases their products from their salon.</li>
            <li> I bought the complete Loreal Series Expert Intense Repair line, and the shampoo I have received here in my house is not the original one. It smells bad, it definitely has a fake consistence... I will never buy that again.</li>

            <li> Great product. Fast delivery. Will definitely buy again. It lasts forever though :) So happy I found something that works for dry and damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for years and years. This is the largest bottle the manufacturer sells, so I bought the smaller 16.9oz pump bottle and keep this one to refill the smaller one.</li>
            <li> My hair has become very dry since I turned 50ish and this shampoo (and the matching conditioner) do the trick leaving no extra weight.  Really like it.</li>
            <li> seriously great! My hair is so soft and smooth after using this shampoo. smells great too</li>
            <li> This is the first shampoo that has allowed me to not have to wash my hair every night without it looking greasy the next day. I also think my hair is healthier and the color looks better - both when I have it in a natural state and with chemical color. The large bottle is great so I don&#x27;t have to buy as regularly. I have a smaller bottle at home with a pump that I just refill with this. The pump is good for &amp;#34;portion control&amp;#34; and keeps me from using too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for years. It&#x27;s great! Some shampoos work well for my hair for a while and then don&#x27;t seem to leave my hair the way I want it. This shampoo never has to be changed. I have thick, coarse hair. It&#x27;s well worth the extra cost!</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for about three years after my hair got damaged and now I it&#x27;s the inky shampoo I use it really works!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve never believed that a shampoo could help \\&quot;treating\\&quot; the hair, I just thought that shampoo was only to clean and wash the hair and that&#x27;s it. But as my hair was really dry and breaking, I decided to search a little more about all kinds of products for the hair.    I have bleached high lighted hair and it is very damaged and dry because of the chemical process. Since I started to use this shampoo, my hair stopped breaking (of course, I use a good conditioner too). I also used the leave in of the same brand, but I didn&#x27;t like it. The leave in didn&#x27;t leave my hair soft, silk or easy to comb. But this shampoo is the best. It&#x27;s creamy and the 1500ml bottle lasts for a long time. My mom has natural hair and my sister also do chemical process on her curly hair and they loved this shampoo. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Everything shipped as expected Product was exactly as ordered. I use this product daily I started using it when my hair stylist recommended it. It was expensive to purchase from the salon This vendor is half the price</li>
            <li> Good value for the money</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo, been using for a year now, my hair stays fluffy, and I don&#x27;t have to wash it&lt;br /&gt;everyday. It also does not wash out my color, which is also a L&#x27;Oreal product.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot find a hairdresser in my area who carries it. So glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Makes dull hair super shiny and clean.  I swear you will see noticible results after one use love it, love it, love it.  I always get compliments when I&#x27;ve used it.  My hair behaves better when I use the system.</li>
            <li> It´s wonderful to my hair...</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. Best. I&#x27;ve used it for years won&#x27;t use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;Makes my hair smooth and soft and its banana scented yum</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GREAT SHAMPOO TO USE 1 A WEEK OR SO. MAKES YOUR HAIR FEEL SO SOFT AND SHINY. SMELLS GOOD ALSO!</li>
            <li> I love this product, my hair was damage and dry do to all my highlights and coloring, with all of these prodcut lines, my hair is more silky and shine,&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to everyone, I LOVE IT!, specially the cost too.</li>
            <li> First of all, the product didn&#x27;t come with an expiration date stamped on the bottle. I just realized after opening it! Normally all products have this information available to the costumeR. Second, it should state it isn&#x27;t a sulfate-free shampoo. I say that because it is a high quality shampoo, normally used in hair saloon and I think this information is critical nowadays. Is there any version of this one sulfate-free? I rated 5 stars because I know this product and it is TOTALLY AWESOME!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo, but bottle didn&#x27;t come with a pump. ?? I had an extra one thank goodness, but its a pretty important element!</li>
            <li> I have used L&#x27;oreal Serie Expert Intense Repair Shampoo for at least 10 years for my below shoulder length, fine hair.  It protects the ends and does not weigh down the hair.  I use it several times a week. It was recommended by my salon stylist who uses it herself.  Do not confuse it with a similar L&#x27;Oreal shampoo also in a yellow bottle. They do not work the same and the other one is heavier.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo!  Great price</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my hair feel, behave and look. I have used this product for more than ten years and it continues to impress me!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, no issues.  Great price.</li>
            <li> Excellent Shampoo!  Been using it for years!</li>
            <li> Good shampoo, though I feel the Absolute Repair version is even better for my texture hair.</li>
            <li> Lasts a very long time.</li>
