    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>But I think this razor is a great product, and value!  </li>
            <li>TIP #2:  I remembered my father telling me years ago when micro-screen shavers came out that you get the best shave by moving the shaver in a circular motion.  </li>
            <li>Great purchase!  </li>
            <li>Best razor I ever used and for a good price.</li>
            <li>This shaver is great.</li>
            <li>that worked great.  </li>
            <li>but it is uncommon to have a nice close shave and a great battery.  </li>
            <li>I made a good choice.</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>But I LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>My husband was so impressed he wants to get a Men&#x27;s Remington for himself!  </li>
            <li>so I can honestly say after the 4/5 years i have owned this razor</li>
            <li>It is a Remington WDF5500 and comes with its own traveling case, charging dock and cleaning brush.</li>
            <li>and I kind of want to get this one again,</li>
            <li>Honestly, there aren&#x27;t that many out there for women.</li>
            <li>It even allows you to trim your bikini area nice and easy with no pulling or burning.</li>
            <li>Most of them were encouraging</li>
            <li>I agree; it work&#x27;s best since the hair grows in different directions.  </li>
            <li>Barring unreasonable expectations of miracle products, anyone should be satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li>In this case, you get more than you pay for.</li>
            <li>Gave this a better review before</li>
            <li>I finally had to start looking online and most of my online shopping is done through Amazon....because Amazon is the Best!!!!  </li>
            <li>and I am totally pleased with the performance of this item.</li>
            <li>A good, reliable, easy to use and clean shaver.</li>
            <li>Glad I went to Amazon to look.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to note that I rarely use my electric, preferring the closer shave I get with a good blade razor.  </li>
            <li>It allows the razor to move more smoothly.  </li>
            <li>This razor has held a charge  for TWO full shavings without even being recharged between uses!  </li>
            <li>Cleaning is easy.  </li>
            <li>I often took this on vacation without the charger and it worked just fine.  </li>
            <li>This shaver works so much better than the first one, my legs were as smooth as a razor shave!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a comfortable shave, easy to clean and gives a smooth finish.  </li>
            <li>And yes, I now see that the replacement foils are available.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and replace parts, which are inexpensive on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Kudos to Remington for making this fabulous razor.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE LOOKING FOR AN ELECTRIC SHAVER!!!!  </li>
            <li>It is a very nice light green color and very easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>This would be great for those of you whose hair doesn&#x27;t grow back quickly, and if it does, don&#x27;t mind shaving every waking minute.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>This shaver has given me a great shave for a very long time.</li>
            <li>It works great dry, but I do need to moisturize afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>This one is a good size and weight for me and the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that it seemed to pull the hair under my arms when I used it there.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this for women and teens easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I can do a quick shave(dry)</li>
            <li>You do have to go over areas a few times to make sure the shave is good.</li>
            <li>I use this when I need a quick shave between the times of using a razor.  </li>
            <li>It does however give you a quick fix</li>
            <li>I was really excited to give this a try that as soon as it was charged, I got right out of bed and turned it on.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to do by just flipping up the top and only takes 2 seconds, so if it will keep the razor in good working order, I would recommend following the directions.   </li>
            <li>how much I love this new (refurbished)shaver I got.  </li>
            <li>As far as the shaver goes, it is ok, but don&#x27;t use it on underarms -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using electric razors for my underarms for many many years due to sensitvity to blades.   </li>
            <li>I remember having a little Sunbeam electric razor years ago that worked great, very gentle,</li>
            <li>This shaver comes with a warning that for the first few weeks this may be experienced.</li>
            <li>So hubby and I went on a mission to find a shaver that would work, be easy to hold, and complete the job well.  </li>
            <li>like I expected, and it was great to get such a close shave so quickly.  </li>
            <li>I went back and bought 2 more so that I will have them if the first one goes on the fritz.</li>
            <li>When I went online to find a new one, I looked at other brands, but couldn&#x27;t find one that had good reviews.</li>
            <li>I tried it a couple of hours later, and it worked fine.  </li>
            <li>This is a reasonable sacrifice for avoiding nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li>Have to say that nothing really beats using a razor for shaving your legs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise much sturdier construction than the Panasonic I had last.&lt;br /&gt;Get</li>
            <li>tierd of spending so much on dispoable</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This is my second remington smooth and silky shaver.  </li>
            <li>I used this first in the shower and didn&#x27;t experience any problems except for areas with sensitive skin (underarms, etc.).</li>
            <li>I was walking through a store that had these electric razors for a decent price</li>
            <li>Works in the shower or out, and for an \\&quot;Electric\\&quot; shaver it gives a decent shave.</li>
            <li>A couple of friends have these and were highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This razor stays charged well, is not too easy to clean, leaves an electric razor (minor stubble- typical)</li>
            <li>It can be left on the charger when fully charged, unlike many other electric razors.</li>
            <li>The good thing is, this has a regular plug-in with a stand, the Panasonic is quieter, but has to be plugged directly into one of my outlets, and in this modern age, such a waste of space!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second Remington WDF3500 - the first one lasted a couple of years - then the charger stopped working.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t really loud</li>
            <li>Sensitive skin may contribute to the condition.</li>
            <li>the shave is reasonably comparable to using a standard razor if one uses it correctly.</li>
            <li>I like this shaver so much that i&#x27;m going to replace the one i have with the same.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second of these and really have had no complaints.</li>
            <li>Had an old Remington that was over 20 yrs old</li>
            <li>I really like how this razor works and how it feels; it definitely gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>Wow, do I wish I did this sooner.  </li>
            <li>Price was pretty high (other advertisers at lower prices didn&#x27;t actually have any inventory), but shaver works very well.  </li>
            <li>Initially they were, but only through Remington directly I believe, and at a steep price (as much as a brand new razor- how wasteful!)</li>
            <li>Clean heads with little brush provided after each use as directed.</li>
            <li>I purchased this razor based on the great reviews that other customers gave it and the fact that I&#x27;m tired of constantly having to change razor blades in my manual all of the time.  </li>
            <li>I thought that maybe my legs just needed to get used to shaving with something new, so I kept at it for a week with the same results:</li>
            <li>On initial use, be sure to charge the razor for at least 15 hours.  </li>
            <li>Its very loud, going back to Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>I was so disappointed because I was satisfied with how it shaved and very impressed with the battery life (which had been my complaint on previous electric razors).  </li>
            <li>I was planning to find something else to try, but from what I&#x27;ve read it isn&#x27;t all that uncommon to have foils go bad...</li>
            <li>I finally had to replace my 20 year old shaver.  </li>
            <li>You have to be careful if u use on sensitive areas such as fast or arm pits.  </li>
            <li>My old one died after 5 years and I could not find this in any local store.  </li>
            <li>I hardly ever clean it</li>
            <li>I did get a very slight rash after the first use, but</li>
            <li>I kept ordering replacement screens (at $25 each) for my old one which was at least 7 years old when I decided I could spend the same amount and get a new one.  </li>
            <li>I have dark, course hairs, so I didn&#x27;t have high expections for this chargeable razor.  </li>

            <li> I have dark, course hairs, so I didn&#x27;t have high expections for this chargeable razor.  </li>
            <li> I have to buy new shavers in less than a year, I keep switching back between this and Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> Only recently has it started to not hold its charge as long</li>
            <li> it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge long enough to get both legs done!  </li>
            <li> now which isn&#x27;t long enough.  </li>
            <li> I have to be on coumadin due to a very large blood clot and therefore no razors for me for at least 9 months.  </li>
            <li> I have been wanting one of these for a long time.</li>
            <li> and i figured in the long run it would save me money.  </li>
            <li> If i do let my hair get long, during winter months, it does not pull my hair out when I go to shave.  </li>
            <li> I have had the WDF3500 for so long that i can&#x27;t even remember buying it.  </li>
            <li> Based on the other good reviews, I bought this razor with some skepticism because I had been shaving with a blade razor for the last 20 years and lately have gotten tired of the rising prices of cartridges and the little knicks I would get using a blade.  </li>
            <li> I had the last one for a very long time - ten years at least or nearly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long I&#x27;ve had this razor, but I recently had to throw it away due to the foil being completely ruined.  </li>
            <li> My review is based on using the razor DRY, and I cannot comment on using it in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I found that by using the razor after getting out of the shower and toweling off that the hairs are softened and you get a closer shave than if you shaved dry before taking a shower.  </li>
            <li> Although it is getting that time, because the last few times I have used it dry it is starting to pull.  </li>
            <li> However, I have had it for a little over a year and the battery life has gone down so much that it lasts for less than 10 mins.</li>
            <li> The wet dry is a plus for me.  </li>
            <li> So I have to buy a new one--more money for them, but a waste of money for us, and a waste of materials, not green-friendly.  </li>
            <li> close shave for only a little while.  </li>
            <li> The head \\&quot;latch\\&quot; on the side pops open a little as ur shaving &amp; has to be \\&quot;popped\\&quot; bk on.  </li>
            <li> NO WAY am I going that long without shaving!!!  </li>
            <li> I also have not tried it wet.  </li>
            <li> I do recommend shaving with a soap or bath gel when using it wet to get a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> My advice is to take advantage of the wet feature.</li>
            <li> this is expected after time with this type of rechargable battery.  </li>
            <li> Let me tell you there is not a large selection of shavers out there to choose from.</li>
            <li> I want to respond to some of the other posters&#x27; comments about rash/redness.</li>
            <li> They sell replacement blade and foil, but the trimmer is a big part of shaving for me, since I don&#x27;t shave every day, and it would catch on my underarms if I kept using the dull one.  </li>
            <li> it is way too rough!!  </li>
            <li> Got a little razor burn one time on underarms.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting a little closer shave.  </li>
            <li> The on/off switch needs a little force to stay on.</li>
            <li> I started out with this razor using the usual up/down motion, but when I noticed there were a few spots that didn&#x27;t seem like they&#x27;d gotten a close shave, I went over them in a circular motion and got an extremely close shave.  </li>
            <li> And I definately could not shave everyday.  </li>
            <li> I can shave my under arms everyday with out breaking out into any rash.  </li>
            <li> Every time I take it out I have to recharge it because the battery is dead.  </li>
            <li> Maybe having it in a suitcase was too hard on the foil though.  </li>
            <li> Has countertop charger so you don&#x27;t have to plug a bulky base directy into the outlet and the base has a slot to keep the little head cleaner handy.</li>
            <li> in the morning if I am running late, or shave in the shower if I want a closer silkier feel.  </li>
            <li> I do not have course or thick hair</li>
            <li> (razor blades are ridiculous)  </li>
            <li> Needless to say it took about two weeks of getting used to using this razor.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately for this item I ended up purchasing though ebay.  </li>
            <li> My previous razor was awful...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting impossible to find shavers with world-wide voltage.  </li>
            <li> , so I was very disappointed when the charger failed.    </li>
            <li> This is the worst razor I have ever owned</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this razor after reading a ton of reviews.  Most of them were encouraging so I went ahead.  My previous razor was awful...it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge long enough to get both legs done!  This razor has held a charge  for TWO full shavings without even being recharged between uses!  I love it!  One reviewer suggested using a circular motion when shaving legs.  I agree; it work&#x27;s best since the hair grows in different directions.  It&#x27;s a comfortable shave, easy to clean and gives a smooth finish.  I did get a very slight rash after the first use, but nothing since.  I only use this on my legs, so can&#x27;t speak to anywhere else.  I also have not tried it wet.  It works great dry, but I do need to moisturize afterwards.  Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long I&#x27;ve had this razor, but I recently had to throw it away due to the foil being completely ruined.  I was so disappointed because I was satisfied with how it shaved and very impressed with the battery life (which had been my complaint on previous electric razors).  I often took this on vacation without the charger and it worked just fine.  Maybe having it in a suitcase was too hard on the foil though.  I was planning to find something else to try, but from what I&#x27;ve read it isn&#x27;t all that uncommon to have foils go bad... but it is uncommon to have a nice close shave and a great battery.  I&#x27;ll think about it, and maybe I&#x27;ll give it another chance.      And yes, I now see that the replacement foils are available.  Initially they were, but only through Remington directly I believe, and at a steep price (as much as a brand new razor- how wasteful!)</li>
            <li> I have been wanting one of these for a long time. A couple of friends have these and were highly recommended. I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor based on the great reviews that other customers gave it and the fact that I&#x27;m tired of constantly having to change razor blades in my manual all of the time.  So I gave this one a shot.  I was really excited to give this a try that as soon as it was charged, I got right out of bed and turned it on.  It wasn&#x27;t really loud like I expected, and it was great to get such a close shave so quickly.  However, this close shave only lasted for about an hour or two and I could feel stubble on my legs.  I thought that maybe my legs just needed to get used to shaving with something new, so I kept at it for a week with the same results:close shave for only a little while.  I guess my legs are just different.  This would be great for those of you whose hair doesn&#x27;t grow back quickly, and if it does, don&#x27;t mind shaving every waking minute.</li>
            <li> I got this Razor about 4/5 years ago.  I would break out in a rash under my arms if I would use a regular razor.  And I definately could not shave everyday.  I was walking through a store that had these electric razors for a decent price and i figured in the long run it would save me money.  (razor blades are ridiculous)  Needless to say it took about two weeks of getting used to using this razor.  But I LOVE IT!  I can shave my under arms everyday with out breaking out into any rash.  If i do let my hair get long, during winter months, it does not pull my hair out when I go to shave.  The wet dry is a plus for me.  I can do a quick shave(dry) in the morning if I am running late, or shave in the shower if I want a closer silkier feel.  I do recommend shaving with a soap or bath gel when using it wet to get a closer shave.  It allows the razor to move more smoothly.  I do not have course or thick hair so I can honestly say after the 4/5 years i have owned this razor I have not had to change the blades.  Although it is getting that time, because the last few times I have used it dry it is starting to pull.  But I think this razor is a great product, and value!  And A BIG TIME MONEY SAVER!!!!!</li>
            <li> I finally had to replace my 20 year old shaver.  Since I had been out of the \\&quot;shaver\\&quot; market for some time, I didn&#x27;t quite know what to choose.  I made a good choice.</li>
            <li> This shaver is great. I want to respond to some of the other posters&#x27; comments about rash/redness. This shaver comes with a warning that for the first few weeks this may be experienced. Sensitive skin may contribute to the condition. My advice is to take advantage of the wet feature. I used this first in the shower and didn&#x27;t experience any problems except for areas with sensitive skin (underarms, etc.). Any irritation was gone within one to two hours. the shave is reasonably comparable to using a standard razor if one uses it correctly. You do have to go over areas a few times to make sure the shave is good. This is a reasonable sacrifice for avoiding nicks and cuts. Barring unreasonable expectations of miracle products, anyone should be satisfied with this product.  It can be left on the charger when fully charged, unlike many other electric razors. Leaving it on the charger does not harm the battery. There are instructions for preserving the battery, thus the razor. It is easy to clean and replace parts, which are inexpensive on Amazon.  I have no complaints. In this case, you get more than you pay for.</li>
            <li> I use this when I need a quick shave between the times of using a razor.  Gave this a better review before but I have to say that it takes repeated strokes to remove hair.  Every time I take it out I have to recharge it because the battery is dead.  Have to say that nothing really beats using a razor for shaving your legs.</li>
            <li> So I have to buy a new one--more money for them, but a waste of money for us, and a waste of materials, not green-friendly.  They sell replacement blade and foil, but the trimmer is a big part of shaving for me, since I don&#x27;t shave every day, and it would catch on my underarms if I kept using the dull one.  Lame!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise much sturdier construction than the Panasonic I had last.&lt;br /&gt;Get with the program and sell replacement trimmers Remington, thanks!&lt;br /&gt;.................&lt;br /&gt;add-on 2013:  I have to buy new shavers in less than a year, I keep switching back between this and Panasonic.  Its very loud, going back to Panasonic.  The good thing is, this has a regular plug-in with a stand, the Panasonic is quieter, but has to be plugged directly into one of my outlets, and in this modern age, such a waste of space!</li>
            <li> This razor stays charged well, is not too easy to clean, leaves an electric razor (minor stubble- typical) It does however give you a quick fix if you don&#x27; t have time to jump in the tub!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric razors for my underarms for many many years due to sensitvity to blades.   I have had the WDF3500 for so long that i can&#x27;t even remember buying it.  I hardly ever clean it and i leave it sit on the charger all the time.   This shaver has given me a great shave for a very long time. Only recently has it started to not hold its charge as long i need it to.  this is expected after time with this type of rechargable battery.  I like this shaver so much that i&#x27;m going to replace the one i have with the same.</li>
            <li> This is the worst razor I have ever owned and I would not recommend it to any woman.  It tore my skin and left me with a rash for days.  After using it twice I threw it away.</li>
            <li> Pretty good product.  As with probably all electric shavers, wish it could shave just a bit closer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second Remington WDF3500 - the first one lasted a couple of years - then the charger stopped working.  I contacted the company and they will not sell replacement chargers, so I had to buy another shaver.  Now I have two working shavers and one charger.    It&#x27;s important to note that I rarely use my electric, preferring the closer shave I get with a good blade razor.  I use the electric if I am in a hurry, travelling, etc., so I was very disappointed when the charger failed.    As far as the shaver goes, it is ok, but don&#x27;t use it on underarms - it is way too rough!!  I remember having a little Sunbeam electric razor years ago that worked great, very gentle, etc.  Guess they don&#x27;t make ladies razors like that anymore.</li>
            <li> I just have to let you know how much I love this new (refurbished)shaver I got.  It is a Remington WDF5500 and comes with its own traveling case, charging dock and cleaning brush. It is a very nice light green color and very easy to hold.  I have to be on coumadin due to a very large blood clot and therefore no razors for me for at least 9 months.  NO WAY am I going that long without shaving!!!  So hubby and I went on a mission to find a shaver that would work, be easy to hold, and complete the job well.  Let me tell you there is not a large selection of shavers out there to choose from. I finally had to start looking online and most of my online shopping is done through Amazon....because Amazon is the Best!!!!  Unfortunately for this item I ended up purchasing though ebay.  I had my item within 3 days and I am totally pleased with the performance of this item. It actually shaved me closer than a razor with none of the razor burn or bumps. It even allows you to trim your bikini area nice and easy with no pulling or burning. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE LOOKING FOR AN ELECTRIC SHAVER!!!!  I love it so much I went back and bought 2 more so that I will have them if the first one goes on the fritz. Check them out at this link   [...].</li>
            <li> Price was pretty high (other advertisers at lower prices didn&#x27;t actually have any inventory), but shaver works very well.  Got a little razor burn one time on underarms.  It&#x27;s getting impossible to find shavers with world-wide voltage.  Doesn&#x27;t anyone travel anymore???</li>
            <li> Best razor I ever used and for a good price. Highly recommend this for women and teens easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second of these and really have had no complaints. I had the last one for a very long time - ten years at least or nearly. It just didn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore. When I went online to find a new one, I looked at other brands, but couldn&#x27;t find one that had good reviews. Honestly, there aren&#x27;t that many out there for women. This one is a good size and weight for me and the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that it seemed to pull the hair under my arms when I used it there. But I never changed the cutters, so this may have been the problem. A good, reliable, easy to use and clean shaver. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I was expecting a little closer shave.  Had an old Remington that was over 20 yrs old that worked great.  The on/off switch needs a little force to stay on. The head \\&quot;latch\\&quot; on the side pops open a little as ur shaving &amp; has to be \\&quot;popped\\&quot; bk on.  However the head doesn&#x27;t come off.  Cleaning is easy.  Have never used it in the shower.  You have to be careful if u use on sensitive areas such as fast or arm pits.  It can nick you.  Like the recharging feature.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas present for my daughter. So far so good. She loves it! Works in the shower or out, and for an \\&quot;Electric\\&quot; shaver it gives a decent shave.</li>
            <li> Based on the other good reviews, I bought this razor with some skepticism because I had been shaving with a blade razor for the last 20 years and lately have gotten tired of the rising prices of cartridges and the little knicks I would get using a blade.  I have dark, course hairs, so I didn&#x27;t have high expections for this chargeable razor.  My review is based on using the razor DRY, and I cannot comment on using it in the shower.  TIP #1:   I found that by using the razor after getting out of the shower and toweling off that the hairs are softened and you get a closer shave than if you shaved dry before taking a shower.  TIP #2:  I remembered my father telling me years ago when micro-screen shavers came out that you get the best shave by moving the shaver in a circular motion.  I started out with this razor using the usual up/down motion, but when I noticed there were a few spots that didn&#x27;t seem like they&#x27;d gotten a close shave, I went over them in a circular motion and got an extremely close shave.  TIP #3:  On initial use, be sure to charge the razor for at least 15 hours.  I was eager to use mine and tried to used it 12 hours after iniating the charge, and thought the razor was defective because it didn&#x27;t work.  I tried it a couple of hours later, and it worked fine.  TIP #4:  Clean heads with little brush provided after each use as directed. It&#x27;s easy to do by just flipping up the top and only takes 2 seconds, so if it will keep the razor in good working order, I would recommend following the directions.   PROS:  Has countertop charger so you don&#x27;t have to plug a bulky base directy into the outlet and the base has a slot to keep the little head cleaner handy. Kudos to Remington for making this fabulous razor.</li>
            <li> tierd of spending so much on dispoable so i looked at the rating on this. so i went ahead and got it. it was geat!!</li>
            <li> Great purchase!  My old one died after 5 years and I could not find this in any local store.  Glad I went to Amazon to look.  Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I really like how this razor works and how it feels; it definitely gets the job done.  However, I have had it for a little over a year and the battery life has gone down so much that it lasts for less than 10 mins. now which isn&#x27;t long enough.  I leave it plugged in when I&#x27;m not using it; should I not have it charging all the time?  I wish there was a way to replace the battery.  Anyway, I&#x27;m looking for another one and I kind of want to get this one again, but I don&#x27;t want to spend $60 on something that might die again in a year....</li>
            <li> This is my second remington smooth and silky shaver.  I kept ordering replacement screens (at $25 each) for my old one which was at least 7 years old when I decided I could spend the same amount and get a new one.  Wow, do I wish I did this sooner.  This shaver works so much better than the first one, my legs were as smooth as a razor shave!  My husband was so impressed he wants to get a Men&#x27;s Remington for himself!  Just wish we could make these in the USA to boost our economy!</li>
