            <li>:o)</li>
            <li>(More on the gel polish kit soon - will wait two weeks to give fair results - day one -  perfect!).  </li>

            <li>It was a good deal and does the job.</li>
            <li>, it has a timer and the reviews were good.</li>
            <li>Very happy with this light.</li>
            <li>Just got it but had used a friends and loved it, h opefuuly mine will be just as good....</li>

            <li>I love this dryer!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>This UV light for gel nails is great.  </li>
            <li>I really loved that there are 2 bulbs on the top and 2 bulbs on the side, this helps A LOT with your pinky and thumb nails.</li>
            <li>The timer lets you not have to watch a clock which is nice.  </li>
            <li>I ordered 2 of these UV lamps because I wanted to start doing my own nails at home.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, I&#x27;ve saved a lot of money doing my own nails.</li>
            <li>Items seems to quite nice and works well.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this so that I could do my own gelish gel nail polish.</li>
            <li>Great product, quick service.  </li>
            <li>Also, this one angles the two end bulbs to better cure your thumbnails.</li>
            <li>Glad I did.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>Buy it already! :)</li>
            <li>However, I am able to return it for a refund.  </li>
            <li>I am going to buy a lamp from Sally Beauty Supply and see if I have better luck.</li>
            <li>Wish it had better instructions. . .</li>
            <li>and it is much better.  </li>
            <li>so I can place my fingers correctly and then slide them in without worrying about touching the sides and messing up the polish.</li>
            <li>THis product is an awesome buy and you gain your money back with 3 polish changes.</li>
            <li>THe time limits are great and everything really just flies by when you are watching a tv show or something.</li>
            <li>I would recommend getting this lamp that is a lot cheaper and more profitable.</li>
            <li>Satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li>It was MUCH better than the salon dryers I used when I used to get acrylic nails years ago.  </li>
            <li>:) please</li>
            <li>I have used this 20+ times and LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>cures it just like the real thing - good buy</li>
            <li>I read the other reviews and found this one to be the best</li>
            <li>and I could rest easy.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to put the bulbs in and operating it is a breeze.</li>
            <li>The timer is incredibly helpful, since you don&#x27;t have to think about how long to cure each coat.</li>
            <li>Just one less thing to worry about when trying to have perfect nails.</li>
            <li>Since having the lamp, I don&#x27;t need to worry about that because this lamp drys your nails quickly in between coats (even glitter polish!)</li>
            <li>but they are huge and can&#x27;t have anything to do with nails...</li>
            <li>I opened the box and tucked inside of the light were 4 bags that contain 50 beads each....</li>
            <li>Every time I used it I had to adjust it to get it to light.</li>
            <li>After a couple of weeks, I couldn&#x27;t get the light bulb to stay in place at all</li>
            <li>and therefore that light bulb would no longer stay lit.  </li>
            <li>USpicy 36W Nail UV Lamp Acrylic Gel CURING Light TIMER 36 WATT]]</li>
            <li>Product arrived promptly, however light didn&#x27;t turn on.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a great UV lamp at a low price this is it.</li>
            <li>I guess, it is not USpicy Nail Dryer Ger UV Lamp, I&#x60;ve got a lamp without manual and  Free Nail Sanding file.</li>
            <li>You have to put the lights in yourself, however, this is super easy</li>
            <li>so I was excited to buy one.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive this lamp.</li>
            <li>I just receieved this in the mail and was so excited to use it.</li>
            <li>This light arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>I am smitten with shellac manicures and was so glad to find a reasonably priced UV lamp on amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>so that your manicure lasts for the full 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>It seems pretty easy.  </li>
            <li>For the price, this is an excellent choice but the more expensive ones do come with a cooling function.</li>
            <li>The lamp arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>The price was very reasonable and the lights work fantastic.</li>
            <li>They replaces super fast and easy.  </li>
            <li>Works great and actually arrived early!</li>
            <li>The polish dries and remains chip free for much longer than air drying.</li>
            <li>I bought this last Feb and decided to use it when I started doing my own gel manicures.</li>
            <li>I change my polish a lot more frequently now.</li>
            <li>I have only used the lamp twice so far, but from what I can tell it works great.  </li>
            <li>However, for the price difference between uv lights that have this feature and this one, it&#x27;s well worth the compromise.</li>
            <li>Thinking that I would just buy a new light bulb for that slot, I kept the device, hoping that a new light bulb would stay in place.  </li>
            <li>While this is kind of an annoyance, it&#x27;s not enough to really bother me.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive my new UV gel curing lamp.  </li>
            <li>It does get a bit hot after a while, but since the timer is only for 2 or 3 minutes, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me, with no time to wait for nails to cure, this is an absolute MUST HAVE!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t need any extra age spots! :)</li>
            <li>This is the first time I purchased something from Amazon that was defective.  </li>
            <li>I used this lamp for the first time today.  </li>
            <li>Love the timer options because it helps me keep track of how long I&#x27;ve been curing my nails.  </li>
            <li>After reading reviews of several UV driers, I decided to spend a little more and get this more powerful unit.</li>
            <li>She confirmed that my ebay purchase was actually the real deal from them</li>
            <li>The timer on it is very convenient.</li>
            <li>This was very aggravating.</li>
            <li>and it worked really well.</li>
            <li>Totally recommend this light to manicurist.</li>
            <li>After reading reviews of the different kinds available, I chose this one.  </li>
            <li>I put it together in a minute and a half - VERY easy - and got my supplies to \\&quot;start gelling\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I got this one because the price was reasonable (compared to the over $100.00 items), the watts were high</li>
            <li>I have experience with these products, but had I not, better instructions/care guide would&#x27;ve been nice.</li>
            <li>(I can do both hands simultaneously if I place one on top of the other!)</li>
            <li>Anyway - I used the light, 30-60 seconds each time, depending on application, and my nails were totally dry after each time.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Worked great and is exactly as show in picture (few small dings in metal tray)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally spend time doing reviews</li>
            <li>The only downside to it is that it does get a little warm in there</li>
            <li>Seller wrote promptly stating it could be defective and would send new one.  </li>
            <li>Rather than snap on when I turned it on, the switch would just flop back and forth and the entire apparatus would no longer light.</li>
            <li>It does come with a small sheet that gives general info like what kind of lights you need if you have to replace them.</li>
            <li>It does get a little warm in there, but certainly not hot (be sure to take off the protective film on the outside after you get it so the lamps are properly vented).</li>
            <li>now I can get the exact same results in my livingroom!  </li>
            <li>First one sent had a shortage, but was delivered a second lamp soon after.</li>
            <li>Do NOT waste your money on this piece of JUNK!  </li>
            <li>I can do multiple coats of polish, including glitter!, one right after the other, finish off with a quick-dry top coat, and dry each hand for about 6 minutes.</li>
            <li>I actually leave my foundation coat in there for the full 2 min even though the instructions say only one min.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it twice so far with Harmony Gelish polishes.</li>
            <li>This product works very well for both gel and regular polish.</li>
            <li>but it really ticks me off when I buy something trusting I will get it as the picture shows and it is completely different.  </li>
            <li>and so far my manicures have lasted around 2 weeks, once I got the hang of it.</li>
            <li>I have used it a couple of times so far and have had no problems.</li>
            <li>First unit I bought had a faulty bulb that caused the whole unit to not light up.</li>
            <li>Amazon sent a new one and took back the old.</li>
            <li>I received my nail dryer today, sat down, opened it up, plugged in the bulbs and was all set to go when I noticed his funny looking plug!  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m worried I&#x27;ll burn myself if I&#x27;m not careful.</li>
            <li>I usually have to set the timer twice for the top coat, but that only adds a couple of minutes to the dry time.  </li>
            <li>Very excited to get this in the mail only to discover that the fuse connection was broken and would not turn on.</li>
            <li>The overall lamp is a little bigger than I&#x27;d like, but the price is right and it gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>His heart was in the right place but THIS PRODUCT IS A SHAM!</li>

            <li> After reading reviews of the different kinds available, I chose this one.  </li>
            <li> I put it together in a minute and a half - VERY easy - and got my supplies to \\&quot;start gelling\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I got this one because the price was reasonable (compared to the over $100.00 items), the watts were high</li>
            <li> I have experience with these products, but had I not, better instructions/care guide would&#x27;ve been nice.</li>
            <li> (I can do both hands simultaneously if I place one on top of the other!)</li>
            <li> Anyway - I used the light, 30-60 seconds each time, depending on application, and my nails were totally dry after each time.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Worked great and is exactly as show in picture (few small dings in metal tray)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally spend time doing reviews</li>
            <li> The only downside to it is that it does get a little warm in there</li>
            <li> Seller wrote promptly stating it could be defective and would send new one.  </li>
            <li> Rather than snap on when I turned it on, the switch would just flop back and forth and the entire apparatus would no longer light.</li>
            <li> It does come with a small sheet that gives general info like what kind of lights you need if you have to replace them.</li>
            <li> It does get a little warm in there, but certainly not hot (be sure to take off the protective film on the outside after you get it so the lamps are properly vented).</li>
            <li> now I can get the exact same results in my livingroom!  </li>
            <li> First one sent had a shortage, but was delivered a second lamp soon after.</li>
            <li> Do NOT waste your money on this piece of JUNK!  </li>
            <li> I can do multiple coats of polish, including glitter!, one right after the other, finish off with a quick-dry top coat, and dry each hand for about 6 minutes.</li>
            <li> I actually leave my foundation coat in there for the full 2 min even though the instructions say only one min.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice so far with Harmony Gelish polishes.</li>
            <li> This product works very well for both gel and regular polish.</li>
            <li> but it really ticks me off when I buy something trusting I will get it as the picture shows and it is completely different.  </li>
            <li> and so far my manicures have lasted around 2 weeks, once I got the hang of it.</li>
            <li> I have used it a couple of times so far and have had no problems.</li>
            <li> First unit I bought had a faulty bulb that caused the whole unit to not light up.</li>
            <li> Amazon sent a new one and took back the old.</li>
            <li> I received my nail dryer today, sat down, opened it up, plugged in the bulbs and was all set to go when I noticed his funny looking plug!  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m worried I&#x27;ll burn myself if I&#x27;m not careful.</li>
            <li> I usually have to set the timer twice for the top coat, but that only adds a couple of minutes to the dry time.  </li>
            <li> Very excited to get this in the mail only to discover that the fuse connection was broken and would not turn on.</li>
            <li> The overall lamp is a little bigger than I&#x27;d like, but the price is right and it gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> His heart was in the right place but THIS PRODUCT IS A SHAM!</li>
            <li> Now since it is one week past the date where I can get a full refund (which is 6 weeks), I have to send it back, pay for the postage myself and take a partial reimbursement for this hunk of junk.  </li>
            <li> The only down side to this is the bulbs get a little hot</li>
            <li> let them dry and especially cure.</li>
            <li> Before I bought this lamp I would wait just enough time to do anything with my hands as was need just to dry, but not cure (no time).</li>
            <li> Super frustrating since it was advertised as U.S. version.</li>
            <li> Initially it worked, but one of the lights was always loose from the start.  </li>
            <li> The only thing to note is be careful when switching the timer from 2 minutes to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> I figured a one time buy with the products and a couple polishes would save me money in the long run</li>
            <li> It was not new.</li>
            <li> I bought this and got my first one with a broken reflector.  </li>
            <li> are these beads mentioned... very strange!</li>
            <li> &quot; so I was curious to see if this one would look like my sis-in-laws (AND LIKE THE PRODUCT PICTURE ON AMAZON!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This lamp arrived faster than expected and works exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> Since I consider this to be a mini-tanning bed for my hands, I apply a drop of sunscreen to the back of my hands a few minutes before using the UV lamp -</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> I would send it back, but it&#x27;s not worth the trouble.  </li>
            <li> This lamp ACTUALLY has a 120sec mode (2min) and an infintie mode (no timer), so you dont have to watch the clock for your nails to dry in between coats, but you DO for your nails to cure (at least 3 min).</li>
            <li> and I would whine endlessly.</li>
            <li> I had read one other reviewer saying hers looked \\&quot;generic\\</li>
            <li> Eventually buying multiple colors can be a small investment</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re using this with Gelish, then cure the base coat and color coats with the 2 minute setting and the top coat with the 3 minute setting.</li>
            <li> No more sheet creases or waiting all day for the polish to dry.</li>
            <li> I purchased this lamp as an upgrade to the 9w that I had previously</li>
            <li> I put the bulbs in mess with the buttons and nothing.</li>
            <li> I wish the chord was a little longer.</li>
            <li> and I like to let my nails cure a little longer than recommended.  </li>
            <li> Not only did it fail to cure my nails, but my hands felt dry and tingly for hours!</li>
            <li> as a few others have stated....</li>
            <li> Manual and nail file were missing from the package.</li>
            <li> I did a plain polish change for $18 or $20 with tip.</li>
            <li> I now have to find another less expensive replacement, I only read the reviews after I could not get the darn thing to work BUYER BEWARE!!!!</li>
            <li> I also noticed a little bit (hardly noticeable) of a vibration when the lamp is on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a working mother (2 babies) with very little time to even do my nails let alone</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I did not discover this until just recently and since it has been a year I am stuck with this piece of junk!</li>
            <li> It was the last piece to my do it at home puzzle and am very sad.</li>
            <li> A GENERIC &amp; DIDN&#x27;T INCLUDE THE STUPID NAIL FILE- no USPICY ANYTHING.  </li>
            <li> I was confused.  </li>
            <li> I was so confused</li>
            <li> Somebody messed up, so now I have to send this back and wait another week or so for them to send me another one....very disappointed.  :(</li>
            <li> Still powered on but was useless.</li>
            <li> Did anyone recieve random beads with this?</li>
            <li> it came with the wrong plug.  </li>
            <li> And imagine my disappointment when I opened the boxes of bulbs and found one shattered.  </li>
            <li> Very frustrating!</li>
            <li> And the price wasn&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li> Packaging of delicated and expensive bulbs was awful, so I gave it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> But the inconvenience is very annoying - and I purchased the UV lamp to do my gel nails tonight, so I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> We are very disappointed in this product and I will just have to stick to letting my nails air-dry.</li>
            <li> FALSE ADVERTISING AMAZON!!!!</li>

            <li> I bought this last Feb and decided to use it when I started doing my own gel manicures. IT DOES NOT WORK NEVER HAS NEVER WILL!!!!! Unfortunately I did not discover this until just recently and since it has been a year I am stuck with this piece of junk! I now have to find another less expensive replacement, I only read the reviews after I could not get the darn thing to work BUYER BEWARE!!!! I only wish I could give it ZERO stars!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this to do my own gel manicures, and it works great. I&#x27;ve used it twice so far with Harmony Gelish polishes. The only thing to note is be careful when switching the timer from 2 minutes to 3 minutes. I didn&#x27;t realize I hadn&#x27;t pushed it all the way, so it was in the no-timer position.  The timer is incredibly helpful, since you don&#x27;t have to think about how long to cure each coat. Also, this one angles the two end bulbs to better cure your thumbnails. The overall lamp is a little bigger than I&#x27;d like, but the price is right and it gets the job done.  If you&#x27;re using this with Gelish, then cure the base coat and color coats with the 2 minute setting and the top coat with the 3 minute setting.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews of several UV driers, I decided to spend a little more and get this more powerful unit. Glad I did. Can&#x27;t speak for the lower watt units, but this one works great for me. I can do multiple coats of polish, including glitter!, one right after the other, finish off with a quick-dry top coat, and dry each hand for about 6 minutes. Dry-dry-dry! (I can do both hands simultaneously if I place one on top of the other!) No more sheet creases or waiting all day for the polish to dry. I change my polish a lot more frequently now. And the price wasn&#x27;t bad either. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Was spending a fortune at the salon.... now I can get the exact same results in my livingroom!  LOVE saving money!!!!</li>
            <li> This UV light for gel nails is great.  Love the timer options because it helps me keep track of how long I&#x27;ve been curing my nails.  Just one less thing to worry about when trying to have perfect nails.</li>
            <li> First one sent had a shortage, but was delivered a second lamp soon after. I use it with Gelish and Axxium soak off gel polish. The timer on it is very convenient. I wish the chord was a little longer. It was a good deal and does the job.</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these lamps. I&#x27;m a licensed nail tech and I use them on a daily basis. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the product. The price was very reasonable and the lights work fantastic.</li>
            <li> I received my nail dryer today, sat down, opened it up, plugged in the bulbs and was all set to go when I noticed his funny looking plug!  Nowhere in the description does this thing say to order models for USA or Europe.  Why would anyone in WV need a European model?? Somebody messed up, so now I have to send this back and wait another week or so for them to send me another one....very disappointed.  :(</li>
            <li> This product works very well for both gel and regular polish. The polish dries and remains chip free for much longer than air drying. It does get a bit hot after a while, but since the timer is only for 2 or 3 minutes, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> This lamp is great! I&#x27;m a working mother (2 babies) with very little time to even do my nails let alone let them dry and especially cure. Before I bought this lamp I would wait just enough time to do anything with my hands as was need just to dry, but not cure (no time). This would ALWAYS result in my nails getting nicked, scrunched, smudged, you name it and I would whine endlessly. Very frustrating! Since having the lamp, I don&#x27;t need to worry about that because this lamp drys your nails quickly in between coats (even glitter polish!) and cures them after the top coat! My nails haven&#x27;t been ruined since! Although, this lamp is described to have a  2 min, and then an infinite mode, and then also described to have a 2min and a 3min mode. This lamp ACTUALLY has a 120sec mode (2min) and an infintie mode (no timer), so you dont have to watch the clock for your nails to dry in between coats, but you DO for your nails to cure (at least 3 min). It does get a little warm in there, but certainly not hot (be sure to take off the protective film on the outside after you get it so the lamps are properly vented). I also noticed a little bit (hardly noticeable) of a vibration when the lamp is on. While this is kind of an annoyance, it&#x27;s not enough to really bother me. I really loved that there are 2 bulbs on the top and 2 bulbs on the side, this helps A LOT with your pinky and thumb nails. Overall, not only would I recommend this to ANY woman, whether they are nail freaks like me or not, but I would also (and plan to) give this as a gift to my nail-enthusiast friends and family. If you&#x27;re like me, with no time to wait for nails to cure, this is an absolute MUST HAVE! What are you waiting for? Buy it already! :)</li>
            <li> First unit I bought had a faulty bulb that caused the whole unit to not light up. Still powered on but was useless. Amazon sent a new one and took back the old. 2nd unit has worked the 2 times I&#x27;ve used it for shellac gel polish. cures it just like the real thing - good buy</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive my new UV gel curing lamp.  And imagine my disappointment when I opened the boxes of bulbs and found one shattered.  I would send it back, but it&#x27;s not worth the trouble.  I had to spend an extra $35 to buy another bulb (they only come in packages of 3).  Packaging of delicated and expensive bulbs was awful, so I gave it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> READ THIS TO SAVE YOURSELF TIME! DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT!  My sis-in-law had given me a gel manicure with her USPICY uv lamp so I was excited to buy one.  I got on Amazon- because they have great customer service.  The product page said the seller was \\&quot;Sunvalley Tek\\&quot;, fulfilled by amazon. When I checked out the actual order page said HUI RONG WU was the seller.  When it shipped- the email said the seller was \\&quot;BABYTREE\\&quot;  I was confused.  I had read one other reviewer saying hers looked \\&quot;generic\\&quot; so I was curious to see if this one would look like my sis-in-laws (AND LIKE THE PRODUCT PICTURE ON AMAZON!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT CAME IN A GENERIC white BOX LOOKING JUST LIKE A GENERIC &amp; DIDN&#x27;T INCLUDE THE STUPID NAIL FILE- no USPICY ANYTHING.  I proceeded to get on ebay and buy from TRUSTPICK b/c that is where my sis-in-law got hers.  Then at checkout it said payment received by SUNVALLEYTEK!  I was so confused I googled sunvalleytek&#x27;s phone number, called them, and a very nice customer service person explained that someone is hijacking their name somehow on amazon.  She confirmed that my ebay purchase was actually the real deal from them and I could rest easy.  I don&#x27;t normally spend time doing reviews but it really ticks me off when I buy something trusting I will get it as the picture shows and it is completely different.  FALSE ADVERTISING AMAZON!!!!</li>
            <li> Did anyone recieve random beads with this? I opened the box and tucked inside of the light were 4 bags that contain 50 beads each.... the beads all have different disigns on them but they are huge and can&#x27;t have anything to do with nails... nowhere on the box or anythign are these beads mentioned... very strange!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this lamp. Upon opening the package, I noticed there were no bulbs included with the lamp. I re-read what the lamp came equipped with, and the UV bulbs were definitely included in the description. Very disappointed. I don&#x27;t want to return the lamp itself, I just want the bulbs that were supposed to be included!</li>
            <li> This works awesome!  I usually have to set the timer twice for the top coat, but that only adds a couple of minutes to the dry time.  I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I am smitten with shellac manicures and was so glad to find a reasonably priced UV lamp on amazon.com.  This lamp arrived faster than expected and works exactly as expected. I am able to do my own shellac manicures now! Since I consider this to be a mini-tanning bed for my hands, I apply a drop of sunscreen to the back of my hands a few minutes before using the UV lamp - don&#x27;t need any extra age spots! :)</li>
            <li> I followed all of the instructions, but the lamp was defective.  It never turned on.  This is the first time I purchased something from Amazon that was defective.  However, I am able to return it for a refund.  But the inconvenience is very annoying - and I purchased the UV lamp to do my gel nails tonight, so I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> Do NOT waste your money on this piece of JUNK!  Initially it worked, but one of the lights was always loose from the start.  Every time I used it I had to adjust it to get it to light. This was very aggravating. Thinking that I would just buy a new light bulb for that slot, I kept the device, hoping that a new light bulb would stay in place.  BIG MISTAKE! After a couple of weeks, I couldn&#x27;t get the light bulb to stay in place at all and therefore that light bulb would no longer stay lit.  Then one evening, the on/off switch quit working.  Rather than snap on when I turned it on, the switch would just flop back and forth and the entire apparatus would no longer light. Now since it is one week past the date where I can get a full refund (which is 6 weeks), I have to send it back, pay for the postage myself and take a partial reimbursement for this hunk of junk.  I have never had a problem with anything I have bought through Amazon.com, but I will think twice before ordering any electrical device from Amazon.com.  [[ASIN:B003XP0JIW USpicy 36W Nail UV Lamp Acrylic Gel CURING Light TIMER 36 WATT]]</li>
            <li> Very excited to get this in the mail only to discover that the fuse connection was broken and would not turn on. It was the last piece to my do it at home puzzle and am very sad. I am going to buy a lamp from Sally Beauty Supply and see if I have better luck. Amazon was wonderful with the refund and return.</li>
            <li> Great product, quick service.  Wish it had better instructions. . . .but maybe it doesn&#x27;t need it.  I have experience with these products, but had I not, better instructions/care guide would&#x27;ve been nice.</li>
            <li> I have only used the lamp twice so far, but from what I can tell it works great.  I only used the 2 minute setting while curing the shellac and it worked really well. I know some people said their bulbs didn&#x27;t work, but that wasn&#x27;t the case with mine.  Everything is in working order!</li>
            <li> I love this dryer! It was easy to put the bulbs in and operating it is a breeze. Works for gel polish and regular polish. The only down side to this is the bulbs get a little hot and I&#x27;m worried I&#x27;ll burn myself if I&#x27;m not careful.</li>
            <li> My husband purchased this for me as a Christmas present because I was always whining when I smudged my nails. His heart was in the right place but THIS PRODUCT IS A SHAM! Not only did it fail to cure my nails, but my hands felt dry and tingly for hours! We are very disappointed in this product and I will just have to stick to letting my nails air-dry.</li>
            <li> I purchased this lamp as an upgrade to the 9w that I had previously and it is much better.  The timer lets you not have to watch a clock which is nice.  The only downside to it is that it does get a little warm in there and I like to let my nails cure a little longer than recommended.  For the price, this is an excellent choice but the more expensive ones do come with a cooling function.</li>
            <li> This light arrived quickly.  It has a timer for 2 or 3 minutes.  It sets the polish just like in the salon.  I like the slide out tray so I can place my fingers correctly and then slide them in without worrying about touching the sides and messing up the polish.</li>
            <li> Product arrived promptly, however light didn&#x27;t turn on.  Seller wrote promptly stating it could be defective and would send new one.  Figured out how to work unit..needs better directions...happy with product!! and seller! I would recommend them again!</li>
            <li> I just receieved this in the mail and was so excited to use it. BUT I cant get it to turn on.  It seems pretty easy.  WHy doesnt it work&gt;?  AND now I cant find out where I even get help from!?</li>
            <li> THis product is an awesome buy and you gain your money back with 3 polish changes. Where I am the manicure and gel polish is $25 or $30 with tip. I did a plain polish change for $18 or $20 with tip. I figured a one time buy with the products and a couple polishes would save me money in the long run and I can change my polish when I feel like it. Eventually buying multiple colors can be a small investment but if you include family members who want their nails done and charge $5 you are making a profit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to the review the lamp works awesome. THe time limits are great and everything really just flies by when you are watching a tv show or something. I would recommend getting this lamp that is a lot cheaper and more profitable.</li>
            <li> Just received this nail lamp in the mail....as a few others have stated....it came with the wrong plug.  The plug was a 2 pin Japanese plug, I believe, regardless, can not be used in US households!  I am returning for a refund and already bought a different brand.</li>
            <li> Item box was open. It was not new. Manual and nail file were missing from the package. Plug was European 2 pin style rather than US 2 pin as described and the timer was different to description.</li>
            <li> It took me a while to decide on a lamp to buy. I got this one because the price was reasonable (compared to the over $100.00 items), the watts were high, it has a timer and the reviews were good. I have used this item to cure my Gelish nails about 8-10 times and it works perfectly. If you are looking for a great UV lamp at a low price this is it.</li>
            <li> I guess, it is not USpicy Nail Dryer Ger UV Lamp, I&#x60;ve got a lamp without manual and  Free Nail Sanding file. Also tehre is no Auto timer control: 180s, only 120s...</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 of these UV lamps because I wanted to start doing my own nails at home. The lamps are the same ones used at the salons. They work great but still trying to figure out how the timer works. I think there are 3 settings: 120 secs, 180 secs and infinity. Nevertheless, I&#x27;ve saved a lot of money doing my own nails.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected. Works great and actually arrived early! Very happy with this light. Totally recommend this light to manicurist. Great price too!</li>
            <li> Items seems to quite nice and works well.  Like the timer feature.  Item is larger than I had thought; but, it will work on feet as well as hand.</li>
            <li> Just got it but had used a friends and loved it, h opefuuly mine will be just as good....we well see</li>
            <li> I purchased this so that I could do my own gelish gel nail polish. You have to put the lights in yourself, however, this is super easy and I don&#x27;t think you should ever need a manual for that. It does come with a small sheet that gives general info like what kind of lights you need if you have to replace them. Remember to switch it over to the three min. timer for the last coat(top it off) so that your manicure lasts for the full 2 weeks. I wish that it had a one min. timer along with the 2 and 3 min timer. However, for the price difference between uv lights that have this feature and this one, it&#x27;s well worth the compromise. I actually leave my foundation coat in there for the full 2 min even though the instructions say only one min. It&#x27;s just easier to leave them in longer and so far my manicures have lasted around 2 weeks, once I got the hang of it. Satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I used this lamp for the first time today.  I got it in my head to try DIY gel nails and it calls for a UV lamp.  After reading reviews of the different kinds available, I chose this one.  It was delivered in 2 days (Yay, Amazon Prime!) in perfect condition, all 4 bulbs intact.  I put it together in a minute and a half - VERY easy - and got my supplies to \\&quot;start gelling\\&quot;.  LOL  (More on the gel polish kit soon - will wait two weeks to give fair results - day one -  perfect!).  Anyway - I used the light, 30-60 seconds each time, depending on application, and my nails were totally dry after each time.  When I was finished after the last use - I immediately washed my hands and started dinner.  NO SMUDGES!!  It was MUCH better than the salon dryers I used when I used to get acrylic nails years ago.  :o)</li>
            <li> I received this \\&quot;US version\\&quot; nail lamp in the mail and it had a japanese plug! I obviously do not have any japanese outlets in my house, so I had to return it. Super frustrating since it was advertised as U.S. version. Whatever USpicy.</li>
            <li> The lamp arrived quickly.  Installing the bulbs was a breeze and even though I was a bit tentative after reading reviews where the bulbs didn&#x27;t work, when I switched it on it worked great.  I have used it a couple of times so far and have had no problems.</li>
            <li> Purchased this and I love it! I read the other reviews and found this one to be the best and it was!</li>
            <li> I just got it in the mail but I can&#x27;t figure out how to turn it on. I put the bulbs in mess with the buttons and nothing. Can anyone help me? :) please</li>
            <li> Worked great and is exactly as show in picture (few small dings in metal tray)</li>
            <li> I bought this and got my first one with a broken reflector.  They replaces super fast and easy.  I have used this 20+ times and LOVE it.  I have recommoned this product to ALL my friends.</li>
