    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Very good quality floss holders that save time and money when flossing your teeth.  </li>
            <li>This thing is great.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>great price, great product.</li>
            <li>Good product, both design and performance</li>
            <li>I hjad been using the GUM/Bulter flossers and liked them  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and makes flossing a breeze.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with everything.</li>
            <li>For years, this has been my favorite floss holder.  </li>
            <li>My order was processed and shipped very quickly, and it arrived much more quickly than I would have anticipated.</li>
            <li>Because these make flossing convenient, I do it twice daily and as a result my good dental health saves thousands of dollars in dental work that is avoided by brushing and flossing.</li>
            <li>It is just so much easier and faster to floss the good old fashioned way.</li>
            <li>outstanding quality--far better than earlier verisons</li>
            <li>Yes, they break once in awhile, but they are worth it.</li>
            <li>My experience is that flossing without these is a waste of time; these holders make flossing quick, easy and effective.  </li>
            <li>Then you go through the motions of stringing it up, go to floss, and as you pull the flosser away the floss falls right off.</li>
            <li>so I do it much more regularly.</li>
            <li>Work exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>They are exactly what I need.  </li>
            <li>Large, fits adult hands easily.</li>
            <li>works pretty much as advertised...</li>
            <li>This makes it much easier</li>
            <li>I had to use more floss than normal and it kept coming loose.</li>
            <li>I thought it might be too wide to use comfortably but that hasn&#x27;t been a problem either.</li>
            <li>I got this in hopes that I could save some plastic from going to the landfill by switching from the disposable flossers, but I&#x27;ve gone right back to using them.</li>
            <li>The Flossaid works as well, is easy to find on Amazon, and costs less.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the GUM brand floss holder, it works OK but is too small for me ...</li>
            <li>I mean, the thing is huge.</li>

            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> The knob on the handle on mine doesn&#x27;t even tighten, it just turns pointlessly.</li>
            <li> I have very tightly spaced teeth and flossing by hand is difficult.</li>
            <li> Absolutely useless!!</li>

            <li> This thing is great. I have very tightly spaced teeth and flossing by hand is difficult. This makes it much easier so I do it much more regularly. As long as you properly tension the floss when you put it on, there are no problems with it popping off or anything like that. I thought it might be too wide to use comfortably but that hasn&#x27;t been a problem either.</li>
            <li> Garbage, threw them in the trash.  Absolutely useless!!</li>
            <li> I have used this FlossAid holder since 1976. Yes, they break once in awhile, but they are worth it. I&#x27;ve tried the GUM brand floss holder, it works OK but is too small for me ... oh, and given time they will break too. I use waxed tape. You can use the floss you please. Great product.</li>
            <li> Tank you for you order.</li>
            <li> It is just so much easier and faster to floss the good old fashioned way. I had to use more floss than normal and it kept coming loose.</li>
            <li> Floss keeps coming off the groove. Flimsy plastic.</li>
            <li> outstanding quality--far better than earlier verisons</li>
            <li> Work exactly as advertised. Well made. Large, fits adult hands easily.</li>
            <li> works pretty much as advertised... had to use it a couple of times to get the hang of it; now it&#x27;s my go to floss aid ... seems to be made from a durable plastic that should last if not abused... would recommend it to someone with floss finger issues and a little patience...</li>
            <li> I hjad been using the GUM/Bulter flossers and liked them  But they break after a few months.  They have also become more expensive and harder to find.

            <li> They were delivered ahead of schedule. I&#x27;m pleased with everything.</li>
            <li> For years, this has been my favorite floss holder.  It is very easy to use and makes flossing a breeze.  My order was processed and shipped very quickly, and it arrived much more quickly than I would have anticipated.</li>
            <li> Just as promised and timely.</li>
            <li> The tongs at the end are ridiculously wide spaced. I mean, the thing is huge.

            <li> I have bought these before.  They are exactly what I need.  I like the product, and it comes just as advertised.</li>
            <li> great price, great product.</li>
