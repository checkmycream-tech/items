            <li>Awesome.</li>
            <li>Even when I use shaving cream it does not give the best shave.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product.  </li>
            <li>With this type of shave head, it&#x27;s not just the ease and convenience of the all-in-one lubricant plus blades, it&#x27;s that the shave is so incredibly close</li>
            <li>Good price!</li>
            <li>Great razors because I no longer get razor burn.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not been happy with how this package of blades has performed.</li>

            <li>Good product for a close shave.</li>
            <li>good product just pricey</li>
            <li>Good product and value</li>
            <li>Get each person their own interchangeable handle and order shaving heads in bulk!&lt;br /&gt;These are my favorites, they have the built in shaving cream and it makes for great one step shaving, even for teenagers!&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>The blade does give a good shave.</li>
            <li>Gel bar dissolves before razor is no longer good, so you still have to use soap or gel to shave.</li>
            <li>I tell all my friends and they have all went to using this too and as excited as I am about telling everyone how awesome these are.</li>
            <li>Make my legs feel great after I&#x27;m done:) I get a shipment every 3 months just</li>
            <li>Purchased these on accident and love them!</li>
            <li>I love these razors!</li>
            <li>Love them and will continue getting them!</li>
            <li>I love these razor blades!</li>
            <li>I love the Venus Breeze Blades and it&#x27;s cheaper to buy through Amazon than at the store!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this razor!</li>
            <li>I love these refills and bought them online cheaper than what they sell for in the department stores!  </li>
            <li>Love the Breeze!</li>
            <li>This is the perfect concept for someone who doesnt have much time to shave.  </li>
            <li>So nice not to have to wrestle these out of the thief proof contraption at CVS.</li>
            <li>I tried the Olay ones, but the shave is not as nice</li>
            <li>Nice Idea, and have tried these and the embrace razors but the thickness of the moisturizing areas on the edges prevent a close shave,</li>
            <li>I was able to score these for a good price and saved some money by ordering from this supplier.</li>
            <li>The 2 lotion strips make shaving a nice experience.</li>
            <li>Brilliant to put the shaving cream right on razorhead.</li>
            <li>Great product, moisturizes well and gives a clean shave.</li>
            <li>this is perfect for traveling and normal use.  </li>
            <li>Work great not a bad price either</li>
            <li>These blades are great, the gel bar does disappear quickly.</li>
            <li>They were perfect for my sensitive skin, and allowed for a close shave without risk of knicks or razor burn.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Recommend them to anyone wanting a nice, smooth shave!</li>
            <li>This is the first product I&#x27;ve not been happy with purchased through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>These are great for the first 2 to 3 shaves depending on how course/fine your hair is.</li>
            <li>Great for the first week, but plan on replacing them often.  </li>
            <li>Very smooth on my legs and never had a problem with nicks.</li>
            <li>Very, very smooth, and each one lasts me two weeks.  </li>
            <li>Good product idea but the gel bars get used up and fall up relatively quickly.  </li>
            <li>So, even though these were a great price (got a large rebate), will not be using the rest of the cartridges, and will be buying something else.</li>
            <li>I love not having to use a shaving gel or soap.</li>
            <li>so I assume the Breeze would be even better.  </li>
            <li>love this product, as we camp all summer.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>and so I would rather buy these razors and save the time of lathering up :)  </li>
            <li>Love that these razors allow you to shave in one step - no shave gel needed.  </li>
            <li>:).</li>
            <li>Will be buying more when we run out.</li>
            <li>Helps keep things smooth, reduces bumps, and is nice sometimes if separate shaving cream isn&#x27;t available!</li>
            <li>The shave is extremely smooth and they are so convenient!</li>
            <li>You could probably get a lot more shaves out of it if it stayed on longer.</li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>i love the convenience of not having to buy shaving cream and separate razors.</li>
            <li>I love that is</li>
            <li>I love these razors.  </li>
            <li>Love the razors.</li>
            <li>I love the convenience of these razors.</li>
            <li>I am glad I made the switch.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all of these different razors and blades and these are the best.</li>
            <li>but I love these Venus blades.</li>
            <li>The top and bottom of razor blade have a soapy piece on them.  </li>
            <li>Love this razor and blades that glide over my skin.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, nice to have gel on razor for a smooth finish.</li>
            <li>These ones work much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to keep them going for about two months by not storing my razor in the shower and by turning the water off while I shave my legs, it decreases the amount of wear on them.</li>
            <li>and I love the moisturizing strips.</li>
            <li>I like the way these razors work, and it&#x27;s a better price than you&#x27;ll find at most retailers.  </li>
            <li>Are you supposed to be able to use these razors without shaving cream?  </li>
            <li>Personally, these are the best ones for me</li>
            <li>Have them on my subscription series so save even more.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite razor blades.</li>
            <li>This is an OK razor.</li>
            <li>Love not shaving with cream-</li>
            <li>When I first started using these, I loved them.  </li>
            <li>Okay, you can get cut easily.</li>
            <li>The saying time is money is very true</li>
            <li>This problem can be alleviated by lathering up like you normally would before you shave (the razor is still good).</li>
            <li>I love how smooth her legs are</li>
            <li>I love the replacement razors - get a smooth shave</li>
            <li>I love these blades, they&#x27;ve been my favorite for quite some time, but they wear out way too quick, one blade lasts maybe one week.</li>
            <li>Easy to order and were delivered without issue.</li>
            <li>but it still weathers very quickly.</li>
            <li>I also find the shipping convenient and easy.</li>
            <li>It does not give a close shave in the best of conditions, but once the pads are uneven, it&#x27;s even more problematic.</li>
            <li>When I got them home, I discovered they fit my existing Venus razor just fine.</li>
            <li>I bought a huge pack of these blades and its been a disaster.  </li>
            <li>It is comfortable and gives legs a close shave.</li>
            <li>These are great if you are strapped for time/in a rush, or perhaps if you have mobility issues/ as they eliminate the step of applying standard shaving cream</li>
            <li>They leave your legs feeling soo smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>These razors leave your legs smooth without drying them out.</li>
            <li>The smooth soapy cream goes on before the blade touches.  </li>
            <li>Never have razor bumps on my smooth legs.</li>
            <li>But worth every dollar :-)</li>
            <li>These razours give a smooth shave as advertised and don&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>You are paying for quality here, and to me, having smooth skin and</li>
            <li>They leave your legs smooth with no nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li>so far so good</li>
            <li>and I very rarely ever get razor burn.</li>
            <li>I love that you don&#x27;t need shaving cream with this razor which makes shaving super quick.</li>
            <li>ended up scraping off the gel with a knife before using, so they are just like normal razors, and that made them work a lot better!</li>
            <li>When new it gives a nice close comfortable shave with no burn.</li>
            <li>These razors always do a great job and the little glider strips keep me from getting razor rash and my legs come out silky smooth!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve nicked myself a couple of  times but that&#x27;s because I kept going over and over the area trying to get that clean bikini look</li>
            <li>This gives me a clean, close shave.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Venus blades for years and expected the buy on Amazon would make for a great buy.  </li>
            <li>The gel leaves my legs feeling nice and soft.</li>
            <li>BUT the saying you get what you pay for is extremely true in this case.</li>
            <li>so you can either toss or go back to shaving cream because the blades are still good.</li>
            <li>These are my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use on bikini line, good for legs and underarms only.</li>
            <li>As someone who has tried several brands of razors (and not just the cheap disposable kind) I can say that these are my favorites.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and item is as described.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite, provide so much more moisture than the regular Venus blades.</li>
            <li>The new generation of Venus prevents that for a couple bucks more.</li>
            <li>I love the razor when it is brand new.</li>
            <li>works pretty well, but the gel ends come off when there is still a good bit left.</li>
            <li>do a great job of cutting close, giving a smooth shave - love the gel bars on both sides of the blades!</li>
            <li>My overall favorite ones are the pink ones but these are just as great.</li>
            <li>It is worth the price to not have the razor burn</li>
            <li>I will say however, something about the design of these razors leaves me with fewer/to no nicks unlike standard razors, so these also might be ideal for that younger set of gals who are just learning to shave, as they may have fewer cuts from these...sort of like a learning curve razor.</li>
            <li>no razor burn is worth it for me.</li>
            <li>The perfumed scene is pretty mild and doesn&#x27;t seem too overpowering.</li>
            <li>I saw it, the price was right, it arrived.</li>
            <li>The shipment did come on time, but they fell apart very easily, the moisturizing strips fell off after the second day, so they did not work as they are advertised.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it ;)</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like as far as sharpness of blade but very quick, good shave!</li>
            <li>so I got 2 more for just a little more.</li>
            <li>I usually go through about one razor every 2 weeks, shaving everything really good once a week and touchups throughout the week as needed... really not bad at all.</li>
            <li>The Best Shaver Ever invented imagine Not needing all that messy shaving foam/creme!!!!</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re ready to go!</li>
            <li>I will not be purchasing any more replacement blades except from my local walk-in businesses.  </li>
            <li>Until they make a razor better than this one, I will continue to only use this razor.</li>
            <li>My only suggestion/complaint is that I wish the gel bar lasted for more uses.  </li>
            <li>Very Convenient!  </li>
            <li>Areas where the hair is more coarse - I&#x27;ve had to using shaving cream to prevent getting any razor bumps/ingrown</li>
            <li>The shave is pretty close</li>
            <li>They work great and as long as you keep them out of the shower they last a day or longer for me.</li>
            <li>I have used many different types of razors over the years for my legs and underarms.  </li>
            <li>I have an extremely sensitive skin but this grides so smoothly, I don&#x27;t even need shaving cream or gel with this.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I can buy one product and eliminate the need to buy shaving cream AND razors, which never seemed to run out at the same time for me.  </li>
            <li>Tried other copy-cat kind they wear out faster...</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found that I cut myself more with this blade, but the bottom line is it is only effective for a few uses</li>
            <li>i have used this product for a long  time you have it cheeper and more quanity than in the stores.</li>
            <li>The gooey moisturizer tips wear out pretty fast if you leave the razor in the shower, but we put ours in the medicine cabinet to prevent that now</li>
            <li>I love these little cartridges :) they are easy to change out and help me not get the razor bumps that other razors give.</li>
            <li>They last about a week each and are easy to change out when needed.  </li>
            <li>These blades are safer to use than other brands, smooth, clean shave.</li>
            <li>The moisturizing pads feel nice on my legs (and also quite slimy), but they somehow make it impossible to get a good shave.</li>
            <li>For clumsy people like me who also have sensitive skin, these raesors are a great choice.</li>
            <li>Venus is a fave razor of mine because they seem to really know what we need for our curves.</li>
            <li>And you can really just quite the shaving cream because it&#x27;s already there, on the blade.</li>
            <li>However, they don&#x27;t shave very closely</li>
            <li>the soapy things on there and my legs feel so much smoother after.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I like the razor blades as your legs are left silky smooth</li>
            <li>It saves from having to use as much body wash.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>I like these so much</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;ve started not doing so well with sensitive skin (like underarms) and cuts become more likely at this stage.</li>
            <li>A little sharp at first use, but they are a great deal.</li>
            <li>They fit, exactly what was expected.</li>
            <li>They are very gentle on the legs as I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>So what you are left with is a razor with NO lubrication, and you end up having to use soap or shaving cream anyway if you want to get the full life out of your blade.  </li>
            <li>it fits my old school venus razor from when they first came out.  </li>
            <li>I do prefer a 5 blade razor, but for only 3 blades it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>Makes shaving so much more less of a hassle.</li>
            <li>I have not tried the Olay ones that are made to fit the same shavers, but I assume they are very much the same.</li>
            <li>so I can see why this is priced high, but still not a fan of the price.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>so you have to shave more frequently and they are not good for your bikini line at all -- I ended up having to buy the original Gillette razers specifically for that area.  </li>
            <li>Have extremely sensitive skin and tolerate these very well.  </li>
            <li>and it keeps longer then when it&#x27;s normally in the shower all the time.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these overall if you want a fine shave, or you&#x27;ll be replacing these cartridges about once a week, and in comparison to cream/standard razors they aren&#x27;t inexpensive, nor are they quality enough to be worth the high overall cost.</li>
            <li>my legs would be far less scarred. :)</li>
            <li>The only thing I have noticed is that they wear out more quickly than other standard razor refills (the shaving cream bars specifically).</li>
            <li>I would recommend this razor &amp; blade to anyone who wants a close, smooth shave (with a little caution).</li>
            <li>This is my new razor</li>
            <li>We use various versions of the Venus razor depending on our needs and we all like them very much.  </li>
            <li>After that the soap/strip seems to wear out quick and or the blades dull quite quickly.</li>
            <li>Also, you get a close shave with no bloody mess.</li>
            <li>The blades aren&#x27;t totally dull yet and could be used more</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>If it wasnt for that I would be in complete heaven.</li>
            <li>The pieces of soap above the blades really help me with not getting any cuts.  </li>
            <li>recetly introduced my 12 year old daughter to them...</li>
            <li>My legs feel so soft with these blades.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if they were cheaper, given that each blade seems to last through only a few leg shavings before the gel is gone.</li>
            <li>The lotion part doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would normally keep a razor, but still worth it.</li>
            <li>Unlike a different brand that is big and bulky these are slim and give you just the right amount of gel to shave.</li>
            <li>Also, if you can avoid it getting wet when other people shower, even better.</li>
            <li>I love these blades for the convenience (no cream necessary!), but they definitely don&#x27;t last long, and I find that I can&#x27;t get as close a shave as I can with a regular blade.</li>
            <li>If you have tried and failed at shaving the dreaded &amp;#34;bikini&amp;#34; area, these will do the trick with no irritation unless of course you are sensitive to scented products, and if you are, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re already aware of it.</li>
            <li>First off, these are the most expensive razors I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>Top disappears faster than the bottom and that&#x27;s not good</li>
            <li>I like not having to lather with shaving cream first; you just wet the razor</li>
            <li>I have tried a new Breeze blade 5 or 6 times and have now given up entirely.  </li>
            <li>The razors are okay, but the weird semi-solid gel stuff curls up &amp; falls off before I&#x27;m ready to change out the razor head.  </li>
            <li>These make life so much easier if you have to shave every single day.  </li>
            <li>I have been using these every other day or so since they first came out</li>
            <li>The razor head is too large to shave carefully on bikini line.</li>
            <li>A little pricey, but well worth it.</li>
            <li>They are a little pricey but worth the money.</li>
            <li>I like the convenience of not having to use shave gel and the fact that these blades don&#x27;t knick my sensitive skin or leave any razor bumps/burn, but given how fast they wear out, it&#x27;s just not worth the cost anymore.</li>
            <li>I am throwing them away and going back to my old brand</li>
            <li>I shave almost daily, and one razor head will last me nearly a month.</li>
            <li>Now since I bought these no dry skin either.  </li>
            <li>but this razor actually makes it better rather than worse.</li>
            <li>After 2 shaves of legs only the gel strips are pretty much down to nothing</li>
            <li>First of all, the gel bars fall off after a few uses (and it just doesn&#x27;t work with only one gel bar), well before the blade itself is worn out, and with the cost of cartridges</li>
            <li>The top lotion pad fell off in the first few uses of this blade, and at that point, the razor becomes difficult to use.</li>
            <li>The razor blade packing was very difficult to open (as compared with previous Venus Breeze packages) and the gel on the top and bottom of the razor was loose and breaks off easily.  </li>
            <li>My only caveat (and not enough to bring the rating down) is that the gel on the rayzers wears down quickly.</li>
            <li>Works great for about a week and then become dull and useless.</li>

            <li> Excellent product.  </li>
            <li> With this type of shave head, it&#x27;s not just the ease and convenience of the all-in-one lubricant plus blades, it&#x27;s that the shave is so incredibly close</li>

            <li> Great razors because I no longer get razor burn.</li>

            <li> good product just pricey</li>
            <li> Good product and value</li>
            <li> Get each person their own interchangeable handle and order shaving heads in bulk!&lt;br /&gt;These are my favorites, they have the built in shaving cream and it makes for great one step shaving, even for teenagers!&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> The blade does give a good shave.</li>
            <li> Gel bar dissolves before razor is no longer good, so you still have to use soap or gel to shave.</li>
            <li> I tell all my friends and they have all went to using this too and as excited as I am about telling everyone how awesome these are.</li>
            <li> Make my legs feel great after I&#x27;m done:) I get a shipment every 3 months just</li>
            <li> Purchased these on accident and love them!</li>

            <li> Love them and will continue getting them!</li>
            <li> I love these razor blades!</li>
            <li> I love the Venus Breeze Blades and it&#x27;s cheaper to buy through Amazon than at the store!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this razor!</li>
            <li> I love these refills and bought them online cheaper than what they sell for in the department stores!  </li>
            <li> Love the Breeze!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect concept for someone who doesnt have much time to shave.  </li>
            <li> So nice not to have to wrestle these out of the thief proof contraption at CVS.</li>
            <li> I tried the Olay ones, but the shave is not as nice</li>
            <li> Nice Idea, and have tried these and the embrace razors but the thickness of the moisturizing areas on the edges prevent a close shave,</li>
            <li> I was able to score these for a good price and saved some money by ordering from this supplier.</li>
            <li> The 2 lotion strips make shaving a nice experience.</li>
            <li> Brilliant to put the shaving cream right on razorhead.</li>
            <li> Great product, moisturizes well and gives a clean shave.</li>
            <li> this is perfect for traveling and normal use.  </li>
            <li> Work great not a bad price either</li>
            <li> These blades are great, the gel bar does disappear quickly.</li>
            <li> They were perfect for my sensitive skin, and allowed for a close shave without risk of knicks or razor burn.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Recommend them to anyone wanting a nice, smooth shave!</li>
            <li> This is the first product I&#x27;ve not been happy with purchased through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> These are great for the first 2 to 3 shaves depending on how course/fine your hair is.</li>
            <li> Great for the first week, but plan on replacing them often.  </li>
            <li> Very smooth on my legs and never had a problem with nicks.</li>
            <li> Very, very smooth, and each one lasts me two weeks.  </li>
            <li> Good product idea but the gel bars get used up and fall up relatively quickly.  </li>
            <li> So, even though these were a great price (got a large rebate), will not be using the rest of the cartridges, and will be buying something else.</li>
            <li> I love not having to use a shaving gel or soap.</li>
            <li> so I assume the Breeze would be even better.  </li>
            <li> love this product, as we camp all summer.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> and so I would rather buy these razors and save the time of lathering up :)  </li>
            <li> Love that these razors allow you to shave in one step - no shave gel needed.  </li>
            <li> :).</li>
            <li> Will be buying more when we run out.</li>
            <li> Helps keep things smooth, reduces bumps, and is nice sometimes if separate shaving cream isn&#x27;t available!</li>
            <li> The shave is extremely smooth and they are so convenient!</li>
            <li> You could probably get a lot more shaves out of it if it stayed on longer.</li>
            <li> and I love them.</li>
            <li> Love these.</li>
            <li> i love the convenience of not having to buy shaving cream and separate razors.</li>
            <li> I love that is</li>
            <li> I love these razors.  </li>
            <li> Love the razors.</li>
            <li> I love the convenience of these razors.</li>
            <li> I am glad I made the switch.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all of these different razors and blades and these are the best.</li>
            <li> but I love these Venus blades.</li>
            <li> The top and bottom of razor blade have a soapy piece on them.  </li>
            <li> Love this razor and blades that glide over my skin.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, nice to have gel on razor for a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> These ones work much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to keep them going for about two months by not storing my razor in the shower and by turning the water off while I shave my legs, it decreases the amount of wear on them.</li>
            <li> and I love the moisturizing strips.</li>
            <li> I like the way these razors work, and it&#x27;s a better price than you&#x27;ll find at most retailers.  </li>
            <li> Are you supposed to be able to use these razors without shaving cream?  </li>
            <li> Personally, these are the best ones for me</li>
            <li> Have them on my subscription series so save even more.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite razor blades.</li>
            <li> This is an OK razor.</li>
            <li> Love not shaving with cream-</li>
            <li> When I first started using these, I loved them.  </li>
            <li> Okay, you can get cut easily.</li>
            <li> The saying time is money is very true</li>
            <li> This problem can be alleviated by lathering up like you normally would before you shave (the razor is still good).</li>
            <li> I love how smooth her legs are</li>
            <li> I love the replacement razors - get a smooth shave</li>
            <li> I love these blades, they&#x27;ve been my favorite for quite some time, but they wear out way too quick, one blade lasts maybe one week.</li>
            <li> Easy to order and were delivered without issue.</li>
            <li> but it still weathers very quickly.</li>
            <li> I also find the shipping convenient and easy.</li>
            <li> It does not give a close shave in the best of conditions, but once the pads are uneven, it&#x27;s even more problematic.</li>
            <li> When I got them home, I discovered they fit my existing Venus razor just fine.</li>
            <li> I bought a huge pack of these blades and its been a disaster.  </li>
            <li> It is comfortable and gives legs a close shave.</li>
            <li> These are great if you are strapped for time/in a rush, or perhaps if you have mobility issues/ as they eliminate the step of applying standard shaving cream</li>
            <li> They leave your legs feeling soo smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li> These razors leave your legs smooth without drying them out.</li>
            <li> The smooth soapy cream goes on before the blade touches.  </li>
            <li> Never have razor bumps on my smooth legs.</li>
            <li> But worth every dollar :-)</li>
            <li> These razours give a smooth shave as advertised and don&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> You are paying for quality here, and to me, having smooth skin and</li>
            <li> They leave your legs smooth with no nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> so far so good</li>
            <li> and I very rarely ever get razor burn.</li>
            <li> I love that you don&#x27;t need shaving cream with this razor which makes shaving super quick.</li>
            <li> ended up scraping off the gel with a knife before using, so they are just like normal razors, and that made them work a lot better!</li>
            <li> When new it gives a nice close comfortable shave with no burn.</li>
            <li> These razors always do a great job and the little glider strips keep me from getting razor rash and my legs come out silky smooth!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve nicked myself a couple of  times but that&#x27;s because I kept going over and over the area trying to get that clean bikini look</li>
            <li> This gives me a clean, close shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Venus blades for years and expected the buy on Amazon would make for a great buy.  </li>
            <li> The gel leaves my legs feeling nice and soft.</li>
            <li> BUT the saying you get what you pay for is extremely true in this case.</li>
            <li> so you can either toss or go back to shaving cream because the blades are still good.</li>
            <li> These are my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use on bikini line, good for legs and underarms only.</li>
            <li> As someone who has tried several brands of razors (and not just the cheap disposable kind) I can say that these are my favorites.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and item is as described.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite, provide so much more moisture than the regular Venus blades.</li>
            <li> The new generation of Venus prevents that for a couple bucks more.</li>
            <li> I love the razor when it is brand new.</li>
            <li> works pretty well, but the gel ends come off when there is still a good bit left.</li>
            <li> do a great job of cutting close, giving a smooth shave - love the gel bars on both sides of the blades!</li>
            <li> My overall favorite ones are the pink ones but these are just as great.</li>
            <li> It is worth the price to not have the razor burn</li>
            <li> I will say however, something about the design of these razors leaves me with fewer/to no nicks unlike standard razors, so these also might be ideal for that younger set of gals who are just learning to shave, as they may have fewer cuts from these...sort of like a learning curve razor.</li>
            <li> no razor burn is worth it for me.</li>
            <li> The perfumed scene is pretty mild and doesn&#x27;t seem too overpowering.</li>
            <li> I saw it, the price was right, it arrived.</li>
            <li> The shipment did come on time, but they fell apart very easily, the moisturizing strips fell off after the second day, so they did not work as they are advertised.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it ;)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like as far as sharpness of blade but very quick, good shave!</li>
            <li> so I got 2 more for just a little more.</li>
            <li> I usually go through about one razor every 2 weeks, shaving everything really good once a week and touchups throughout the week as needed... really not bad at all.</li>
            <li> The Best Shaver Ever invented imagine Not needing all that messy shaving foam/creme!!!!</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re ready to go!</li>
            <li> I will not be purchasing any more replacement blades except from my local walk-in businesses.  </li>
            <li> Until they make a razor better than this one, I will continue to only use this razor.</li>
            <li> My only suggestion/complaint is that I wish the gel bar lasted for more uses.  </li>
            <li> Very Convenient!  </li>
            <li> Areas where the hair is more coarse - I&#x27;ve had to using shaving cream to prevent getting any razor bumps/ingrown</li>
            <li> The shave is pretty close</li>
            <li> They work great and as long as you keep them out of the shower they last a day or longer for me.</li>
            <li> I have used many different types of razors over the years for my legs and underarms.  </li>
            <li> I have an extremely sensitive skin but this grides so smoothly, I don&#x27;t even need shaving cream or gel with this.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I can buy one product and eliminate the need to buy shaving cream AND razors, which never seemed to run out at the same time for me.  </li>
            <li> Tried other copy-cat kind they wear out faster...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found that I cut myself more with this blade, but the bottom line is it is only effective for a few uses</li>
            <li> i have used this product for a long  time you have it cheeper and more quanity than in the stores.</li>
            <li> The gooey moisturizer tips wear out pretty fast if you leave the razor in the shower, but we put ours in the medicine cabinet to prevent that now</li>
            <li> I love these little cartridges :) they are easy to change out and help me not get the razor bumps that other razors give.</li>
            <li> They last about a week each and are easy to change out when needed.  </li>
            <li> These blades are safer to use than other brands, smooth, clean shave.</li>
            <li> The moisturizing pads feel nice on my legs (and also quite slimy), but they somehow make it impossible to get a good shave.</li>
            <li> For clumsy people like me who also have sensitive skin, these raesors are a great choice.</li>
            <li> Venus is a fave razor of mine because they seem to really know what we need for our curves.</li>
            <li> And you can really just quite the shaving cream because it&#x27;s already there, on the blade.</li>
            <li> However, they don&#x27;t shave very closely</li>
            <li> the soapy things on there and my legs feel so much smoother after.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I like the razor blades as your legs are left silky smooth</li>
            <li> It saves from having to use as much body wash.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> I like these so much</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;ve started not doing so well with sensitive skin (like underarms) and cuts become more likely at this stage.</li>
            <li> A little sharp at first use, but they are a great deal.</li>
            <li> They fit, exactly what was expected.</li>
            <li> They are very gentle on the legs as I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> So what you are left with is a razor with NO lubrication, and you end up having to use soap or shaving cream anyway if you want to get the full life out of your blade.  </li>
            <li> it fits my old school venus razor from when they first came out.  </li>
            <li> I do prefer a 5 blade razor, but for only 3 blades it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> Makes shaving so much more less of a hassle.</li>
            <li> I have not tried the Olay ones that are made to fit the same shavers, but I assume they are very much the same.</li>
            <li> so I can see why this is priced high, but still not a fan of the price.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> so you have to shave more frequently and they are not good for your bikini line at all -- I ended up having to buy the original Gillette razers specifically for that area.  </li>
            <li> Have extremely sensitive skin and tolerate these very well.  </li>
            <li> and it keeps longer then when it&#x27;s normally in the shower all the time.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these overall if you want a fine shave, or you&#x27;ll be replacing these cartridges about once a week, and in comparison to cream/standard razors they aren&#x27;t inexpensive, nor are they quality enough to be worth the high overall cost.</li>
            <li> my legs would be far less scarred. :)</li>
            <li> The only thing I have noticed is that they wear out more quickly than other standard razor refills (the shaving cream bars specifically).</li>
            <li> I would recommend this razor &amp; blade to anyone who wants a close, smooth shave (with a little caution).</li>
            <li> This is my new razor</li>
            <li> We use various versions of the Venus razor depending on our needs and we all like them very much.  </li>
            <li> After that the soap/strip seems to wear out quick and or the blades dull quite quickly.</li>
            <li> Also, you get a close shave with no bloody mess.</li>
            <li> The blades aren&#x27;t totally dull yet and could be used more</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> If it wasnt for that I would be in complete heaven.</li>
            <li> The pieces of soap above the blades really help me with not getting any cuts.  </li>
            <li> recetly introduced my 12 year old daughter to them...</li>
            <li> My legs feel so soft with these blades.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if they were cheaper, given that each blade seems to last through only a few leg shavings before the gel is gone.</li>
            <li> The lotion part doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would normally keep a razor, but still worth it.</li>
            <li> Unlike a different brand that is big and bulky these are slim and give you just the right amount of gel to shave.</li>
            <li> Also, if you can avoid it getting wet when other people shower, even better.</li>
            <li> I love these blades for the convenience (no cream necessary!), but they definitely don&#x27;t last long, and I find that I can&#x27;t get as close a shave as I can with a regular blade.</li>
            <li> If you have tried and failed at shaving the dreaded &amp;#34;bikini&amp;#34; area, these will do the trick with no irritation unless of course you are sensitive to scented products, and if you are, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re already aware of it.</li>
            <li> First off, these are the most expensive razors I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> Top disappears faster than the bottom and that&#x27;s not good</li>
            <li> I like not having to lather with shaving cream first; you just wet the razor</li>
            <li> I have tried a new Breeze blade 5 or 6 times and have now given up entirely.  </li>
            <li> The razors are okay, but the weird semi-solid gel stuff curls up &amp; falls off before I&#x27;m ready to change out the razor head.  </li>
            <li> These make life so much easier if you have to shave every single day.  </li>
            <li> I have been using these every other day or so since they first came out</li>
            <li> The razor head is too large to shave carefully on bikini line.</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> They are a little pricey but worth the money.</li>
            <li> I like the convenience of not having to use shave gel and the fact that these blades don&#x27;t knick my sensitive skin or leave any razor bumps/burn, but given how fast they wear out, it&#x27;s just not worth the cost anymore.</li>
            <li> I am throwing them away and going back to my old brand</li>
            <li> I shave almost daily, and one razor head will last me nearly a month.</li>
            <li> Now since I bought these no dry skin either.  </li>
            <li> but this razor actually makes it better rather than worse.</li>
            <li> After 2 shaves of legs only the gel strips are pretty much down to nothing</li>
            <li> First of all, the gel bars fall off after a few uses (and it just doesn&#x27;t work with only one gel bar), well before the blade itself is worn out, and with the cost of cartridges</li>
            <li> The top lotion pad fell off in the first few uses of this blade, and at that point, the razor becomes difficult to use.</li>
            <li> The razor blade packing was very difficult to open (as compared with previous Venus Breeze packages) and the gel on the top and bottom of the razor was loose and breaks off easily.  </li>
            <li> My only caveat (and not enough to bring the rating down) is that the gel on the rayzers wears down quickly.</li>
            <li> Works great for about a week and then become dull and useless.</li>
            <li> I have never actually timed how long they last</li>
            <li> When you first use the razor, you have to press hard.</li>
            <li> Also, they don&#x27;t last very long compared to the original Gillette razers which I can usually make last for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> BUT the blades don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> One that does not last long at all.</li>
            <li> And they last a long time which cuts the.</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t last a long.</li>
            <li> BUT they don&#x27;t last long before the shave cream strips run out / fall off.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the purple &amp;#34;gel bars&amp;#34; - they get really goopy while you are shaving and make it hard to actually shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried angling the razor differently but the only thing that seems to help is pressing a lot harder on it - which is a recipe for a shaving injury.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half way through them and ALL performed poorly, requiring me to go over my legs multiple times to get a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> use this product all year long.</li>
            <li> Simply wait until the end of your bath or shower so that your legs have had time to hydrate, wet the razor and shave.</li>
            <li> I wet the razor and shaved and simply wiped my leg with a paper tower in the examining room and</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t cut myself in a long, long time with these razors.  </li>
            <li> Last a long time and stays sharp.</li>
            <li> Seems to stay sharp, and last a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other razors, and this one is just heads and shoulders above the rest.  </li>
            <li> moisturizes  does not leave skin dry.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> Though admittedly I do have a thick layer of facial hair, being transgender and at an early point in my transition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are also a bit wider, so cut a larger area at one time - few less trips up the old calf!&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I could not live without them.  </li>
            <li> When I called to company they stated that the average life is only 3 times.  </li>
            <li> No matter what I do--whether this razor is new, used, or dull, it gives me razor burns and cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you do not leave these face down in the shower, the bar will last longer.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and have been using these for years.</li>
            <li> After about the third shave, I start using a little shaving cream.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m frustrated that after about 4 or 5 uses, the top gel strip falls off.</li>
            <li> My 30 year old daughter and myself have been using these razors for at least six years.  </li>
            <li> Btw, I suggest not storing them in the shower if you want the shaving cream strip to last a few days.  </li>
            <li> Only issue the soap strip falls off after a few uses</li>
            <li> Not much to say about these except they work well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other razors and always come back to the Venus.  </li>
            <li> and then it is just like any other razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weird at first with how slimy it is</li>
            <li> Pretty expensive considering everything.  </li>
            <li> She prefers the other ones with the pads on the ends.</li>
            <li> I usually would buy these in the store but they only have 3 or 4 in a pack.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of the other Venus blades</li>
            <li> used this once, then reverted back to my disposable razor, which gives me one maybe two cuts usually, though now its reopening the three nicks still on my face from this.</li>
            <li> Every so often, I might try something from the Vine Program, but usually end up going back to the Breeze blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use any other type.  </li>
            <li> It seems that the company has improved the blade a little, but you mut be careful.</li>
            <li> I use Amazon&#x27;s feature of subscribe &amp; save to have the razor refills delivered regularly so we don&#x27;t have to worry with running to the drugstore or using dull razor blades because we&#x27;ve run out.  </li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t leave my razor in the shower because excess moisture ruins the blade -</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> not worth it</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use any other razor now!</li>
            <li> I find that the purple ones tend to get little bumps on it when it&#x27;s getting close to being done and the other ones don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> one less product to take..shaving cream..  </li>
            <li> (less motion/moving around in the shower/bath required).</li>
            <li> Less products to buy, less products crowding up the shower.</li>
            <li> I tend to use them when I&#x27;m in a hurry and don&#x27;t want to deal with the mess of shaving cream.</li>
            <li> than I have with other blades in the past 3 years.</li>
            <li> The handle came with a little hook for the handle</li>
            <li> I resorted to E-Bay to try and save a little money.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced this with the Venus blades I&#x27;ve purchased from my local corner store.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try the Breeze after using the Schick Intution (with the shave cream bars) for a few years</li>
            <li> Like I really do not enjoy wasting time.  </li>
            <li> hate wasting money, but will probably not get through the entire package before switching to a new brand.</li>
            <li> Once the shave gel bars wear down, you do not have to press so hard for a closer shave.</li>
            <li> (I have very dark, coarse hair unfortunately).</li>
            <li> I never enjoyed shaving until now.</li>
            <li> I realize how lazy I was trying to shorten my shower by 10 seconds....</li>
            <li> I have to tell anyone if you are not sure if want to purchase</li>
            <li> One thing I would reiterate is DO NOT push down too hard when shaving!  </li>
            <li> Dull blades.</li>
            <li> I hardly ever cut myself.</li>
            <li> I use until at least one of the lotion bars fall off, then replace.</li>
            <li> I use them for all of my skin and it glides delicately.</li>
            <li> I had broken my foot and had a cast and after a few weeks as the hair on my leg grew my leg would itch under the cast.</li>
            <li> However, after just one week of daily shaving, one of the gel-like pads came off, making it difficult to use the razor without cutting myself.  </li>
            <li> I am clumsy, and even I have a hard time cutting myself with these rasers.</li>
            <li> They shave close and well and do not leave my legs crazy dried out.</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> no more itching!!!</li>
            <li> dont get me wrong</li>
            <li> and I no longer cut my poor legs when shaving!</li>
            <li> Their design makes it difficult to cut yourself.</li>
            <li> I wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive</li>
            <li> I know on the expensive side</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> That is one expensive blade!</li>
            <li> but is very expensive.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate.  </li>
            <li> Worst Part is, and ALWAYS HAS BEEN, the price.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how awful these blades have been made.</li>
            <li> Well, I tried and obtained terrible cuts and nicks.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The aloe strips fall off too soon, have used them for awhile, but now looking for a razor that the strip stays on longer!</li>
            <li> I do prefer a 5 blade razor, but for only 3 blades it&#x27;s not bad. The gel leaves my legs feeling nice and soft.</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but well worth it. I love that you don&#x27;t need shaving cream with this razor which makes shaving super quick. Also, you get a close shave with no bloody mess.</li>
            <li> Great razors because I no longer get razor burn.</li>
            <li> I love not having to use a shaving gel or soap. Unlike a different brand that is big and bulky these are slim and give you just the right amount of gel to shave. Venus is a fave razor of mine because they seem to really know what we need for our curves. I have sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve not had any razor burn issues.</li>
            <li> I have loved the Venus so I assume the Breeze would be even better.  I bought a huge pack of these blades and its been a disaster.  Every time I use a Breeze blade I either I get cut (never happens with Venus) or the upper gel glide falls off.  I have tried a new Breeze blade 5 or 6 times and have now given up entirely.  Today, I am back to buy the Venus blades.</li>
            <li> Ever since I discovered the Venus shavers with the lotion bars, I have been hooked. This type of refill fits any of the Venus shavers and you can even use them on the disposables if you look at how they are attached. It&#x27;s all the same head, but a slightly different configuration. I have used the Breeze and the Spa refills and the only difference is the scent. I have not tried the Olay ones that are made to fit the same shavers, but I assume they are very much the same. With this type of shave head, it&#x27;s not just the ease and convenience of the all-in-one lubricant plus blades, it&#x27;s that the shave is so incredibly close and yet never irritates, no matter where you use it. If you have tried and failed at shaving the dreaded &amp;#34;bikini&amp;#34; area, these will do the trick with no irritation unless of course you are sensitive to scented products, and if you are, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re already aware of it.</li>
            <li> love this product, as we camp all summer. this product is perfect for shaving in the ruff..one less product to take..shaving cream..  use this product all year long. moisturizes  does not leave skin dry.</li>
            <li> I love it BUT the blades don&#x27;t last long. If it wasnt for that I would be in complete heaven.I&#x27;m going to stick with it though for the convience of having it all in one.</li>
            <li> Good product for a close shave. One thing I would reiterate is DO NOT push down too hard when shaving!  I have been shaving for 30+ years and have never ripped up my skin as I have with these blades. It seems that the company has improved the blade a little, but you mut be careful. Not for beginners. You also still need to use a shaving lotion. I would recommend this razor &amp; blade to anyone who wants a close, smooth shave (with a little caution).</li>
            <li> I actually bought these by mistake. When I got them home, I discovered they fit my existing Venus razor just fine. I like not having to lather with shaving cream first; you just wet the razor and you&#x27;re ready to go! The only thing I have noticed is that they wear out more quickly than other standard razor refills (the shaving cream bars specifically). This problem can be alleviated by lathering up like you normally would before you shave (the razor is still good). This is a great convenience product!</li>
            <li> I have been using these every other day or so since they first came out and they do a wonderful job from toe to bikini line.  Btw, I suggest not storing them in the shower if you want the shaving cream strip to last a few days.  Move them to a drier location, such as the medicine cabinet, and they&#x27;ll safely last longer.</li>
            <li> works as intended, I just wish the front gel pad thing would not fall off.  Seems to stay sharp, and last a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Venus blades for years and expected the buy on Amazon would make for a great buy.  I&#x27;ve not been happy with how this package of blades has performed. I&#x27;m half way through them and ALL performed poorly, requiring me to go over my legs multiple times to get a clean shave.  I&#x27;ve never experienced this with the Venus blades I&#x27;ve purchased from my local corner store.  I will not be purchasing any more replacement blades except from my local walk-in businesses.  This is the first product I&#x27;ve not been happy with purchased through Amazon.  Makes me wonder of these are manufacturing &#x27;seconds&#x27; ... i.e. didn&#x27;t make the mark for regular retail.</li>
            <li> I always use Venus. It is comfortable and gives legs a close shave.</li>
            <li> These blades are safer to use than other brands, smooth, clean shave.</li>
            <li> I decided to try the Breeze after using the Schick Intution (with the shave cream bars) for a few years and I have the same problem with this razor as I did the Schick.  First of all, the gel bars fall off after a few uses (and it just doesn&#x27;t work with only one gel bar), well before the blade itself is worn out, and with the cost of cartridges you can&#x27;t justify throwing it away after this happens.  So what you are left with is a razor with NO lubrication, and you end up having to use soap or shaving cream anyway if you want to get the full life out of your blade.  I haven&#x27;t found that I cut myself more with this blade, but the bottom line is it is only effective for a few uses and then it is just like any other razor. Definitely not worth the money.</li>
            <li> First off, these are the most expensive razors I&#x27;ve used BUT the saying you get what you pay for is extremely true in this case. I&#x27;ve used these razors for the last 3 years and I&#x27;ve NEVER had a razor bump in the bikini area or underarm. I&#x27;ve nicked myself a couple of  times but that&#x27;s because I kept going over and over the area trying to get that clean bikini look (I have very dark, coarse hair unfortunately). I do use it with shaving cream to give me an extra layer of protection but in a crunch, I use it without. Until they make a razor better than this one, I will continue to only use this razor.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect concept for someone who doesnt have much time to shave.  Its shave gel and razor all in one...I will never go back to regular shave gel in a can.  this is perfect for traveling and normal use.  My only suggestion/complaint is that I wish the gel bar lasted for more uses.  dont get me wrong it lasts for several, but I think it could go longer.  Still the only product I use to shave, and it fits my old school venus razor from when they first came out.  bravo!</li>
            <li> It is worth the price to not have the razor burn I used to experience from traditional razors. It&#x27;s weird at first with how slimy it is but you get used to it. I won&#x27;t use any other razor now!</li>
            <li> Good product idea but the gel bars get used up and fall up relatively quickly.  Pretty expensive considering everything.  Won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> I hate.  Like I really do not enjoy wasting time.  The saying time is money is very true and so I would rather buy these razors and save the time of lathering up :)  They shave close and well and do not leave my legs crazy dried out.</li>
            <li> Love that these razors allow you to shave in one step - no shave gel needed.  Speeds up the process and are especially convenient for travel!</li>
            <li> So nice not to have to wrestle these out of the thief proof contraption at CVS.</li>
            <li> I just received a box and I&#x27;m concerned these may be knock offs.  The razor blade packing was very difficult to open (as compared with previous Venus Breeze packages) and the gel on the top and bottom of the razor was loose and breaks off easily.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my wife. She is not a fan. She said the lather pad things are really gross and leave slime all over her legs. She prefers the other ones with the pads on the ends.</li>
            <li> Dull blades. Not happy.</li>
            <li> Worst Part is, and ALWAYS HAS BEEN, the price. On How it&#x27;s Made you see the time taken into products so I can see why this is priced high, but still not a fan of the price.&lt;br /&gt;As for the quality ~ Great! And you can really just quite the shaving cream because it&#x27;s already there, on the blade. Very Convenient!  Top disappears faster than the bottom and that&#x27;s not good so you can either toss or go back to shaving cream because the blades are still good.</li>
            <li> I get maybe 2 shaves out of each refill before the gel bars are worn out.  When I called to company they stated that the average life is only 3 times.  That is one expensive blade! One that does not last long at all.</li>
            <li> I love these blades for the convenience (no cream necessary!), but they definitely don&#x27;t last long, and I find that I can&#x27;t get as close a shave as I can with a regular blade. It would be nice if they were cheaper, given that each blade seems to last through only a few leg shavings before the gel is gone. I tend to use them when I&#x27;m in a hurry and don&#x27;t want to deal with the mess of shaving cream.</li>
            <li> These shave heads fall apart after about three uses. I&#x27;d like to think it is because they were the ones about to be thrown out from sitting in a hot warehouse, but some small business-man used a drop-ship company, and now they are ridding themselves of these frail items.</li>
            <li> good product just pricey</li>
            <li> They fit, exactly what was expected.</li>
            <li> Now I remember why I never buy this razor blade! The moisturizing pads feel nice on my legs (and also quite slimy), but they somehow make it impossible to get a good shave. My leg hair feels longer after using this. :). I&#x27;ve tried angling the razor differently but the only thing that seems to help is pressing a lot harder on it - which is a recipe for a shaving injury.  So, even though these were a great price (got a large rebate), will not be using the rest of the cartridges, and will be buying something else.</li>
            <li> Good product and value</li>
            <li> These blades work great.  My Fiance loves them I love how smooth her legs are and it has a great smell to them.  Will be buying more when we run out.</li>
            <li> I like the shaving cream/moisturizer gel above and below the blades. Helps keep things smooth, reduces bumps, and is nice sometimes if separate shaving cream isn&#x27;t available!</li>
            <li> I bought these because they were the cheapest replacement heads for my venus razor. I don&#x27;t like the purple &amp;#34;gel bars&amp;#34; - they get really goopy while you are shaving and make it hard to actually shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up scraping off the gel with a knife before using, so they are just like normal razors, and that made them work a lot better!</li>
            <li> These razor refills are great for my Venus razor.  I&#x27;ve been using a Venus razor for about fifteen years.  I&#x27;ve tried a few other razors and always come back to the Venus.  The pieces of soap above the blades really help me with not getting any cuts.  In areas where there isn&#x27;t much coarse hair I haven&#x27;t had to use shaving cream at all.  Areas where the hair is more coarse - I&#x27;ve had to using shaving cream to prevent getting any razor bumps/ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback I find is that you have to keep the razor away from any water while not in use or else the soap pieces will fall off prematurely and they&#x27;re pricey!</li>
            <li> These make life so much easier if you have to shave every single day.  They last about a week each and are easy to change out when needed.  I think they are one of the best inventions.  Easy to order and were delivered without issue.</li>
            <li> Work great not a bad price either</li>
            <li> HEY, WHAT can one write. I saw it, the price was right, it arrived. No hassel. Would do it again</li>
            <li> than I have with other blades in the past 3 years. I am throwing them away and going back to my old brand</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how awful these blades have been made. They will cut up your leg within 10 seconds of shaving. Do yourself a favor and buy another type.</li>
            <li> A little sharp at first use, but they are a great deal.</li>
            <li> I prefer these razors to others. The shave is pretty close and I very rarely ever get razor burn. The perfumed scene is pretty mild and doesn&#x27;t seem too overpowering.</li>
            <li> With three shaving women in one house there&#x27;s only one thing to do. Get each person their own interchangeable handle and order shaving heads in bulk!&lt;br /&gt;These are my favorites, they have the built in shaving cream and it makes for great one step shaving, even for teenagers!&lt;br /&gt;A bit of advice for these razor heads. If you store them in the shower, don&#x27;t keep them somewhere that the lotion attachment stays moist. Also, if you can avoid it getting wet when other people shower, even better. I use until at least one of the lotion bars fall off, then replace. The blades aren&#x27;t totally dull yet and could be used more but they&#x27;ve started not doing so well with sensitive skin (like underarms) and cuts become more likely at this stage. I shave almost daily, and one razor head will last me nearly a month.</li>
            <li> They work great and as long as you keep them out of the shower they last a day or longer for me. The handle came with a little hook for the handle and I stuck it just outside the shower door and it keeps longer then when it&#x27;s normally in the shower all the time. I find that the purple ones tend to get little bumps on it when it&#x27;s getting close to being done and the other ones don&#x27;t. My overall favorite ones are the pink ones but these are just as great.</li>
            <li> The packing was intact when it arrived, and it arrived on time. This is a product that I get in the store for 18 almost 19 dollars for 4 so I got 2 more for just a little more.</li>
            <li> These are great if you are strapped for time/in a rush, or perhaps if you have mobility issues/ as they eliminate the step of applying standard shaving cream (less motion/moving around in the shower/bath required). These are great for the first 2 to 3 shaves depending on how course/fine your hair is. After that the soap/strip seems to wear out quick and or the blades dull quite quickly. Overall, I tend to keep one of these in the shower and also a standard razor and cream and switch off and on based on time constraints. I will say however, something about the design of these razors leaves me with fewer/to no nicks unlike standard razors, so these also might be ideal for that younger set of gals who are just learning to shave, as they may have fewer cuts from these...sort of like a learning curve razor. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these overall if you want a fine shave, or you&#x27;ll be replacing these cartridges about once a week, and in comparison to cream/standard razors they aren&#x27;t inexpensive, nor are they quality enough to be worth the high overall cost.</li>
            <li> Works great for about a week and then become dull and useless.</li>
            <li> Great product but is very expensive.</li>
            <li> I have been using these Venus razors since they hit the market and I could not live without them.  The shave is extremely smooth and they are so convenient! This variety that comes with the built in shower gel bars does not require you to use shave cream.  Simply wait until the end of your bath or shower so that your legs have had time to hydrate, wet the razor and shave. Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Purchased these on accident and love them! Makes shaving so much more less of a hassle. The lotion part doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would normally keep a razor, but still worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a while but I&#x27;m frustrated that after about 4 or 5 uses, the top gel strip falls off. You could probably get a lot more shaves out of it if it stayed on longer. When new it gives a nice close comfortable shave with no burn.</li>
            <li> The razors are okay, but the weird semi-solid gel stuff curls up &amp; falls off before I&#x27;m ready to change out the razor head.  If they hadn&#x27;t been on sale I would refrain from buying.  BTW, I don&#x27;t notice any &amp;#34;tropical&amp;#34; scent (as advertised).</li>
            <li> I use these babies all the time and I love them. I have Amazone deliver them to me on a 6 week basis so I never run out. These razors always do a great job and the little glider strips keep me from getting razor rash and my legs come out silky smooth!</li>
            <li> These are great when shaving your legs as you don&#x27;t have to worry about using shaving cream.  However, they don&#x27;t shave very closely so you have to shave more frequently and they are not good for your bikini line at all -- I ended up having to buy the original Gillette razers specifically for that area.  Also, they don&#x27;t last very long compared to the original Gillette razers which I can usually make last for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I love these razors! Brilliant to put the shaving cream right on razorhead. I find I actually shave every day with this addition.</li>
            <li> I love these little cartridges :) they are easy to change out and help me not get the razor bumps that other razors give. Love them and will continue getting them!</li>
            <li> I love these razor blades! They leave your legs feeling soo smooth and moisturized. Can&#x27;t beat the price either! I&#x27;d reccomend</li>
            <li> With six people in our family under one roof, we each have our preferred razors.  My daughter likes the Venus Breeze, so I use Amazon&#x27;s feature of subscribe &amp; save to have the razor refills delivered regularly so we don&#x27;t have to worry with running to the drugstore or using dull razor blades because we&#x27;ve run out.  We use various versions of the Venus razor depending on our needs and we all like them very much.  Recommend!</li>
            <li> Love these. Very smooth on my legs and never had a problem with nicks. I will definitely will buy them again.</li>
            <li> I usually would buy these in the store but they only have 3 or 4 in a pack. I like the venus breeze cartridges the best, i tried the oil of olay but didn&#x27;t care for them. These exfoliate and moisturize your skin. i love the convenience of not having to buy shaving cream and separate razors.</li>
            <li> I love these blades but do wish they weren&#x27;t quite so expensive.  I have never actually timed how long they last but it is costly to replace them.  I resorted to E-Bay to try and save a little money.  They are great to use and I no longer cut my poor legs when shaving!</li>
            <li> These are my absolute favorite. I have tried a lot of the other Venus blades but I keep coming back to this one. I love that is has the soapy things on there and my legs feel so much smoother after. I don&#x27;t have to use any sort of shaving cream. These are great and will be sticking to these from now on!</li>
            <li> I love these razors.  I haven&#x27;t used shaving cream ever since I bought these.  I have very dry skin and after I shave I have to put on alot of lotion.  Now since I bought these no dry skin either.  I tell all my friends and they have all went to using this too and as excited as I am about telling everyone how awesome these are.</li>
            <li> Love the razors. I hardly ever cut myself. Make my legs feel great after I&#x27;m done:) I get a shipment every 3 months just so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> Used on my face, had 8-10 nicks afterwords. Though admittedly I do have a thick layer of facial hair, being transgender and at an early point in my transition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I did use shaving cream, which should have added another layer of protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this once, then reverted back to my disposable razor, which gives me one maybe two cuts usually, though now its reopening the three nicks still on my face from this.</li>
            <li> Each blade lasts about 1 month. Great quality. I love the convenience of these razors. I am subscribed to the automatic renewal. That droped the price even lower. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Okay, you can get cut easily. The new generation of Venus prevents that for a couple bucks more.</li>
            <li> My daughter influenced me to use this Gillette razor.  I am glad I made the switch.  I have used many different types of razors over the years for my legs and underarms.  This razor outshines them all for a great shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them before and am always happy with them.  I am recovering from a fall and can&#x27;t get out to shop too often, so this was great</li>
            <li> These razors leave your legs smooth without drying them out. Their design makes it difficult to cut yourself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all of these different razors and blades and these are the best. I use them for all of my skin and it glides delicately. It doesn&#x27;t get stuck and I haven&#x27;t gotten cut by it. Gillette is the best at making razors. Buy here!</li>
            <li> i have used this product for a long  time you have it cheeper and more quanity than in the stores.</li>
            <li> I love the Venus Breeze Blades and it&#x27;s cheaper to buy through Amazon than at the store!</li>
            <li> I wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive but I love these Venus blades.</li>
            <li> The Venus Breeze is wonderful. I don&#x27;t even need to use shaving cream. The top and bottom of razor blade have a soapy piece on them.  The smooth soapy cream goes on before the blade touches.  The blade does give a good shave. There is a money saving factor, I don&#x27;t buy shaving cream anymore.</li>
            <li> works pretty well, but the gel ends come off when there is still a good bit left.</li>
            <li> I havent cut myself shaving in 3 years since I started using these...recetly introduced my 12 year old daughter to them...so far so good and she could get hurt in a rubber room! The gooey moisturizer tips wear out pretty fast if you leave the razor in the shower, but we put ours in the medicine cabinet to prevent that now...love these razors...wish i had had them when I was a teen...my legs would be far less scarred. :)</li>
            <li> Love this razor and blades that glide over my skin. Never have razor bumps on my smooth legs. And they last a long time which cuts the. Cost of shaving.</li>
            <li> The shipment did come on time, but they fell apart very easily, the moisturizing strips fell off after the second day, so they did not work as they are advertised.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use on bikini line, good for legs and underarms only. The razor head is too large to shave carefully on bikini line. Otherwise, nice to have gel on razor for a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> The Best Shaver Ever invented imagine Not needing all that messy shaving foam/creme!!!! Since on market I&#x27;ve been buying All The Time !! Tried other copy-cat kind they wear out faster... I know on the expensive side But worth every dollar :-)</li>
            <li> This gives me a clean, close shave.  I tried the Olay ones, but the shave is not as nice and they don&#x27;t last a long. These ones work much better.</li>
            <li> Nice Idea, and have tried these and the embrace razors but the thickness of the moisturizing areas on the edges prevent a close shave, so making it necessary to shave every day. Will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> These blades are great, the gel bar does disappear quickly. I&#x27;ve been able to keep them going for about two months by not storing my razor in the shower and by turning the water off while I shave my legs, it decreases the amount of wear on them.</li>
            <li> Only issue the soap strip falls off after a few uses</li>
            <li> As someone who has tried several brands of razors (and not just the cheap disposable kind) I can say that these are my favorites. These razours give a smooth shave as advertised and don&#x27;t irritate my skin. My only caveat (and not enough to bring the rating down) is that the gel on the rayzers wears down quickly. I am clumsy, and even I have a hard time cutting myself with these rasers. For clumsy people like me who also have sensitive skin, these raesors are a great choice.</li>
            <li> I have been only using this shaving heads for a while. I have an extremely sensitive skin but this grides so smoothly, I don&#x27;t even need shaving cream or gel with this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other razors, and this one is just heads and shoulders above the rest.  Yes, the purple pads fall off after 2 weeks, but I still use the razor blade for about 1 month. You are paying for quality here, and to me, having smooth skin and no razor burn is worth it for me.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and item is as described. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Not much to say about these except they work well and the wife stands by these as the best. Good price!</li>
            <li> The convenience of these razors trumps any complaints about the longevity of the soap bars on these razors.  I love the fact that I can buy one product and eliminate the need to buy shaving cream AND razors, which never seemed to run out at the same time for me.  Less products to buy, less products crowding up the shower. If you do not leave these face down in the shower, the bar will last longer.  I usually go through about one razor every 2 weeks, shaving everything really good once a week and touchups throughout the week as needed... really not bad at all. I will use these forever!</li>
            <li> I will only use Venus razors. They leave your legs smooth with no nicks or cuts. Best price using Amazon subscribe and save. Hihgly recommend</li>
            <li> When I first started using these, I loved them.  They were perfect for my sensitive skin, and allowed for a close shave without risk of knicks or razor burn.  However, after just one week of daily shaving, one of the gel-like pads came off, making it difficult to use the razor without cutting myself.  I tossed that cartridge, thinking it was a fluke, and started on the second...  One week later, the same thing happened!  Great for the first week, but plan on replacing them often.  I&#x27;ll be opting for something else next time.</li>
            <li> No matter what I do--whether this razor is new, used, or dull, it gives me razor burns and cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate wasting money, but will probably not get through the entire package before switching to a new brand.</li>
            <li> Awesome. My gf loves it</li>
            <li> No need to pack shave gel.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this razor! It shaves great and I love the moisturizing strips. I have dry skin but this razor actually makes it better rather than worse. This is my new razor and I don&#x27;t ever see a reason to look for a different one. I would recommend this to everyone who shaves!</li>
            <li> great value for the price</li>
            <li> These are the only razors I will ever use. I hope they continue to be manufactured! Last a long time and stays sharp.</li>
            <li> The soapy, silky part is so bulky that it inhibits a close shave.  It makes shaving a breeze but it&#x27;s not a close shave.  It also doesn&#x27;t last very long.  I don&#x27;t leave my razor in the shower because excess moisture ruins the blade - but it still weathers very quickly. Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I like the way these razors work, and it&#x27;s a better price than you&#x27;ll find at most retailers.  I also find the shipping convenient and easy. The moisturizing bars on the razor help get a close shave while not having to worry about getting shaving cream. 2 in 1!</li>
            <li> I was able to score these for a good price and saved some money by ordering from this supplier. I like the razor blades as your legs are left silky smooth</li>
            <li> Are you supposed to be able to use these razors without shaving cream?  Well, I tried and obtained terrible cuts and nicks.  Even when I use shaving cream it does not give the best shave.  Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I love the replacement razors - get a smooth shave BUT they don&#x27;t last long before the shave cream strips run out / fall off.  So for the $ - it&#x27;s not a value AND for the convenience of not using shave cream...it&#x27;s worth it ;)</li>
            <li> These are my favorite, provide so much more moisture than the regular Venus blades. I have very dry skin and have been using these for years.</li>
            <li> I never enjoyed shaving until now. I love the razor when it is brand new. No shaving cream is needed. After about the third shave, I start using a little shaving cream. When you first use the razor, you have to press hard. Once the shave gel bars wear down, you do not have to press so hard for a closer shave.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.  Gel bar dissolves before razor is no longer good, so you still have to use soap or gel to shave.</li>
            <li> The top lotion pad fell off in the first few uses of this blade, and at that point, the razor becomes difficult to use. It does not give a close shave in the best of conditions, but once the pads are uneven, it&#x27;s even more problematic. I will not buy these again.</li>
            <li> Personally, these are the best ones for me and I do not need to use anything else, such as shave cream.  Have extremely sensitive skin and tolerate these very well.  Have them on my subscription series so save even more.</li>
            <li> Great product, moisturizes well and gives a clean shave. It&#x27;s all I use anymore. I can&#x27;t think of the last time I needed shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I love these refills and bought them online cheaper than what they sell for in the department stores!  They are very gentle on the legs as I have sensitive skin.  I&#x27;ve been using them for years.  In fact I found them in a department store and bought them because they don&#x27;t require that you use soap.  I had broken my foot and had a cast and after a few weeks as the hair on my leg grew my leg would itch under the cast. The next time they removed the cast I wet the razor and shaved and simply wiped my leg with a paper tower in the examining room and no more itching!!!</li>
            <li> Love the Breeze! The 2 lotion strips make shaving a nice experience. My legs feel so soft with these blades.</li>
            <li> this is the only model and brand my wife will purchase. Happy wife, happy life.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite razor blades. It saves from having to use as much body wash.</li>
            <li> This is an OK razor. I like the idea of skipping the lather step, but it just doesn&#x27;t get as close a shave as a regular razor. I realize how lazy I was trying to shorten my shower by 10 seconds....not worth it haha</li>
            <li> Love not shaving with cream- just put the razor on and go to town. Doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like as far as sharpness of blade but very quick, good shave!</li>
            <li> I have been using these blades for several years. Every so often, I might try something from the Vine Program, but usually end up going back to the Breeze blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do a great job of cutting close, giving a smooth shave - love the gel bars on both sides of the blades! They are also a bit wider, so cut a larger area at one time - few less trips up the old calf!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend them to anyone wanting a nice, smooth shave!</li>
            <li> I like these so much I have to tell anyone if you are not sure if want to purchase do it you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> These are great.  Very, very smooth, and each one lasts me two weeks.  I recommend them!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  My 30 year old daughter and myself have been using these razors for at least six years.  Wouldn&#x27;t use any other type.  I haven&#x27;t cut myself in a long, long time with these razors.  They are a little pricey but worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love these blades, they&#x27;ve been my favorite for quite some time, but they wear out way too quick, one blade lasts maybe one week. I don&#x27;t store my razor in the shower either when I use these blades, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to help any. After 2 shaves of legs only the gel strips are pretty much down to nothing and I can hear the blades scraping against my skin. I like the convenience of not having to use shave gel and the fact that these blades don&#x27;t knick my sensitive skin or leave any razor bumps/burn, but given how fast they wear out, it&#x27;s just not worth the cost anymore.</li>
            <li> The wife loves the shaver</li>
