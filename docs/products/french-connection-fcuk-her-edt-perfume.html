            <li>This product smells OKAY.</li>
            <li>JUST OKAY.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a fun name!!</li>
            <li>The product was perfect, but the delivery took 2 extra days than what was originally scheduled.</li>

            <li>It is not wearing off easily and not to strong</li>
            <li>The scent is strongly chemical and...sort of cheap smelling.</li>

            <li>FABULOUS</li>
            <li>AND THE PRICE IS CHEAP...  </li>
            <li>This perfume is great, it has a wonderful fragrance and you can&#x27;t go wrong for the price!  </li>
            <li>Smells better once it has blended with your chemistry than when you first put it on.</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>Also the product came in original packing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased by the freshness and crisp scent.</li>
            <li>Although I would recomended for women spicy and sexy, it is not so classy; it&#x27;s more like fun!</li>
            <li>It was a very special gift with a funny story.</li>
            <li>I bought this perfume for my sister, I love it so much that I&#x27;m thinking on buying one for myself.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh, light, stays to you</li>
            <li>The scent is amazing..soft and sweet but not to sweet.</li>
            <li>I like the scent although it wore off to quickly</li>
            <li>I love this perfume I remember smelling this in 2008 and thought WOW!!</li>
            <li>MY NEW FAVORITE PERFUME.  </li>
            <li>I love this perfume, the scent is very soft.</li>
            <li>Great everyday fragrance.  </li>
            <li>My boyfriend loves the smell too, and the provocative name made him laugh.</li>
            <li>And the name is fun to tell people.</li>
            <li>Everyone should get one if you&#x27;re into fresh frangances.  </li>
            <li>Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4 Ounces for almost 10 dollars is really worth it.</li>
            <li>Fresh smelling and fun.</li>
            <li>I used to own this fragrance back in 2005.</li>
            <li>The pricing on this item is very reasonable</li>
            <li>thought name was funny</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty bummed about this perfume.</li>
            <li>Received fast and you can&#x27;t beat the price for the 3.4 oz!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this perfume, it is light and citrusy and slightly musky.</li>
            <li>I ðŸ’œ this fresh, light and daily wear fragrance!!</li>
            <li>This perfume has been my favorite for a long time and finding it at this price blew my mind.</li>
            <li>this one was a knock off that smelled like pure alcohol.</li>
            <li>I really like this smell.</li>
            <li>Really don&#x27;t like this plus</li>
            <li>Thanks a bunch.</li>
            <li>When I did it sprays in a straight line.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The item was shipped very promptly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Its not the original Fcuk French Connection ...</li>
            <li>its a soft and sexy but clean smell and long lasting.</li>
            <li>love the clean subtle scent!</li>
            <li>I called customer service and they immediately replaced it with a new one which was delivered in 4 days.</li>
            <li>Its long lasting to be eau de toilette, the smell is definitely unique.......</li>
            <li>Surprised her with this HER.</li>
            <li>but this one has topped those by far.</li>
            <li>The look is classy..</li>
            <li>Thankfully it is not an expensive perfume, so I can reapply as much as I damn well please, but I wish that it lasted longer because it smells so nice.</li>
            <li>I was dissappointed it stinks ,smells old or something,would not recommend this product for anyone who wants to smell good.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find that it truly fit the description as a light, casual fragrance.  </li>
            <li>This particular spray does not last.  </li>
            <li>The container it came in is also pretty cheaply made as mentioned in a few other reviews.</li>
            <li>This scent as described to me was appealing because of the patchouli and other unique ingredients but failed to impress me when I got it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want them stealing my secret :)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok smell but kindof hard to pump like other reviews</li>
            <li>, it isn&#x27;t so strong that it makes you feel sick, it&#x27;s just right</li>

            <li> its a soft and sexy but clean smell and long lasting.</li>
            <li> love the clean subtle scent!</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s ok smell but kindof hard to pump like other reviews</li>
            <li> , it isn&#x27;t so strong that it makes you feel sick, it&#x27;s just right</li>
            <li> I must say that the shipping and order fulfillment were exceptional, even though I have been hounded to remove my prior bad review based on the dysfunctional spray-thingy.</li>
            <li> To my surprise, the EDT smells close to 85% of what I had been using, and lasts quite long.</li>
            <li> The sprayer stopped working only after a few applications.</li>
            <li> The sprayer on the perfume had problems and was not functioning as expected.</li>
            <li> IT GETS JAMMED EVEN!</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my mon who complained that she it did not really linger on her as long as she thought it would.</li>
            <li> AT HALF BOTTLE.</li>
            <li> Found a cheaper deal online(almost half of what i paid before).</li>
            <li> Has notes of sage and woods as well, and a little citrus, I think.</li>
            <li> the patchouli is not too heavy like in some others where patchouli makes an appearance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing like what a few reviews said.</li>
            <li> and I always have trouble finding it!</li>
            <li> Not a nice spray.</li>
            <li> I am not about overpowering perfumes but, rather, one that&#x27;s subtle.  </li>
            <li> It is VERY HARD to spray!</li>
            <li> its terrible and the spraying knob doesn&#x27;t even work properly.</li>
            <li> , unfortunately - it is useless -</li>
            <li> /&gt;the item was send as a gift - and is a disappointment to the recipient - and an embarrasment to the giver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hate it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing!  </li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>

            <li> Eh..it&#x27;s ok..thought name was funny..sounded good blend..it&#x27;s ok smell but kindof hard to pump like other reviews stated..definitely liked price</li>
            <li> Best cologne ever. Great price. I use the HIM and got a girlfriend who loves the smell. Surprised her with this HER. Tons of compliments and wanting to know where they can buy it. I tell them it&#x27;s only in England. I don&#x27;t want them stealing my secret :)</li>
            <li> I like the scent although it wore off to quickly and my boyfriend didnt like the smell, he said it reminded him of chemicals</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this perfume, it is light and citrusy and slightly musky. However, I notice that an hour after putting it on I could no longer smell it. Thankfully it is not an expensive perfume, so I can reapply as much as I damn well please, but I wish that it lasted longer because it smells so nice. My boyfriend loves the smell too, and the provocative name made him laugh.</li>
            <li> This perfume is great, it has a wonderful fragrance and you can&#x27;t go wrong for the price!  It&#x27;s also a fun name!!</li>
            <li> I got this perfume in hopes it would smell good.I was dissappointed it stinks ,smells old or something,would not recommend this product for anyone who wants to smell good.</li>
            <li> I really like this smell. maybe it is not my top fragrance, but it smells really nice and for the price it is a real bargain.</li>
            <li> A pleasant, mild fragrance - the patchouli is not too heavy like in some others where patchouli makes an appearance. Smells better once it has blended with your chemistry than when you first put it on. Has notes of sage and woods as well, and a little citrus, I think. Nice, not overpowering, you get a lot for the price but it does not have that &amp;#34;cheap perfume&amp;#34; smell. And the name is fun to tell people.</li>
            <li> The parfum product itself is excellent, but the atomizer on the one that I received would not work until I disemboweled the designer container...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but I must say that the shipping and order fulfillment were exceptional, even though I have been hounded to remove my prior bad review based on the dysfunctional spray-thingy.</li>
            <li> Its not the original Fcuk French Connection ...its some duplicate ...its terrible and the spraying knob doesn&#x27;t even work properly.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume I remember smelling this in 2008 and thought WOW!! this smells really nice and now in 2012 it still smell the same which is AWESOME, Its long lasting to be eau de toilette, the smell is definitely unique....... it smells like a male cologne but with a feminine twist on it... TRUST ME you will not regret buying this perfume!!!! oh yeah and the price is GREAT!!</li>
            <li> this perfume is so incredibly awesome the smell OMG! its a soft and sexy but clean smell and long lasting. MY NEW FAVORITE PERFUME.  I always wear armani or thierry muggler but this one has topped those by far. women you must get it you will love it and so will your man he will find you irrestible!! :) FABULOUS</li>
            <li> MY TITLE SAYS IT ALL... IT SMELLS GOOD AND THE PRICE IS CHEAP...  I&#x27;D BUY MORE... AND GIVE IT AS A GIFT... &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Really don&#x27;t like this plus the bottle always topples over</li>
            <li> I ordered this fragrance by description only, hoping that it was in my range of preferences.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that it truly fit the description as a light, casual fragrance.  It definitely works for me.  I am not about overpowering perfumes but, rather, one that&#x27;s subtle.  I would recommend this fragrance to others.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girl friend as a Christmas gift and absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, the scent is very soft. The price is amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty bummed about this perfume. I purchased this perfume on a recommendation from a friend, who has since agreed that something is off with what I got. The scent is strongly chemical and...sort of cheap smelling. The container it came in is also pretty cheaply made as mentioned in a few other reviews. The sprayer stopped working only after a few applications.</li>
            <li> This perfume has been my favorite for a long time and finding it at this price blew my mind. I recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my sister, I love it so much that I&#x27;m thinking on buying one for myself.  It&#x27;s fresh, light, stays to you&#x27;re body for hours. Great for the summer nights. Love it!  And the best of all everyone is asking what is that delicious smell :)  Everyone should get one if you&#x27;re into fresh frangances.  Although I would recomended for women spicy and sexy, it is not so classy; it&#x27;s more like fun!</li>
            <li> I took this one for my friend..The look is classy..Perfect for a gift..Smell is good too..Fcuk By French Connection For Women. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4 Ounces for almost 10 dollars is really worth it.</li>
            <li> I ðŸ’œ this fresh, light and daily wear fragrance!! It&#x27;s nothing like what a few reviews said. It&#x27;s affordable (here) and being a native of London the price here is way better. Great to give as a gift comes neatly packaged and easy to open.</li>
            <li> love the clean subtle scent!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume and I always have trouble finding it! Received fast and you can&#x27;t beat the price for the 3.4 oz!</li>
            <li> Totally satisfied with the product, excellent quality, just what I was looking for a totally original fragrance, very good seller, timely delivery, good packaging, recommended for future purchases, worthy of five stars</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife. The scent is amazing..soft and sweet but not to sweet. It is not wearing off easily and not to strong</li>
            <li> The product was perfect, but the delivery took 2 extra days than what was originally scheduled.</li>
            <li> The sprayer on the perfume had problems and was not functioning as expected. I called customer service and they immediately replaced it with a new one which was delivered in 4 days. Excellent customer service response. The product is good and my mother-in-law loved it.</li>
            <li> I have worn this scent for YEARS.  I absolutely love it!  This particular spray does not last.  I can put it on, and within 1 hour the scent is gone.  Very disappointing!  I purchased a replacement...and the scent does last all day!</li>
            <li> This scent as described to me was appealing because of the patchouli and other unique ingredients but failed to impress me when I got it.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. I can&#x27;t find it in stores</li>
            <li> This is great to wear day to day.  Kind of a sporty smell but in a good way.  Fresh smelling and fun.</li>
            <li> Purchased for a friend. I had to have a smell and I think it&#x27;s lovely, it isn&#x27;t so strong that it makes you feel sick, it&#x27;s just right and I will be buying one for myself too. It&#x27;s a great price too. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I order this perfume all the time..this one was a knock off that smelled like pure alcohol. Horrible.</li>
            <li> Love it! Smells so good</li>
            <li> I had never heard of this fragrance until my daughter-in-law requested it for Christmas.  She was thrilled when she opened it and we all loved the scent.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this perfume.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my mon who complained that she it did not really linger on her as long as she thought it would.</li>
            <li> I purchased FCUK for women in London and assumed I was getting the same fragrance. It is NOT.&lt;br /&gt;Test before you buy!</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PERFUME! IT&#x27;S MY FAVORITE &amp; THERE&#x27;S NOTHING ELSE LIKE IT. PEOPLE ALWAYS COMMENT ON HOW GOOD I SMELL &amp; WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE FRANGRANCE IS. THIS IS THE LOWEST PRICE I&#x27;VE EVER FOUND &amp; IT SHIPPED SO QUICKLY! I&#x27;LL BE A CUSTOMER FOR LIFE :)</li>
            <li> This product was very good and as a gift was received with great excitement?  The pricing on this item is very reasonable</li>
            <li> item arrived within time frame given! package was damaged upon receipt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, unfortunately - it is useless - the spray mechanism does not work.&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, no fragrance is released.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the item was send as a gift - and is a disappointment to the recipient - and an embarrasment to the giver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;God Bless America</li>
            <li> I used to own this fragrance back in 2005. It was a very special gift with a funny story. I wanted to have it again and ordered this one. I must say it took me back to the day I was presented it as a gift. Thanks a bunch. Keep it in stock!!</li>
            <li> Great everyday fragrance.  Very good price!</li>
            <li> This is my fav colone. I didn&#x27;t open this package for several weeks. When I did it sprays in a straight line. Not a nice spray. Hate it.</li>
            <li> This product smells OKAY. JUST OKAY. There is NOTHING spectacular or &amp;#34;wowing&amp;#34; about this scent. It&#x27;s also not long-lasting. ONE THING: It is VERY HARD to spray! IT GETS JAMMED EVEN! I HAD TO STOP USING IT AT HALF BOTTLE. IT JUST WOULD NOT SPRAY!</li>
            <li> I have experienced the richness of this EDT before. After a gap, thought I would go back to it. Found a cheaper deal online(almost half of what i paid before). With my fingers crossed, ordered it. To my surprise, the EDT smells close to 85% of what I had been using, and lasts quite long. Worth the money! Also the product came in original packing. Made in USA.</li>
            <li> Thanks! The product was what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item was shipped very promptly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now my daughter can use her own bottle and not her sisters!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a longtime fan of Fcuk. I had been worried about purchasing this sort of product online but thank gosh my worries were unfounded! I&#x27;m pleased by the freshness and crisp scent. Highly recommend!</li>
