            <li>It is really too soon to be sure.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to  Amazon, I was able to&lt;br /&gt;purchase</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s work amazing for black heads.</li>
            <li>I will purchase product again, very soon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Why did the price increase so much ?</li>
            <li>The cap was neither strong not properly fixed.</li>
            <li>Helpful daily usage before application of makeup prevents a dry skin problem.&lt;br /&gt;Soothing and smooth!</li>
            <li>Main thing is to moisturizer and grow old gracefully.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and this product helped me so much.&lt;br /&gt;Btw-</li>
            <li>I estimate it&#x27;s 1-3 yrs old.  </li>
            <li>I bought a set of Onsen products (Onsen basic series, Onsen Micro Water, Body Lotion, Modern Foot Balm, and Moisturizer) in a mall in Thailand.</li>
            <li>I loved it but ordering directly was quite expensive.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure this is the same quality product I originally purchased directly from Onsen.  </li>
            <li>Also, it smells a little different than the first one.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product goes well with Onsen skin toner.  I am pleased with the results and will order again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of moisturizers! This doesn&#x27;t have any powerful effects but I prefer it because it smells great and it doesn&#x27;t leave me excessively oily (t-zone).  I also like the price that I found on Amazon. It beats the heck out of $80.00 for other products...some of which smell of chemicals. Main thing is to moisturizer and grow old gracefully. ;) I also use the daily peel in combination- wonderful as well! Give both a try!</li>
            <li> I totally love Onsen and couldn&#x27;t pass up on such an amazing deal...that being said Onsen has changed their packaging a few times in the last 2 years and this is the older packaging...I estimate it&#x27;s 1-3 yrs old.  As long as it&#x27;s sealed it&#x27;s fine for a few years but make sure when you buy it that it is sealed otherwise I might have gone bad...</li>
            <li> Helpful daily usage before application of makeup prevents a dry skin problem.&lt;br /&gt;Soothing and smooth!</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for the first time in London.  When I ran out of it, I tried to buy it on the Onsen website.  It was $130!!!!!  I couldn&#x27;t believe it and at the time unwilling to pay 130 for a moisturizer.  It is the best moisturizer I have ever used.  It is lightweight, and doesn&#x27;t clog pores.  It is worth every penny and you will not regret ordering this.  AMAZING!!!!!  I am so glad I got it for 1/8 the regular price.</li>
            <li> Love this product! You only need a small amount... Last a long time! I will definitely buy this again and again!</li>
            <li> I guess I kind of got hooked on this moisturizer after getting a free sample in Vegas.  I think it does work well for my skin (ageing) and it is not greasy and does not make me break out.  Great under make up during the day but I wish it had some SPF.  For now, I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s work amazing for black heads. I also had lots of dark spots and I could see after a month really big difference</li>
            <li> Love their products!&lt;br /&gt;the moisturizer and eye products are simply good! I have very sensitive skin and this product helped me so much.&lt;br /&gt;Btw- he exfoliation is also very good and not aggressive which was important for me.</li>
            <li> A good product. A good seller. Love Onsen.</li>
            <li> I bought this moisturizer from an Onsen store in LA.  I loved it but ordering directly was quite expensive.  I&#x27;m not sure this is the same quality product I originally purchased directly from Onsen.  The box is the same but the bottle is different.  Also, it smells a little different than the first one.  I will have to continue using it a while to determine if the effects are the same.</li>
            <li> Onsen&#x27;s Daily Hydration works well on my skin.  I will purchase product again, very soon.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> Love Onsen, my skin look fresh and great!</li>
            <li> I bought a set of Onsen products (Onsen basic series, Onsen Micro Water, Body Lotion, Modern Foot Balm, and Moisturizer) in a mall in Thailand. I was expecting them to enjoy using them, as they were quite expensive. But I had a very bad experience instead. The cap was neither strong not properly fixed. The content got all over my traveling staff. I would not recommend these product, especially of you are traveling! So disappointed!</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer.  The smell, the feel, the texture.  But not anymore .....  Bought it when it was $29, now $130!!  Why did the price increase so much ?</li>
            <li> This product seems to be working ok.  It is really too soon to be sure.  I do like the feel of it.</li>
            <li> I took a chance and bought this lotion on Zulily for 29.99 and I&#x27;m glad I did. I didn&#x27;t know it was this expensive. This moisturizer is light but absorbs in my skin quickly. It smells nice but not too overbearing. I don&#x27;t use a lot and hopefully it will last long. The top is different and fancy; twist it and the pump is ready.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cleanser to try out. My face was always dry and dirty. Washing my with this Onsen Daily Hydration number 3 Collagen Moisture, it is a surprise! You got to try it to believe yourself.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter several months ago from a vendor. She loved it and when I saw it was available through Amazon at a much lower price, I just had to have it. It is lightweight, but yet it provides super hydration. I fly a ton for work and the airplane air tends to dry my skin out. This has eliminated the dry, cracky feeling I get when I fly.</li>
            <li> The moisturizing creme is great; the prize  is even better. Bought the very same product for $130.00 in a mall;; so compare and contrast!</li>
            <li> My Niece gave this to me as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;I ran out of my traditional anti-aging facial cream, so I tried this and I absolutely love it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light but effective in replenishing and hydrating my skin... all day.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now switched to using this product.  Thanks to  Amazon, I was able to&lt;br /&gt;purchase this product at a much more reasonalbe price.  I&#x27;ve seen this&lt;br /&gt;product go for $60-$120, I bought it through Amazon for $29.00.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon for making great products accessible to the consumer&lt;br /&gt;I greatly appreciate it!</li>
