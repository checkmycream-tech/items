            <li>That&#x27;s how great it</li>
            <li>Great for sinuses, headaches, sore spots.  </li>
            <li>In three days of using this product I have seen a great improvement on my heel pain.</li>
            <li>very effective.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think any product could be that good</li>
            <li>we had used it in Germany and liked i. does great on aches and pains.</li>
            <li>good stuff.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am ordering 4 more at your great price and because of shipping time from Thailand&lt;br /&gt;Buy</li>
            <li>i use this first before taking any pain reliever and most of the time it works perfectly</li>
            <li>And love it ,and will order more.</li>
            <li>He said that if it wasn&#x27;t for this he would not have made it through many a match.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE Tiger Balm.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and they all tend to feel better afterwords, so I&#x27;m pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>saved over 3 bucks a jar by buying it through Amazon and the free shipping was nice too.</li>
            <li>It really does work great at relieving pain, and is way better than the stuff you can buy in the store.</li>
            <li>Price was pretty good too.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t smell like Tiger Balm and felt about as strong as baby lotion on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really fine stuff  </li>
            <li>THE BEST MEDICINE FOR MY RIGHT SHOULDER, ARM AND BACK--- GOOD - DEEP LAYERED REFIEF</li>
            <li>/&gt;It did come in a cool hexagonal box and had no English on it whatsoever, so that was kind of neat.</li>
            <li>Tiger balm is a multi-purpose first aid ointment must have!  </li>
            <li>so it takes a while to get it, but it is worth the wait.</li>
            <li>I normally love this product but for some reason, this particular product is not the strength of pain relief that I normally receive when buying this @ Walgreens.  </li>
            <li>and she is not complaining very much anymore.</li>
            <li>It helps my condition very much.</li>
            <li>Your hand became yellow! :)</li>
            <li>I was first given some in Thailand for mosquito bites</li>
            <li>( the Wife...) :&amp;#62;):&amp;#62;):&amp;#62;)</li>
            <li>The only thing TB did was turn my skin yellow; on the plus side it does have a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than Walgreens--</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the bite of the other formula, but that&#x27;s OK.  </li>
            <li>There are various formulas for it and this one seems to contain less menthol than the Ultra Strength version, but it still seems to be effective anyway.  </li>
            <li>The product comes directly from Thailand</li>
            <li>I actually got a hand written note saying thanks for buying it.</li>

            <li> it has done very well with us in the past and now the present.&lt;br /&gt;very</li>
            <li> Be careful with white cloths.</li>
            <li> This is not real Tiger Balm.</li>
            <li> Not only doesn&#x27;t it have the intense smell and sensation of the real product, it has an underlying weird petroleum odor that is disturbing.</li>
            <li> Various aches and pains have surfaced along with the usual knee issues.</li>
            <li> With repetitive use eventually it goes away altogether, except for the knee issue due to the chronic nature that one only eases up.</li>

            <li> I have fibro, arthritis and other sharp pain producing conditions and this WORKS!!  </li>
            <li> I have used Tiger Balm for quite a few years.  </li>
            <li> I feel this is false advertising because your expecting the same pain relief that this product is noted for.</li>
            <li> then I started using it for sore or stiff muscles, sprains, bruises, swollen joints, etc.</li>
            <li> I usually use with my patients (physiotherapist).</li>
            <li> I have used tiger balm a lot in the past.</li>
            <li> This neither had smell, intensity of any tiger balms I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Its a small jar</li>
            <li> Common sense.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was a bad batch or what, but it simply didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This seemed like a fake balm.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, this Tiger Balm was useless.</li>
            <li> It is useless.</li>
            <li> Put a teaspoon in your bath water or rub on after bath, rub it on swollen glands in the neck to cure  a cold.</li>
            <li> my wife has really bad pain in her hands  </li>
            <li> It was like rubbing vasoline on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely worthless.  </li>

            <li> Good price, this balm is great for pain! I usually use with my patients (physiotherapist). Be careful with white cloths. It can blur... Your hand became yellow! :)</li>
            <li> I heard about this product,and tried it.And love it ,and will order more.My daughter use it as well and have told her friends&lt;br /&gt;about it.</li>
            <li> Tiger balm is a multi-purpose first aid ointment must have!  I was first given some in Thailand for mosquito bites then I started using it for sore or stiff muscles, sprains, bruises, swollen joints, etc.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even want to give this 1 star, Tiger Balm did not work for me.  I was looking for something to help my sore knees &amp; muscles and was very disappointed with this product.  The only thing TB did was turn my skin yellow; on the plus side it does have a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Found this product through my sensi. He said that if it wasn&#x27;t for this he would not have made it through many a match.  I didn&#x27;t think any product could be that good but I too became a believer. I have been doing P90X for several months and pushing it. Various aches and pains have surfaced along with the usual knee issues. I put on the tiger balm and it eases away the pain.  With repetitive use eventually it goes away altogether, except for the knee issue due to the chronic nature that one only eases up. The product comes directly from Thailand so it takes a while to get it, but it is worth the wait. The 1st couple of times I ordered it I actually got a hand written note saying thanks for buying it. Obviously a company that cares.</li>
            <li> I have used several versions of the tiger balm product line. This version works best for me and smells the best.</li>
            <li> This seemed like a fake balm. I have used tiger balm a lot in the past. This neither had smell, intensity of any tiger balms I have used in the past. Seemed like orange colored wax.</li>
            <li> very effective. every time i got a headache i use this first before taking any pain reliever and most of the time it works perfectly and i don&#x27;t need to take any pain reliever.. i guess it&#x27;s safer that way..recommended!</li>
            <li> I LOVE Tiger Balm. Love it. I use the red extra strength almost every day. It stains my clothes and pillows and I don&#x27;t even care. That&#x27;s how great it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this Tiger Balm was useless. I don&#x27;t know if it was a bad batch or what, but it simply didn&#x27;t work. Didn&#x27;t smell like Tiger Balm and felt about as strong as baby lotion on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did come in a cool hexagonal box and had no English on it whatsoever, so that was kind of neat. Still, I&#x27;d rather have Tiger Balm that works. I recommend getting your Tiger Balm from a different source.</li>
            <li> I have fibro, arthritis and other sharp pain producing conditions and this WORKS!!  Don&#x27;t let the size confuse you&lt;br /&gt;, it packs a punch and stops topical pain.  Linda RNBSN</li>
            <li> Really fine stuff  my wife has really bad pain in her hands  she uses this on her hands both AM &amp; PM and she is not complaining very much anymore. I am ordering 4 more at your great price and because of shipping time from Thailand&lt;br /&gt;Buy it and try it, you will like it.&lt;br /&gt;Bob</li>
            <li> I have used this since the 1970&#x27;s.  Great for sinuses, headaches, sore spots.  A little goes a long way !</li>
            <li> THE BEST MEDICINE FOR MY RIGHT SHOULDER, ARM AND BACK--- GOOD - DEEP LAYERED REFIEF I RECCOMEND IT TO EVERY ONE I KNOW</li>
            <li> I normally love this product but for some reason, this particular product is not the strength of pain relief that I normally receive when buying this @ Walgreens.  It was like rubbing vasoline on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely worthless.  I feel this is false advertising because your expecting the same pain relief that this product is noted for.</li>
            <li> When I bought this I thought it would be a bigger jar, but considering the price I am not complaining. Its a small jar but it does the trick when you have aches and pains.</li>
            <li> In three days of using this product I have seen a great improvement on my heel pain. Who would have thought it would work so well.</li>
            <li> I have used Tiger Balm for quite a few years.  There are various formulas for it and this one seems to contain less menthol than the Ultra Strength version, but it still seems to be effective anyway.  It doesn&#x27;t have the bite of the other formula, but that&#x27;s OK.  I&#x27;d rather have something that works and this seems to.  I put it on my shoulders, lower back, and knees and they all tend to feel better afterwords, so I&#x27;m pleased with this product.  Price was pretty good too.  Much cheaper than Walgreens--saved over 3 bucks a jar by buying it through Amazon and the free shipping was nice too.</li>
            <li> we had used it in Germany and liked i. does great on aches and pains. tell our friends about it also. it has done very well with us in the past and now the present.&lt;br /&gt;very good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;does not rlieve the pain in the butt though ( the Wife...) :&amp;#62;):&amp;#62;):&amp;#62;)</li>
            <li> It helps with the relief of pain I had. I do recommend it to others. But just do not over do it, like anything else.It helps my condition very much.</li>
            <li> Put a teaspoon in your bath water or rub on after bath, rub it on swollen glands in the neck to cure  a cold. Common sense.</li>
            <li> It really does work great at relieving pain, and is way better than the stuff you can buy in the store.</li>
            <li> This is not real Tiger Balm. Not only doesn&#x27;t it have the intense smell and sensation of the real product, it has an underlying weird petroleum odor that is disturbing. It is useless.</li>
