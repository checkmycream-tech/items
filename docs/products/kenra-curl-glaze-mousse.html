            <li>and I have received many, many compliments on the change.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>What can you lose?\\&quot; Boy, am I glad I tried it</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>One of the things with curly hair is you have to get the product and try it more than once.</li>
            <li>We both love it.</li>
            <li>and I use this with another product and love it.</li>
            <li>It was Ok,.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>My best suggestion would be try the amount that works for you on your hair, its all different for everyone.</li>
            <li>Works better than anything else I have used.</li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>She is equally selective in her hair product choices and I was delighted that she was as excited as I am about this great find.</li>
            <li>It makes my fresh perm smell great, and adds just the right amount of shine and hold.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and this stuff works great to keep the curl from frizzing and makes your hair look shiny.</li>
            <li>It does not work for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>But for us with fine hair</li>
            <li>Great for short tousled hair.  </li>
            <li>She said, \\&quot;It&#x27;s free.</li>
            <li>I was so excited about it that I bought some for my sister-in-law for Christmas.</li>
            <li>This is a good product, but I am way more partial to the Kenra Curl Defining Creme.  </li>
            <li>this is great stuff I put it on my wet hair and style with blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>Nice soft curls no hair spray needed</li>
            <li>Thank You~Super Fast Shipping!!</li>
            <li>A little bit of this product give me great volume.</li>
            <li>Holds hair exceptionally well, and doesn&#x27;t look crusty after your curls dry.</li>
            <li>My hair looked &amp; felt frizzy even after the third time of using this product I added conditioner to soften my hair and still my hair was Some what crunchy, frizzy, wirey and not a single comment on how beautiful my hair appeared.</li>
            <li>I have fine, wavy hair and have used many hair products over my long life,  Most have been professional products</li>
            <li>I have big Curly long colored hair that everyone Stops me to address how beautiful it is...</li>
            <li>sure enough the lady was right.</li>
            <li>and now I have several on hand to be sure I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this I wasn&#x27;t impressed and thought it was just expensive mousse.  </li>
            <li>About 1.5 years ago, my teen-age daughter suggested that I try a different hair style and clipped out several that she thought would look good.</li>
            <li>I use a fair amount for upper back length hair, and apply when my hair is still wet and dripping- scrunch in, plop, and love my hair the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>Once it got some length on it, we decided to make the switch to a natural,curly style that would be easy to take care of and that was similar to what I was trying to achieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have short, no body, and fine hair.  </li>
            <li>curly removes the frizz and it feels good it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or hard</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it and stand by it for the rest of my life as long as it stays on the market. :)</li>
            <li>The two products in combination allow gentle curls without frizz that hold up all day.</li>
            <li>I only tried it because it came as a free sample with the hair spray I bought at my stylist&#x27;s salon.</li>
            <li>really like this product.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t looking so much for volume</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>But it is better than other profucts I have tried, I prefer the Kenra defining cream.</li>
            <li>Next time use more of less depending on your original results.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and limp.</li>
            <li>I live in a very humid area and my curls get frizzy and out of control if I do not use some type of product.  </li>
            <li>I lightly blow it dry with a defuser while crunching the hair with my hands.</li>
            <li>This product came highly recommended by both a stylist friend and a fellow curly girl.</li>
            <li>I suggest highly you try this.</li>
            <li>I use about a little more than a quarter size.</li>
            <li>It says to rub your hands together until the product is clear, or maybe they are using too much product.</li>
            <li>This works better on my hair than any mousse I have tried, and I have tried quite a few.</li>
            <li>spend a few $$ more &amp; try Lakme2</li>
            <li>Most of the time I have tried to rid myself of the wave and have worn it very short and blew it dry to straighten it out.</li>
            <li>It is not heavy,&lt;br /&gt;overly perfumed or stiff as many cheaper mousse products are.</li>
            <li>so I was very surprised.</li>
            <li>just very soft</li>
            <li>instructions tell you to spray the mousse into your hands and rub your hands till the mousse turns clear, then apply to your hair.  </li>
            <li>I apply a bit of Kenra Curl Glaze Mousse and then follow that with the Redken soft spin 05.</li>
            <li>She uses it for everyone, not just those with natural curl.  </li>
            <li>My hair has shine and it has a healthy look that I have never accomplished with any other product.</li>
            <li>It provides my baby-fine hair with enough texture that I can easily blow dry and style my hair at the same time.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine, very short, a little wavy</li>
            <li>Most other gel/mousse brands weigh my hair down and the curls just straighten.  </li>
            <li>I have such thick hair that 1-2 pumps like most directions suggest</li>
            <li>It is fine, thick, and wavy.</li>
            <li>Instant Hair Conditioner &amp; wells Professional Elastic Energy Curl</li>
            <li>I never knew there was a way to have soft curls last all day long.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t believe at 36 years of age I finally find something amazing for this crazy hair.  </li>

            <li> Received be4 expected.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick and naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> I use a small amount of this on wet hair and then dry it, flat iron it and use a wax to spike it out.</li>

            <li> Neither product weight my hair down.</li>
            <li> like all mousses it left my hair a little bit hard.</li>
            <li> I also used less then a dime of Kenra Shine Serum (did not grease up my hair) to see if both would work</li>
            <li> and I like to wear it messy and spiky.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it was sticky at all, once it dried I ran my fingers through my hair</li>
            <li> money wasted.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to crunchy, hard and crackly curls....</li>
            <li> My hair feels heavy and dirty after I put it on; when I brush my hair, curls disappear.</li>
            <li> Kerastas is my fav but too expensive.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be sorry.  </li>
            <li> Sorry ladies for those with curls</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Nice smell and that is what I can say about this product. It does not work for my fine hair. My hair feels heavy and dirty after I put it on; when I brush my hair, curls disappear.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick and naturally curly hair. I went to my salon and had  my hair colored and the stylist used this product and I can&#x27;t believe how great it is! My hair is always dry and frizzy and I&#x27;ve tried hundreds of different products to try to tame it. This is the best! Finally I have found something to help my hair. If you have very thick, very curly and very dry hair this product is for you!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by a lady at Ulta and I said what the heck I have tried and returned all the other products and another one will not hurt.&lt;br /&gt;Well sure enough the lady was right. The product is beyond amazing. I just bought it yesterday and it does not get sticky on your fingers/hair and the best part there is no flacking after running my fingers through my hair. It has given my curls definition and shine. I also used less then a dime of Kenra Shine Serum (did not grease up my hair) to see if both would work and yes they did. My hair has shine and it has a healthy look that I have never accomplished with any other product. Neither product weight my hair down. And let me say I have tried a lot and I even tried a 30 dollar product last weekend that after my hair dried up I literally looked like I had been though the Amazon Rainforest and back. I am not from the States so that is the reason I say that. My hair is long, curly and dry but not heavy/thick curly so I was very surprised. I have to say this product is wonderful for curly hair. Just try it once and see the results. I have been looking and trying different products all of my life and I can&#x27;t believe at 36 years of age I finally find something amazing for this crazy hair.  I highly recommend it and stand by it for the rest of my life as long as it stays on the market. :)</li>
            <li> This is so different from anything I ever used!  Great for short tousled hair.  Comes out as a foam and you rub your fingers together and put it on your already dry hair.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great product for wavy to curly hair. Holds hair exceptionally well, and doesn&#x27;t look crusty after your curls dry. I use a fair amount for upper back length hair, and apply when my hair is still wet and dripping- scrunch in, plop, and love my hair the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> This product came highly recommended by both a stylist friend and a fellow curly girl.</li>
            <li> Luv it! Makes my hair curly and has a good hold.</li>
            <li> My entire life I have fought my hair (what woman hasn&#x27;t ?). It is fine, thick, and wavy. Most of the time I have tried to rid myself of the wave and have worn it very short and blew it dry to straighten it out. About 1.5 years ago, my teen-age daughter suggested that I try a different hair style and clipped out several that she thought would look good. Since it was probably time for a change, I took the pile of clippings to my stylist and asked what she thought. She was encouraging and I began the process of growing it out. Once it got some length on it, we decided to make the switch to a natural,curly style that would be easy to take care of and that was similar to what I was trying to achieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now wear my hair longer and curly all over but with no chemicals of any kind - including hair color. This product is part of my hair care regime and I love it. I apply a bit of Kenra Curl Glaze Mousse and then follow that with the Redken soft spin 05. I lightly blow it dry with a defuser while crunching the hair with my hands. The result had been wonderful. I now have \\&quot;curly\\&quot; hair (vs. wavy) and I have received many, many compliments on the change. The two products in combination allow gentle curls without frizz that hold up all day. A wonderful product that does exactly what I want it to do --</li>
            <li> I have a combination of curly and frizzy hair. This product is the best I&#x27;ve ever used I highly recommend it to anybody with hair like mine it keeps my hair curly removes the frizz and it feels good it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or hard</li>
            <li> My stylist used this on my hair and I love it. My hair is fine, very short, a little wavy and I like to wear it messy and spiky. I use a small amount of this on wet hair and then dry it, flat iron it and use a wax to spike it out.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product for putting and keeping waves and curl in fine hair. I was so excited about it that I bought some for my sister-in-law for Christmas. She is equally selective in her hair product choices and I was delighted that she was as excited as I am about this great find. I only tried it because it came as a free sample with the hair spray I bought at my stylist&#x27;s salon. I told her I didnt even need that. She said, \\&quot;It&#x27;s free. What can you lose?\\&quot; Boy, am I glad I tried it and now I have several on hand to be sure I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful and nice smelling product for a fresh permed or curly hair. I love it. It makes my fresh perm smell great, and adds just the right amount of shine and hold. would buy it again.</li>
            <li> My stylist used this in my hair. I have 3b curls. They are tight/spirally and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product. I don&#x27;t think it was sticky at all, once it dried I ran my fingers through my hair and it was not crunchy at all. Perhaps people aren&#x27;t reading the directions. It says to rub your hands together until the product is clear, or maybe they are using too much product. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products. Kerastas is my fav but too expensive. But I&#x27;ve tried Pantene, Loreal, Bumble and Bumble, Frieda, regular hair gel, garnier and some others. But this is one of my fav&#x27;s. One of the things with curly hair is you have to get the product and try it more than once. Next time use more of less depending on your original results. I have such thick hair that 1-2 pumps like most directions suggest is just silly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I like this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 7 years. I have naturally curly hair and this stuff works great to keep the curl from frizzing and makes your hair look shiny.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this I wasn&#x27;t impressed and thought it was just expensive mousse.  Then I got a magnifying glass to read the instructions and the results are awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions tell you to spray the mousse into your hands and rub your hands till the mousse turns clear, then apply to your hair.  The result is great, nothing else has done this for me.  I&#x27;m used to crunchy, hard and crackly curls....this doesn&#x27;t leave  your hair crunchy....just very soft but it holds your curls!  I never knew there was a way to have soft curls last all day long.</li>
            <li> My curly to frizzy hair is smoother and easier to manage with a bit of Kenra Mousse. It is not heavy,&lt;br /&gt;overly perfumed or stiff as many cheaper mousse products are. It holds the curl and helps to keep my&lt;br /&gt;hair from being frizzy in humid weather. I wish they made a travel size.</li>
            <li> Great product for hair styling - does not leave a sticky residue, and gives you all day hold...PLUS it is NOT tested on animals!</li>
            <li> Not worth the money I paid for this. It smells great, but it&#x27;s a bit sticky.</li>
            <li> I have fine, wavy hair and have used many hair products over my long life,  Most have been professional products and I have discarded after one use.....money wasted.  Take my word ....buy it.....you won&#x27;t be sorry.  You can put it on dry hair.  Just rub your hands together with product...do the scrunch thing and you are done.</li>
            <li> This is amazing.  it is NOT like regular mouse that make your hair bigger.  You rub this between your hands until the foam is gone and THEN you put it on your hair.  It defines your curls and keeps frizz at bay.  I have used it on my Caucasian waves and my DIL on her Ethnic curls.  We both love it.</li>
            <li> this is great stuff I put it on my wet hair and style with blow dryer.  Gives me volume but not sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Makes my hair shine and defines the curls.  I live in a very humid area and my curls get frizzy and out of control if I do not use some type of product.  Most other gel/mousse brands weigh my hair down and the curls just straighten.  This product allows the curls to be well defined.</li>
            <li> Received be4 expected.Thanks</li>
            <li> Nice soft curls no hair spray needed</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and limp. A little bit of this product give me great volume. Love this product!</li>
            <li> love this product!! Service was awesome.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, but I am way more partial to the Kenra Curl Defining Creme.  It is the bomb!</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and I use this with another product and love it. it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking like it has product in it.</li>
            <li> It was Ok,. like all mousses it left my hair a little bit hard. But it is better than other profucts I have tried, I prefer the Kenra defining cream.</li>
            <li> I have short, no body, and fine hair.  My hair dresser tried this on me. I love it. This works better on my hair than any mousse I have tried, and I have tried quite a few. I just wanted my hair to look thicker and this does work. I wasn&#x27;t looking so much for volume but I do get some with this. I use about a little more than a quarter size. My best suggestion would be try the amount that works for you on your hair, its all different for everyone. Sorry ladies for those with curls I cannot give you a review ha ha. But for us with fine hair I suggest highly you try this.</li>
            <li> I learned about this product from my hairstylist.  She uses it for everyone, not just those with natural curl.  It provides my baby-fine hair with enough texture that I can easily blow dry and style my hair at the same time.  Works better than anything else I have used.</li>
            <li> Makes fairly good curls or waves</li>
            <li> I am still waiting on this product. I haven&#x27;t received it yet.  I love the product. I purchased it at a saloon.</li>
            <li> good price, quick shipment</li>
            <li> Thank You~Super Fast Shipping!! AWESOME Product!!!</li>
            <li> Works very well. Has good hold and easy to style</li>
            <li> I have big Curly long colored hair that everyone Stops me to address how beautiful it is... This Product Kenra is STICKY from start to Finnish.. My hair looked &amp; felt frizzy even after the third time of using this product I added conditioner to soften my hair and still my hair was Some what crunchy, frizzy, wirey and not a single comment on how beautiful my hair appeared. Actually ppl ask are you using something different in your hair? I said Yes! They said Don&#x27;t use it again.. This product is for newbies who are still looking for the BEST CURL CONTROL PRODUCT.. Please save your money spend a few $$ more &amp; try Lakme2 Instant Hair Conditioner &amp; wells Professional Elastic Energy Curl Enhancing mousse.. This is the best of the best for Curly, colored or not curly hair..</li>
