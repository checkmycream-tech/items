            <li>The hair looked pretty at first then about a week later the hair started to tangle easy and look matted</li>

            <li>I do expect the hair to shed because its man made and my real hair shed and its made by god.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the best hair I have ever purchsed and at a very reasonable price. I was out in the hot humid weather and it didnt POOF like some hair that I have had in the past. It is light and very soft. Blends very well with my hair.</li>
            <li> Did NOT LIKE THE GRADE OF THIS HAIR&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> This hair is thinner than the picture makes it seem. Curl pattern is also a bit different. Otherwise, texture is nice.</li>
            <li> I must say I really really really love this hair I ordered this hair on the 30th and received it to day I on the 5th right before school started. I love the hair itself I just didn&#x27;t like it when I brushed it out it kind of look to thick (I HAVE 3 BUNDLES). So I flat wrapped it to see how it turn out in the morning. I do expect the hair to shed because its man made and my real hair shed and its made by god. So far I have nothing negative to say about the hair. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> Probably the best service I have received for hair...and what amazing hair it is! Right after I placed the order, I requested for the grey hairs to be removed since I had seen others commenting about it. In less than 24hrs, I was contacted saying that they could :D I won&#x27;t be buying hair from anywhere else!!! Thankya!</li>
            <li> the customer service experience was A1. My hair arrive on time i think a day or so early actually in basic packaging but protective packaging. Getting such a good deal on the hair i was suprised at the wonderful quality and customer experience i actually had. The old saying goes you get what you pay for and with pst experience i got just that but this time i had my faith restored in customer service and quality. I would have given 5 stars BUT the only hang up i have had is the fact that the hair does not hold curls very long espcially in the back for some reason but other than that i again am extremely satisfied!must buy!</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair about a week ago and I was scared at first to get this hair cuz it was so cheap but I must say I love the hair I purchased two bundles an I had hair left over and my hair is fun I will buy again fro this company</li>
            <li> The hair started to tangle as soon as I&#x27;d opened the package. It&#x27;s low grade and it had a very messy appearance once I had it installed. I&#x27;ve purchased cheaper hair with a better texture and quality. Never again.</li>
            <li> You definitely are getting what you paying for.  It&#x27;s good hair for 24 - 72 hours. Will not ever purchase cheap hair again. Might as well add about $100 to the amount the hair cost get yourself some more expensive hair. Tangled up in 3 days. Broke my neck out, which let&#x27;s me know it&#x27;s synthetic not human. See what I get for trying to be cheap! No &#x27;mo!</li>
            <li> This hair is beautiful!!! I was skeptical at first because i mean really $28 but it&#x27;s perfect. It came wayyyy faster than the estimated delivery date said it would. The hair has very minimal shedding. I made clip-ins with the hair &amp; i did a red ombre with the hair without using bleach &amp; it came out gorgeous. I hope it lasts very long i&#x27;ll keep you updated, but i definitely recommend it to everyone</li>
            <li> Like most of the negative reviews hair looked good for almost a week then became a knotted rats nets! I couldnt even run my fingers through it without them getting caught ugh! Now i have to spend another $150+ to look good so disappointed!</li>
            <li> The hair is really nice and the it styles the way you want it, but the weft isn&#x27;t very strong and it takes to long to ship.</li>
            <li> I ordered 14 in Remy and ended up with 12 \\&quot; Remy, but it took so long to get here I put it in anyways instead of re ordering. They will not be getting any more of my business.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous hair ever.....at first I didn&#x27;t believe the hair will last duo to the negative comments I saw here... I decided to give it a try since is cheap, wen the hair arrived, it was so soft and nice looking. I didn&#x27;t feel so comfortable even at that,  three days later I insight it.... After two weeks I washed it and to my surprise the curls was still there and it didn&#x27;t tangle..  After one month the hair still look nice and beautiful,,, am happy to tell you guys that it has been three months and I still have this hair on..soft and tangle free.... Am recommending this hair to everybody....  The hair is ver ver very good....am here today to purchase for my sis in africa...</li>
            <li> The hair looked pretty at first then about a week later the hair started to tangle easy and look matted and it had alot of gray strands in it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this hair and had a bad experience I tried contacting the seller but never got a response. That&#x27;s rude and I don&#x27;t like being ignored more then I didn&#x27;t like the hair. I want replacement hair or a refund this hair didn&#x27;t last a week. I&#x27;m pissed off</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something new and overall this hair was great, I love it and will be ordering again.👏👏</li>
            <li> I started purchasing my hair from Empyrean Hair Extensions and I have to say that it was the best move I ever made. I have been a stylist for ten years and have bought \\&quot;Virgin\\&quot; hair from many different suppliers. I am so happy that I found this hair because it is the only one that actually lives up to the claims. It is truly virgin hair that hasn&#x27;t had any chemical treatments. It is soft, silky and doesnt shed or tangle at all. I have had clients that have re-used the same hair three times over a 6-7 month period and it still was the same as when I first installed it. Stylists, if you would rather your clients pay you, instead of the beauty supply shop, BUY THIS HAIR!!</li>
            <li> I ordered straight hair, but received curly wavy hair, had a lot of short hairs and uneven strings, lots of them.. wouldn&#x27;t buy this again,</li>
            <li> I order 14 and got 12inches the 18was on the other hair that I got 18 and got 14 or 12 sorry y&#x27;all I&#x27;m piss</li>
            <li> i always get my hair off amazon because  it is really brazilian hair and is well worth the money .....</li>
            <li> The hair was way shorter than 14inches. I haven&#x27;t used the hair yet but it&#x27;s really soft to the touch. The only complaint I have is the length.</li>
            <li> This hair Is NICE.It Can be Dyed i dyed it ..and it took thee color,soft true to length also irwhen u wash it it goes cake to its oringinal State :)...i only bought one bundle imma have a partical i looks enought so i have no worrys</li>
            <li> The worst purchase on Amazon to date! I wrote a review on this purchase and someone took it down, so I&#x27;m writing it again. the packagign and quality of the hair is beyone poor. It seemed to be a blens of 4, 6, 8, 10,12 and 14 inches. The hair was pre-layered and it sheds. The selled sent me several e-mail asking me to take down my negative comments before I can get my refund!!! The seller wrote &amp;#34;i can refund you and but pls help me to remove your this negative feedback then i will refund you all money iS USD88 TO YOU immediatly ,&lt;br /&gt;is ito k?&lt;br /&gt;sorry ,the feedback is really very important for me and for my jobs&lt;br /&gt;pls give me support and then&lt;br /&gt;i will do my promise to refund you immediatly ,ok?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Terribe hair and the is the worst customer service experience I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> this hair was very poor quality , tangles very easily and constantly in the back ,sheds and some strands have already come out</li>
            <li> I got hair in a 28\\&quot; ..took about 3 dayz ....soldt and pretty loyal to the lengh it tangles a bit mainly at tips I have to keep it braided most of the time...smh ...hair is thin. But has thick wefts...il give this company a second chance but wit diffeeent hair</li>
            <li> I PURCHASED THIS HAIR DUE TO THE RATINGS THAT WAS POSTED. I HATE THIS HAIR BECAUSE IT WAS NOT ALL WHAT THE RATINGS HAD POSTED. PLUS IT WAS NOT WORTH THE MONEY THEY ARE CHARGING, IT WAS NOT A FULL BUNDLE IT WOULD TAKE (4) TO DO AFULL HEAD, WHERE OTHERS (2) IS ENOUGH TO DO A FULL HEAD. NO I WILL NOT RECOMMEND THIS HAIR TO NO ONE. I DIDN&#x27;T EVEN USE IT JUST AWASTE OF M-O-N-E-Y!!!!</li>
            <li> I love it , thanks Amazon ,</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this hair at all.  I purchased some other hair a different brand, that I absolutely loved.  This hair was definitely a let down. I just did not even like the look of it.  it was very dry looking and not the color I asked for.  I know that sometimes you can get a bad batch of hair just like anything else, but I probably would not order this particular hair again.</li>
            <li> I just received my hair and I must say that I&#x27;m truly impressed and I can tell that this hair is of superb quality and I am looking forward to ordering so much more also they really give you complete instructions on how to maintain the hair I truly will recommend this hair to friends and family</li>
            <li> Weft was thick with a good amount of hair attached, &amp; there has been minimal shedding. This hair does tangle, though. Its just not good quality hair. Will most likely only last through one install...</li>
