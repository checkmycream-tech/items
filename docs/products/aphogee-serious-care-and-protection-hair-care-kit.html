    <ol>
            <li>i guess it would be best used with a moisturising conditioner after use.     </li>
            <li>Aphogee is an amazing product!!!..</li>
            <li>For the price I was very happy.  </li>
            <li>This product made my hair increasingly strong after just one use!!!!</li>
            <li>THEN THESE THREE GUYS WILL BE YOUR HAIR&#x27;S BEST FRIEND</li>
            <li>Aphogee is the truth it is great for any and every ethnicity.</li>
            <li>lol)</li>
            <li>Great product for rebuilding the strength and feel of your hair.</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>THIS WILL BE ALL YOU NEED TO BE OFF TO A GREAT START WITH YOUR HAIR CARE ROUTINE.</li>
            <li>great product.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are good</li>
            <li>The one thing any good hair dresser should do for her clients who have chemicals on their hair is recommend that their clients add some protein every once in a while to their hair (depending on each persons hair condition).</li>
            <li>Works good for 4C hair.</li>
            <li>They also ship the product in a good timely manner and my product were in tact as well.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is good too.</li>
            <li>good product.</li>
            <li>Shampoo smells nice almost like a gatorade and is a great shampoo.</li>
            <li>Good luck everyone! :)</li>
            <li>THIS IS TRULY A GREAT START TO HEALTHY BREAK-FREE HAIR, I PROMISE.</li>
            <li>I love it !</li>
            <li>It smells amazing</li>
            <li>well i decided to try this to see if it could kind of fix my hair cause</li>
            <li>I have had the greatest success at a salon with the brazillian blowout keratin treatment and would love to have it done every three months</li>
            <li>Really nice product.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to Ateeyaa on youtube for showing the world about this wonderful haircare product....</li>
            <li>but honestly I have tryed much better shampoo/ conditioners from Walmart or Target.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, along the way I have been blessed to have a good hairdresser or two.</li>
            <li>guess would be more effective for people with the breaking hair type :)</li>
            <li>I really am glad I tried this product and will buy it again.</li>
            <li>It help repair damaged hair but once your hair is healthy it doesnt work anymore</li>
            <li>However, I know that this product will work for many who has hair problems like myself.</li>
            <li>They are famous among all the hair boards for their protein treatments which begin working ASAP.</li>
            <li>I have experimented with many treatments from beauty supply stores in town and from online stores.  </li>
            <li>and I will be buying more soon.</li>
            <li>Love Love Love Aphogee</li>
            <li>These products are awesome in bringing the hair back to life..</li>
            <li>and I love the products.  </li>
            <li>a good combo price Def worth it</li>
            <li>The 2minute reconstructer does a great job and has really helped my hair.</li>
            <li>It was generally ok.</li>
            <li>These are good products and they&#x27;re priced right.</li>
            <li>has grown 2 inches and is very full and healthy.</li>
            <li>I have always loved aphogee products ever since my sister gave me a regimen for growing my hair back healthy amazing and quality product that works.</li>
            <li>I really like Aphogee products they work really good</li>
            <li>They cost more, but are definitely better quality and worth the money.</li>
            <li>My styles would not hold beyond one or two days before the frizz took strong hold.</li>
            <li>The product today does not have as strong of a smell as it did 15 years ago.     </li>
            <li>My hair has some gray, is fine in texture</li>
            <li>However it does not smell nearly as nice as the coco-smelling keratin products out there but works well for the amazing low price tag.  </li>
            <li>Ive never gotten such great results as i have with the conditioner.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and 2minute restore/conditioner are okay and do smell pretty.  </li>
            <li>I went  from breakage of  100 plus hair or more to  absolutely zero in one treatment!</li>
            <li>Hair is clean curls are defined and manageable</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner were great for my dry, damaged hair.  </li>
            <li>but the second time was better since I knew what to expect and used a spray bottle (top) to apply the treatment easily since it is liquidity</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t seem to do anything special...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many hair care products--I can absolutely say that this product has done wonders for my hair.  </li>
            <li>THE SUPER HEROS OF HAIR CARE IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE #1.</li>
            <li>thanks aphogee for such a great product that I could use myself at an affordabe price for me.</li>
            <li>Using a natural protien treatment now, it seems to work better.</li>
            <li>I tried these products after I was not having any success with any others for my shedding thinning hair.</li>
            <li>this product helps the hair grow and strengthens it, the coconut finish smell alone is worth the wash.  </li>
            <li>the silky finish is worth it.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t start right away like the website said, but today I wore my hair out</li>
            <li>My hair was very soft, shiny and I received compliments the next day on how good it looked.</li>
            <li>Aphogee does work but not like what you will see with the brazillian blowout straight &amp; softness (like virgin hair); nor for the full six weeks as Aphogee bottle directs to use (the smallest bottle is the treatment).  </li>
            <li>because it REALLY does work for full three months but at around $300 a pop.  </li>
            <li>since I could not afford hair treatments done professionally I decided to try aphogee hair protection treatment, and what a good decision this was, because as of now I am noticeing a big change in the condition of my hair</li>
            <li>I used the products as directed and after the first application my hair stopped breaking.  </li>
            <li>i had straight hair!</li>
            <li>so i ended up adding FHI hot sauce to my hair after that for moisturising purposes.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I found better products that instantly give results.</li>
            <li>From the first application I noticed a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>I really recommend it!</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because its has sodium laureth sulfate, i think that is why it didn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft as sulfate and paraben free shampoos.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and clean for days and tangled-free.</li>
            <li>These treatments are good and way more expensive in salons.</li>
            <li>i dont really know the effects</li>
            <li>I really wanted keratin treatment which these products have keratin in them</li>
            <li>and my hair was very damaged and the shampoo didn&#x27;t seem to do much</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone who wants to stop breakage.</li>
            <li>IF YOU DON&#x27;T WANT TO INVEST IN THE WHOLE LINE OF APHOGEE</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m  in the process of getting ready to try the two step protein treatment because of the reviews I&#x27;ve been seeing on Youtube.  </li>
            <li>the shampoo lathers really well and the citrus scent awakens the scalp.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recall the effect on my hair then because I was a product junkie and my hair was much stronger and resilient than now.</li>
            <li>I used all three products combined and did not feel it took as much time as some stated, but I suppose that time can vary depending on the length of your hair (mine is shoulder-length).</li>
            <li>The protein small bottle is very sticky and doesnt smell very well however after it hardens and you rinse with warm water</li>
            <li>The shampoo was better than average, but the treatment really made no difference.</li>
            <li>My hair was left very nice and soft for about a week and a half.  </li>
            <li>If you have damage hair, I highly recommend these products😉</li>
            <li>Maybe my expectations were too high.</li>
            <li>hair grew significantly but protien treatment can dry out hair so moisturize moisturize.</li>
            <li>Excellent for chemically treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using these products for three months now and my hair is recovering from a bad highlight process.&lt;br /&gt;It makes hair stronger and healthier.</li>
            <li>really helped my natural hair journey be patient</li>
            <li>, well,thats a different story,lol but worth the results.</li>
            <li>It is worth a try though, even if only for the shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li>Ladies not only this product is priced just right</li>
            <li>and I was amazed how soft my hair was after the treatment!</li>
            <li>the first time was definitely the messiest</li>
            <li>If you use it on a regular basis, on the other hand, as per the directions, and use A VERY GOOD DEEP CONDITIONER afterwards I promise you will see less breakage.</li>
            <li>The treatment is very difficult to do by yourself (as it stiffens like a rock very quickly and you do not want to damage your hair by combing or pulling through with fingers), and take a good two-three hours for long hair.  </li>
            <li>And the leave in conditioner makes your hair hard my hair dresser advised me not to u it any more.</li>
            <li>It really works🏄 my hair was so damage by hair dye, it felt like straw😣, however, these products  soften it and stop massive hair breakag.</li>
            <li>cause I swam a lot when i was young and stuff.</li>
            <li>when i was really young</li>
            <li>actually i dont really see any difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>It brings out my natural hair color.</li>
            <li>But its better late than never.  </li>
            <li>Ive only used it once, blowdried it onto my hair, and it really made no difference at all.</li>
            <li>The product is slowly for surely working on my hair.</li>
            <li>As an African American who has experienced extreme breakage thought my life, I highly recommend this product to ANYONE who has excessive breakage and shedding.</li>
            <li>The reconstructor is good my hair was super soft, but it didn&#x27;t repair any damage:(</li>
            <li>When I first started my hair journey my hair was dry and brittle and being</li>
            <li>After using the full protein treatment line, I noticed how soft my hair was and there was little loss/shedding.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a Asian chinese with pretty screwed up hair</li>
            <li>(so it appears very full and thick).  </li>
            <li>my hair is really frizzy and dry and brittle.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product package because I was having severe breaking and could barely touch it without it snapping.  </li>
            <li>I used this on my hair and it was instantly manageable, soft and stopped a lot of the breakage.</li>
            <li>I had used the old protein formula well over fifteen years ago and ended up giving the bottle away because I only used it once.</li>
            <li>african american finding good hair care products can be so difficult after about 5-6 months of using aphogee my hair</li>
            <li>My hair was indeed softer after shampooing and using the reconstructor however, I have not used the protien because this is not the complete set, and I don&#x27;t want to mess around with pure protien..</li>
            <li>and I was too scared to do the treatment as my hair was very damaged but not spongy like other people</li>
            <li>I am full African American and I have poofy thick hair and this works wonders.</li>

            <li> It is worth a try though, even if only for the shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> Ladies not only this product is priced just right</li>
            <li> and I was amazed how soft my hair was after the treatment!</li>
            <li> the first time was definitely the messiest</li>
            <li> If you use it on a regular basis, on the other hand, as per the directions, and use A VERY GOOD DEEP CONDITIONER afterwards I promise you will see less breakage.</li>
            <li> The treatment is very difficult to do by yourself (as it stiffens like a rock very quickly and you do not want to damage your hair by combing or pulling through with fingers), and take a good two-three hours for long hair.  </li>
            <li> And the leave in conditioner makes your hair hard my hair dresser advised me not to u it any more.</li>
            <li> It really works🏄 my hair was so damage by hair dye, it felt like straw😣, however, these products  soften it and stop massive hair breakag.</li>
            <li> cause I swam a lot when i was young and stuff.</li>
            <li> when i was really young</li>
            <li> actually i dont really see any difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> It brings out my natural hair color.</li>
            <li> But its better late than never.  </li>
            <li> Ive only used it once, blowdried it onto my hair, and it really made no difference at all.</li>
            <li> The product is slowly for surely working on my hair.</li>
            <li> As an African American who has experienced extreme breakage thought my life, I highly recommend this product to ANYONE who has excessive breakage and shedding.</li>
            <li> The reconstructor is good my hair was super soft, but it didn&#x27;t repair any damage:(</li>
            <li> When I first started my hair journey my hair was dry and brittle and being</li>
            <li> After using the full protein treatment line, I noticed how soft my hair was and there was little loss/shedding.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Asian chinese with pretty screwed up hair</li>
            <li> (so it appears very full and thick).  </li>
            <li> my hair is really frizzy and dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product package because I was having severe breaking and could barely touch it without it snapping.  </li>
            <li> I used this on my hair and it was instantly manageable, soft and stopped a lot of the breakage.</li>
            <li> I had used the old protein formula well over fifteen years ago and ended up giving the bottle away because I only used it once.</li>
            <li> african american finding good hair care products can be so difficult after about 5-6 months of using aphogee my hair</li>
            <li> My hair was indeed softer after shampooing and using the reconstructor however, I have not used the protien because this is not the complete set, and I don&#x27;t want to mess around with pure protien..</li>
            <li> and I was too scared to do the treatment as my hair was very damaged but not spongy like other people</li>
            <li> I am full African American and I have poofy thick hair and this works wonders.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t go wrong with this bundle and they ship so fast you&#x27;ll have them by the time you&#x27;re ready to wash your hair-lol</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times now and the shampoo leaves my hair so soft!</li>
            <li> my sister&#x27;s hair is really straight and smooth :(    </li>
            <li> So much so that you really have to be careful not to leave it on too long or it will be difficult to manipulate your hair.</li>
            <li> i dont know if its stronger or not, my hair is short and it never really breaks or anything</li>
            <li> I have very long, bleached hair.  </li>
            <li> so anyway, i find that these aphogee products are really really dry.</li>
            <li> and then it was dry while i was even rinsing it off</li>
            <li> I have not tried the protein treatment yet because it says you have to put it on and let it dry.  </li>
            <li> They sell this stuff at sallys, it just doesnt give me enough moisuturization my hair needs its just like an average product.</li>
            <li> Cut down on heat and use \\&quot;low manipulation\\&quot; hair styles until your hair is stronger and you will be amazed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s breaking less and in no time I expect to have next to know breakage.</li>
            <li> but this side effect wore off after a few weeks of subsequent washes.</li>
            <li> otherwise money well spent.</li>
            <li> One of those products is the Roux porosity control and corrector conditioner, the other product is Nexxus polymeric treatment.</li>
            <li> I have used the shampoo part of this product but not the other two</li>
            <li> The chemicals in colors, relaxers, and yes even braids and weaves (due to \\&quot;pulling on the scalp\\&quot;) can break hair down over time.</li>
            <li> and I only use the hard protein on my hair every six weeks.</li>
            <li> Overall the shampoo is not amazing.</li>
            <li> I noticed that when I comb my hair now....there were only 2 strands on my shirt instead of my usual 57 strands!</li>
            <li> I was referred to use this product over a year and a half ago</li>
            <li> My hair was slightly damage.</li>
            <li> I guess anything was an improvement over the previous frizzy look.     </li>
            <li> It works on all hair types i even use it in my daughters hair when their hair was breaking off from wearing tight braids.</li>
            <li> Hair becomes hard and dry.  </li>
            <li> Once it gets hard and dry you rinse it out.</li>
            <li> The protein treatment does help lessen the breakage, but not significantly.</li>
            <li> (I believe in having as few products as possible)or even just get the 2-min Reconstructor to maintain and the 2-step treatment if you are in a hair s.o.s mode.</li>
            <li> Every few months I&#x27;ll switch to the Aphogee line and combine with the 2 step protein treatment, it does wonders to my hair.</li>
            <li> I though I was missing something, but</li>
            <li> So now it feels like a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I had suffered a WTH period with my hair for approximately eight to twelve months where it was constantly frizzy regardless of what was done to it.</li>
            <li> One thing to mention is the protein in the products did make my hair a little hard</li>
            <li> The protein treatment is a little hard to deal with</li>
            <li> It has saved my hair and I have very little breakage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the protien treatment also works well.it wasnt hard to use or messy at all.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> Not sure it works.  </li>
            <li> Its worked for me in the past</li>
            <li> it just makes my hair feel hard.</li>
            <li> grew at least 2-3 inches over a 6 month period while wearing protective styles.</li>
            <li> I have wavy, medium thick hair, not too unruly.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I found out about the Aphogee Hair care products a little to late.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be helping my thin, colored hair a lot.  </li>
            <li> The smell is NOT as bad as other comments said.  </li>
            <li> The only thing i dont like about it is the terrible smell.</li>
            <li> The treatment that came with them stinks so bad that the smell almost made me ill.</li>
            <li> I was some somewhat desperate to find a product to help me with my hair breakage problems.  </li>
            <li> It smells really bad</li>
            <li> Disappointed with the results.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> African American with chemically straighten hair.  I started experiencing breakage and my friend recommended the Aphogee system.  I used the products as directed and after the first application my hair stopped breaking.  One thing to mention is the protein in the products did make my hair a little hard but this side effect wore off after a few weeks of subsequent washes.</li>
            <li> It really works🏄 my hair was so damage by hair dye, it felt like straw😣, however, these products  soften it and stop massive hair breakag. If you have damage hair, I highly recommend these products😉</li>
            <li> Seems to be helping my thin, colored hair a lot.  I really am glad I tried this product and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Asian chinese with pretty screwed up hair cause I swam a lot when i was young and stuff. my hair is really frizzy and dry and brittle. and porous if you said it :/ well i decided to try this to see if it could kind of fix my hair cause when i was really young i had straight hair! my sister&#x27;s hair is really straight and smooth :(    so anyway, i find that these aphogee products are really really dry. they didnt seem to make my hair smoother or anything. it just makes my hair feel hard. i dont really know the effects cause i used the keratin treatment once and then it was dry while i was even rinsing it off so i ended up adding FHI hot sauce to my hair after that for moisturising purposes. i guess it would be best used with a moisturising conditioner after use.     the shampoo for damaged hair dries my hair too. yup.     actually i dont really see any difference in my hair. i dont know if its stronger or not, my hair is short and it never really breaks or anything so yup. guess would be more effective for people with the breaking hair type :)</li>
            <li> These are good products and they&#x27;re priced right. You won&#x27;t go wrong with this bundle and they ship so fast you&#x27;ll have them by the time you&#x27;re ready to wash your hair-lol</li>
            <li> The ingredients are good I really wanted keratin treatment which these products have keratin in them but honestly I have tryed much better shampoo/ conditioners from Walmart or Target. They sell this stuff at sallys, it just doesnt give me enough moisuturization my hair needs its just like an average product.</li>
            <li> It help repair damaged hair but once your hair is healthy it doesnt work anymore so you need to change to something else.    Do not like the 2 step protien treatment.  It smells really bad and I cant take the drying.  Hair becomes hard and dry.  Not sure it works.  Using a natural protien treatment now, it seems to work better.</li>
            <li> Aphogee is the truth it is great for any and every ethnicity. It restored my hair back to health, thicken up my hair and helped me achieve length.</li>
            <li> Aphogee is an amazing product!!!..When I first started my hair journey my hair was dry and brittle and being african american finding good hair care products can be so difficult after about 5-6 months of using aphogee my hair has grown 2 inches and is very full and healthy. I would recommend this product to everyone</li>
            <li> The product is slowly for surely working on my hair. The only thing I have a problem with, is that the price is lower! It didn&#x27;t start right away like the website said, but today I wore my hair out and I was amazed how soft my hair was after the treatment! My hair was severly damaged and it broke off like a \\&quot;kit kat\\&quot; bar! I noticed that when I comb my hair now....there were only 2 strands on my shirt instead of my usual 57 strands! (I didn&#x27;t count them..lol) However, I know that this product will work for many who has hair problems like myself. I was referred to use this product over a year and a half ago and I wish I had used it then. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I too am an African American girl- and I take a lot of pride in taking care of me hair by sorting through the half-truths and gimmicks out there to find a routine that works. Fortunately, along the way I have been blessed to have a good hairdresser or two. The one thing any good hair dresser should do for her clients who have chemicals on their hair is recommend that their clients add some protein every once in a while to their hair (depending on each persons hair condition). The chemicals in colors, relaxers, and yes even braids and weaves (due to \\&quot;pulling on the scalp\\&quot;) can break hair down over time. SO, what&#x27;s a girl to do if she doesn&#x27;t want to be tied to her beautician&#x27;s chair and pay for treatments ever month? Do it at home. Now a lot of products claim to strengthen hair and maybe they do- but its slooooowly. If your hair is breaking daily that isn&#x27;t going to help. So enter Aphogee products. They are famous among all the hair boards for their protein treatments which begin working ASAP. So much so that you really have to be careful not to leave it on too long or it will be difficult to manipulate your hair. If you use it on a regular basis, on the other hand, as per the directions, and use A VERY GOOD DEEP CONDITIONER afterwards I promise you will see less breakage. Cut down on heat and use \\&quot;low manipulation\\&quot; hair styles until your hair is stronger and you will be amazed. This is a must buy (I believe in having as few products as possible)or even just get the 2-min Reconstructor to maintain and the 2-step treatment if you are in a hair s.o.s mode. This product is comparable to what you would get from a protein treatment in the shop. MUST BUY.</li>
            <li> I have very long, bleached hair.  My hair has some gray, is fine in texture but I have a TON of it (so it appears very full and thick).  Bleaching twice per year leaves it &#x27;straw-ish&#x27; and I just end up wanting it all cut off.  I have had the greatest success at a salon with the brazillian blowout keratin treatment and would love to have it done every three months BUT I cannot afford to have this done.  As for this Aphogee product line; I like it!  I have experimented with many treatments from beauty supply stores in town and from online stores.  Aphogee does work but not like what you will see with the brazillian blowout straight &amp; softness (like virgin hair); nor for the full six weeks as Aphogee bottle directs to use (the smallest bottle is the treatment).  The shampoo and 2minute restore/conditioner are okay and do smell pretty.  The treatment is very difficult to do by yourself (as it stiffens like a rock very quickly and you do not want to damage your hair by combing or pulling through with fingers), and take a good two-three hours for long hair.  I wore gloves, used a color application brush and followed the directions.  The smell is NOT as bad as other comments said.  However it does not smell nearly as nice as the coco-smelling keratin products out there but works well for the amazing low price tag.  My hair was left very nice and soft for about a week and a half.  For the price I was very happy.  I do see that salons are offering half-off deals on the brazillian blowout treatments and will also try to use the deals because it REALLY does work for full three months but at around $300 a pop.  Good luck everyone! :)</li>
            <li> hair grew significantly but protien treatment can dry out hair so moisturize moisturize. otherwise money well spent. grew at least 2-3 inches over a 6 month period while wearing protective styles.</li>
            <li> Really nice product.  Prompt delivery time</li>
            <li> I used these products for several months and continued to have breakage. They didn&#x27;t seem to make my hair any stronger or healthier. The protein treatment does help lessen the breakage, but not significantly. The 2min reconstructor helps, but not as moisturizing as I would like. the shampoo makes the hair a bit softer but doesn&#x27;t help with breakage. Overall, I will not purchase any of these products again. I found better products that instantly give results. One of those products is the Roux porosity control and corrector conditioner, the other product is Nexxus polymeric treatment. They cost more, but are definitely better quality and worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have used the shampoo part of this product but not the other two and my hair was very damaged and the shampoo didn&#x27;t seem to do much and I was too scared to do the treatment as my hair was very damaged but not spongy like other people said their hair was like before they used . The product was timely in shipping to me. I would recommend this</li>
            <li> really helped my natural hair journey be patient</li>
            <li> Every few months I&#x27;ll switch to the Aphogee line and combine with the 2 step protein treatment, it does wonders to my hair. definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> It brings out my natural hair color. My hair is soft and clean for days and tangled-free. From the first application I noticed a difference in my hair. It&#x27;s breaking less and in no time I expect to have next to know breakage. No dandruff issues either! I really recommend it!</li>
            <li> Excellent for chemically treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using these products for three months now and my hair is recovering from a bad highlight process.&lt;br /&gt;It makes hair stronger and healthier.</li>
            <li> Great product for rebuilding the strength and feel of your hair. It smells amazing and I will be buying more soon.</li>
            <li> I have used these products before and I knew that they would work for the damage that I did to my hair and it was instant. Love Love Love Aphogee</li>
            <li> These products are awesome in bringing the hair back to life..the first time was definitely the messiest but the second time was better since I knew what to expect and used a spray bottle (top) to apply the treatment easily since it is liquidity lol</li>
            <li> I purchased this product package because I was having severe breaking and could barely touch it without it snapping.  You have to buy the balance moisturizer separately but please use this with the protein treatment.  I went  from breakage of  100 plus hair or more to  absolutely zero in one treatment! This is definitely incorporated into my regimen from now on.  Wish I  would&#x27;ve cared for my  hair sooner but  hey gotta start somewhere.  Start here!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with breakage for quite sometime now and a friend recommended this to me and it works. I could tell a difference in my hair after the 1st treatment. It works on all hair types i even use it in my daughters hair when their hair was breaking off from wearing tight braids. The only thing i dont like about it is the terrible smell.</li>
            <li> Works good for 4C hair. Hair is clean curls are defined and manageable</li>
            <li> Not totally sold that this works. Tried it on my daughters hair. The 3rd step of the treatment called for another step that was NOT included in this package. I though I was missing something, but no....It does not ship with the 4th step. I just did the 3 steps and kept going. It didn&#x27;t seem to do anything special...maybe if I had the 4th step, it would have actually worked.</li>
            <li> Ladies not only this product is priced just right it is a work horse I being to see the efforts of using this product within 2 weeks.  It has saved my hair and I have very little breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dee Peterson&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Houston, Texas</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner were great for my dry, damaged hair.  The treatment that came with them stinks so bad that the smell almost made me ill.</li>
            <li> I tried these products after I was not having any success with any others for my shedding thinning hair. This package along with the [[ASIN:B000BU7SMM Aphogee Balancing Moisturizer 16 Oz]] helped my hair and added the extra moisture that was lost from PM Shines and Thermal Straitening. I used this on my hair and it was instantly manageable, soft and stopped a lot of the breakage. Would recommend buying extra Protein Treatments[[ASIN:B0009R33U8 Aphogee Two-step Treatment Protein for Damaged Hair 16 oz.]]. These treatments are good and way more expensive in salons.</li>
            <li> This product made my hair increasingly strong after just one use!!!! The stylist at a Cape Verdean salon I used to go to as a child would always use these products on my hair and my hair would feel stronger and healthier each time I went!!!! The amount of breakage I had after using the protein treatment was close to nothing. I only lost three strands of hair when I combed through it after the treatment. I bought the entire line and it is the only things I use on my hair. As an African American who has experienced extreme breakage thought my life, I highly recommend this product to ANYONE who has excessive breakage and shedding.</li>
            <li> Great product. I recommend this to anyone who wants to stop breakage.</li>
            <li> THIS WILL BE ALL YOU NEED TO BE OFF TO A GREAT START WITH YOUR HAIR CARE ROUTINE. THE REASON WHY I CALLED IT THE SUPER HEROS OF HAIR CARE IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE #1. SHAMPOO FOR DAMAGED HAIR., #2. TWO STEP PROTEIN TREATMENT., AND #3. TWO MINUTE RECONSTRUCTOR. IF YOU DON&#x27;T WANT TO INVEST IN THE WHOLE LINE OF APHOGEE THEN THESE THREE GUYS WILL BE YOUR HAIR&#x27;S BEST FRIEND IF THERE IS SUCH A THING. I&#x27;M NOT KIDDING. THIS IS TRULY A GREAT START TO HEALTHY BREAK-FREE HAIR, I PROMISE.</li>
            <li> I use these products on my hair and my daughter. My hair was slightly damage. After using it once I saw a difference immediately in my hair and my daughter.I wash our hair once a week and I only use the hard protein on my hair every six weeks. They also ship the product in a good timely manner and my product were in tact as well.</li>
            <li> I am full African American and I have poofy thick hair and this works wonders. It feels softer yet thicker and it has been helping my hair grow back. I love it !</li>
            <li> They said it was suppose to stop breakage. I get my hair done once a week I don&#x27;t see any change. And the leave in conditioner makes your hair hard my hair dresser advised me not to u it any more. So now it feels like a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times now and the shampoo leaves my hair so soft! The conditioner is good too. The protein treatment is a little hard to deal with but my hair feels stronger already!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I found out about the Aphogee Hair care products a little to late.  But its better late than never.  I&#x27;ve tried many hair care products--I can absolutely say that this product has done wonders for my hair.  I&#x27;ve only tried the 2minute reconstructor and the Damaged hair shampoo and I love the products.  I&#x27;m  in the process of getting ready to try the two step protein treatment because of the reviews I&#x27;ve been seeing on Youtube.  I probably will try it this weekend and repost my review.  Thanks to Ateeyaa on youtube for showing the world about this wonderful haircare product....</li>
            <li> So far so good. I have noticed some growth since I have been using it (4 weeks) and my hair seems thicker and fuller but am still seeing the same amount of shedding.</li>
            <li> I was some somewhat desperate to find a product to help me with my hair breakage problems.  since I could not afford hair treatments done professionally I decided to try aphogee hair protection treatment, and what a good decision this was, because as of now I am noticeing a big change in the condition of my hair which was so damaged.  thanks aphogee for such a great product that I could use myself at an affordabe price for me.</li>
            <li> bought this 4 wife. she likes it alot. the protien treatment also works well.it wasnt hard to use or messy at all. good product. the shampoo and conditioner smell great,the treatment, well,thats a different story,lol but worth the results.</li>
            <li> My hair was indeed softer after shampooing and using the reconstructor however, I have not used the protien because this is not the complete set, and I don&#x27;t want to mess around with pure protien.. Overall the shampoo is not amazing. The reconstructor is good my hair was super soft, but it didn&#x27;t repair any damage:(</li>
            <li> Disappointed with the results. Maybe my expectations were too high. Its worked for me in the past so I can&#x27;t totally not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have always loved aphogee products ever since my sister gave me a regimen for growing my hair back healthy amazing and quality product that works.</li>
            <li> this product helps the hair grow and strengthens it, the coconut finish smell alone is worth the wash.  the shampoo lathers really well and the citrus scent awakens the scalp.  The protein small bottle is very sticky and doesnt smell very well however after it hardens and you rinse with warm water the silky finish is worth it. great product.</li>
            <li> I really like Aphogee products they work really good I got it for a good combo price Def worth it</li>
            <li> Shampoo smells nice almost like a gatorade and is a great shampoo. The 2minute reconstructer does a great job and has really helped my hair. It smells like citrus. I use both in the shower. I have blonde colored hair and neither product hurts the color. I have not tried the protein treatment yet because it says you have to put it on and let it dry.  Once it gets hard and dry you rinse it out. I just haven&#x27;t had the time to let this product sit yet.</li>
            <li> I have wavy, medium thick hair, not too unruly. Ive never gotten such great results as i have with the conditioner. The shampoo was better than average, but the treatment really made no difference. Ive only used it once, blowdried it onto my hair, and it really made no difference at all. It is worth a try though, even if only for the shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> I had suffered a WTH period with my hair for approximately eight to twelve months where it was constantly frizzy regardless of what was done to it. Washing, extra conditioner, heat styling...nothing helped. My styles would not hold beyond one or two days before the frizz took strong hold. I attributed the texture change to stress, dehydration and prescribed medications.     After researching online, I read reviews regarding this product and decided I would give it a try again. I had used the old protein formula well over fifteen years ago and ended up giving the bottle away because I only used it once. I don&#x27;t recall the effect on my hair then because I was a product junkie and my hair was much stronger and resilient than now. The product today does not have as strong of a smell as it did 15 years ago.     I used all three products combined and did not feel it took as much time as some stated, but I suppose that time can vary depending on the length of your hair (mine is shoulder-length). After using the full protein treatment line, I noticed how soft my hair was and there was little loss/shedding. A roller set plus a hooded dryer and voila! - my frizz problem was abated. My hair was very soft, shiny and I received compliments the next day on how good it looked. I guess anything was an improvement over the previous frizzy look.     I haven&#x27;t used the treatment again, although I thought I would perform it every three months. The condition of my hair has improved dramatically and five months later, I still haven&#x27;t had a problem with severe frizz!</li>
            <li> Used it to wash my relaxed hair. It was generally ok. I know that my hairdressers use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because its has sodium laureth sulfate, i think that is why it didn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft as sulfate and paraben free shampoos. I won&#x27;t be using these shampoos as part of my weekly regimen. But i may use it every two weeks with out the protein treatment and every six weeks with the two step protein treatment to help stop breakage.</li>
