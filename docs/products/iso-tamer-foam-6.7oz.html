            <li>I was worried that this wasn&#x27;t the right product because it is called &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; but indeed it is the &amp;#34;mousse&amp;#34; I had been buying from my hair stylist.  </li>
            <li>I got great results with this gel when allowing my hair to dry naturally.</li>

            <li>Leaves hair soft and straight.</li>
            <li>But I compared the bottle to the foam and they are exactly the same.</li>
            <li>Finally, something that REALLY does what it says it will!</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I have short hair and only use a little more than dime size, otherwise it is too much.  </li>
            <li>This is a must-have item for me because it makes my hair so soft and gives it body.</li>
            <li>As someone who has been using mousse/foam/gel as a hair tamer since I was a teen, I am always on the lookout for a new product that will control my frizzy, curly, unruly tresses.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why the word &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; is in the title.  This is supposed to be a foam.  I got it and it was indeed a gel, but I returned it because it&#x27;s supposed to foam.  I found the foam and ordered it and it is great!  I think it was a gel because it had sat around so long, it turned from a foam to a gel. But I compared the bottle to the foam and they are exactly the same. But the other sellers don&#x27;t call it a gel.</li>
            <li> I never wore my hair curly due to frizz and volume before using this product. Iso tamer maintains frizz while not making your hair weighed down or look like its covered in mousse. This product is a miracle!</li>
            <li> The best smoothing and control product for curly hair that I have ever used. I have been using this mousse for a decade now!</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this to me but I thought it was just OK.  I didn&#x27;t tame frizz as much as I expected it to.</li>
            <li> Recommended for curly hair. I just had a perm and used it to keep the curls fluffy. It worked in hot and humid weather too.</li>
            <li> Used to buy it at Ulta and last time I went they didn&#x27;t have anything by this brand. Amazon to the rescue! This stuff is essential for a great blow out, and smells absolutely delicious!</li>
            <li> My hair is curly and difficult. i love the ISO Tamer Foam Gel becaus it makes my hair  easier to control, and easier to syle.  It also holds the style and is not sticky like other products. I would recommend this  to everyone. I  actually got it because my hairdresser uses it!</li>
            <li> Finally, something that REALLY does what it says it will! Curly, frizzy, out of control hair is really NEVER a pretty look - after a blow out you may look fantastic as you walk out the door, but as soon as the humidity hits your hair....all your efforts become apparently futile. This product (and I have tried them ALL!!) actually creates a barrier that holds your blow out (or your scrunched curls) where you put them without a sticky, greasy feeling. A nickel-sized gel dollop will do. Just rub your hands together and it turns to foam. Rake it through your towel dried hair and blow dry. WOW! Silky styled hair with movement but NO FRIZZ! Day two changes nothing!! Worth the wait for this product and keeps a Keratin treatment like new! So enjoy dancing at a party, walking in humidity, and all the days you skipped activities because of the weather.</li>
            <li> really keeps my daughters curly hair from flattening and frizzing all day!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite. Ulta doesn&#x27;t carry it anymore. Who knows why? It is a great product for getting smooth shiny hair. I am so glad I found it through Amazon. I found it cheaper than at my local retail store, especially with Prime.</li>
            <li> Love! Perfect for wavy/ curly hair . Doesn&#x27;t look wet and crunchy. But hair gets limp by end of the day . Best thing I have found so far</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!!! I just recently switched from a gel I have been using for years. Super happy with this product!!</li>
            <li> I love this for my hair.  I have short hair and only use a little more than dime size, otherwise it is too much.  Keeps my hair frizz free.</li>
            <li> I was worried that this wasn&#x27;t the right product because it is called &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; but indeed it is the &amp;#34;mousse&amp;#34; I had been buying from my hair stylist.  This is a must-have item for me because it makes my hair so soft and gives it body.</li>
            <li> I love this foam! its more than a foam its soft creme for bouncy curls--perfect</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Great hair product. Leaves hair soft and straight. Long lasting: you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of product for it to work. A little expensive. I will definitely will buy again.</li>
            <li> Forget all those gels and mousses that leave your hair crispy textured and dried out. This sets softer, holds curls beautifully, leaves hair run-your-fingers-through-it soft, and quickly refreshes the next day with spritzes of water and some scrunching.    To those who claim it&#x27;s not a gel, it isn&#x27;t! What it IS like is shaving gel - it starts dispensing as a gel but instantly foams up and has a thicker feel than airy mousses. Apply a dime-sized amount to each section of hair while still wet and either finger-rake it through for more largely defined curls or use a wide-tooth comb for thinner curls. It doesn&#x27;t take a lot of product to get all squishy with it!</li>
            <li> As someone who has been using mousse/foam/gel as a hair tamer since I was a teen, I am always on the lookout for a new product that will control my frizzy, curly, unruly tresses. Coming across the Tamer Foam Gel by ISO, I was instantly open to wanting to give this product a try. Normally, after I wash my hair, I mousse it up and allow it to air dry. However, I don&#x27;t always have that option, and during the cold weather months when I am heading out, its never an option. This is a major problem for my hair as it is easily damaged by heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most brands of hair styling aids like mousse/foam leave my hair stiff and hard after they dry on my hair which is very annoying, With the Tamer Foam Gel I had no need to change my hair routine. I used the Tamer Foam Gel by adding it to my wet hair just as I usually do with my hair mousse, then let it air dry or styled as usual. I was surprised by how soft and manageable my hair was after it dried. I got great results with this gel when allowing my hair to dry naturally. I am totally happy with this product and how it can be used on a daily basis to help improve my hair. I recommend the Tamer Foam Gel to anyone with curly or frizzy hair who would like more control over their tresses and overall, their hairstyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample was received to facilitate this post. All opinions expressed above are my own.</li>
            <li> Great Transaction, Great Product!</li>
