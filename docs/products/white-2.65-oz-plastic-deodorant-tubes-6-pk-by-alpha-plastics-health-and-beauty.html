            <li>Arrived in great condition with no defects.  </li>
            <li>These are great, I have not had an issue with these breaking or leaking.</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>I make my own deodorant and this seal up great on the bottom</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve made several containers of deodorant and all the containers work perfectly.</li>

            <li>These products had a powdery smell at first but after opening the smell disappeared, so maybe they are from a place that sells something powder smelling?</li>

            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>the little plastic thing inside does fit snuggly enough that they don&#x27;t leak easily.</li>
            <li>I also make other things like my home made &amp;#34;Bengay&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Vicks&amp;#34; and put in these to make them easy to apply.</li>
            <li>normal size deodorant containers</li>

            <li> Not bad if using for a solid, my coconut oil recipes leaked :(</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much to say about these, except they work!  They are the regular size deodorant containers and haven&#x27;t had one that didn&#x27;t work yet. Have made several containers of deodorant with these.  Very good product!</li>
            <li> These are great containers for homemade deodorant.  They work like they are supposed to work.  Happy I purchased them.</li>
            <li> These products had a powdery smell at first but after opening the smell disappeared, so maybe they are from a place that sells something powder smelling? The tubes were the same as tubes I buy regular deodorant from the store in. They have a little plastic thing inside that can come out when rolling it up. They are not leak-proof but the little plastic thing inside does fit snuggly enough that they don&#x27;t leak easily.</li>
            <li> I ordered these to use for my homemade excema relief lotion.  They DID NOT leak!!  Very happy with my purchase, will order more!</li>
            <li> As expected. Good quality.</li>
            <li> These tubes were easy to fill and work with. However, care needs to be taken when working with a heated product.</li>
            <li> I make my own deodorant and this seal up great on the bottom so it doesn&#x27;t leak out when pouring the hot mix in.  I have not had any trouble with it lifting.</li>
            <li> normal size deodorant containers, they work well for homemade deodorant.</li>
            <li> Just as described. Great product for making Deoderant at home</li>
            <li> These work so good for my home made deodorant! I also make other things like my home made &amp;#34;Bengay&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Vicks&amp;#34; and put in these to make them easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Arrived in great condition with no defects.  They serve their purpose well.  I&#x27;ve made several containers of deodorant and all the containers work perfectly.</li>
            <li> These deodorant containers are great for homemade natural deodorants. The lids and turning mechanisms all seem to work quite well.</li>
            <li> These are great, I have not had an issue with these breaking or leaking. Been using them for 6+ months now and very happy with them.</li>
            <li> I am glad to make my own all natural deo. thanks</li>
            <li> Well made. Will work perfect.</li>
