            <li>It works really nicely and there is enough of it that I don&#x27;t hesitate to use it on my neck as well as my face, and I don&#x27;t have to skimp on the areas that get driest.</li>

            <li>It also left an oily feel, but then during summer it doesn&#x27;t take much to make my skin oily.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make the wife break out or give any bad side effects especially when she puts something else on , I think she knows what she is doing the wife is beautiful and looks as young as she ever has .good</li>
            <li>This product is slightly oily, so, just make sure you rub it in well just to avoid any mess.</li>
            <li>Though I haven&#x27;t been using this product for weeks, I have been using it for the past few days and already in that time frame I can notice my skin smoother and more rejuvenated from this cream.</li>

            <li> They are dry enough I had no oily feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li> The natural healing power of Vitamin E replenishes your skin&#x27;s beauty and helps protect it against harsh elements.</li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t linger long either.</li>
            <li> I like the soft powder scent unlike others that have a really heavy scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is extremely moisturizing and i use it in the day under my makeup as well as at night because i feel that this is when i actually feel the vitamins working !!!!</li>
            <li> Prior my skin was always dry and perhaps other days oily.  </li>
            <li> If you have dry skin this might be made just for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this product which means this will last for sometime!</li>
            <li> As they are rough from working in the Garden.</li>
            <li> Plus in a couple days my hands was smoother and not as rough.</li>
            <li> So once it arrived I opened it and smelled it as I did not want a fragrence that would be overpowering as it might bother other people.</li>
            <li> Has a gel like whipped texture, is very thick, white and only a very faint clean smell.</li>
            <li> Now they are smoothed down.  </li>
            <li> There are endless things you can do with vitamin e creme!</li>

            <li> WOW Upon receiving my jar of Vital Care Vitamin E Creme with Age Defying Antioxidants I was amazed at the size of the jar. Immediately I was anxious to try this on my face. It is a wonderful face moisturizer and after just one week my skin appears to be much softer and smoother. I have had many compliments on the appearance of my skin. Vital Care is a wonderful addition to my beauty care regimen and I highly recommend it to those ladies looking for something a little extra special.</li>
            <li> Friend of mine just purchased this product. She likes the way it feels on her skin and is still using it to the actual results.</li>
            <li> Vitamin E Creme, Vital Care Age Defying Antioxidants, 8 Oz. provided by Vita Care...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Description&lt;br /&gt;A concentrated moisturizing creme, specially blended with nature&#x27;s moisturizer, Vitamin E, to minimize the signs of aging and help maintain a more youthful appearance. The natural healing power of Vitamin E replenishes your skin&#x27;s beauty and helps protect it against harsh elements. This non-greasy formula softens and conditions skin while helping to smooth wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is awesome. I have so much trouble with my skin, it has taken a beaten and finding something that works for them is so hard to find&lt;br /&gt;There are many benefits in applying Vitamin E to your skin. One being that it helps your skin look younger by reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;It is extremely moisturizing and i use it in the day under my makeup as well as at night because i feel that this is when i actually feel the vitamins working !!!! It has evened out my skin tone and gotten rid of some sun spots that I had.  Disclosure: Product was provided for review, thank you</li>
            <li> Though I haven&#x27;t been using this product for weeks, I have been using it for the past few days and already in that time frame I can notice my skin smoother and more rejuvenated from this cream. Prior my skin was always dry and perhaps other days oily.  This cream seems to balance that fine line, somewhere in the middle of dry and oily.  The container itself is rather large so you defiantly get your moneys worth and the cream is a light, almost whipped consultancy and applies cool on the skin. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Vitamin E Creme, Vital Care Age Defying Antioxidants, 8 Oz.  FOR REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the magic creme, it goes on , soaks in , and like magic you are beautiful and 20 again we all wish for that magic trick for our selves .&lt;br /&gt;as the ritual goes anyway , I can only say you will always find this product in the house  and being used . It doesn&#x27;t make the wife break out or give any bad side effects especially when she puts something else on , I think she knows what she is doing the wife is beautiful and looks as young as she ever has .good stuff great seller</li>
            <li> i got this for my mom and me. I&#x27;m getting close to my 30s and my mom 60s. we have to start using creams as such to obtain  our youth. this one smells really good and makes your face soft. drys fast too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received  this product for free or discount  for an honest  review as stated above</li>
            <li> I reiceved this product for exchange for a review!! And I love it!! This vitamin e creme is excellent!! Not greasy at all has a nice smell and makes my skin feel so soft!! There are endless things you can do with vitamin e creme! I didnt only use it for lotion I also made diy body wraps with it and it was excellent!! Its even perfect for kids! The size is wonderful!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been two weeks now, since my mom started to use this product.So far she&#x27;s liking the result.She said, this product moisturize her face to look more younger and smoother.I got this product with a discount but since my mom is liking this I wont mind buying more of this.I will absolutely recommend this product to all the ladies who wants to have a younger looking skin.</li>
            <li> Moisturizer is not greasy but very hydrogening and it sinks into your skin quickly. Vitiaim E has many benefits for your skin.</li>
            <li> Great value, comes in a generous 8 ounce tub. Has a gel like whipped texture, is very thick, white and only a very faint clean smell. The smell doesn&#x27;t linger long either. Great for man or woman, face or body in the right conditions. I tried it on my face, it left it soft, smooth, well moisturized, absorbed well, although it did take a few minutes. It also left an oily feel, but then during summer it doesn&#x27;t take much to make my skin oily. During winter I think it would make a good facial moisturizer, but summers for me it is to heavy. With that that being said, I tried it as a body cream, my feet loved it! My elbows and knees loved it also. They are dry enough I had no oily feeling afterwards. This has some wonderful ingredients in it. I tried to get a pic of the list I will attach to review. I really like the cream, it is awesome right now for feet and body, but not my face yet till cold weather. If you have dry skin this might be made just for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received this product on a promotional discount for my honest review and they are 100% my own opinions.

            <li> This is good, definitely works although it is a bit heavy. I usually use it at night before bed.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I absolutely love this Vitamin E creme!!! It feels so great on my skin. It leaves it feeling smooth and moisturized. I like the soft powder scent unlike others that have a really heavy scent. I also love that this product is not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> (Note: I originally posted this review on 7/31/15 but today I saw it was missing, so I am re-posting it. I&#x27;ve been using this cream twice daily since I got it and I still couldn&#x27;t be happier with it!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Huge container!! Omg. I was expecting a small jar, which still would have been a great deal, but this is a lot of creme for your money. I purchased this because I have been looking for a more affordable brand creme since the one I was using before was 2-3 times this price for about 1/4th as much. I am very happy with this product! It works really nicely and there is enough of it that I don&#x27;t hesitate to use it on my neck as well as my face, and I don&#x27;t have to skimp on the areas that get driest. It&#x27;s got a really nice, soft lotiony smell that is pleasant but not overwhelming. I think I&#x27;ve found my new long-term face cream brand!</li>
            <li> A+ Smooth creme! Will buy again</li>
            <li> This Vitamin E Creme works great and isn&#x27;t greasy!  I am so glad I purchased this!</li>
            <li> Great Vitamin E Creme!  There isn&#x27;t much of a scent-just a fresh smell. Then, when I put in on my face-I loved it!  I didn&#x27;t find the cream to be too thick or too thin!  I also put it on my elbows &amp; sides of my feet.  Both my elbows &amp; feet felt wonderful!  My cuticles also got the benefit of the cream.  Now they are smoothed down.  I did receive this at a reduced cost for an honest opinion. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I love it. Just apply after washing face at night and it does all the work for you. I love the fact it is not tested on animals either. I&#x27;m a customer for life.</li>
            <li> I AM LOVING USING THIS ON MY SCARS AND STRETCH MARKS. IT ISNT GREASY AND GOES ON SMOOTH. IT DOESNT LEAVE RESIDUE FEELING. I GOT THIS IN EXCHANGE FOR REVIEW AND GLAD I DID</li>
            <li> This product came recommended by my boss.  She told me I will never need another formula.  Well I have used this for the past 2 weeks and I can tell you she is right.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Works well; moisturizing and is helping aging nicely. Highly recommend. It makes my face super smooth. :)</li>
            <li> Your dose of vitamin E in its cream version.&lt;br /&gt;I like this cream because the scent is amazing, it has a floral hint but not too overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;It glides in my skin smoothly and my skin would absorb it quickly. It didnt leave any oily feel at all and that&#x27;s always a plus.&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer didnt break me out or caused any skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;I only need a thin layer for my face and neck, a little goes a long way with this product.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I didnt like is the packaging, I wish it came on a bottle type with a pump, because tub packaging always have the risk of double dipping. Making it a little less hygienic.&lt;br /&gt;But overall this is an amazing moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;It does the job really well and it keeps your skin healthy and moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this using a promo code for testing.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin E Creme makes my skin feel supple and smooth. But I give this a 3.5 rating. The ingredients are questionable as I see a lot on the list, I thought tocopheryl acetate would be number one given the name Vitamin E Creme. That leaves me wondering about the integrity of this product and just a precaution, this Vitamin E Creme moisturizer has parabens (if you&#x27;re too concerned about the Big C associated with parabens). I was provided this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> This was purchased to use on my neck/chest and arms.  I tend to use different types of creams and lotions because my skin is different all over.&lt;br /&gt;I received this at a reduced rate with coupon but my review in no way reflects that I purchased this at a sale price.&lt;br /&gt;This is a generous 8 oz container. The cream is smooth and sinks easily into the skin with relative ease, no heavy buffing in.  I use rosehip oil on my hands because they are drier, the oil is too oily for my arms/chest/neck but this cream is perfect for arms/elbows and the main use for me which is the d&amp;eacute;colletage area. This cream sinks into the skin nicely, has no heavy fragrances that I&#x27;ve noticed, moisturizes nicely without leaving a greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Using this after a shower gives me optimal moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I love a good Vitamin E Creme and this is it! It has a &amp;#34;whipped&amp;#34; texture to it that draws me to this product.  Just make sure to rub it in really well so it does not leave a greasy feeling to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing creme and I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a nice quality face creme.</li>
            <li> I received the Creme on time and have been using it for a week now. I use it as a night moisturizer and I find that it keeps the moisture in all night; my face feels cool and fresh.  I used CeraVe before trying this creme and I will continue to use Vitamin E creme.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this vitamin E cream. This is a nice quality cream and comes in a generous 8oz jar. It has a &amp;#34;whipped&amp;#34; texture. Vitamin E is great to help your skin look younger and helps with scaring. I purchased this because I have some scaring on my face and I&#x27;m hoping it will help fade the scars some. A little goes a long way with this product which means this will last for sometime! It has a light smell which is nice that it isn&#x27;t over-powering. This product is slightly oily, so, just make sure you rub it in well just to avoid any mess. I would recommend this product to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Vitamin E Cr&amp;egrave;me...This jar is HUGE 8oz a great value.  I use it daily to moisturize and rejuvenate my face and neck.  This Vita Care Vitamin E Cr&amp;egrave;me has a light scent that is very pleasant.  Great to use at night. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a vitamin A, D, and E cr&amp;egrave;me.  And another plus...MADE IN THE USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount for giving my fair review.</li>
            <li> I had head great things about Vitamin E and so I was excited to try it out. As I wanted to see if it would help my hands become smoother. As they are rough from working in the Garden. Plus they look so old and wrinkled that I hate for people to see them. Plus my face looks like a road map. So once it arrived I opened it and smelled it as I did not want a fragrence that would be overpowering as it might bother other people. This is not the case those as the scent is very light and not overpowering at all. I put it on and rubbed it in and it absorbed right away. It was not greasy. Plus in a couple days my hands was smoother and not as rough.</li>
