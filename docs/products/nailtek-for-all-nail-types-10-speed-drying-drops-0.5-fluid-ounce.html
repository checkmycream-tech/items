            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Great product, dries my nail polish in min.</li>
            <li>I braced myself for the bright orange and purple horror that I would undoubtedly find underneath her, but nothing was there.</li>
            <li>but I honestly can&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
            <li>Great product to get you going quickly after your polish color change.</li>
            <li>This product is great it drys your nails toenails really fast&lt;</li>
            <li>I am so glad I</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have used it for many years and do not like to be without it.</li>
            <li>This wristlet holds more than I could ever have imagined.  </li>
            <li>just like whatever this is ok.</li>
            <li>I just wasn&#x27;t impressed, I will probably not be buying this again because it didn&#x27;t make enough of a difference to me.</li>
            <li>Like I said, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>This polish dryer really does a great job.</li>
            <li>Upon opening the bottle all you can smell is the strong scent of Isopropyl Alcohol.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product, took it with me to my nail salon</li>
            <li>I even picked up the cushion and held it to the light.</li>
            <li>I have tried others before which claim to help the polish dry fast but nothing works as great as this!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure that even my neighbors heard the blood curdling scream as I lunged across the room to pick her up.</li>
            <li>It looked like the freshly polishes nails were melting!</li>
            <li>Petfect finish if you do your own  natural nails.</li>
            <li>I love new 10 speed nail polish dryer!  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>Her nails had primer, two coats of polish, and nail art applied to them, so we&#x27;re not talking one light coat that would quicklyair dry on its own.</li>
            <li>Really dries my nails quickly when I am doing a mani/pedi!</li>
            <li>Also great for moisturizing cuticles after exposure to harsh nail polish chemicals.</li>
            <li>They are undoubtedly the reason for the long, strong nails that I have today and love to paint.</li>
            <li>this product came super fast, about 2-3 days after I placed the order</li>
            <li>Either God performed a small miracle to keep me from completely flipping out, or these drops are freaking amazing!!</li>
            <li>I bought these to see if they would dry my inbetween layers more quickly</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t the best product though, I found that it didn&#x27;t really make a dramatic difference.</li>
            <li>Seems to be working pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I put my nails under a fan for about a two minutes, drop this little wonder on them, put them back under the fan for another 2 minutes, and i&#x27;m good to go!</li>
            <li>First I thought would this really work?</li>
            <li>Nailtek 10-Speed Polishing Drying Drops, 0.5 Fluid Ounce  arrived fine packaging was sufficient.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a huge fan of Nail Tek products - specifically the Foundation II and Intensive Therapy - for ten years.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really speed up the drying process much.</li>
            <li>I used the spray but never thought it helped much.</li>
            <li>WORKS REALLY FAST.</li>
            <li>and I really like it</li>
            <li>thanks so much.</li>
            <li>They are also very shiny.</li>
            <li>For 10 extra minutes, they&#x27;re worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Dries fast helps with soft nails</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used plenty of quick dry products before and decided to go with the one after my Nicole by OPI Drying Drops ran out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I took a chance on these little drops, because they work!  </li>
            <li>I always use drying drops (because I think drops are the only thing that really work to dry nails quickly), and needed a new bottle.</li>
            <li>After two coats of polish and one coat of clear topcoat, she put one drop on each nail, and I rolled my fingers around to spread the liquid.</li>
            <li>Used it on my young granddaughter who loves to have her nails done but always smudges them because of it taking too long for the polish to dry...always touching to see if it has dried yet.</li>
            <li>I have shared this fun passion with my young step-daughters, but it is often frustrating that I will spend HOURS painting wonderful designs on their little fingers and toes only to have them ruined because the girls can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t stay still long enough for their nails to completely dry.</li>
            <li>painted the girls&#x27; toes last night while they were sitting on our new beige sectional watching a movie</li>
            <li>I am someone who usually carries large handbags, so much of the time I have the wristlet in my handbag.  </li>
            <li>It sets the polish, but not harden- you will still dent if not careful.</li>
            <li>In fact, it might be slightly worse because i&#x27;ve smudged my manicures more often using this.</li>
            <li>I purchased these because I find Nail Tek products really work, and I&#x27;m a busy person that doesn&#x27;t like to sit around coaxing wet nails to dry.  </li>
            <li>While it doesn&#x27;t harden intensely or create a situation where you could &#x27;do anything&#x27; after a fresh paint job, they shave off at least 10 minutes of down time.</li>
            <li>It allows me to quickly do my nails and get back to other things without having to wait for the mail polish to dry and be careful in the process.</li>

            <li> it DEFINITELY did not dry instantly, but it was dry within 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> No more than five minutes later, I looked over at the six year old and saw that she was sitting with her legs tucked directly underneath her, meaning her toes were being pressed against the sofa under the weight of her bottom.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how much faster they dry my nails</li>
            <li> It still takes a long while</li>
            <li> The only thing is that I feel a little sting around my cuticles when I apply it, but that goes away shortly after putting it on.</li>
            <li> I immediately applied the dry drops (one drop per nail), and then I turned my attention to her sister.</li>
            <li> Works to quickly dry nails.</li>
            <li> You still need not to bump up against anything but the outer layer is dry to the touch and will not smear.</li>
            <li> This is the fastest dry.</li>
            <li> I went to the dryer and in 10 minutes my nails were completely dry.</li>
            <li> Nails are completely dry in 7-8 minutes after use.</li>
            <li> Use them as directed on the package - a few drops to each nail after applying polish, wait a few seconds, and you&#x27;re ready to go.  </li>
            <li> With this product the polish is dry to the touch in 30 second or less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;vd seen these dry drops at Ulta and other places, but I didn&#x27;t think they would work considering the professionals at my nail salon don&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li> There was absolutely no polish anywhere.</li>
            <li> Along with their other products</li>
            <li> I tried other brands.</li>
            <li> gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I have to be careful when it is not hanging from my wrist as the zipper opens if I grab it the wrong way.</li>
            <li> My nails aren&#x27;t as smudged as they usually are!  </li>
            <li> I polished both girls nails with a base coat and then used nail art pens to paint some designs on the six year old&#x27;s nails.</li>
            <li> Was this a bad batch?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m beyond disappointed.</li>
            <li> it was very stupid of me to do that!)</li>
            <li> and I went with this one because the price wasn&#x27;t outrageous.</li>

            <li> It works!  I don&#x27;t know how it works but I&#x27;m amazed and happy each time I use it because it does indeed work.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working pretty well.  My nails aren&#x27;t as smudged as they usually are!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I like these drops. I am not sure how much faster they dry my nails but Since I started using them I never smudged a nail after polishing it. The only thing is that I feel a little sting around my cuticles when I apply it, but that goes away shortly after putting it on.</li>
            <li> This product is great it drys your nails toenails really fast&lt;br /&gt;It speaks for itself.  I will order again. Along with their other products</li>

I used the spray but never thought it helped much. I&#x27;vd seen these dry drops at Ulta and other places, but I didn&#x27;t think they would work considering the professionals at my nail salon don&#x27;t use them. However, I decided after the last smear fest to give them a try. I am so glad I did!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I painted the girls&#x27; toes last night while they were sitting on our new beige sectional watching a movie (I know, I know...it was very stupid of me to do that!) I polished both girls nails with a base coat and then used nail art pens to paint some designs on the six year old&#x27;s nails.

I braced myself for the bright orange and purple horror that I would undoubtedly find underneath her, but nothing was there. I looked closer. I even picked up the cushion and held it to the light. There was absolutely no polish anywhere. I checked her toes and they were the same pristine stripes and polka dots I had painted ten minutes before. Her nails had primer, two coats of polish, and nail art applied to them, so we&#x27;re not talking one light coat that would quicklyair dry on its own. Either God performed a small miracle to keep me from completely flipping out, or these drops are freaking amazing!! They&#x27;ve earned a permanent place in my nail bag 💜💜💜</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST STUFF FOR DRYING YOUR NAILS. WORKS REALLY FAST. GIVE THIS A TRY THE PRICE IS VERY GOOD.</li>
            <li> Works to quickly dry nails. It sets the polish, but not harden- you will still dent if not careful.</li>
            <li> Really dries my nails quickly when I am doing a mani/pedi!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I have used it for many years and do not like to be without it. It allows me to quickly do my nails and get back to other things without having to wait for the mail polish to dry and be careful in the process.</li>
            <li> This wristlet holds more than I could ever have imagined.  I use it as a wallet but it also holds my phone, my glasses, and the car key.  I also stuck a nail clipper in there for emergencies.  I am someone who usually carries large handbags, so much of the time I have the wristlet in my handbag.  However, for shopping, a trip to the movies, a doctor&#x27;s appointment, anywhere I go where I will not be putting on makeup, fixing my hair, etc. this bag is great.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I have to be careful when it is not hanging from my wrist as the zipper opens if I grab it the wrong way.</li>
            <li> This is the  same product that they use ad the Nail Salon where I go and I really like it</li>
            <li> I bought these to see if they would dry my inbetween layers more quickly but I honestly can&#x27;t see a difference. In fact, it might be slightly worse because i&#x27;ve smudged my manicures more often using this. Ill stick to just putting a layer of seche vite on top.</li>
            <li> This is great and a great price Amazon  buy it</li>
            <li> Great product to get you going quickly after your polish color change.

            <li> Nailtek 10-Speed Polishing Drying Drops, 0.5 Fluid Ounce  arrived fine packaging was sufficient.  the drops work great. thanks so much.</li>
            <li> this product came super fast, about 2-3 days after I placed the order so that&#x27;s a great thing. It isn&#x27;t the best product though, I found that it didn&#x27;t really make a dramatic difference. just like whatever this is ok. it DEFINITELY did not dry instantly, but it was dry within 30 minutes. I just wasn&#x27;t impressed, I will probably not be buying this again because it didn&#x27;t make enough of a difference to me. Like I said, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Dries fast helps with soft nails</li>
            <li> I tried other brands. This is the fastest dry. All of them will be greasy but this is the fastest.</li>
            <li> I love new 10 speed nail polish dryer!  nail tec always rocks.  This polish dryer really does a great job.</li>
            <li> I always use drying drops (because I think drops are the only thing that really work to dry nails quickly), and needed a new bottle. I couldn&#x27;t find the brand I was using now, so and I went with this one because the price wasn&#x27;t outrageous. I have my nails done at a salon and leave the bottle there in my rented box. They worked great! After two coats of polish and one coat of clear topcoat, she put one drop on each nail, and I rolled my fingers around to spread the liquid. I went to the dryer and in 10 minutes my nails were completely dry. They are also very shiny.</li>
            <li> Great product. Nails are completely dry in 7-8 minutes after use. Also great for moisturizing cuticles after exposure to harsh nail polish chemicals.</li>
            <li> Great product, dries my nail polish in min. Gives my nails polish shine and makes nail polish last longer too.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used plenty of quick dry products before and decided to go with the one after my Nicole by OPI Drying Drops ran out. Based on reviews I bought the Nail Tek 10 Speed Drying Drops. I followed the directions as listed on the box. Upon opening the bottle all you can smell is the strong scent of Isopropyl Alcohol. First I thought would this really work? I&#x27;m so used to the nonscented oily drying drops. Soon after application the smell didn&#x27;t go away and then started to notice white spots. It looked like the freshly polishes nails were melting! I&#x27;m beyond disappointed. Was this a bad batch?</li>
            <li> I put my nails under a fan for about a two minutes, drop this little wonder on them, put them back under the fan for another 2 minutes, and i&#x27;m good to go! I was a chronic smudger, but not anymore!!!</li>
            <li> this is the best nailpolish drier I&#x27;ve ever used. Buy 2 so you don&#x27;t run out.</li>
