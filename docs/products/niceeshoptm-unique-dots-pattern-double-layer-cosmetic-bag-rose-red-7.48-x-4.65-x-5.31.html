            <li>It fits my makeup perfectly and is easy to grab and go if I&#x27;m getting ready at a girlfriend&#x27;s house.</li>
            <li>Great bag, exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>

            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Cute</li>
            <li>:) Fits everything I need to take with me.</li>
            <li>Since it has a mirror in the top area, she might put her play makeup in the top section and then her jewelry in the lower section.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well made, bright, and colorful</li>
            <li>Love it and the color.</li>
            <li>but it is cute.  </li>
            <li>and I think she will love it.</li>
            <li>perfect if you don&#x27;t have a massive makeup collection.</li>
            <li>I love the way it has space for tools and it has two layers.</li>
            <li>There is an attached mirror on the top pocket and spots to hold makeup brushes and anything else you dont want flying around in there.</li>
            <li>Cute.</li>
            <li>Its really cute in person ..</li>
            <li>LOVE this.</li>
            <li>It does the job and its cute.</li>
            <li>So Im satisfied.</li>
            <li>I put my most used items on top</li>
            <li>since I got it a week ago, the top has started to sag backwards because the bottom pouch has no support...</li>
            <li>granted I don&#x27;t have much up top except mascara, blush, eyelash curler, Bobby pins, Rubberbands tweezers, etc.  </li>
            <li>It looks cute but the quality is okay.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it :)</li>
            <li>the bag is cute.</li>
            <li>I also really love the dual sections.</li>
            <li>This is much better.</li>
            <li>This bag is really cute.</li>
            <li>Really cute.  </li>
            <li>The top has an attached mirror &amp; places to put brushes in the lid.</li>
            <li>I love that the brushes have a designated spot that is separated from the rest of the make up and contents in the bag.</li>
            <li>but it fits everything i need and more.</li>
            <li>Cute make up bag.  </li>
            <li>This is a cute bag.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s cute.</li>
            <li>I love that I can keep all of my color polishes standing up on the bottom (snug, but a perfect fit), and all of the clear either hardeners or top-coats in the top portion of the bag.</li>
            <li>Declutter your life &amp; Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with the item</li>
            <li>Really cute</li>
            <li>super cute and handy.</li>
            <li>The picture doesn&#x27;t exactly depict how shiny and bright</li>
            <li>The material is pretty good quality and washes off easily.  </li>
            <li>Other than that , it&#x27;s perfect !</li>
            <li>I was more than excited to get my makeup in it.</li>
            <li>I wish I had put in some extra money to get a good one!</li>
            <li>First of all, it is really cute!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more sanitary and keeps the bag clean.</li>
            <li>Super cute bag, holds my makeup</li>
            <li>Perfect little make up bag.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute and worth the $5 I paid for it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even fit a 32 piece palette inside.</li>
            <li>Using this for my nail polish, and was concernd everything would&#x27;t fit.....</li>
            <li>Cute and useful.</li>
            <li>Love that they all fit, and I&#x27;m not \\&quot;digging\\&quot; around to find the right color and/or topcoat anymore.</li>
            <li>Bag is very durable, made of very strong materials, and expands when zipped.</li>
            <li>The bag is prettying cheap for such a  good product.</li>
            <li>I love the dot designs really neat.</li>
            <li>It helps with organization and with finding what I need quickly.</li>
            <li>and I would definitely recommend it to others, especially at such a great price!</li>
            <li>The color is exactly as the picture shown and the material is smooth and</li>
            <li>The bag is exactly as described - you get what you see listed on the site!</li>
            <li>I put my rarely used items on the bottom.  </li>
            <li>I love the soft fabric.</li>
            <li>However it was worth wait the wait.</li>
            <li>just the right size and keeps everything organized so nothing gets lost at the bottom of the bag - always my problem.</li>
            <li>it is very large and holds tons of makeup.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad since I don&#x27;t have much makeup</li>
            <li>These little bags are awesome but they are very very hot pink.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>The color is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I love that it has a tiny mirror in it, and lots of holders for my makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>but it was pretty</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>I also love the double decker aspect of this bag.</li>
            <li>LOVE the color and how big it is.</li>
            <li>Just adorable, but grown up enough that I wouldn&#x27;t mind traveling with it as a make up bag.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute, but it&#x27;s smaller than it looks in the picture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got tons of space, which you might not think upon first looking at it.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this if you have a lot of makeup :)</li>
            <li>There are two zippered compartments: one large compartment on the bottom of the bag, and one smaller compartment on the top of the bag (where the brushes are).</li>
            <li>Anyway, what makes this bag great, other than the quality and utter cuteness, is the double-decker feature.</li>
            <li>The sides do not stay up on their own so it tends to flatten out a little bit</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want something very bulky to begin with</li>
            <li>so I really like that this bag is not.  </li>
            <li>I really like this cosmetic bag</li>
            <li>They are much roomier than I thought they would be as well.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to use for travel instead of taking my whole drawer of make up.</li>
            <li>While it is cute, it&#x27;s very cheap and managed to rip along the bottom of the top compartment about 3 months in, and spilled the contents all over the place while I was carrying it one day :(</li>
            <li>In fact, it still sags down even with nothing in the top compartment.</li>
            <li>The top is only half full.  </li>
            <li>You can find a better quality makeup bag at Walmart for less.</li>
            <li>The compartments are a decent size and it does hold quite a bit of makeup or toiletries.</li>
            <li>have a strong plastic/dye smell when you first get it, seems to dissipate after a while.&lt;br /&gt;Great little bag for the price</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from a makeup bag that cost under $5, but I was pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li>I love this little bag.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cute little bag for the price..</li>
            <li>Shinny hot pink martial (Satin) cute, little and pretty, good for a little girl who doesn&#x27;t have a lot of cosmetics.</li>
            <li>I wish they would make the sides of the bag more firm so that it would not droop and have a crease on the side.</li>
            <li>But nice enough for a short trip, or to store extra makeup or jewelry in.</li>
            <li>I needed a new make up bag, and I specifically wanted to find one that would hold all of my brushes.</li>
            <li>But the seller sent me a new one for free,&lt;br /&gt;Kind</li>
            <li>This was smaller than I expected, but so cute regardless.</li>
            <li>It was much smaller than I expected but it works just fine and for the price you really can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>This product was delivered on time, was exactly what the description said, I would definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li>Pretty large so it will hold my big round brush and full size shampoo bottles for traveling.</li>
            <li>It also comes in a more grownup black with white dots.</li>
            <li>This is called a Cosmetic bag, but I got as a jewelry tote and storage bag for my young 7 year old Granddaughter.</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my 8 year old daughter and she seems to like it a lot..</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my 20 year old niece</li>
            <li>I was searching for a new Nail Polish bag, as my current one was getting to be to small (Yes, I have way too many, but that&#x27;s beside the point).</li>
            <li>I love the shiny pink and the little mirror attached inside.</li>
            <li>I love the hot pink inside because it makes finding things easier as opposed to the typical dark insides and the abyss of finding stuff.  </li>
            <li>Had it for a few weeks and had to go out and buy a bigger one because all of my make up won&#x27;t fit in the polka dot one.</li>
            <li>It holds more than I expected even though it&#x27;s small</li>
            <li>I carry this all around especially for trips to far places.</li>
            <li>They arrived much sooner than expected.</li>
            <li>I only store a few brushes and pencils on the top compartment, so it is not heavy and has no reason to be sagging down.</li>
            <li>they may it sound like it was , it very small .</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Since it has a mirror in the top area, she might put her play makeup in the top section and then her jewelry in the lower section.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well made, bright, and colorful</li>
            <li> Love it and the color.</li>
            <li> but it is cute.  </li>
            <li> and I think she will love it.</li>
            <li> perfect if you don&#x27;t have a massive makeup collection.</li>
            <li> I love the way it has space for tools and it has two layers.</li>
            <li> There is an attached mirror on the top pocket and spots to hold makeup brushes and anything else you dont want flying around in there.</li>
            <li> Cute.</li>
            <li> Its really cute in person ..</li>
            <li> LOVE this.</li>
            <li> It does the job and its cute.</li>
            <li> So Im satisfied.</li>
            <li> I put my most used items on top</li>
            <li> since I got it a week ago, the top has started to sag backwards because the bottom pouch has no support...</li>
            <li> granted I don&#x27;t have much up top except mascara, blush, eyelash curler, Bobby pins, Rubberbands tweezers, etc.  </li>
            <li> It looks cute but the quality is okay.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it :)</li>
            <li> the bag is cute.</li>
            <li> I also really love the dual sections.</li>
            <li> This is much better.</li>
            <li> This bag is really cute.</li>
            <li> Really cute.  </li>
            <li> The top has an attached mirror &amp; places to put brushes in the lid.</li>
            <li> I love that the brushes have a designated spot that is separated from the rest of the make up and contents in the bag.</li>
            <li> but it fits everything i need and more.</li>
            <li> Cute make up bag.  </li>
            <li> This is a cute bag.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s cute.</li>
            <li> I love that I can keep all of my color polishes standing up on the bottom (snug, but a perfect fit), and all of the clear either hardeners or top-coats in the top portion of the bag.</li>
            <li> Declutter your life &amp; Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with the item</li>
            <li> Really cute</li>
            <li> super cute and handy.</li>
            <li> The picture doesn&#x27;t exactly depict how shiny and bright</li>
            <li> The material is pretty good quality and washes off easily.  </li>
            <li> Other than that , it&#x27;s perfect !</li>
            <li> I was more than excited to get my makeup in it.</li>
            <li> I wish I had put in some extra money to get a good one!</li>
            <li> First of all, it is really cute!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much more sanitary and keeps the bag clean.</li>
            <li> Super cute bag, holds my makeup</li>
            <li> Perfect little make up bag.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute and worth the $5 I paid for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even fit a 32 piece palette inside.</li>
            <li> Using this for my nail polish, and was concernd everything would&#x27;t fit.....</li>
            <li> Cute and useful.</li>
            <li> Love that they all fit, and I&#x27;m not \\&quot;digging\\&quot; around to find the right color and/or topcoat anymore.</li>
            <li> Bag is very durable, made of very strong materials, and expands when zipped.</li>
            <li> The bag is prettying cheap for such a  good product.</li>
            <li> I love the dot designs really neat.</li>
            <li> It helps with organization and with finding what I need quickly.</li>
            <li> and I would definitely recommend it to others, especially at such a great price!</li>
            <li> The color is exactly as the picture shown and the material is smooth and</li>
            <li> The bag is exactly as described - you get what you see listed on the site!</li>
            <li> I put my rarely used items on the bottom.  </li>
            <li> I love the soft fabric.</li>
            <li> However it was worth wait the wait.</li>
            <li> just the right size and keeps everything organized so nothing gets lost at the bottom of the bag - always my problem.</li>
            <li> it is very large and holds tons of makeup.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not bad since I don&#x27;t have much makeup</li>
            <li> These little bags are awesome but they are very very hot pink.</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> The color is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I love that it has a tiny mirror in it, and lots of holders for my makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> but it was pretty</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> I also love the double decker aspect of this bag.</li>
            <li> LOVE the color and how big it is.</li>
            <li> Just adorable, but grown up enough that I wouldn&#x27;t mind traveling with it as a make up bag.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute, but it&#x27;s smaller than it looks in the picture.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got tons of space, which you might not think upon first looking at it.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this if you have a lot of makeup :)</li>
            <li> There are two zippered compartments: one large compartment on the bottom of the bag, and one smaller compartment on the top of the bag (where the brushes are).</li>
            <li> Anyway, what makes this bag great, other than the quality and utter cuteness, is the double-decker feature.</li>
            <li> The sides do not stay up on their own so it tends to flatten out a little bit</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want something very bulky to begin with</li>
            <li> so I really like that this bag is not.  </li>
            <li> I really like this cosmetic bag</li>
            <li> They are much roomier than I thought they would be as well.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use for travel instead of taking my whole drawer of make up.</li>
            <li> While it is cute, it&#x27;s very cheap and managed to rip along the bottom of the top compartment about 3 months in, and spilled the contents all over the place while I was carrying it one day :(</li>
            <li> In fact, it still sags down even with nothing in the top compartment.</li>
            <li> The top is only half full.  </li>
            <li> You can find a better quality makeup bag at Walmart for less.</li>
            <li> The compartments are a decent size and it does hold quite a bit of makeup or toiletries.</li>
            <li> have a strong plastic/dye smell when you first get it, seems to dissipate after a while.&lt;br /&gt;Great little bag for the price</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from a makeup bag that cost under $5, but I was pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li> I love this little bag.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cute little bag for the price..</li>
            <li> Shinny hot pink martial (Satin) cute, little and pretty, good for a little girl who doesn&#x27;t have a lot of cosmetics.</li>
            <li> I wish they would make the sides of the bag more firm so that it would not droop and have a crease on the side.</li>
            <li> But nice enough for a short trip, or to store extra makeup or jewelry in.</li>
            <li> I needed a new make up bag, and I specifically wanted to find one that would hold all of my brushes.</li>
            <li> But the seller sent me a new one for free,&lt;br /&gt;Kind</li>
            <li> This was smaller than I expected, but so cute regardless.</li>
            <li> It was much smaller than I expected but it works just fine and for the price you really can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> This product was delivered on time, was exactly what the description said, I would definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> Pretty large so it will hold my big round brush and full size shampoo bottles for traveling.</li>
            <li> It also comes in a more grownup black with white dots.</li>
            <li> This is called a Cosmetic bag, but I got as a jewelry tote and storage bag for my young 7 year old Granddaughter.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my 8 year old daughter and she seems to like it a lot..</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my 20 year old niece</li>
            <li> I was searching for a new Nail Polish bag, as my current one was getting to be to small (Yes, I have way too many, but that&#x27;s beside the point).</li>
            <li> I love the shiny pink and the little mirror attached inside.</li>
            <li> I love the hot pink inside because it makes finding things easier as opposed to the typical dark insides and the abyss of finding stuff.  </li>
            <li> Had it for a few weeks and had to go out and buy a bigger one because all of my make up won&#x27;t fit in the polka dot one.</li>
            <li> It holds more than I expected even though it&#x27;s small</li>
            <li> I carry this all around especially for trips to far places.</li>
            <li> They arrived much sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> I only store a few brushes and pencils on the top compartment, so it is not heavy and has no reason to be sagging down.</li>
            <li> they may it sound like it was , it very small .</li>
            <li> The new one still has little problem</li>
            <li> the reviews are accurate, the zippers are somewhat difficult at times</li>
            <li> I am used to my brushes being piled on top of one another, and getting my makeup bag dirty.</li>
            <li> Almost forgot about this order because of the long wait.</li>
            <li> It was smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> I wish it was bigger though other than that there no complaints about it.</li>
            <li> I bought these for some bridesmaids gifts because many of the other bags from other stores were too expensive.</li>
            <li> My first one was broken, it is a dedect.</li>
            <li> and I can still flatten the case down because of the room left for me to stuff it!</li>
            <li> Small but big enough for what ever you need.</li>
            <li> only downfall is the little mirror inside broke.</li>
            <li> I just thought it was going to be a little bit bigger.</li>
            <li> This little double decker bag does the trick and let me be organized to boot.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something a little bigger</li>
            <li> The inside was a beige color i thought that was a little different.  </li>
            <li> It was inexpensive, so at least I didn&#x27;t waste too much money however.</li>
            <li> just as i expected.</li>
            <li> it closed.</li>
            <li> Have had it a few months, use it on a regular basis and have not had problems with the zippers.</li>
            <li> I suggest buying a few of them with low prices like these!</li>
            <li> The Zippers were not easy to open or close.</li>
            <li> Only negative thing was that it was a little smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a typical make up bag</li>
            <li> The little mirror is well...</li>
            <li> I was worried that they would be too small to hold all of my little gifts</li>
            <li> Bought this for a christmas gift and its so small you need a magnifying glass to see it.</li>
            <li> it was small</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t  like it&#x27;s too too small</li>
            <li> Although it looks small, it expands quite a bit and holds a lot of stuff.</li>
            <li> I got this bag with in two days of ordering it when i got it i thought it was small</li>
            <li> I thought the makeup bag was going to be bigger than what it was, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> When I received it I thought it seemed really small</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really small.</li>
            <li> stupidly small!</li>
            <li> when I opened up the bag to the item, it was wet and dirty and there are threads fraying all over it.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all</li>
            <li> I bought this for travel because I was tired of bottles leaking or breaking and spoiling my carefully-packed clothes.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that it took so long to get here!</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this cosmetic bag.</li>
            <li> The way it&#x27;s built makes it difficult to work with if you have a lot of make-up in it.</li>
            <li> Soo disappointed and embarrassed.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t here for Christmas :(</li>
            <li> I hate this bag.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed it was  not 31 bag</li>
            <li> Terrible quality -</li>

            <li> I love this little bag. It has a place for everything you need for your makeup. A perfect quality as well</li>
            <li> This makeup case is very cute. The color is exactly what I wanted. Only negative thing was that it was a little smaller than I expected. Other than that , it&#x27;s perfect !</li>
            <li> Had this case for about 6 months. While it is cute, it&#x27;s very cheap and managed to rip along the bottom of the top compartment about 3 months in, and spilled the contents all over the place while I was carrying it one day :( You can find a better quality makeup bag at Walmart for less.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute and worth the $5 I paid for it. Pretty large so it will hold my big round brush and full size shampoo bottles for traveling.</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to big bigger then what I received but it is not, which is perfect! I didn&#x27;t want something very bulky to begin with so I really like that this bag is not.  The color is exactly as the picture shown and the material is smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bag fits everything I use on a daily bases from makeup, to brushes,  even lotion and perfume.  I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> This makeup bag is SO cute! It fits my makeup perfectly and is easy to grab and go if I&#x27;m getting ready at a girlfriend&#x27;s house.</li>
            <li> Cute :) Fits everything I need to take with me. I love that it has a tiny mirror in it, and lots of holders for my makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> This is called a Cosmetic bag, but I got as a jewelry tote and storage bag for my young 7 year old Granddaughter. Since it has a mirror in the top area, she might put her play makeup in the top section and then her jewelry in the lower section. It&#x27;s well made, bright, and colorful ans the perfect size for a young girl.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a makeup wearer, so I myself won&#x27;t use it for that purpose. However, I do design, make, and sell my own jewelry and can use this as a carrying case for my Swarovski Crystal pieces to and from shows and craft fairs and also a storage case for the crystal. It also comes in a more grownup black with white dots.</li>
            <li> only downfall is the little mirror inside broke. that is my fault though, i love this bag, i have alot of makeup and its perfect size for it all. will buy another in a diffrent color! (:</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expect it it was small but it was pretty and it held up. Love it and the color.</li>
            <li> The bag is exactly as described - you get what you see listed on the site! Bag is very durable, made of very strong materials, and expands when zipped. Would definitely recommend this seller and this product!</li>
            <li> very nice bag, i think it is the most beautiful color for this stuff. i used it as a gift for my friend...</li>
            <li> A bit flimsy but it is cute.  I bought it for my niece and I think she will love it.</li>
            <li> perfect if you don&#x27;t have a massive makeup collection. just the right size and keeps everything organized so nothing gets lost at the bottom of the bag - always my problem.</li>
            <li> I hate this bag. It&#x27;s small. It has two compartments. I&#x27;m always trying to shove things back in and wedge it closed. It was inexpensive, so at least I didn&#x27;t waste too much money however.</li>
            <li> I love the dot designs really neat. The bag is prettying cheap for such a  good product. I love the way it has space for tools and it has two layers. I use this bag for nail polish and nail polish tools and it fits well. I carry this all around especially for trips to far places.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted and I love it! I was more than excited to get my makeup in it.</li>
            <li> Great product considering the cost. Used as gifts for a bachelorette party and they were perfect! Would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Love this! Convenient pockets for mascara or whatever you like. Holds its shape well. Have had it a few months, use it on a regular basis and have not had problems with the zippers.</li>
            <li> I really like this cosmetic bag and it surprisingly holds a lot. It was much smaller than I expected but it works just fine and for the price you really can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> It carries enough makeup. I wish it was bigger though other than that there no complaints about it. It&#x27;s a typical make up bag</li>
            <li> I bought these for some bridesmaids gifts because many of the other bags from other stores were too expensive. These little bags are awesome but they are very very hot pink. The picture doesn&#x27;t exactly depict how shiny and bright the fabric is in person but they are so adorable! They are much roomier than I thought they would be as well. I was worried that they would be too small to hold all of my little gifts but they are perfect. There is an attached mirror on the top pocket and spots to hold makeup brushes and anything else you dont want flying around in there. I would definitely purchase from this seller again! They arrived much sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> Great quality bag. The sides do not stay up on their own so it tends to flatten out a little bit but it has a solid construction and fits quite a bit of make up. This is a great travel-sized bag but I would not recommend it for someone looking to store their extensive collection.</li>
            <li> This make up bag is really nice. Good quality. Perfect sizing if you dont have alot of makeup. Fexible (meaning if the item in it is too big it will flex around it). Cute. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Terrible quality - when I opened up the bag to the item, it was wet and dirty and there are threads fraying all over it. Look elsewhere for a make-up bag!!</li>
            <li> Love this! Its really cute in person ..the colors are bright! It holds more than I expected even though it&#x27;s small</li>
            <li> LOVE this. I still use it and I bought it a while ago. Reminds me of Minnie mouse</li>
            <li> Very disappointed it was  not 31 bag they may it sound like it was , it very small . Not big  enough to put your makeup in.My granddaughter  Will play with. Not happy at all</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT! I USE IT FOR SCHOOL AND KEEPS EVERYTHING IN PLACE! SO ORGANIZED! I RECCOMEND! LOVE IT! :)</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my 8 year old daughter and she seems to like it a lot.. It&#x27;s a cute little bag for the price.. I might order another one for myself..</li>
            <li> I just thought it was going to be a little bit bigger. It does the job and its cute. So Im satisfied.</li>
            <li> This product was delivered on time, was exactly what the description said, I would definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> The bag is very cute and functional for my needs.  I put my most used items on top so I can find them easier.  I put my rarely used items on the bottom.  I love the hot pink inside because it makes finding things easier as opposed to the typical dark insides and the abyss of finding stuff.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of makeup, so it&#x27;s perfect sized for my needs.  THE CON- since I got it a week ago, the top has started to sag backwards because the bottom pouch has no support...granted I don&#x27;t have much up top except mascara, blush, eyelash curler, Bobby pins, Rubberbands tweezers, etc.  The top is only half full.  To fix the problem, I took the plastic bottom out of one of my recyclable bags and made a hoop that runs the outer perimeter of the bottom compartment.  We will see how that holds up.  I wish I could upload the photo I took to show you my modification.</li>
            <li> Shinny hot pink martial (Satin) cute, little and pretty, good for a little girl who doesn&#x27;t have a lot of cosmetics.</li>
            <li> Great bag, exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;Does have a strong plastic/dye smell when you first get it, seems to dissipate after a while.&lt;br /&gt;Great little bag for the price</li>
            <li> It looks cute but the quality is okay. I wish I had put in some extra money to get a good one!</li>
            <li> I bought this for travel because I was tired of bottles leaking or breaking and spoiling my carefully-packed clothes. It&#x27;s perfect for storing and organizing your beauty care items at home as well - looks adorable on a makeup table or sink.  Would make a good gift, too.</li>
            <li> Very cute bag! I could store my Naked3 shadow palette into this bag. A downside to this bag is that the bottom compartment has a problem remaining upright and always droops to the side. I only store a few brushes and pencils on the top compartment, so it is not heavy and has no reason to be sagging down. In fact, it still sags down even with nothing in the top compartment. I wish they would make the sides of the bag more firm so that it would not droop and have a crease on the side.</li>
            <li> I have had this for a while now and I absolutely love it :) it is very large and holds tons of makeup. The little mirror is well... stupidly small! Really just probably a waste of product but the bag is cute.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t  like it&#x27;s too too small</li>
            <li> I love the soft fabric. I also really love the dual sections. It helps with organization and with finding what I need quickly. My favorite section is the makeup brush holders! It&#x27;s much more sanitary and keeps the bag clean. I am used to my brushes being piled on top of one another, and getting my makeup bag dirty. This is much better. Good bag!</li>
            <li> This bag is really cute. Although it looks small, it expands quite a bit and holds a lot of stuff. I&#x27;ve even fit a 32 piece palette inside.</li>
            <li> Almost forgot about this order because of the long wait. However it was worth wait the wait. Good quality and it is what it is as shown in picture. Can&#x27;t wait to use for travel instead of taking my whole drawer of make up.</li>
            <li> This is a really cute bag for a great price. This bag would run me almost 20 bucks at a Target or CVS. I did think it was bigger but it&#x27;s not bad since I don&#x27;t have much makeup anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really great deal!</li>
            <li> Perfect little make up bag. Really cute.  has two roomy sections.  The top has an attached mirror &amp; places to put brushes in the lid. The bottom compartment is the biggest. I only gave it 4 stars because it took almost 3 months to come in the mail.  But Its perfect for me &amp; the price is great :D</li>
            <li> I needed a new make up bag, and I specifically wanted to find one that would hold all of my brushes. I am so happy with this bag. First of all, it is really cute! I love that the brushes have a designated spot that is separated from the rest of the make up and contents in the bag. This will keep them clean and in great condition - yay! I also love the double decker aspect of this bag. There are two zippered compartments: one large compartment on the bottom of the bag, and one smaller compartment on the top of the bag (where the brushes are). This helps me keep everything organized, and I finally can find what I am looking for instead of digging around in a bag. I am very pleased about this bag and I would definitely recommend it to others, especially at such a great price!</li>
            <li> I got this bag with in two days of ordering it when i got it i thought it was small but it fits everything i need and more. very cute bag and i would highly recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a great make up bag!!!</li>
            <li> This little double decker bag does the trick and let me be organized to boot. Well made.</li>
            <li> Cute make up bag.  Holds up good and holds a lot of stuff. Zippers work well too.  Will buy again when I need too.</li>
            <li> This is a cute bag. I was looking for something a little bigger so I gave it away. The Zippers were not easy to open or close. I liked the color it was just as shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this yet but I do love it! It was smaller than I expected but I think it will be prefect for traveling with the makeup I need!</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted this for Christmas and was very happy with it. I was disappointed that it took so long to get here! It wasn&#x27;t here for Christmas :(</li>
            <li> Great makeup bag for traveling. Small but big enough for what ever you need. And it&#x27;s cute. Took at while to get it but came in time it said it would.</li>
            <li> LOVE the color and how big it is. Using this for my nail polish, and was concernd everything would&#x27;t fit..... three words, I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I was actually not looking for a make-up bag at the time I found this- I was searching for a new Nail Polish bag, as my current one was getting to be to small (Yes, I have way too many, but that&#x27;s beside the point). Anyway, what makes this bag great, other than the quality and utter cuteness, is the double-decker feature. I love that I can keep all of my color polishes standing up on the bottom (snug, but a perfect fit), and all of the clear either hardeners or top-coats in the top portion of the bag. Love that they all fit, and I&#x27;m not \\&quot;digging\\&quot; around to find the right color and/or topcoat anymore. Perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it looks even cuter in person. Just adorable, but grown up enough that I wouldn&#x27;t mind traveling with it as a make up bag. If hesitant, go for it!</li>
            <li> This cosmetic bag is spacious, flexible, and it fits in a tote sized purse/ handbag. Because I have gained an addiction to Mary Kay products and my collection is growing, I thought that this case would be a good temporary keeper for my cosmetics. Turns out, that this case is a lot bigger than it looks. I have one blush, four eyeshadows, concealer, satin hands sample packs, foundation, foundation brush, eyebrow &amp; eyeliner duo brush,7 different lipsticks, 3 lipglosses, 2 eyeliner pens, tweezers, &amp; a gel eyeliner jar w/ applicator stick and I can still flatten the case down because of the room left for me to stuff it! Great product! I suggest buying a few of them with low prices like these! Declutter your life &amp; Enjoy!</li>
            <li> It is good for the money. The inside was a beige color i thought that was a little different.  Very happy.</li>
            <li> It is smaller than it shows in the picture. Received it faster than it had promised. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it if u have lot of make up</li>
            <li> I thought the makeup bag was going to be bigger than what it was, but I was wrong. Had it for a few weeks and had to go out and buy a bigger one because all of my make up won&#x27;t fit in the polka dot one.</li>
            <li> it was much smaller than I was expecting. I could not use it for travel because of its size. The picture gave me the impression it was larger than it actually was. i did not pay attention to the dimensions.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this cosmetic bag. It took about a month to arrive and it wasn&#x27;t even how I pictured. It&#x27;s cute, but it&#x27;s smaller than it looks in the picture. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> The compartments are a decent size and it does hold quite a bit of makeup or toiletries. I&#x27;m satisfied with the item and I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of use out of it.</li>
            <li> i ordered this for my mother a while back and took forever to come in! also the color is not the same but she liked it</li>
            <li> seller was nice I have to say. My first one was broken, it is a dedect. But the seller sent me a new one for free,&lt;br /&gt;Kind of nice. The new one still has little problem but anyway i can use it. Good one.</li>
            <li> Really cute I use it for my nail polishes and it&#x27;s so good</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my 20 year old niece and she absolutely loved it.  When I received it I thought it seemed really small but all of her make-up fit perfectly!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from a makeup bag that cost under $5, but I was pleasantly surprised!  It&#x27;s got tons of space, which you might not think upon first looking at it. The material is pretty good quality and washes off easily.  The color is very cute.  I definitely recommend this if you have a lot of makeup :)</li>
            <li> Cute and useful. Love it, and its an excellent deal</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really small. But nice enough for a short trip, or to store extra makeup or jewelry in.</li>
            <li> This is smaller than I thought. The way it&#x27;s built makes it difficult to work with if you have a lot of make-up in it. It had a chemical smell to it that took awhile to go away.</li>
            <li> Already reviewed. I don&#x27;t know what the problem is, But I have already reviewed this product, and all of my purchases!</li>
