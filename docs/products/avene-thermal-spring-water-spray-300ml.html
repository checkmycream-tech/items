            <li>It is an amazing cool,</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to travel with this</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s an amazing feeling when on a hot aluminum boat.</li>
            <li>It calms my skin down and best of all moisturize it as well.</li>
            <li>just a fine mist that doesn&#x27;t leave water residue.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Significantly reduces the post procedure burning sensation.</li>
            <li>So far OK !</li>

            <li>It cools me off enough to refresh me but not too much to put my body in shock.&lt;br /&gt;While cooling me off and refreshing my skin</li>
            <li>I can fish for much longer after refreshing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it way too much</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell good or not good .</li>
            <li>Very, very helpful after laser facial procedures.</li>
            <li>After i sprayed on my face, my skin immediately turns soft!</li>
            <li>I live in a dry area.</li>
            <li>If you grab a wet towel you will have wet spots or drip everywhere right??</li>
            <li>However, after using it on my face, my face became tight and dry that I couldn&#x27;t even smile.</li>
            <li>Only one issue is that the pop cap sometimes is cracked in Amazon shipment and that can be annoying; otherwise superior product, highly reccommend.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> The product is excellent, but the bottle arrived with some damage. ./.</li>
            <li> Great spring water, super for pre-moisturizer application, refreshing on a hot day, preventing razor burn after shaving, really helps reduce pilaris keratosis on arms, back, etc. Softens and refreshes skin, skin texture actually improves over time with regular use. Large can last a long time, great value. Only one issue is that the pop cap sometimes is cracked in Amazon shipment and that can be annoying; otherwise superior product, highly reccommend.  Will be part of my skin care routine for life.</li>
            <li> I live in a dry area. And this spray helps me a lot. I feel good when using it. It&#x27;s worthy,</li>
            <li> I will be the first to day WHY would I pay for water in the can? So if you are like me let me tell you why I love this Avene Thermal Spring water;&lt;br /&gt; It is an amazing cool, refreshing mist that is perfect for working outside or after a strenuous workout. I use it all the time at the gym. It cools me off enough to refresh me but not too much to put my body in shock.&lt;br /&gt;While cooling me off and refreshing my skin it does not leave me soaking wet. If you grab a wet towel you will have wet spots or drip everywhere right?? Not with this mist it just a fine mist that doesn&#x27;t leave water residue.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so convenient and it&#x27;s easy to travel with this can I stick in my gym bag or purse so it&#x27;s always there when I need it. I have a bottle in my fishing bag as well. That&#x27;s an amazing feeling when on a hot aluminum boat. I can fish for much longer after refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be completely honest I have no idea about any benefits for my skin. If there are any. it&#x27;s just a bonus but I will never be without a bottle of this water I use it way too much</li>
            <li> I like it ! After wash my face . I put it ! I don&#x27;t know this have any good for my face . I can&#x27;t tell good or not good . So far OK !</li>
            <li> After i sprayed on my face, my skin immediately turns soft! It&#x27;s just an amazing product!! I love it !</li>
            <li> Many people recommended this water to me because I have sensitive skin. However, after using it on my face, my face became tight and dry that I couldn&#x27;t even smile. So I gave up using it.</li>
            <li> Always love the Avene spring water spray.  Makes skin feel completed after washing.  I use it at least twice a day. I order the small ones for travel.</li>
            <li> This seriously works! It calms my skin down and best of all moisturize it as well. On razor burns it works like a charm and I get no irritations at all</li>
            <li> Love to wake up and refresh my face with this.</li>
            <li> nice product. use it 2x daily</li>
            <li> Hydrating and soothing spray. Very, very helpful after laser facial procedures. Especially when combined with cotton face mask that can hold the spray on the face for 10 minutes. Significantly reduces the post procedure burning sensation.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product it made my Skin feel so fresh. I love it.</li>
            <li> very nice stuff&amp;very nice seller!</li>
