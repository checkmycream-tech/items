            <li>It does feel to be of good quality in the hand, adjustment, power switch, and guide all seem well engineered.  </li>

            <li>Not as good as the Conair stubble trimmer.</li>

            <li>I use this for my head and my beard and works great on both great product, came quickly!</li>
            <li>Neat quick, very nice shaver!!!!</li>

            <li>Love this trimmer!  </li>
            <li>I am able to trim my goatee and beard to my girlfriend&#x27;s liking!</li>
            <li>Simply love it !</li>
            <li>It seems to work great just fine and very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>Nice machine for the money</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not the kind of guy that writes reviews</li>
            <li>Nice trimmer.  </li>
            <li>However the many levels of adjustment make this perfect for creating just the right shadow.</li>
            <li>great product, quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Very easy).  </li>
            <li>Honestly this product is pretty perfect for the cheap price you pay.</li>
            <li>Cuts great and is pretty durable!</li>
            <li>Great useful trimmer tool.</li>
            <li>Quick service and product works well!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It will not hold a charge for more then 5 minutes at most, and it will not run while plugged</li>
            <li>Preformed as promised, easy to clean, one charge is good for about a week for my needs.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I love this product and it&#x27;s *</li>
            <li>but if you have anything greater than a quarter of an inch you&#x27;ll want to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Cheap and effective.</li>
            <li>Just like any trimmer though, you have to make sure you get all areas so that you get an even cut.</li>
            <li>Love this thing.</li>
            <li>also, the box said &amp;#34;Only at Walmart&amp;#34;, so you might check that site for more reviews.</li>
            <li>Cheap and Effective</li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my stubble look.</li>
            <li>His beard looks more even now.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;ve bought MANY</li>
            <li>one has a great range of adjustability, and gets pretty close on the lowest setting - but even better, the guide pops off easily and without risk of breakage, just poke it up with your finger.  </li>
            <li>Works great so far, I charged it up and have used it many times since without having to recharge yet, I will update when and if anything makes me deduct a star.</li>
            <li>The motor is very cheap and the blades are cheap as well.</li>
            <li>The multiple levels of adjustment are incredible.</li>
            <li>It cuts great, but it&#x27;s so LOUD that it hurts my eardrums when I&#x27;m trimming sideburns.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and the adjustment of the build in comb is convenient however it does flex somewhat</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned the Norelco QT4021 for a few years now and found it to be an excellent trimmer, however I wanted something with a more fine-toned level of trimming.</li>
            <li>I also thought the depth attachment worked fine, and like the look I get out of the #4 setting.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and works well for my needs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this a few times now and have to say that I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>Adjustable guide means you can shave your head, face or anything else that takes your fancy, and get the length just right to your liking :-)</li>
            <li>This machine did exactly that!!</li>
            <li>The Axe Philips Norelco is quick, light weight and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The first one I bought at a store and was extremely pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Adjustable comb works great and doesn&#x27;t seem to bend or feel cheap as some other reviewers have said.</li>
            <li>A true stubble at the lowest setting.</li>
            <li>Great range of setting, small and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>It is by no means a precise trimmer so if you plan to use it for clean edges or straight lines, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>great job with less cost than the others.  </li>
            <li>Charges fast and runs strong</li>
            <li>I was excited to give this a shot, reading all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Maybe they couldve added a LED light on it to know how much battery it has????</li>
            <li>I first got this</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time yesterday and it provided me with the exact length that I was hoping for (@ level 3, which is somewhere between 2 &amp; 3 on the QT4021).</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>love it, second trimmer i buy in 6yrs.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says it does..</li>
            <li>, maybe the material could be higher grade???</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>This device lets me choose exactly the length I like for my stubble (#3).</li>
            <li>The first time I used this trimmer I was using it with the buttons facing towards me</li>
            <li>The product doesn&#x27;t have multiple attachments which is exactly what I was looking for instead it relies on one attachment that can be easily adjusted.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to experiment with a few other levels to see which \\&quot;look\\&quot; fits me best.</li>
            <li>My beard was getting scraggly and this helped me make it look very good, if not excellent, on the first try.</li>
            <li>This machine was easy to operate, and took about the same time as my QT4021 to do the job, despite the fact that the head piece is a bit narrower.</li>
            <li>how many shaves i got out of it on a single charge.  </li>
            <li>I eliminate this by putting a large newspaper (NY Times size) over sink.  </li>
            <li>The head comes off easy for cleaning, and it seems like it does a great job cutting.  </li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much to this</li>
            <li>It holds a charge very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>and i really like it.  </li>
            <li>But it does what it is meant to do which is trim your hair in various lengths I enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>Good price ,should last longer then cheaper versions by other companies.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also been using it as a replacement for individual razors to clean up the neck area.  </li>
            <li>but the beard started growing twice as fast as I became older.</li>
            <li>I went back to my old 12yr old remington which works a lot better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would definitely recommend this to anyone who can grow a full beard and prefers a stubble.</li>
            <li>I have an older model/version of this</li>
            <li>out of the box I did a shave on the lowest setting and it did s better job than my much more expensive electric shaver...</li>
            <li>One advice I have is that you use this trimmer with the buttons and main logos facing away from you.</li>
            <li>that much but use it on my chin after uisng AXE where the AXE does not hit so well Just because it is cheap, don&#x27;t think it doesn&#x27;t do the job I like this because other methods irritate my face</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m really liking this thing so far.  </li>
            <li>Have used it several times already since the initial charge and still going strong.  </li>
            <li>I charged it when I received it and still waiting for the battery to wear down, but it keep going strong.</li>
            <li>There is a part that broke inside the trimmer, so I am getting a new one.</li>
            <li>will* take off hair very close to the skin, especially ear hair (take the guard off for this:  just pull it straight out.  </li>
            <li>Takes some time, as expected, as blades are cheap, so repeat strokes are necessary, certainly not painful, just not a breeze-thru with higher quality materials, as to be expected.  </li>
            <li>Mainly I am the type of guy that just seems to look a little better when I have some sort of facial hair.</li>
            <li>How could they call this a stubble trimmer, when it left you with a full beard, albeit a short one.</li>
            <li>However the second one was not as sharp and not quite as powerful as the first one.</li>
            <li>really compact and lightweight, time will tell how well it holds up, but for under $30 it&#x27;s got a low mark to clear.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive ears or hearing, avoid this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only difference I found so far is that it&#x27;s much louder than my old trimmer.</li>
            <li>I can taper my hair into my beard and make a haircut last much longer.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t work very well, leaving different sized patches all over the face.</li>
            <li>It seems to not have quite enough power (full charge also) to do the job efficiently, thus  needing to go over the same area multiple times.  </li>
            <li>Still decent second place</li>
            <li>I thought I had the timing down right</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need more than 2 minutes with this thing on my face to realize it&#x27;s weak.</li>
            <li>The main problem I had one this trimmer is that it doesn&#x27;t offer enough length options which limits options for facial hair styles.</li>
            <li>one didn&#x27;t get close enough, as I don&#x27;t want any more than shadow at least for my upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I used to always grow my beard, get the stubble naturally for a very short time before my beard would grow to be too big and look unkempt.</li>
            <li>Not sure about the battery longevity yet, but my experience with Norelco has been positive so far</li>
            <li>My blades had gotten a bit gummed up and it really slowed down the Axe.</li>
            <li>The low settings allow me to get up close and personal while still having enough facial hair so that I don&#x27;t look like a 12 year old boy at work.</li>
            <li>Its small and powerful with a variety of different settings to keep your beard (and hair) whatever length you want.</li>
            <li>Oddly, the straight Norelco version of this same product is double</li>
    </ol>

            <li> A true stubble at the lowest setting.</li>
            <li> Great range of setting, small and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> It is by no means a precise trimmer so if you plan to use it for clean edges or straight lines, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> great job with less cost than the others.  </li>
            <li> Charges fast and runs strong</li>
            <li> I was excited to give this a shot, reading all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Maybe they couldve added a LED light on it to know how much battery it has????</li>
            <li> I first got this</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time yesterday and it provided me with the exact length that I was hoping for (@ level 3, which is somewhere between 2 &amp; 3 on the QT4021).</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> love it, second trimmer i buy in 6yrs.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it does..</li>
            <li> , maybe the material could be higher grade???</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This device lets me choose exactly the length I like for my stubble (#3).</li>
            <li> The first time I used this trimmer I was using it with the buttons facing towards me</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t have multiple attachments which is exactly what I was looking for instead it relies on one attachment that can be easily adjusted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to experiment with a few other levels to see which \\&quot;look\\&quot; fits me best.</li>
            <li> My beard was getting scraggly and this helped me make it look very good, if not excellent, on the first try.</li>
            <li> This machine was easy to operate, and took about the same time as my QT4021 to do the job, despite the fact that the head piece is a bit narrower.</li>
            <li> how many shaves i got out of it on a single charge.  </li>
            <li> I eliminate this by putting a large newspaper (NY Times size) over sink.  </li>
            <li> The head comes off easy for cleaning, and it seems like it does a great job cutting.  </li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much to this</li>
            <li> It holds a charge very well.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> and i really like it.  </li>
            <li> But it does what it is meant to do which is trim your hair in various lengths I enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> Good price ,should last longer then cheaper versions by other companies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also been using it as a replacement for individual razors to clean up the neck area.  </li>
            <li> but the beard started growing twice as fast as I became older.</li>
            <li> I went back to my old 12yr old remington which works a lot better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to anyone who can grow a full beard and prefers a stubble.</li>
            <li> I have an older model/version of this</li>
            <li> out of the box I did a shave on the lowest setting and it did s better job than my much more expensive electric shaver...</li>
            <li> One advice I have is that you use this trimmer with the buttons and main logos facing away from you.</li>
            <li> that much but use it on my chin after uisng AXE where the AXE does not hit so well Just because it is cheap, don&#x27;t think it doesn&#x27;t do the job I like this because other methods irritate my face</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m really liking this thing so far.  </li>
            <li> Have used it several times already since the initial charge and still going strong.  </li>
            <li> I charged it when I received it and still waiting for the battery to wear down, but it keep going strong.</li>
            <li> There is a part that broke inside the trimmer, so I am getting a new one.</li>
            <li> will* take off hair very close to the skin, especially ear hair (take the guard off for this:  just pull it straight out.  </li>
            <li> Takes some time, as expected, as blades are cheap, so repeat strokes are necessary, certainly not painful, just not a breeze-thru with higher quality materials, as to be expected.  </li>
            <li> Mainly I am the type of guy that just seems to look a little better when I have some sort of facial hair.</li>
            <li> How could they call this a stubble trimmer, when it left you with a full beard, albeit a short one.</li>
            <li> However the second one was not as sharp and not quite as powerful as the first one.</li>
            <li> really compact and lightweight, time will tell how well it holds up, but for under $30 it&#x27;s got a low mark to clear.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive ears or hearing, avoid this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only difference I found so far is that it&#x27;s much louder than my old trimmer.</li>
            <li> I can taper my hair into my beard and make a haircut last much longer.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t work very well, leaving different sized patches all over the face.</li>
            <li> It seems to not have quite enough power (full charge also) to do the job efficiently, thus  needing to go over the same area multiple times.  </li>
            <li> Still decent second place</li>
            <li> I thought I had the timing down right</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need more than 2 minutes with this thing on my face to realize it&#x27;s weak.</li>
            <li> The main problem I had one this trimmer is that it doesn&#x27;t offer enough length options which limits options for facial hair styles.</li>
            <li> one didn&#x27;t get close enough, as I don&#x27;t want any more than shadow at least for my upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I used to always grow my beard, get the stubble naturally for a very short time before my beard would grow to be too big and look unkempt.</li>
            <li> Not sure about the battery longevity yet, but my experience with Norelco has been positive so far</li>
            <li> My blades had gotten a bit gummed up and it really slowed down the Axe.</li>
            <li> The low settings allow me to get up close and personal while still having enough facial hair so that I don&#x27;t look like a 12 year old boy at work.</li>
            <li> Its small and powerful with a variety of different settings to keep your beard (and hair) whatever length you want.</li>
            <li> Oddly, the straight Norelco version of this same product is double</li>
            <li> The battery seems to last a long time.</li>
            <li> The battery last so long</li>
            <li> Not like to have my facial hair too long</li>
            <li> For the price, at least it&#x27;s decent to do daily or bi-weekly trimming.  </li>
            <li> so you can&#x27;t push too hard or you might cut too much.  </li>
            <li> My only gripe is that the trimmers are not terribly sharp, meaning I usually have to make multiple passes from varying directions.</li>
            <li> Most depressing trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> you are looking for something long term, this is not the item.  </li>
            <li> If you are careful it is not too big a problem but in the design, I would have like to see that they firmed up the length adjuster so that it cannot bend or flex from its selected length.</li>
            <li> Quality trimming razor for those long eye brows or stray hairs.  </li>
            <li> My only worry is longevity of the product due to price, but for now I have had it for months with no issues.</li>
            <li> The only deficiency is that the plastic length adjuster seems a little fragile and when you press it against your face, it bends and tends to cut closer than the setting you choose.</li>
            <li> , I bought this in the hopes that it would allow me to trim my beard/mustache enough so that I could go a few extra days without shaving.</li>
            <li> 3 starts only for overall quality of product, but so far reliable, using 3x/ week for past few months.  </li>
            <li> and this takes the whiskers off quickly down to .5mm I use a regular razor and water for under the neck which I shave every two days .</li>
            <li> It has a little difficulty with upper lip</li>
            <li> Norelco makes a non axe one for a little cheaper and it is the same unit</li>
            <li> Charging is simple and last me at least 4 shaves (I shave about once or twice a month).</li>
            <li> Less complicated a tool is, usually means the better it works with less chance of breaking.&lt;br /&gt;Right</li>
            <li> but after a once every other week use, the battery is dead.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Lets see if it will last past a year.</li>
            <li> be it electric razor or conventional razor and soap</li>
            <li> What your AXE needs is for you to remove the black plastic clipping head and spray w WD-40 or other brand penetrating oil onto it.</li>
            <li> You can buy the identical trimmer from Norelco without the AXE label for half the price.</li>
            <li> Lost charging capability after less than a year.</li>
            <li> Remove black plastic trimming blades and oil them.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t nitpick something and give it less stars.</li>
            <li> Also can keep a stubble or a little bit longer as desired.</li>
            <li> ---Battery is getting a little bit weaker.</li>
            <li> These are clippers, for crying out</li>
            <li> trims uneven...</li>
            <li> It will scatter a few whiskers around your sink.</li>
            <li> Husband uses it everyday.  </li>
            <li> I have had no issue and I have thick black hair on my face.</li>
            <li> At first, I was disappointed in the lowest setting.</li>
            <li> Yes, expensive and will last me 20 years.</li>
            <li> I find the non razor shave  less irritating on my face.</li>
            <li> &gt; Hardly holds a charge, It trims like it&#x27;s dull, plug it in and it gains no rpm</li>
            <li> only bad thing which is no big deal to me is that this can&#x27;t be ran under the water.&lt;br /&gt;For 30 bucks, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I was forced to shave it all off and start over.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s lame.</li>
            <li> But I was wrong.</li>
            <li> For the price this seems very tough to beat.</li>
            <li> miss my Norelco QT4022, which was at least 50% quieter :(</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no charge or cleaning base, you have to plug the cord in yourself, but this isn&#x27;t a $100</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This was the second one I purchased. The first one I bought at a store and was extremely pleased with it. However the second one was not as sharp and not quite as powerful as the first one. Overall though I like the product.</li>
            <li> I use my trimmer every day great</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;I use it for shaving my head and trimming my beard. Results are satisfactory.</li>
            <li> Love this trimmer!  Trims my mustache like butter.  Have used it several times already since the initial charge and still going strong.  Looks awesome to with a great feel in your hand.</li>
            <li> I have an older model/version of this and I am very impressed. The battery life is incredible. I shave my head every 4 days all of that on one charge! The multiple levels of adjustment are incredible. I am able to trim my goatee and beard to my girlfriend&#x27;s liking! Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Best price on a stubble trimmer and it works great.  There isn&#x27;t much to this and that&#x27;s what makes it great.  Less complicated a tool is, usually means the better it works with less chance of breaking.&lt;br /&gt;Right out of the box I did a shave on the lowest setting and it did s better job than my much more expensive electric shaver...only bad thing which is no big deal to me is that this can&#x27;t be ran under the water.&lt;br /&gt;For 30 bucks, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> It cuts great, but it&#x27;s so LOUD that it hurts my eardrums when I&#x27;m trimming sideburns. If you have sensitive ears or hearing, avoid this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I miss my Norelco QT4022, which was at least 50% quieter :(</li>
            <li> Very happy with the performance.  The battery seems to last a long time. I charged it when I received it and still waiting for the battery to wear down, but it keep going strong.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Would recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> Nice machine for the money</li>
            <li> Neat quick, very nice shaver!!!!</li>
            <li> Purchased in February 2014, battery is now useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first got this I loved it.  but after a once every other week use, the battery is dead.&lt;br /&gt;It will not hold a charge for more then 5 minutes at most, and it will not run while plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for something long term, this is not the item.  You get what you pay for in this case.</li>
            <li> Preformed as promised, easy to clean, one charge is good for about a week for my needs.Rounded blades do not pull or tug at skin or hair. Good price ,should last longer then cheaper versions by other companies.</li>
            <li> Awesome Product I love the adjustable head.  I use this for my head and my beard and works great on both great product, came quickly!</li>
            <li> Works great to keep a stubble beard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not the kind of guy that writes reviews but I&#x27;m recovering from surgery and have time and thought I would warn guys out there this trimmer is crap.&lt;br /&gt; Hardly holds a charge, It trims like it&#x27;s dull, plug it in and it gains no rpm this thing is a 30.00 waist. I went back to my old 12yr old remington which works a lot better.</li>
            <li> great job with less cost than the others.  Trust in buying this</li>
            <li> Easy to use and the adjustment of the build in comb is convenient however it does flex somewhat so you can&#x27;t push too hard or you might cut too much.  It holds a charge very well.</li>
            <li> Works good.  Trims my beard.</li>
            <li> got slower and slower and eventually stopped working after about 2 months...</li>
            <li> This razor is perfect for the gym or home.  I set it on 3 for a great stubble look, and now 4 for a slightly more noticeable look.  It has *lots* of adjustment settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not, however, use it as a razor or razor replacement.  These are clippers, for crying out loud!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it *will* take off hair very close to the skin, especially ear hair (take the guard off for this:  just pull it straight out.  Very easy).  Anyway, I love this product and it&#x27;s *way* cheaper than its competitors!  Oddly, the straight Norelco version of this same product is double the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t hesitate.  You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> very happy with this trimmer. good if you like to always have some stubble.</li>
            <li> excellent product and service</li>
            <li> Works great so far, I charged it up and have used it many times since without having to recharge yet, I will update when and if anything makes me deduct a star.</li>
            <li> Cuts to great lengths, sturdy, holds it&#x27;s charge. Seems well built to me.</li>
            <li> II was looking for a replacement for another Philips trimmer and I was hoping this would work. The product doesn&#x27;t have multiple attachments which is exactly what I was looking for instead it relies on one attachment that can be easily adjusted. The main problem I had one this trimmer is that it doesn&#x27;t offer enough length options which limits options for facial hair styles. It is called a stubble trimmer so that was on oversight on my part I suppose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have very short facial hair this will work for you but if you have anything greater than a quarter of an inch you&#x27;ll want to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Excellent trimmer but overpriced. You can buy the identical trimmer from Norelco without the AXE label for half the price.</li>
            <li> Nicest cordless trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned!</li>
            <li> Simple but well built! The removeable adjustable comb allows for a controlled cut and also allows for detail trimming. Fits great in the hand and function well!&lt;br /&gt;Very well priced.</li>
            <li> It seems to work great just fine and very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> For the price, at least it&#x27;s decent to do daily or bi-weekly trimming.  Takes some time, as expected, as blades are cheap, so repeat strokes are necessary, certainly not painful, just not a breeze-thru with higher quality materials, as to be expected.  3 starts only for overall quality of product, but so far reliable, using 3x/ week for past few months.  Cheap and effective.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m really liking this thing so far.  Without  the depth control attachment on, It&#x27;s great for shaping up the beard at the jaw line. I&#x27;ve also been using it as a replacement for individual razors to clean up the neck area.  That&#x27;s where i had to knock off a star.  It seems to not have quite enough power (full charge also) to do the job efficiently, thus  needing to go over the same area multiple times.  Other than that though, I was actually impressed how many shaves i got out of it on a single charge.  I also thought the depth attachment worked fine, and like the look I get out of the #4 setting.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re anything like me, you&#x27;re looking to have that stubble beard look, which is somewhere between a 5&#x27;olock shadow and a full-on beard. I&#x27;ve owned the Norelco QT4021 for a few years now and found it to be an excellent trimmer, however I wanted something with a more fine-toned level of trimming. This machine did exactly that!! I used it for the first time yesterday and it provided me with the exact length that I was hoping for (@ level 3, which is somewhere between 2 &amp; 3 on the QT4021). This machine was easy to operate, and took about the same time as my QT4021 to do the job, despite the fact that the head piece is a bit narrower. The only difference I found so far is that it&#x27;s much louder than my old trimmer. Not sure about the battery longevity yet, but my experience with Norelco has been positive so far so I expect the same from this trimmer. I&#x27;m going to experiment with a few other levels to see which \\&quot;look\\&quot; fits me best.</li>
            <li> At first, I was disappointed in the lowest setting. How could they call this a stubble trimmer, when it left you with a full beard, albeit a short one. Then I realized, you get a completely different effect depending on how you angle the device. A true stubble at the lowest setting. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Lost charging capability after less than a year. That&#x27;s lame.</li>
            <li> Great. Exactly what I was looking for. I can taper my hair into my beard and make a haircut last much longer. Also can keep a stubble or a little bit longer as desired.</li>
            <li> Great product! We use on the kids hair as well.</li>
            <li> trims uneven...even after making several adjusyments..</li>
            <li> So far so good.  The head comes off easy for cleaning, and it seems like it does a great job cutting.  Just like any trimmer though, you have to make sure you get all areas so that you get an even cut.</li>
            <li> Love this thing. Its small and powerful with a variety of different settings to keep your beard (and hair) whatever length you want. For the price this seems very tough to beat. Well done.</li>
            <li> I have been getting my beard trimmed whenever I received a haircut. I thought I had the timing down right but the beard started growing twice as fast as I became older. I decided finally I needed to get a beard trimmer and learn to do it myself. My beard was getting scraggly and this helped me make it look very good, if not excellent, on the first try. I could see how others may not like the maximum length on this beard trimmer but for me, I like my beards short so this does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll edit this review if necessary over time but as of this writing, 2/25/2014, I give this 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and works well for my needs.</li>
            <li> Great Trimmer. Would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> love it, second trimmer i buy in 6yrs. great battery, and love the number/settings</li>
            <li> Cuts great and is pretty durable!</li>
            <li> Quick service and product works well!!</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> Honestly this product is pretty perfect for the cheap price you pay. I have had no issue and I have thick black hair on my face. I now can keep a good stubble look all the time. My only worry is longevity of the product due to price, but for now I have had it for months with no issues.</li>
            <li> The red plastic part that adjusts height over the cutter WILL break. If you travel and move things around and use this weekly, you will regret this purchase.&lt;br /&gt; I have searched at Amazon and they do not carry the part.  Phillips web site has it for $9 plus $7 shipping.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking for a stubble trimmer with a metal part.  Yes, expensive and will last me 20 years.</li>
            <li> *****Dec 2016 update Your battery is not dying. What your AXE needs is for you to remove the black plastic clipping head and spray w WD-40 or other brand penetrating oil onto it. Let is sit 10 minutes then knock off any excess of the penetrating oil. I did this 60 minutes ago and it was like day and night  ******  April 2016 update---Battery is getting a little bit weaker. Say 20%. But I am still happy with it. MUST must must spray some WD-40 on the Axe trimming blades. Remove black plastic trimming blades and oil them. Do it twice per year. My blades had gotten a bit gummed up and it really slowed down the Axe. It thought the battery was dying. But I was wrong. The blades need to be slicked up a bit.  ___________  works great for me!!! I no longer use my electric razor  (Norelco) that much but use it on my chin after uisng AXE where the AXE does not hit so well Just because it is cheap, don&#x27;t think it doesn&#x27;t do the job I like this because other methods irritate my face be it electric razor or conventional razor and soap I shave every 3 days and this takes the whiskers off quickly down to .5mm I use a regular razor and water for under the neck which I shave every two days . ***** It will scatter a few whiskers around your sink. I eliminate this by putting a large newspaper (NY Times size) over sink.  ***** April 2014 update--- Still give it 5 stars. It does the job. It has a little difficulty with upper lip so I sometimes use the electric razor on that part</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Very good price.</li>
            <li> Been using it for two months now and no problems at all.  Adjustable comb works great and doesn&#x27;t seem to bend or feel cheap as some other reviewers have said.</li>
            <li> Great useful trimmer tool. Adjustable guide means you can shave your head, face or anything else that takes your fancy, and get the length just right to your liking :-)</li>
            <li> great product, quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it does..I use it for my goatee at a the setting of 2.5 about once a week...Charges fast and runs strong</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t be used without the guard.</li>
            <li> This is a very good trimmer for the price compared to others out there. The only deficiency is that the plastic length adjuster seems a little fragile and when you press it against your face, it bends and tends to cut closer than the setting you choose. If you are careful it is not too big a problem but in the design, I would have like to see that they firmed up the length adjuster so that it cannot bend or flex from its selected length. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I had a panasonic stubble trimmer who&#x27;s battery went bad.&lt;br /&gt;That one didn&#x27;t get close enough, as I don&#x27;t want any more than shadow at least for my upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;This one has a great range of adjustability, and gets pretty close on the lowest setting - but even better, the guide pops off easily and without risk of breakage, just poke it up with your finger.  So if you need to get extra close, you can.&lt;br /&gt;That being said - it&#x27;s a trimmer, not a razor, so set your expectations accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really compact and lightweight, time will tell how well it holds up, but for under $30 it&#x27;s got a low mark to clear.  It does feel to be of good quality in the hand, adjustment, power switch, and guide all seem well engineered.  There&#x27;s no charge or cleaning base, you have to plug the cord in yourself, but this isn&#x27;t a $100 unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note also, the box said &amp;#34;Only at Walmart&amp;#34;, so you might check that site for more reviews.</li>
            <li> Got 1 word for this item....awesome</li>
            <li> Quality trimming razor for those long eye brows or stray hairs.  Great range of setting, small and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> works perfectly and price is great</li>
            <li> The battery last so long and i have been using this for 6 months almost and i really like it.  Norelco makes a non axe one for a little cheaper and it is the same unit but I like the color.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I do not like to shave with a razor blade every week. Mainly I am the type of guy that just seems to look a little better when I have some sort of facial hair. Not like to have my facial hair too long, I bought this in the hopes that it would allow me to trim my beard/mustache enough so that I could go a few extra days without shaving. It works perfectly. The low settings allow me to get up close and personal while still having enough facial hair so that I don&#x27;t look like a 12 year old boy at work.</li>
            <li> Cheap and Effective I have no complaints with this trimmer, maybe the material could be higher grade??? But it does what it is meant to do which is trim your hair in various lengths I enjoy this product. Maybe they couldve added a LED light on it to know how much battery it has???? I won&#x27;t nitpick something and give it less stars.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my stubble look. Lets see if it will last past a year.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer but has a life span of 4 months under weekly usage.. There is a part that broke inside the trimmer, so I am getting a new one.</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer.  Husband uses it everyday.  His beard looks more even now.</li>
            <li> I find the non razor shave  less irritating on my face. The Axe Philips Norelco is quick, light weight and easy to use. Did I mention it&#x27;s a good price that has save on having to buy replacement  blades?</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for. For a while I&#x27;ve been trying to find a way to trim my beard to a shorter level to get that stubble look. I used to always grow my beard, get the stubble naturally for a very short time before my beard would grow to be too big and look unkempt. I was forced to shave it all off and start over. This device lets me choose exactly the length I like for my stubble (#3). You can even take the red guard off and use it as a regular shaver. Charging is simple and last me at least 4 shaves (I shave about once or twice a month). One advice I have is that you use this trimmer with the buttons and main logos facing away from you. The first time I used this trimmer I was using it with the buttons facing towards me and it didn&#x27;t work very well, leaving different sized patches all over the face. Once I turned it over it worked like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to anyone who can grow a full beard and prefers a stubble.</li>
            <li> Excellent stubble trimmer, does not work well if you are looking for a clean shave.</li>
            <li> best beard trimmer i&#x27;ve ever owned and i&#x27;ve bought MANY</li>
            <li> Simply love it ! It is precise, effective and does a great job keeping my beard trim !</li>
            <li> Not as good as the Conair stubble trimmer. Still decent second place</li>
            <li> I bought this razor and only got to use it for about 2 weeks before it broke. The motor is very cheap and the blades are cheap as well. After 2 weeks the motor would spin and the blades would not move. I learned my lesson with this product.</li>
            <li> I was excited to give this a shot, reading all the positive reviews. I didn&#x27;t need more than 2 minutes with this thing on my face to realize it&#x27;s weak. If you have coarse hairs, it will not cut. You&#x27;ll be going over the same spot several times and even after that, it still didn&#x27;t do the job. Most depressing trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used. Back to Remington!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times now and have to say that I&#x27;m impressed. It is by no means a precise trimmer so if you plan to use it for clean edges or straight lines, look elsewhere. However the many levels of adjustment make this perfect for creating just the right shadow. My only gripe is that the trimmers are not terribly sharp, meaning I usually have to make multiple passes from varying directions.</li>
