            <li>I have a family history of Alzheimers and with the uncertainty of how aluminum affects our aging brains I wanted to do my best to eliminate aluminum and toxic cancer causing parabens. .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that deodorants with zinc oxide are the best at controlling odor.  </li>

            <li>The smell is not overpowering, and is pleasant.</li>
            <li>The smell was pleasant in my opinion.</li>
            <li>A friend told me that I always smell so good, and I am not wearing perfume--it is the deodorant.</li>

            <li>I love this deodorant!  </li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>Love the product!</li>
            <li>And it has a nice gender neutral odor.  </li>
            <li>I can safely say it is my favorite!  </li>
            <li>Yes, this is the best long-lasting natural deodorant I have ever found!</li>
            <li>This is the best &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant I&#x27;ve found and used so far.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t go on clear, but I&#x27;m happy to overlook that since it works!</li>

            <li>I love this stick.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite deodorant.</li>
            <li>I was so glad to find this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried Tom&#x27;s and Crystal, but I really love the Now Foods because it lasts longer than the others.  </li>
            <li>I wasnt sweating, was wearing a tank top, and within 2 hours had b.o. Note:</li>
            <li>Even after a shower, most deodorants break through in about 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Eat more vegetables or take a chlorophyl supplement to get the \\&quot;Funk\\&quot; out of your body - you will find that ALL deodorants will work better.</li>
            <li>and I am able to go a couple of days without reapplying.</li>
            <li>the deodorant worked to keep my odor away much better in the marshmallow state than it did in the coconut oil state.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>No odor and healthy.</li>
            <li>then more like oil in the end.</li>
            <li>I love that I can apply this after my shower</li>
            <li>easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>literally spraying straight lavender oil on my pits is more effective than this stuff.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Foods is the best natural deodorant I have tried so far.  </li>
            <li>When I transitioned over 2 years ago from aluminum free</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t synthetic or flowery smelling, but smells like REAL lavender, so just clean, kind of piney.  </li>
            <li>It is pricey at about $7-8 per purchase but so worth it!  </li>
            <li>I had already detoxed a full 3 weeks before trying this but after using this now for 2 weeks</li>
            <li>,  My husband is very picky with ingredients being healthy, and this is his TOPS.</li>
            <li>still nothing was working a full day.</li>
            <li>You cannot go wrong with this product, all natural ingredients, pleasant scent, nice application and most important ~ It works!</li>
            <li>This works better than my previous favorite (Lavilin).</li>
            <li>girls love the lavender...and if they do forget it one night its no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First, if you have a lot of toxins in your body, this deodorant is not going to be what you are looking for.</li>
            <li>and it goes on clear and smooth.</li>
            <li>as I continued to use it, the white layer was replaced by a translucent layer that looked like mostly coconut</li>
            <li>Smells great, but not terribly effective.</li>
            <li>I smelled like I&#x27;d hit the gym within the first hour of applying.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many different brands of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants, homemade and none of them would work.</li>
            <li>But I make sure to exfoliate my underarms very well to make sure all traces of previous deodorant is removed, then making sure I&#x27;m completely dry before applying!</li>
            <li>Keeps me dry and smells ok, even for a dude.</li>
            <li>I switched to natural everything recently, and first I tried the Alba brand deodorant and it didn&#x27;t work at all for me, I still smelled, but this deodorant on the other hand, does do a great job of preventing body odor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m putting on too much.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Lavilin cream which works really</li>
            <li>I really like the lavender scent of this deodorant stick.</li>
            <li>you are very toxic</li>
            <li>For me, the consistency was too much like frosting &amp; it got in my clothes.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t sweat much, maybe it will work for you.</li>
            <li>It was really embarrassing</li>
            <li>highly reccommend this product across the board.</li>
            <li>Second, depending upon how much humidity is in the air, this deodorant will either be smooth going on or clumpy and gross.</li>
            <li>I started to try different natural deodorants when I was pregnant with my son.  </li>
            <li>I can only smell it for about an hour after I first put it on.</li>
            <li>First deodorant stick that does not have aluminum in them that actually works that I have found.</li>
            <li>Lasts a long time, without staining clothes or damaging your body from the Aluminum that&#x27;s prevalant in most other products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve carried on with the natural deodorant thing since my son was born over a year ago since he nurses and has his face near my armpits because of</li>
            <li>The fact that putting this deodorant on after her shower is easier to remember than using deodorant in the busy morning is a plus.  </li>
            <li>This stuff will last ALL day if you really smear it on.  </li>
            <li>only downside to it is that it is made from so many natural oils that it is actually really hard to wash off when I shower.  </li>
            <li>Contrary to the claims on the package, I can not get two days&#x27; worth of use out of it, only one, but that&#x27;s about 21 hours longer than any other natural deodorant I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>It does make your underarms REALLY white due to the zinc oxide, but it does fade, and it works better than any other non aluminum deodorant I have tried.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m no stinkier than the next girl trying out natural deoderant remedies.</li>
            <li>I have tried several natural deodorants:</li>
            <li>Been looking for a natural deodorant and this is definitely NOT it.  </li>
            <li>This is the only natural deodorant that has worked for me(i have tried about 4 others)</li>
            <li>I live in Arizona which is dry but during the monsoon months I leave the lid off so that it dries out between uses.</li>
            <li>Only natural deodorant that actually works.</li>
            <li>You really just need a little bit to spread.</li>

            <li> You really just need a little bit to spread.</li>
            <li> I am a 53 year old, 133 lb women with extremely stinky pits.  </li>
            <li> It usually takes a day or more and some hard labor for me to get that funky.</li>
            <li> How can they claim that it lasts long when it can&#x27;t even last the entire day on everyone?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works well as s long lasting deodorant.</li>
            <li> If you are new to zinc oxide, it might take a few weeks of application before the odor is under control (zinc oxide kills the odor-causing bacteria).  </li>
            <li> I also love that the ingredients are completely natural, there&#x27;s not one bad ingredient.</li>
            <li> So, when I&#x27;m actually running around and doing sports, I still use my chemical-laden antiperspirant deodorant, but for everyday use, I stick to the natural Now Foods.</li>
            <li> A few simple changes to your diet can help get rid of these toxins and make it easier for you to wear a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> Tried to follow suggestions of using on skin that&#x27;s been clear for a time of regular deodorant... and then giving this product a few days to start working.  </li>
            <li> No it&#x27;s not clear.  </li>
            <li> First time I used it and really needed the protection, it failed!</li>
            <li> It applies white and it CAN get on your clothing but with a few ninga skills and maneuvers you can avoid that white streak on your clothes.</li>
            <li> I mean, I really don&#x27;t normally smell that way.</li>
            <li> the deodorant started off to be softer than a normal deodorant &amp; as I applied it I had white deodorant that looked like I put a thin layer of marshmallow fluff under my arms.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> if you use your finger to get a little bit of the oily part and the white part and rub it in (which is what I&#x27;ve been doing)</li>
            <li> might try to find something a little less messy and one where the ingredients do not separate after time, but this worked for it&#x27;s main purpose</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s still not as long-lasting as the chemical-laden deodorants, which is to be expected.  </li>
            <li> It is messy, but that way you don&#x27;t end up with a ton of white stuff under your arm like you</li>
            <li> u do have to give it a few days to work if your body has been used to regular deodorant.</li>
            <li> Yes, it goes on thick and has a sort of white film, but its the only one that I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t leave me smelling like a sweaty peach after 2 hours.</li>
            <li> Not until I came across this, its a creamy deodorant and a little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> I will buy for the other women in the family.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have mentioned, when you get towards the end of the product, the bar will crack and break.</li>
            <li> I have average stinkiness.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, white, clay like in consistency.  </li>
            <li> I have been down the road of trying \\&quot;natural\\</li>
            <li> Had a real hard time keeping up with my active 12 year old.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wear with black sleeveless items.  </li>
            <li> downside is that the stick broke in half after about a month of using it</li>
            <li> This deodorant has a little less zinc oxide that other I have tried in the past</li>
            <li> There were times she would come home from school smelling a little funky.  </li>
            <li> So I would just use my finger to get a little bit and rub it in.</li>
            <li> &quot; deodorants a few times.  </li>
            <li> But for on the go everyday.</li>
            <li> well also (made by Now), but it was messy.  </li>
            <li> Drink a green drink each day and you will notice that all the funky smells will start to go away.</li>
            <li> I do use it everyday.</li>
            <li> the longest that it actually kept my under arm odor away was about a day.&lt;br /&gt;- false advertising.</li>
            <li> What a mess!  </li>
            <li> I wanted to get away from the aluminum and crazy chemical stuff in my normal antiperspirant deodorant.  </li>
            <li> Other natural deodorants I looked at still had some bad ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> they were a little rude &amp; seemed un-caring.</li>
            <li> I applied it everyday!</li>
            <li> I also was not pleased by this product.</li>
            <li> Only to leave me feeling completely disappointed and my pocket book empty.  </li>
            <li> I read the negative reviews and here is my opinion of that.</li>
            <li> No more!  </li>
            <li> Even on the hottest summer day I had no worries about odor or excessive sweating!</li>
            <li> That is frustrating.</li>
            <li> It has less bad stuff in it</li>
            <li> &quot;, the company &amp; discussed what could be wrong &amp;</li>
            <li> If you have really bad BO</li>

            <li> I have been down the road of trying \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deodorants a few times.  Only to leave me feeling completely disappointed and my pocket book empty.  I even went on Pinterest helping to discover a homemade recipe . See,  I have a family history of Alzheimers and with the uncertainty of how aluminum affects our aging brains I wanted to do my best to eliminate aluminum and toxic cancer causing parabens. . Well this deodorant is the one for me!  I had already detoxed a full 3 weeks before trying this but after using this now for 2 weeks I can safely say it is my favorite!  I don&#x27;t even notice any b.o. whatsoever. Note:You must shower daily to get this desired result.  And why wouldn&#x27;t you want to anyways?  It is pricey at about $7-8 per purchase but so worth it!  No allergic reactions. .. easy to apply.  No it&#x27;s not clear.  Don&#x27;t wear with black sleeveless items.  What a mess!  For that instead to swipe your pits with apple cider vinegar and coconut oil.  But for on the go everyday. .. this stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> Turns my pits purple/blue(?) Maybe I&#x27;m putting on too much.  Works ok</li>
            <li> It worked for maybe three days and that was it! I applied it everyday! I don&#x27;t see how people are going up to 8 days without re-applying it.</li>
            <li> Only natural deodorant that actually works. It does make your underarms REALLY white due to the zinc oxide, but it does fade, and it works better than any other non aluminum deodorant I have tried.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant!  I&#x27;ve been using the Lavilin cream which works really well also (made by Now), but it was messy.  I love this stick.  I will buy for the other women in the family.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite deodorant. Because I can&#x27;t use aluminum based products but I sweat a LOT I was so glad to find this. Yes, it goes on thick and has a sort of white film, but its the only one that I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t leave me smelling like a sweaty peach after 2 hours. Doesn&#x27;t last all day for me (I sweat a LOT!!), but it works!</li>
            <li> I started to try different natural deodorants when I was pregnant with my son.  I wanted to get away from the aluminum and crazy chemical stuff in my normal antiperspirant deodorant.  I&#x27;ve carried on with the natural deodorant thing since my son was born over a year ago since he nurses and has his face near my armpits because of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Foods is the best natural deodorant I have tried so far.  I&#x27;ve also tried Tom&#x27;s and Crystal, but I really love the Now Foods because it lasts longer than the others.  Plus, I love the smell of lavender, so the scent is great for me.  Tom&#x27;s made me feel stinky after only a couple hours, and Crystal could usually last about 1/2 to 3/4 of a work day, but Now Foods seems to last all work day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to it is that it is made from so many natural oils that it is actually really hard to wash off when I shower.  Also, it&#x27;s still not as long-lasting as the chemical-laden deodorants, which is to be expected.  So, when I&#x27;m actually running around and doing sports, I still use my chemical-laden antiperspirant deodorant, but for everyday use, I stick to the natural Now Foods.</li>
            <li> Yes, this is the best long-lasting natural deodorant I have ever found! Thank you!</li>
            <li> literally spraying straight lavender oil on my pits is more effective than this stuff. I wasnt sweating, was wearing a tank top, and within 2 hours had b.o. Note: i&#x27;m no stinkier than the next girl trying out natural deoderant remedies. I have average stinkiness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that deodorants with zinc oxide are the best at controlling odor.  The downside is that zinc oxide leaves a chalky residue.  This deodorant has a little less zinc oxide that other I have tried in the past so it&#x27;s not quite as sticky.  And it has a nice gender neutral odor.  If you are new to zinc oxide, it might take a few weeks of application before the odor is under control (zinc oxide kills the odor-causing bacteria).  But after that you can sometimes go for days without the smell coming back, but do us all a favor and keep applying it anyways.</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with this product, all natural ingredients, pleasant scent, nice application and most important ~ It works!</li>
            <li> Had a real hard time keeping up with my active 12 year old.  There were times she would come home from school smelling a little funky.  No more!  The fact that putting this deodorant on after her shower is easier to remember than using deodorant in the busy morning is a plus.  Also it smells great...girls love the lavender...and if they do forget it one night its no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly reccommend this product across the board.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY deodorant that works for me.  I am a 53 year old, 133 lb women with extremely stinky pits.  Even after a shower, most deodorants break through in about 30 minutes.  This stuff will last ALL day if you really smear it on.  It&#x27;s thick, white, clay like in consistency.  I have tried them all.  Would not be with out this ever.  Buy it!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried several natural deodorants: Tom&#x27;s of Maine, Hugo Naturals, Kiss My Face, the Thai one that is a big \\&quot;rock\\&quot;, Desert Essence, and others. \\&quot;Now Solutions\\&quot; deodorant is the only one I&#x27;ve ever tried that truly works all day, even if I get sweaty. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my armpits, like some others do (I&#x27;m lookin&#x27; at you, Kiss My Face).  Contrary to the claims on the package, I can not get two days&#x27; worth of use out of it, only one, but that&#x27;s about 21 hours longer than any other natural deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is pasty, though it is the stick form, and it leaves white marks on your clothes.  I don&#x27;t care.  I love it!  It works!  If you want a technological marvel, you&#x27;ll have to look for the chemical-laden deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is lavender, but it is lavender essential oil, not lavender \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot;.  It isn&#x27;t synthetic or flowery smelling, but smells like REAL lavender, so just clean, kind of piney.  I can only smell it for about an hour after I first put it on.</li>
            <li> First deodorant stick that does not have aluminum in them that actually works that I have found. I really like the lavender scent of this deodorant stick. A friend told me that I always smell so good, and I am not wearing perfume--it is the deodorant. The smell is not overpowering, and is pleasant.</li>
            <li> I have been using this deodorant for a couple of years and I love it! I read the negative reviews and here is my opinion of that. First, if you have a lot of toxins in your body, this deodorant is not going to be what you are looking for. Eat more vegetables or take a chlorophyl supplement to get the \\&quot;Funk\\&quot; out of your body - you will find that ALL deodorants will work better. Second, depending upon how much humidity is in the air, this deodorant will either be smooth going on or clumpy and gross. I live in Arizona which is dry but during the monsoon months I leave the lid off so that it dries out between uses. I use it after getting out of the shower when my skin is still moist (gross word!) and it goes on clear and smooth. I have never had problems with it staining my clothes and I am able to go a couple of days without reapplying. It is awesome and smells great!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your underarms are part of your body&#x27;s filtering system. If you have really bad BO you are very toxic - that smell is coming from inside your body. A few simple changes to your diet can help get rid of these toxins and make it easier for you to wear a natural deodorant. Drink a green drink each day and you will notice that all the funky smells will start to go away. Also, avoid using Antiperspirants - they prevent the body from flushing toxins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps! :o)</li>
            <li> I also was not pleased by this product. For me, the consistency was too much like frosting &amp; it got in my clothes. I wrote to \\&quot;now foods\\&quot;, the company &amp; discussed what could be wrong &amp; they were a little rude &amp; seemed un-caring. They said that if I didn&#x27;t like their product that I should just return it to the store I purchased it from &amp; get a refund. They also had no idea how else to get their deodorant out of my clothes. They said it should just wash out. It didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I liked:&lt;br /&gt;- The smell was pleasant in my opinion. It smells like lavender &amp; pine&lt;br /&gt;- It has less bad stuff in it (which is why I purchased it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;- the deodorant started off to be softer than a normal deodorant &amp; as I applied it I had white deodorant that looked like I put a thin layer of marshmallow fluff under my arms.&lt;br /&gt;- as I continued to use it, the white layer was replaced by a translucent layer that looked like mostly coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;- the deodorant worked to keep my odor away much better in the marshmallow state than it did in the coconut oil state.&lt;br /&gt;- the longest that it actually kept my under arm odor away was about a day.&lt;br /&gt;- false advertising. How can they claim that it lasts long when it can&#x27;t even last the entire day on everyone?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while.  No odor and healthy.</li>
            <li> Smells great, but not terribly effective. If you don&#x27;t sweat much, maybe it will work for you.</li>
            <li> Been looking for a natural deodorant and this is definitely NOT it.  Tried to follow suggestions of using on skin that&#x27;s been clear for a time of regular deodorant... and then giving this product a few days to start working.  First time I used it and really needed the protection, it failed! I smelled like I&#x27;d hit the gym within the first hour of applying.  I mean, I really don&#x27;t normally smell that way. It usually takes a day or more and some hard labor for me to get that funky. It was really embarrassing and I don&#x27;t think I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is the best &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant I&#x27;ve found and used so far. It doesn&#x27;t go on clear, but I&#x27;m happy to overlook that since it works!</li>
            <li> BEST deodorant you can buy,  My husband is very picky with ingredients being healthy, and this is his TOPS. And is ALSO lasts for days with one application. Buy it!</li>
            <li> I switched to natural everything recently, and first I tried the Alba brand deodorant and it didn&#x27;t work at all for me, I still smelled, but this deodorant on the other hand, does do a great job of preventing body odor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took it with me on a Europe trip where I was walking in the heat a lot and going dancing, and I wasn&#x27;t smelly at all! I did apply it almost every day, although I noticed unless I scrub my armpits it doesn&#x27;t come off. I also love that the ingredients are completely natural, there&#x27;s not one bad ingredient. Other natural deodorants I looked at still had some bad ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside is that the stick broke in half after about a month of using it (I&#x27;ve been using the same stick for 7 months now, applying it almost every day). So I would just use my finger to get a little bit and rub it in. It is messy, but that way you don&#x27;t end up with a ton of white stuff under your arm like you might if you just rubbed the stick on you. You really just need a little bit to spread. One reviewer mentioned that it was very white in the beginning and then more like oil in the end. I think this is because the ingredients tend to separate, so if you use your finger to get a little bit of the oily part and the white part and rub it in (which is what I&#x27;ve been doing) it works. I just wash my hands after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might try to find something a little less messy and one where the ingredients do not separate after time, but this worked for it&#x27;s main purpose so I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different brands of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants, homemade and none of them would work. By mid-day I was already smelling off. When I transitioned over 2 years ago from aluminum free I did a underarm detox and took chlorophyll and still nothing was working a full day. Not until I came across this, its a creamy deodorant and a little does go a long way. It applies white and it CAN get on your clothing but with a few ninga skills and maneuvers you can avoid that white streak on your clothes. I love that I can apply this after my shower and I&#x27;m covered all day in ALL seasons. Even on the hottest summer day I had no worries about odor or excessive sweating! I&#x27;ve used this for a year and its never &amp;#34;stopped working&amp;#34;. But I make sure to exfoliate my underarms very well to make sure all traces of previous deodorant is removed, then making sure I&#x27;m completely dry before applying!</li>
            <li> Love the product! just doesn&#x27;t work so will when working out.</li>
            <li> This works better than my previous favorite (Lavilin). Smells nicer, too. Lasts a long time, without staining clothes or damaging your body from the Aluminum that&#x27;s prevalant in most other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year. It works well as s long lasting deodorant. Keeps me dry and smells ok, even for a dude. As other reviewers have mentioned, when you get towards the end of the product, the bar will crack and break. That is frustrating.</li>
            <li> This is the only natural deodorant that has worked for me(i have tried about 4 others) u do have to give it a few days to work if your body has been used to regular deodorant. I do use it everyday. I also dab cornstarch on my pits if wearing a tighter shirt bc I have had the oil from the deodorant get on my clothes. It does sometimes stay on your clothes after washing(white residue on inside of clothes). Overall, I still like the product as it is the only one that has worked on odor for me</li>
