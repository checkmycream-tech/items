            <li>this is the best sunscreen there is ladies.</li>
            <li>It is evidently, very effective at protecting against UVA rays!</li>
            <li>Not too greasy and has great UVA protection.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Great transaction.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great.  </li>
            <li>recommend this for anyone with fair skin.</li>
            <li>Good Product for kids.</li>
            <li>sunscreen is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>I do not wear any kind of powders on the areas that I apply this sunscreen, I reserve those for my face and keep them away from my body when I apply them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have fair skin that burns easily</li>
            <li>The best product that I ever found for my sensitive skin to protect from the heat in the summer time.</li>
            <li>This has a very light scent.</li>
            <li>We have a few excellent all-physical sunscreens available, but while zinc oxide is an amazing filter that provides broad-spectrum protection (and you absolutely should use it because it is wonderful!)</li>
            <li>love the spray bottle!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>got this initially in Spain and it is the best the family has every ysed - never using anything else ever</li>
            <li>I have tried out many sunscreens over the years as I am sun-conscious.</li>
            <li>It is absolutely wonderful for day-to-day use, and even days when I will be outside</li>
            <li>If your makeup or mineral powder contains uncoated minerals, you should not use it on top of this sunscreen (or any sunscreens containing avobenzone).</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the way it goes on: it doesn&#x27;t feel oily.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>It is cosmetically elegant and sinks in very nicely!</li>
            <li>I needed something that was as strong and protective as it gets.</li>
            <li>Europe has access to a wider range of extremely effective sunscreen filters than we do in America, and European sunscreens have the reputation of having some of the best anti-UVA qualities in the world (many brands even outdoing much-loved Japanese sunscreens like Shiseido).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are super sun sensitive and need something that&#x27;s really going to protect you, this is an excellent sunscreen to try.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>Or even to the light inside the house, computer, etc.</li>
            <li>But, it&#x27;s available in a 400mL bottle, which is rather economical, even compared to some of the high-end Zinc Oxide sunscreens available here.</li>
            <li>I love any product made by bioderma,&lt;br /&gt;Especially this high factor easy to spray body</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s true or not.  </li>
            <li>this is nice for those who are sensitive to fragrances in products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>quick delivery -- within days.  </li>
            <li>This is the most protective sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever found and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d like to say that this is my new favorite body sunscreen.</li>
            <li>i used this product on recent caribean cruise - i burn very easily but did not get much color at all - mostly from not applying this product</li>
            <li>it is kind of like a sunscreen &#x27;milk&#x27; like my Shiseido facial sunscreen is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for everyday wear and when you&#x27;re going to be out and about in the sun, too!</li>
            <li>very effective SS &#x3D; got VERY little color on my body after 2 hours of swimming and</li>
            <li>Both my 4 year old son and my face burned, itched, and turned our cheeks bright red before we even made it out the door.  </li>
            <li>I am also very, very well protected against burning-</li>
            <li>I live in a very sunny part of the US and have extremely fair skin (lighter than NC/NW 15) and use lots of topical creams and such that make my skin even more</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>This is well more than enough protection against UVA rays in day-to-day life, even during the sunnier times here.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t know why so many are using it on their bodies only.  </li>
            <li>This works in the hot Florida summer.  </li>
            <li>I truly love about this sunscreen is the fact that I haven&#x27;t gotten a single new freckle in the time I have been using it- which is testament to its efficacy, as I&#x27;m prone to light freckling.</li>
            <li>I have given this sunscreen a fair shake (daily use for the last 7 months)</li>
            <li>Goes on like a good quality moisturizer, no grease, no white streaks, doesn&#x27;t make you look like you&#x27;re about to try to swim across the English Channel.  </li>
            <li>It takes me a while to go through an entire bottle, so I don&#x27;t really have too many qualms with paying that much for a sunscreen that really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;the spray was a little suprising as i was somehow expecting an aerosol product - but it was easy to apply and my skin has never felt so smooth</li>
            <li>We get most of our vitmin D from the Sun&#x27;s rays, and the fact that my levels became really low might indicate that the clear mist stuff works pretty well for Sun protection.  </li>
            <li>cosmetically elegant in that it sinks into my skin w/</li>
            <li>In that area, it does VERY well.  </li>
            <li>when worn on my face, it made it very shiny.  </li>
            <li>It is very milky, watery, and runny-</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is really only available online for US consumers and it is somewhat pricey at $40 a bottle.</li>
            <li>of those really merits a lost star, though.</li>
            <li>I only wish this was available from shops in Aus - the sunscreen manufacturers over here</li>
            <li>many people talking about a white cast are simply using too much.  </li>
            <li>but when I had this on, I was out in direct sun for 2 hours straight without so much as redness.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, onto this product in particular.</li>
            <li>This particular sunscreen&#x27;s two star filters (among others) are Tinosorb S and Tinsorb M.  </li>
            <li>and i&#x27;ve done my research, and tried many more expensive ones.  </li>
            <li>It has an incredibly high PPD rating-</li>
            <li>Most sunscreens have a heavy scent.</li>
            <li>I live in Hawaii</li>
            <li>I was very surprised when I sprayed and onto my arm</li>
            <li>Keeping our skin pale despite the strong sunshine of Australia.  </li>
            <li>I was going to return it, but my friend tells me that the spf mists that go on clear and even don&#x27;t provide reliable protection...</li>
            <li>US sunscreens that I&#x27;ve come across aren&#x27;t very protective across the entire UV spectrum.</li>
            <li>i am 45, and most people think i am in my late 20s.  </li>
            <li>feel free to message me about where to buy professional grade peels for wrinkles and uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to apply and helps you reach the areas that are hard to reach by yourself.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You can hardly tell your wearing sunscreen and the spray bottle make it easy to apply.</li>
            <li>came an uneven splatter of thick bright, white cream.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using that clear stuff and the doctor just told me that my test results say my vitamin D is extremely low &amp; ordered me to get daily supplements which I&#x27;m doing now.  </li>

            <li> but the new one brought me a pimples in my face and was sooo greasy,, photoderm is slightly greasy but I treat this problem by adding a little powder..</li>
            <li> apply a generous amount of sunscreen to my entire body, then wait a few minutes for it to fully dry before putting my clothes on to avoid staining.</li>
            <li> It does not really have a scent, either, and does not have fragrance/perfume added at all-</li>
            <li> I have used other Bioderma sunscreen products and have had no issues.  </li>
            <li> other issues with this sunscreen are the availability and the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off a star because the only complaint I have is it&#x27;s a bit greasy and</li>
            <li> I spray into my hand and then rub - its kinda runny, but less than say Biore UV or Sofina.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a previous reviewer stated, it does contain avobenzone, which is destabilized by (uncoated) zinc oxide.</li>
            <li> This is not true.  </li>
            <li> in a few minutes</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use on my face due to the titanium dioxide and zinc oxide in my MMU (which totally sucks becuz</li>
            <li> very little smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually allow about 20-30 minutes before outdoor exposure to allow the sunscreen to &#x27;set&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what ingredient is so irritating and neither of us have reacted to anything on the list previously.  </li>
            <li> It is recommended for all family, it has not produced allergies or secondary effects on the skin.</li>
            <li> What does this mean?  </li>
            <li> I am a sunscreen fanatic!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Extremely disappointing to have paid this amount for an unusable product.</li>
            <li> SPF 50 and yet not at all greasy or difficult (or annoying) to apply.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This product is easy to apply and helps you reach the areas that are hard to reach by yourself.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this for anyone with fair skin.</li>
            <li> I do like this stuff:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  cosmetically elegant in that it sinks into my skin w/in a few minutes (my body, not using on face, see below).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  love the spray bottle!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  very little smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  not greasy, but not sticky either.  I spray into my hand and then rub - its kinda runny, but less than say Biore UV or Sofina.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.  very effective SS &#x3D; got VERY little color on my body after 2 hours of swimming and reapplying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  kinda expensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  contains avobenzone &#x3D; I can&#x27;t use on my face due to the titanium dioxide and zinc oxide in my MMU (which totally sucks becuz I think this stuff would ROCK on my face under MMU)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best Sun Block I&#x27;ve ever used....I tried to change it once..but the new one brought me a pimples in my face and was sooo greasy,, photoderm is slightly greasy but I treat this problem by adding a little powder..and it becomes perfect...I use it now for the 3rd year..its the best</li>
            <li> Fantastic. Would repurchase again and again.</li>
            <li> got this initially in Spain and it is the best the family has every ysed - never using anything else ever</li>
            <li> i used this product on recent caribean cruise - i burn very easily but did not get much color at all - mostly from not applying this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the spray was a little suprising as i was somehow expecting an aerosol product - but it was easy to apply and my skin has never felt so smooth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend</li>
            <li> The description (at the time of this writing) says that it goes on colorless when applied and leaves no white marks.  This is not true.  I was very surprised when I sprayed and onto my arm came an uneven splatter of thick bright, white cream.  For it to be colorless and evenly distributed you have to rub it into your skin afterwards like a regular cream.    I was going to return it, but my friend tells me that the spf mists that go on clear and even don&#x27;t provide reliable protection... I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s true or not.  I&#x27;ve been using that clear stuff and the doctor just told me that my test results say my vitamin D is extremely low &amp; ordered me to get daily supplements which I&#x27;m doing now.  Point is- We get most of our vitmin D from the Sun&#x27;s rays, and the fact that my levels became really low might indicate that the clear mist stuff works pretty well for Sun protection.  Since I have no idea I decided to keep this spray just in case.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> It is recommended for all family, it has not produced allergies or secondary effects on the skin. Good Product for kids.</li>
            <li> I love any product made by bioderma,&lt;br /&gt;Especially this high factor easy to spray body lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product!!!&lt;br /&gt;Wish they casein packs of specials!!,</li>
            <li> It was perfect, now I remember I have to reorder another bottle. Bioderma is the best. Remember apply it 20 mins before to expose yourself to the sun.  Or even to the light inside the house, computer, etc. Even in cloudy days or winter</li>
            <li> I live in Hawaii so I needed the extra protection this sunscreen promised to provide.  In that area, it does VERY well.  I have fair skin that burns easily but when I had this on, I was out in direct sun for 2 hours straight without so much as redness.  I re-apply after 2 hours of course, especially when I&#x27;m in the water and I have never burned nor experience redness while using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off a star because the only complaint I have is it&#x27;s a bit greasy and when worn on my face, it made it very shiny.  Not a big deal though because I use this when going to the beach or for outdoor sports activities.  This one is a definite repeat buy.</li>
            <li> Not oily.  Does the job.</li>
            <li> I have used other Bioderma sunscreen products and have had no issues.  Both my 4 year old son and my face burned, itched, and turned our cheeks bright red before we even made it out the door.  I am not sure what ingredient is so irritating and neither of us have reacted to anything on the list previously.  Even after washing it off thoroughly both of our cheeks were red and irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extremely disappointing to have paid this amount for an unusable product.</li>
            <li> Most sunscreens have a heavy scent. This has a very light scent. You can hardly tell your wearing sunscreen and the spray bottle make it easy to apply. It&#x27;s still a lotion (white in color) but the consistency is thinner allowing it to spray out. As with any sunscreen you still have to rub it into the skin to ensure even distribution.</li>
            <li> My HG sunscreen! Not too greasy and has great UVA protection.</li>
            <li> I am a sunscreen fanatic! I have tried out many sunscreens over the years as I am sun-conscious. I live in a very sunny part of the US and have extremely fair skin (lighter than NC/NW 15) and use lots of topical creams and such that make my skin even more sun-sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most US sunscreens that I&#x27;ve come across aren&#x27;t very protective across the entire UV spectrum. We have a few excellent all-physical sunscreens available, but while zinc oxide is an amazing filter that provides broad-spectrum protection (and you absolutely should use it because it is wonderful!) I needed something that was as strong and protective as it gets. This is where European sunscreens come in. Europe has access to a wider range of extremely effective sunscreen filters than we do in America, and European sunscreens have the reputation of having some of the best anti-UVA qualities in the world (many brands even outdoing much-loved Japanese sunscreens like Shiseido).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, onto this product in particular.This particular sunscreen&#x27;s two star filters (among others) are Tinosorb S and Tinsorb M.  It has an incredibly high PPD rating- 35. This is well more than enough protection against UVA rays in day-to-day life, even during the sunnier times here. I have given this sunscreen a fair shake (daily use for the last 7 months) and I&#x27;d like to say that this is my new favorite body sunscreen. It is absolutely wonderful for day-to-day use, and even days when I will be outside a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply a generous amount of sunscreen to my entire body, then wait a few minutes for it to fully dry before putting my clothes on to avoid staining. I usually allow about 20-30 minutes before outdoor exposure to allow the sunscreen to &#x27;set&#x27;. After that, I go about my daily life- reapplying my sunscreen as necessary, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen is AMAZING. It is cosmetically elegant and sinks in very nicely! It does not cast on me. I find that it is slightly greasy when I first apply it,but it sinks in and dries matte- it is kind of like a sunscreen &#x27;milk&#x27; like my Shiseido facial sunscreen is. It is very milky, watery, and runny- but it is NOT sticky. It does not really have a scent, either, and does not have fragrance/perfume added at all- this is nice for those who are sensitive to fragrances in products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I truly love about this sunscreen is the fact that I haven&#x27;t gotten a single new freckle in the time I have been using it- which is testament to its efficacy, as I&#x27;m prone to light freckling. It is evidently, very effective at protecting against UVA rays! I am also very, very well protected against burning- this sunscreen is rated at SPF 50+ and it means it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a couple of drawbacks, though. As a previous reviewer stated, it does contain avobenzone, which is destabilized by (uncoated) zinc oxide. What does this mean?  If your makeup or mineral powder contains uncoated minerals, you should not use it on top of this sunscreen (or any sunscreens containing avobenzone). I do not wear any kind of powders on the areas that I apply this sunscreen, I reserve those for my face and keep them away from my body when I apply them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two other issues with this sunscreen are the availability and the price. This sunscreen is really only available online for US consumers and it is somewhat pricey at $40 a bottle. But, it&#x27;s available in a 400mL bottle, which is rather economical, even compared to some of the high-end Zinc Oxide sunscreens available here. It takes me a while to go through an entire bottle, so I don&#x27;t really have too many qualms with paying that much for a sunscreen that really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of those really merits a lost star, though. If you are super sun sensitive and need something that&#x27;s really going to protect you, this is an excellent sunscreen to try. This is the most protective sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever found and I highly recommend it. It&#x27;s great for everyday wear and when you&#x27;re going to be out and about in the sun, too!</li>
            <li> I love it. No greasy feeling after application.  I feel protected at the beach or going for a walk. Great product.</li>
            <li> has the best PDA out there.  if you don&#x27;t know what that is, and are concerned about UVA rays, you need to look it up ladies.  In addition, best sunscreen I have ever used, and i&#x27;ve done my research, and tried many more expensive ones.  as i have melasma (anyone with freckles or age spots should stay well away from chemical sunscreens), i do a lot of peels, and i use it on my face, summer and winter.  i don&#x27;t know why so many are using it on their bodies only.  i have sensitive skin, and i only avoid it for a couple of days after a harsh peel (like a TCA).  feel free to message me about where to buy professional grade peels for wrinkles and uneven skin tone. this is the best sunscreen there is ladies. i am 45, and most people think i am in my late 20s.  many people talking about a white cast are simply using too much.  you need about 4-5 short sprays in the palm of your hand after you shake the bottle well.  i am so grateful i discovered this.  thank you Bioderma!!!</li>
            <li> The best product that I ever found for my sensitive skin to protect from the heat in the summer time.</li>
            <li> This works in the hot Florida summer.  I love the way it goes on: it doesn&#x27;t feel oily.&lt;br /&gt;Very quick delivery -- within days.  Great transaction.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  SPF 50 and yet not at all greasy or difficult (or annoying) to apply.  Goes on like a good quality moisturizer, no grease, no white streaks, doesn&#x27;t make you look like you&#x27;re about to try to swim across the English Channel.  Keeping our skin pale despite the strong sunshine of Australia.  I only wish this was available from shops in Aus - the sunscreen manufacturers over here could learn a thing or two from Bioderma.</li>
