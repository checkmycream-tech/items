            <li>I&#x27;m going to be honest, this eye cream is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>Love the fact that this cream contains Algae extract, I read a lot about it, it is a great antioxidant.</li>
            <li>Love this eye cream!</li>
            <li>but more so when I use this products and get a good amount of sleep.</li>

            <li>received this product in exchange for a honest review.</li>
            <li>:) ooo try their mud soap too that stuff is amazing</li>
            <li>Its too early to tell what effect or if any results from continue use of your Best Eye Cream,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Seems to be working ok.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;i really am enjoying this.</li>
            <li>am trying to find more products by this brand.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to be able to purchase this Eye Cream at a drastically lower price from a promotion!</li>
            <li>I have found that many eye creams don&#x27;t do what they claim.</li>
            <li>I will give it more time.</li>
            <li>cant tell you enough how pleased I am with the results!!!</li>
            <li>I was excited to get this product at a discount for my 100% honest review.</li>
            <li>I think this is pretty good.</li>
            <li>It has a light texture, does not feel greasy but at the same time hydrates my under eyes, so it&#x27;s perfect for me to use under makeup.</li>
            <li>however I figured I should try one before becoming too biased.</li>
            <li>Love the texture, it&#x27;s light and non greasy....</li>
            <li>The cream is very smooth and rich.  </li>
            <li>Not sure I would call it the best eye cream, but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Have been trying this cream for a week, and it seems to have smoothed my fine wrinkles and improved my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Works for puffy eyes and fine wrinkles&lt;</li>
            <li>It does feel good and makes the skin so soft.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it morning and night for about 2 weeks now and the bottle is still basically full.</li>
            <li>Other ingredients are great too.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>Some of the ingredients made me chuckle and say to myself &#x27;these REALLY help?!?!&#x27;</li>
            <li>and I have really noticed a difference in the under eye darkness and fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I really find that this eye cream is light, creamy and not greasy.</li>
            <li>It went on smoothly and does wonders for making my eye look not tired and puffy.</li>
            <li>Now that I am getting older, I have noticed fine lines beginning as well.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t help the puffiness very much but it did help with the dark circles and feels really good when you put it on.</li>
            <li>and I have recently developed some puffiness and fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>it really does what it says!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product consistently for about 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li>This is my first product review because this eye cream works.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it made</li>
            <li>It absorbs well and hydrates at the same time without leaving a film where you applied it, so its safe to be used under foundation or concealer.</li>
            <li>As i saw bunch of positive reviews i went ahead and ordered 2</li>
            <li>Thanks IdealSkinLab</li>
            <li>Looking forward to looking in the mirror everyday to see a bright eyed person looking back at me!</li>
            <li>Have not seen significant results yet but will use for another couple of weeks as I have not been using it for long.</li>
            <li>The dark circles are almost non-existent now, the puffiness has gone way down, and my fine lines and become less prominent!!</li>
            <li>I liked the cream, but the pump broke when I was only half way thru the product</li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>A fantastic Eye Cream For Dark Circles cream.</li>
            <li>Works for my fine wrinkles too, they seem less visible.</li>
            <li>and I notice the dark circles under my eyes are already better after only a week!</li>
            <li>My puffiness and dark circles have become less visible and I love it!</li>
            <li>Definitely not a waste.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>My eyes are no where near as puffy</li>
            <li>I received the cream and so far it seems to be working.  </li>
            <li>I think it is to early to tell so</li>
            <li>so I see it lasting a pretty long time.</li>
            <li>My eyes have had dark circles and puffiness for many years now (almost to the point of looking like black eyes).</li>
            <li>This is&lt;br /&gt;the first eye cream to reduce puffiness, to whiten the dark circles I often get and which no concealer will help, and which has a luxurios feel but goes on perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>when putting on concealer over it, the concealer stuck to it, so I&#x27;m going back to my old eye cream.  </li>
            <li>and anytime I put anything close to my eyes if it barely gets in my eyes</li>
            <li>natural ingredients....will definitely recommend!</li>
            <li>but less noticeable and this stuff really tightens up the skin.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I thought the smell would be nasty but it actually smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> The other reviews were so positive that I wanted to try it and the price was right, unfortunately didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> The second day it made my under eye dry and wrinkled looking.  </li>
            <li> It does a fantastic job of moisturizing and soothing tired eyes!</li>
            <li> It contains Dead Sea Algae Extract, Alguronic Acid, and actual Dead Sea Salts (along with other ingredients obviously).</li>
            <li> Usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but I bought this product several weeks ago</li>
            <li> I have used hundreds of other creams.</li>
            <li> The bottle is small but you literally only need like a half of pump</li>
            <li> As for disappearance of dark circles-</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any difference in my dark circles yet.</li>
            <li> Your dark circle and bags will go away.</li>
            <li> I have not really been a firm believer in any anti-aging product</li>
            <li> I saw results within about a week and a half.</li>
            <li> She became a fan of Dead Sea cosmetics after we went on a trip to Israel a couple of years ago and spent a few days at the Dead Sea.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 20 year old mom with 2 children and trust me I get bags and dark circles underneath my eyes really badly, also I&#x27;ve had them for years ever since I was a teen</li>
            <li> I also apply it on and around my eyebrows and it gives it a little lift.</li>
            <li> Saw little results.  </li>
            <li> how it your product feel on my skin, but its performance I hope to know in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I also has some puffiness and tried quite a few products to get rid of it.</li>
            <li> We have been using this for a few days now and are just noticing a difference in the darker circles.</li>
            <li> (Water), Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Isopropyl Myristate, Stearyl Alcohol, PEG-40 Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate-SE, Calendula Officinalis Oil, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Maris Aqua (Dead Sea Water), Gluconolactone, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Allantoin, Borago Officinalis (Borage) Seed Oil, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose)</li>
            <li> Oil, Algae Extract, Maris Sal (Dead Sea Salt), Tocopheryl Acetate (Vit. E), Collagen (Marine), Fragrance (Parfum),</li>
            <li> but if we can &#x27;slow&#x27; the appearance down, why not give it a shot.</li>
            <li> My one complaint is the heavy perfume scent.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m slowly seeing results.</li>
            <li> She is using it every day and is noticing subtle results.</li>
            <li> It is somewhat irritating to eyes.</li>
            <li> but after a mere 5 days of using this eye cream, I have noticed a dramatic difference around my eyes.</li>
            <li> So that means nasty dark circles all the time.</li>
            <li> Please buy, don&#x27;t be skeptical just buy it!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never been disappointed!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I use thins in the morning and at night! I saw results within about a week and a half. I&#x27;ve also come to find my eyes are brighter with the use of this but more so when I use this products and get a good amount of sleep. It also spreads well. The bottle is small but you literally only need like a half of pump so I see it lasting a pretty long time. I&#x27;ve been using it morning and night for about 2 weeks now and the bottle is still basically full. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but I bought this product several weeks ago and I have really noticed a difference in the under eye darkness and fine lines.  The cream is very smooth and rich.  Feels good going on. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I&#x27;ll order again.</li>
            <li> I was please with the eye cream. It didn&#x27;t help the puffiness very much but it did help with the dark circles and feels really good when you put it on. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I think this is pretty good.</li>
            <li> Just another eye cream</li>
            <li> Happy with the product and the service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be honest, this eye cream is AMAZING! it really does what it says! I&#x27;ve ordered ideaskinlab products before and I&#x27;ve never been disappointed! My best friend tried it and dude...immediate results! I tried it today and immediate results! I&#x27;m a 20 year old mom with 2 children and trust me I get bags and dark circles underneath my eyes really badly, also I&#x27;ve had them for years ever since I was a teen but this eye cream gets rid of all that! Thanks IdealSkinLab you guys make amazing products! Please buy, don&#x27;t be skeptical just buy it! trust me it works!!! :) ooo try their mud soap too that stuff is amazing oh and the mud mask OMGOODNESS amazing!! you have to try all their products. I personally can&#x27;t get enough!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell that it is diminishing the luggage under my eyes a lot yet, but to be fair with the amount of sleep I get that is probably not the products fault. I DO think it helps. It does not irritate my eyes at all, feels nice going on and I do think it helps with wrinkles. I think when this is all used up I may purchase another bottle.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 3 weeks now and no results whatsoever.  As i saw bunch of positive reviews i went ahead and ordered 2 but maybe it&#x27;s all a marketing or it did not work on me.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working ok.</li>
            <li> Works for wrinkles but jury is still out about eliminating under eye bags</li>
            <li> Wonderful product..&lt;br /&gt;i really am enjoying this.</li>
            <li> Good product and good shipping</li>
            <li> Great product, will reorder.</li>
            <li> well I would like to say it&#x27;s working great but I just received it so it&#x27;s too soon to tell it came on timean it has a really nice consistency to it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m slowly seeing results. Definitely not a waste. I&#x27;ve been using this product consistently for about 2-3 weeks. It seems to be working but nothing will shape it up like actually working out. I&#x27;m going to keep trying it out and see what happens.</li>
            <li> I liked the cream, but the pump broke when I was only half way thru the product and I had to use a q-tip to apply the rest of the bottle.  A bit of a pain.</li>
            <li> Its too early to tell what effect or if any results from continue use of your Best Eye Cream,&lt;br /&gt;I do like the consistency and how it your product feel on my skin, but its performance I hope to know in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Smells good and product arrived in good condition. Have not seen significant results yet but will use for another couple of weeks as I have not been using it for long.</li>
            <li> The cream itself is good. My one complaint is the heavy perfume scent. It is somewhat irritating to eyes. As for disappearance of dark circles- they are still there, but puffiness is a bit reduced. Not sure I would call it the best eye cream, but it&#x27;s ok. I&#x27;ll see what happens after prolonged use.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  I have extremely sensitive eyes and this cream does not irritate whatsoever. It does a fantastic job of moisturizing and soothing tired eyes!</li>
            <li> Love this eye cream! It has a light texture, does not feel greasy but at the same time hydrates my under eyes, so it&#x27;s perfect for me to use under makeup. I also has some puffiness and tried quite a few products to get rid of it. With this cream I definitely see improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> This is my first product review because this eye cream works. I have used hundreds of other creams. This is&lt;br /&gt;the first eye cream to reduce puffiness, to whiten the dark circles I often get and which no concealer will help, and which has a luxurios feel but goes on perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I am trying to find more products by this brand.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any difference in my dark circles yet. Hope in time they will improve with usage</li>
            <li> I was so excited to be able to purchase this Eye Cream at a drastically lower price from a promotion! For that I am thankful. I really find that this eye cream is light, creamy and not greasy. It went on smoothly and does wonders for making my eye look not tired and puffy. I have found that many eye creams don&#x27;t do what they claim. Looking forward to looking in the mirror everyday to see a bright eyed person looking back at me! Thank you for the opportunity to review your product!</li>
            <li> We have been using this for a few days now and are just noticing a difference in the darker circles. It does feel good and makes the skin so soft.  We are going to continue and see how it goes.  Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this for an honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my mother.  She is using it every day and is noticing subtle results.</li>
            <li> Have been trying this cream for a week, and it seems to have smoothed my fine wrinkles and improved my skin tone. Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and feels like it is helping to tighten under eye puffiness.</li>
            <li> Did not care for this eye cream.  The first time I used it, it made my under eye feel puffy.  The second day it made my under eye dry and wrinkled looking.  I&#x27;ve used it a couple times since and when putting on concealer over it, the concealer stuck to it, so I&#x27;m going back to my old eye cream.  The other reviews were so positive that I wanted to try it and the price was right, unfortunately didn&#x27;t work for me.  Will return.</li>
            <li> Works for puffy eyes and fine wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for my wife. She became a fan of Dead Sea cosmetics after we went on a trip to Israel a couple of years ago and spent a few days at the Dead Sea. Its minerals and salts really work wonders with your skin and after that my wife started using exclusively Dead Sea cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what she has to say about this cream:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cant tell you enough how pleased I am with the results!!! I have been using it for about 10 days and already see the difference! It is an amazing product! I am in my late 30&#x27;s and I have recently developed some puffiness and fine lines around my eyes. With this cream, my eyes are not as puffy , they look rested and the skin is brighter. I definitely see improvement with my wrinkles too, they are still there but less noticeable and this stuff really tightens up the skin.  It absorbs well and hydrates at the same time without leaving a film where you applied it, so its safe to be used under foundation or concealer. I also apply it on and around my eyebrows and it gives it a little lift. Love the fact that this cream contains Algae extract, I read a lot about it, it is a great antioxidant. Other ingredients are great too.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am happy with the product and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> I have only used this for a short time. I see results already. We shell see.</li>
            <li> Excellent product; worked as promised!</li>
            <li> A fantastic Eye Cream For Dark Circles cream. If you start using the cream twice a day you will see a difference in no time at all. Your dark circle and bags will go away.

            <li> Saw little results.  Product would get clogged in pump</li>
            <li> Face it we are all aging and yes we all are faced with times when our face shows our problems. I work as a nurse and work nights so I wear my work on my face especially when I have worked 3-4 nights at a time. I apply in morning and afternoon on entire face and I have noticed softer and smoother skin.It has a very pleasant smell and not greasy which is important.  My puffiness and dark circles have become less visible and I love it! I also have very sensitive eyes and anytime I put anything close to my eyes if it barely gets in my eyes I have a reaction I didn&#x27;t have this problem with Best Eye Cream and that&#x27;s the reason I will stick with it to continue to see results. I was excited to get this product at a discount for my 100% honest review.</li>
            <li> I have not really been a firm believer in any anti-aging product however I figured I should try one before becoming too biased. My eyes have had dark circles and puffiness for many years now (almost to the point of looking like black eyes). Now that I am getting older, I have noticed fine lines beginning as well. I know aging is part of life and there&#x27;s no way to avoid it but if we can &#x27;slow&#x27; the appearance down, why not give it a shot. Not for a minute was I thinking it would actually work but after a mere 5 days of using this eye cream, I have noticed a dramatic difference around my eyes. The dark circles are almost non-existent now, the puffiness has gone way down, and my fine lines and become less prominent!! Some of the ingredients made me chuckle and say to myself &#x27;these REALLY help?!?!&#x27; It contains Dead Sea Algae Extract, Alguronic Acid, and actual Dead Sea Salts (along with other ingredients obviously). I thought the smell would be nasty but it actually smells pretty good. The fact that it also comes with a 100%, UNCONDITIONAL, LIFETIME GUARANTEE did not hurt. (I received this product at a discount but this review is solely my opinion and the information provided is based on my personal experience.)</li>
            <li> I work shift work. And my shifts change almost daily sometimes. So that means nasty dark circles all the time. I started using this about a week ago and I have noticed the darkness disappearing.  My eyes are no where near as puffy either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for a honest review. All my reviews are 100% my personal opinion.</li>
            <li> I received the cream and so far it seems to be working.  I think it is to early to tell so I will give it more time.</li>
            <li> Tried it for a week. My under eye skin feels tighter and well hydrated and the make-up does not end up in the lines. Works for my fine wrinkles too, they seem less visible. Love the texture, it&#x27;s light and non greasy....natural ingredients....will definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I am fair complected  and I notice the dark circles under my eyes are already better after only a week!</li>
