            <li> It really holds my hair down from getting all frizzy in the summer humidity.  </li>
            <li> It can be cause you hair to be stiff or clump if you put too much on the ends.</li>
            <li> I use about a dime size portion of this after washing my hair and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> My hair is long, about half way down my back, and it&#x27;s thick as well.</li>
            <li> This gel controls his hair well and it not super stiff.</li>
            <li> He has crazy hair that sticks straight up like a spike.  </li>
            <li> AND it only takes a small amount, I mean small amount....</li>
            <li> Would probably not buy again as it is similar to less expensive gel.</li>
            <li> Small amounts on your finger tips is recommended with application at the roots.  </li>
            <li> It is sometimes hard to find.  </li>
            <li> Very hard texture after applied as described.</li>
            <li> so is slightly difficult to remove from jar.</li>

            <li> I have used this product before and love it. Now that the company has discontinued it, I went to Amazon and ws able to find lots of it!! I bought 4 jars....that should hold me for awhile or until I find something I like equally as well.</li>
            <li> My son uses this for his hair.  It keeps it under under control and styled throughout the day without being sticky or greasy.  It smells like most of Biolage&#x27;s products which is my favorite thing about the gel....not too fruity/sweet smelling.  The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars is that if you don&#x27;t use it sparingly it will leave white residue on the hair.</li>
            <li> I love this styling gel.  It really holds my hair down from getting all frizzy in the summer humidity.  It does not make my hair look greasy either.</li>
            <li> Very good hold non greasy or sticky non flaky. Gives great long lasting hold! Great affordable  gel highly recommend! Must buy again soon</li>
            <li> This product makes my already good looks even more amazing as I do not have a single hair out of place.</li>
            <li> It works perfect for me .  I tried many other products, but always come back to this one.  Great product for short spikey look</li>
            <li> I loved this when I purchased it at a hair salon. After they ran out of it, I was thrilled to discover it on Amazon. However, this one does not equal the one purchase directly from the salon. I don&#x27;t know why? Maybe the formula was changed?</li>
            <li> A little expensive,but honestly the only gel that lay my  natural hair down without flaking or sticky. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Very hard texture after applied as described. Not as good as the Matrix Amplify Gel.  Would probably not buy again as it is similar to less expensive gel.</li>
            <li> Will not use anything else!  AND it only takes a small amount, I mean small amount....one jar lasted me 6 months!!!</li>
            <li> I love this gel, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different ones. Only takes a dab for light control. Has a slippery texture like unset Jello so is slightly difficult to remove from jar. Try not to take too.much.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair, and this is my favorite hair product. My hair is long, about half way down my back, and it&#x27;s thick as well. I live in a humid climate so it can be very frizzy too. I use about a dime size portion of this after washing my hair and let it air dry. It holds the curl and eliminates frizz without making my hair sticky or crispy. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> ....that I have never seen in the store. I love the fragrance and love the body it gives my hair. I will definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li> I love it. It&#x27;s &amp;#34;gooey&amp;#34; but it definitely keeps a strong and straight hold.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this hair gel.  It is sometimes hard to find.  He has crazy hair that sticks straight up like a spike.  This gel controls his hair well and it not super stiff.</li>
            <li> I just love this stuff for short hair. Works very well. Hard to find, come on Matrix make it easy for us</li>
            <li> Great product for my styling needs.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I give it 5 starts</li>
            <li> This product  works very well for my short, layered hair.  Small amounts on your finger tips is recommended with application at the roots.  It can be cause you hair to be stiff or clump if you put too much on the ends.</li>
