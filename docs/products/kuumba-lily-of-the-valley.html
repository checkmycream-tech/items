            <li>It&#x27;s a roll-on perfume oil and a nice size</li>
            <li>And, this scent (Water Lily) in particular is delightful.  </li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>Many of the vintage perfumes have been severely compromised.  </li>

            <li>Love the scent, which is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>Wish there was more, which is why I lopped off a star.</li>
            <li>That said, I&#x27;d buy again if I couldn&#x27;t find a better deal.</li>
            <li>Not terrible but will not buy again.</li>
            <li>It stays with you all day, unlike most perfumes or oils which fade into nothingness.  </li>
            <li>The price is super-right and it&#x27;s better by light-years than anything else I&#x27;ve found anywhere.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite flowers is Lily Of The Valley.</li>
            <li>Love it,and will order again when this bottle runs out.</li>
            <li>It is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Another good item and purchase, thanks amazon</li>

            <li>Thank you so much for shipping them SO quickly!!!</li>
            <li>Worth the purchase :)</li>
            <li>I enjoy the fragrance of lilly of the valley.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d describe it as a lovely, thriving floral bouquet with a tiniest hint of sweet and buckets full of sunshine.  </li>
            <li>This scent reminds me of the perfume oil Kai (one I loved for years but costs 10X more), but even better (less buttery after-scent).  </li>
            <li>Nice roll on, good spreading ability, and can put anywhere and use as much or as little as you want.  </li>
            <li>True lily of the valley scent.  </li>
            <li>Shalimar was once a wonderful scent; it was the signature scent of my late dear aunt.  </li>
            <li>have bought many a product in search of that smell and was pleased to finally find it.</li>
            <li>A little oil goes a mighty good distance.  </li>
            <li>If you enjoy a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; scent, you might really like this one.  </li>
            <li>I spent years hunting a true honest to goodness lily scent</li>
            <li>Simple, fragrant, and easy to enjoy without a squirt of musk, patchouli, or incense to override the scent.  </li>
            <li>and this smells exactly like I remember.  </li>
            <li>It smells exactly like lily of the valley.</li>
            <li>I am sure if they tell you it is for human use</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a floral essential oil blend, but this one smells more like synthetic fragrance.</li>
            <li>Smells exactly like the flowers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bottle is small, but a very small dab will be plenty to catch the perfect scent for many hours</li>
            <li>This smells very much like real lilies of the valley, and is long-lasting.</li>
            <li>As to the scent I grew up with a huge patch of lily of the valley right outside the house</li>
            <li>This is a true &amp; natural smelling scent.</li>
            <li>It was packed very well.  </li>
            <li>it really is an oil)</li>
            <li>I was a little nervous because until you smell it you can&#x27;t be sure if it&#x27;s really going to smell like lily of the valley.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Long lasting smell that stays true to scent when wearing it.</li>
            <li>This smells so pretty and you only need a tiny bit.</li>
            <li>Smells soft enough for women</li>

            <li> Smells amazing, just like it should. Scent lasts a while as perfume and you do not need a lot. Worth the purchase :)</li>
            <li> True lily of the valley scent.  Perfect!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! I was a little nervous because until you smell it you can&#x27;t be sure if it&#x27;s really going to smell like lily of the valley. I didn&#x27;t need to worry though, it smells just like lily of the valley. I would buy this again in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> Smells soft enough for women</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this!  It is a true lily of the valley scent! I am definitely going to buy it again!</li>
            <li> This came promptly even though it did not qualify for prime shipping.  It was packed very well.  As to the scent I grew up with a huge patch of lily of the valley right outside the house and this smells exactly like I remember.  I would say the scent lasts about as long as I would expect from a perfume oil, about 5 - 6 hours without touch ups.</li>
            <li> This smells so pretty and you only need a tiny bit. It rolls on so that&#x27;s nice too.</li>
            <li> Omgosh! I spent years hunting a true honest to goodness lily scent and this is it. They do not play. It smells exactly like lily of the valley. I am sure if they tell you it is for human use but I pit it on my, my daughters, cats, etch, all without any reaction. I plan to reorder again.</li>
            <li> This smells very much like real lilies of the valley, and is long-lasting. I would definitely recommend it for people who are fans of that scent.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance; very true to the flower it&#x27;s named after.  The vial is small, but a little goes a long way - - for days, actually.  Makes my dear wife smell like she did in 1972.  Liked it then, like it now.  (Loved her then, love her now.) You won&#x27;t be disappointed. Simple, fragrant, and easy to enjoy without a squirt of musk, patchouli, or incense to override the scent.  If you enjoy a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; scent, you might really like this one.  Trust me.  Many of the vintage perfumes have been severely compromised.  Shalimar was once a wonderful scent; it was the signature scent of my late dear aunt.  However, I believe it&#x27;s now manufactured with brake fluid or something equally vile, and they still sell it for $50 a bottle!  Smells awful.  But Kuumba still has it together, and it smells great.  Nice to find an honest company these days. . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> AWESOME!!  Came in time for my daughter&#x27;s wedding - it made her so happy when she saw the lily of the valley flowers and SMELLED them!  It was her Grandpa&#x27;s favorite.  Made her day!  Thank you so much for shipping them SO quickly!!!</li>
            <li> Love the scent, which is one of my favorites. Wish there was more, which is why I lopped off a star. That said, I&#x27;d buy again if I couldn&#x27;t find a better deal.</li>
            <li> Smells too perfumey. I was hoping for a floral essential oil blend, but this one smells more like synthetic fragrance. I don&#x27;t know if it is or not, but I only use EOs in my home or on my body, so I don&#x27;t want to risk it.</li>
            <li> A bit chemical smelling for my taste. Not terrible but will not buy again. I was hoping for the proper oil to mix for perfume, This is not it.</li>
            <li> If you want something that smells like Lily of the Valley.  This is it.&lt;br /&gt;I have bought many a product in search of that smell and was pleased to finally find it.</li>
            <li> Kuumba fragrance oils are absolutely wonderful!  They are quality products in all ways--just find your flavor.  A little oil goes a mighty good distance.  It stays with you all day, unlike most perfumes or oils which fade into nothingness.  And, this scent (Water Lily) in particular is delightful.  I consider it my sunny, summery signature scent.  I&#x27;d describe it as a lovely, thriving floral bouquet with a tiniest hint of sweet and buckets full of sunshine.  This scent reminds me of the perfume oil Kai (one I loved for years but costs 10X more), but even better (less buttery after-scent).  The price is super-right and it&#x27;s better by light-years than anything else I&#x27;ve found anywhere.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!  Can&#x27;t recommend enough.</li>
            <li> DELICIOUS! Smells exactly like the flowers.&lt;br /&gt; Portion is quite small though for the price.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite flowers is Lily Of The Valley.This fragrance oil smells just like it!!! Love it,and will order again when this bottle runs out. You only need a little of this,so it will last a long time. It&#x27;s a roll-on perfume oil and a nice size so I can carry in my purse. Smells just heavenly!!</li>
            <li> I bought. This item and im pleased smells very nice.</li>
            <li> This is a true &amp; natural smelling scent. Smells just like the flower with zero chemical/fake smell to it. Long lasting smell that stays true to scent when wearing it. I LOVE it!! I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Item is as description says, does what it is supposed to. Nice roll on, good spreading ability, and can put anywhere and use as much or as little as you want.  Lasts all day, even through hard workout. Beautiful scent, not overpowering or nauseating. Good price, shipping was on time. Another good item and purchase, thanks amazon</li>
            <li> So yummy!!!! I love this and wear it a lot!!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Lily of the valley, this is perfect. I actually wear it as a perfume (stay out of the sun it really is an oil) and I get compliments every time.</li>
            <li> heavenly &amp;#60;3  The bottle is small, but a very small dab will be plenty to catch the perfect scent for many hours</li>
            <li> I enjoy the fragrance of lilly of the valley. It is my favorite. I wish it was in a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> This smells absolutely AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Wonderfully intoxicating.  Smells just like the flower.</li>
