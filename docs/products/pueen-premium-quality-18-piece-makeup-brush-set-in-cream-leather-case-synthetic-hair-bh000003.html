            <li>I would recommend this to every one who&#x27;s looking for a nice set.</li>
            <li>I would have preferred if the brushes were a litte more dense, however, for the most part the brushes are of great quality.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When my set arrived, I was thrilled when I opened the box.</li>
            <li>I think these brushes are nice.</li>
            <li>However, most of the brushes are good and</li>

            <li>and super cheap great value!!</li>
            <li>The leather case is also extremely soft to the touch and is the perfect cream color that I absolutely love!</li>
            <li>The brushes are high quality, excellent results.&lt;br /&gt;The case is lovely.</li>
            <li>I originally hesitated buying these brushes, because they didn&#x27;t have many reviews online, but I&#x27;m so glad I did!!</li>
            <li>They are soft and the variety is great!</li>
            <li>Lip bush, bowder brush, etc).&lt;br /&gt;The case also has a magnetic closing which is nice, a lot better than velcro.</li>
            <li>These makeup brushes are so cute and they are amazing.</li>
            <li>aren&#x27;t good for you&#x27;re skin they carry bacteria and the hair falls out synthetic brushes work better and are safer and cruilty free</li>
            <li>The leather case is beautiful and very high quality.</li>
            <li>Was so so so excited for this set after reading reviews and loved how cute it was.</li>
            <li>They are great after washing them as well, they hold up to soap and hot water, they do not fall apart or lose their bristles.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend, these brushes are so amazing</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who is wanting good quality brushes for a very reasonable price!</li>

            <li>I would recommend this set to anyone looking for an affordable, good-quality brush kit, and am so glad I bought them.</li>
            <li>The synthetic eye shadow brushes pick up cream based eye shadows better than the powder eye shadows</li>
            <li>but I still love them.</li>
            <li>others I wish where better technique quality.</li>
            <li>I gave it three stars because I still have to buy more brushes.</li>
            <li>I also gave these as a gift to my make-up artist grand niece.</li>
            <li>I love love these brushes.</li>
            <li>then you are making it so that they don&#x27;t have a reason to kill more animals and animal hair brushes</li>
            <li>plus they&#x27;re cute</li>
            <li>i love them</li>
            <li>I love them...</li>
            <li>perfect starting brushes and for the price...they can&#x27;t be beat</li>
            <li>which brush is which and what they are used for :)</li>
            <li>And my order arrived on time :)</li>
            <li>and they are so cute too</li>
            <li>I read ALL reviews about many brush sets and this one had the highest</li>
            <li>I have not had many bristles fall off either.</li>
            <li>I ordered these because of the color; which I love even more in person.</li>
            <li>I have been using my brushes for 6 months now and I am still in love with them.</li>
            <li>I love them ..</li>
            <li>And its my favorite color.</li>
            <li>Brushes are ok</li>
            <li>n get the job done for the most part</li>
            <li>Both girls love them</li>
            <li>Super Cute brushes!</li>
            <li>I think the strong chemical smell is the only downside of this brush set; everything else is great!</li>
            <li>If you purchase this brush set, make sure to have a tube of super glue handy.</li>
            <li>The most amazing product I have bought on here most def worth the money</li>
            <li>At first loved them besides the smell</li>
            <li>but when i received them in the mail i was not disappointed at all!</li>
            <li>And, I&#x27;m not disappointed by my choice at all!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive my brushes today!</li>
            <li>I was impressed by the huge variety of different sizes and shapes of brushes.</li>
            <li>Very soft and for the price great value.</li>
            <li>It is low price but very very good.</li>
            <li>So far they are working great.</li>
            <li>Great value product, good quality, without any odd smell.</li>
            <li>But, they broke easily.</li>
            <li>All the brushes are inside this cream leather case, easy for storage and for traveling.  </li>
            <li>The smell is so strong its nauseating.</li>
            <li>The chemical smell was so strong it gave me a migraine headache</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft, good  bristles, the synthetic ones don&#x27;t sheds  at all which I love but the brown ones</li>
            <li>Practical, effective, and pricing is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>high recommended probably not as good as mac or sigma</li>
            <li>These are beautiful and super soft.</li>
            <li>the case they come in is also pretty nice.</li>
            <li>Nice quality, and pretty.</li>
            <li>The case is nice and convenient and the color is really pretty.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li>This set of brushes is super cheap and quite lovely looking.</li>
            <li>The handles are a blush pink VERY PRETTY and the bristles are perfect.</li>
            <li>plus they&#x27;re way cute :) I would certainly recommend these.</li>
            <li>The large angled brush has become my favorite for shading/contouring -- good distribution of product and they wash out very well.</li>
            <li>The handles feel cheap and look cheap in person.</li>
            <li>and if you enjoy using brushes for make up application.</li>
            <li>Great quality for the price, I would definitely  buy them again if I needed to.</li>
            <li>the case is great the brushes came individually wrapped to keep them protected.</li>
            <li>Updated review: These brushes are cheap and almost all of them have fell apart.</li>
            <li>And cheap.</li>
            <li>I found that both professional and ladies like me loved these brushes.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and a good quality to me.</li>
            <li>The barrel is another issue, the top near the bristles is nicely made but once it goes towards the handle</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty new to makeup, but this has been a great set.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who wishes to purchase a great brush set at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these brushes and for an amazing price too.</li>
            <li>Super good quality and soft on the skin.</li>
            <li>I love the brushes they clean pretty easy, apply make up and pick up pigment quick</li>
            <li>I LOVE how these brushes are very soft and smooth, so they don&#x27;t hurt your skin when using them!</li>
            <li>Last year I bought a set for my sister and she said she loved them cause they are soft and good quality, so this this</li>
            <li>at first we wernt to sure about getting them.</li>
            <li>Got my money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li>I love it so much!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS WHOLE PACKAGE!</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, the bristles of the brushes are very soft, while the handles are made of a sturdy material in this beautiful rose pink color.</li>
            <li>brushes felt super cheap.</li>
            <li>When they finally came they were jus what I thought they would be perfect, soft</li>
            <li>This brushes are perfect I definitely recommend them they are really soft and</li>
            <li>so soft I love them !</li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft, and appear to be pretty good quality.</li>
            <li>most of all very nice pouch and pretty pink brushes</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice product and soft.</li>
            <li>they are full...</li>
            <li>The hair feels super soft and they are really nice.</li>
            <li>The synthetic hair brushes are super soft and have a nice spring to them.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>First off, upon opening there is an extremely strong chemical smell that comes off of these.</li>
            <li>Other than that, great product for the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely happy with this set for the minimal amount of money I paid for them!</li>
            <li>They make it easier to get the perfect makeup look than other brushes I have tried and they arrived within a week even when I live overseas in Europe.</li>
            <li>LOVE my new brush set!</li>
            <li>Either way, when they fall off like that I just use super glue to fix it</li>
            <li>I was super hesitant because i use mac products</li>
            <li>These are amazing brushes for this price... way better thank expected</li>
            <li>Three of the brush heads already fell off and I had to super glue</li>
            <li>but super gule does the job...</li>
            <li>and it will lose the smell rather quickly.</li>
            <li>I love that they are full sized and so soft!</li>
            <li>Really cute, super soft, and no shedding!</li>
            <li>This is my first professional set, super excited to try them out!!</li>
            <li>For me, the only reason this product received less than a perfect score is because the brush heads pop off easily.</li>
            <li>so as long as your okay with that, it seems okay otherwise.</li>
            <li>They are very soft and I love all of the options of brushes I have.  </li>
            <li>however whenever you wash them make sure you keep them brush down and use luke warm water</li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, it&#x27;s cute and the brushes are useful and soft</li>
            <li>Amazing quality for your buck and will definitely recommend them to my friends.</li>
            <li>These brushes look nice, and I enjoy the fun pink color.</li>
            <li>i cannot believed it so soft and make me sure that the price</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>main issue is with the quality of the brushes, which is super important.</li>
            <li>i just got them and i am completely and entirely satisfied with them..</li>
            <li>and there is a brush for every kind of possible application of makeup.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and there are many of them.</li>
            <li>Worth the money</li>
            <li>Brushes are soft, easy to clean and work well.</li>
            <li>I actually love them more because they aren&#x27;t pink!</li>
            <li>The eye shadow brushes hold the shadow just right.</li>
            <li>The case is a creamy white color and the brushes are a really pretty rose color.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these fabulous and affordable brushes.</li>
            <li>Great brushes after you get past the smell...</li>
            <li>The larger brushes also came with soft plastic casings that fit over the bristles which will be nice for travel.</li>
            <li>It comes in a very useful case for when you are traveling the brushes are super soft.</li>
            <li>there really are no blending brushes and they fell apart quickly.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also easy to clean which is a big plus.</li>
            <li>Very cheap, definitely get what you paid for.  </li>
            <li>There so soft and came in the mail so quick!</li>
            <li>It did smell like paint at first but after leaving it out (unwrapped)</li>
            <li>There is no comparison to my higher end makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>when first open some smell but am ok with that because the case made from PU</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>I am so glad they got these brushes back!</li>
            <li>First, ask yourself these questions:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>so pretty</li>
            <li>One of the brushes fell apart on the first use, but glue will fix it...</li>
            <li>totally recommended :)</li>
            <li>The powder brush is more like a blush brush and the blush brush is not dense enough at all.</li>
            <li>I am overall satisfied.</li>
            <li>Am in love, got them in a short period of time....</li>
            <li>The case does have smell when you first get it but leave it out</li>
            <li>,it&#x27;s very soft and it has different kind of blending,shadow brushes...</li>
            <li>I recommend the brush set for those who are starting, but if you only need a couple brushes as a replacement such as a foundation brush or kabuki, you&#x27;re better off spending money on a good brush individually for the same price if you want a good blend.</li>
            <li>Great quality, firm and soft brushes.</li>
            <li>I would say that the product is good for the price, not very dense but soft enougth for the face</li>
            <li>pretty much looks exactly like it does in the picture.</li>
            <li>I loved that it had a good collection of brushes of different types, and was a very reasonable pricepoint(conversely, you&#x27;ll spend the same amount on a single brush from Japonesque than you would for this entire set).</li>
            <li>I love the color and the brush is long.</li>
            <li>at first I thought they were too expensive, but ooog my God it was worth, quality is good and it was shipped to my house like in 2-3 days, sooo I really liked that, not only that</li>
            <li>It includes pretty much any type of brush</li>
            <li>They are incredibly soft, easy to clean, and only a couple of hairs have fallen out of a couple of the brushes after I cleaned them.</li>
            <li>I really wanted a case that&#x27;s exactly like this one, so I went ahead and bought this brush set instead.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes, I&#x27;ve had them for a very long time now</li>
            <li>Also, super soft.</li>
            <li>Large Variety of Brushes</li>
            <li>However, I have to agree with the other reviewers who mentioned this smells very strongly of chemicals straight out of the package.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these brushes!</li>
            <li>I am very satisified with these brushes.</li>
            <li>I absolutely loveeeee these brushes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these brushes to anyone and everyone!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a reasonable price</li>
            <li>and I really like the pouch it comes in.</li>
            <li>I just opened it and very please that it matches the picture and everything is intact and cover in plastic.</li>
            <li>If you are a real make up user like me.</li>
            <li>I really like these.</li>
            <li>I can tell you i am glad i didnt spent 180</li>
            <li>They had very minimum shedding.</li>
            <li>The delivery of the product was extremely fast.</li>
            <li>I really like this brush set,  </li>
            <li>Buy the Real Technique brushes.  </li>
            <li>The blending brush was broken which in my opinion is the most important brush!</li>
            <li>I have had two or three that I&#x27;ve had to glue back together, but overall, I am thrilled with these.</li>
            <li>Supper fast shipping and the brushes are even nicer than pictured, the bigger brushes have plastic coverings which I really like, it keeps them clean and in correct form.</li>
            <li>Very soft and apply the makeup really well!</li>
            <li>I ordered these along with four other makeup brush sets and these are my favorite.  </li>
            <li>love that it&#x27;s pink!</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about a $30 brush set but thought why not give it a try since it has good reviews!</li>
            <li>Super fluffy and accurate on my face.</li>
            <li>They are soft and very versatile!</li>
            <li>They are also not as soft as higher end brushes.</li>
            <li>The case does have a smell at first, but I&#x27;ve aired mine out and it doesn&#x27;t have a noticeable smell.</li>
            <li>when you first start using them they seem professional, not recommended.</li>
            <li>had to super glue them back on.</li>
            <li>They were super inexpensive so not a big deal.</li>
            <li>The fibers are very soft!</li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY recommend these brushes to anyone.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s normal to be smell like that&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>Wasted my money for sure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve washed the brushes and the only ones to shed are the natural haired one (the full brown hair) and they shed quite a bit.</li>
            <li>normally use on weekends for going out.</li>
            <li>Was skeptical but its pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li>Other then that they worked fine.</li>
            <li>It was a good deal and the PUEEN brand is greater than any other expensive brand.</li>
            <li>and she needed new ones.</li>
            <li>my girlfriend is a makeup artist and is always trying out new products.</li>
            <li>It was time to invest in a new brush set</li>
            <li>Even for someone like myself, who isn&#x27;t terribly skilled with makeup, I noticed that the overall application was much smoother and seamless than what I have achieved with other brushes.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t like spending a fortune on my face, but I had reached  a point where I had watched too many youtube tutorials and purchased too many high-end cosmetics to be unhappy as I was with my makeup.</li>
            <li>Secondly, if you are vegan or are very conscious of not buying animal products make sure to read the description carefully-</li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the bristles are very soft.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft.</li>
            <li>the brushes are so so so soft!</li>
            <li>Firstly,  the chemical smell that assaults your senses upon opening the kit is actually the plastic case (it is NOT leather like the description says), not the brushes themselves.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Cute but not very good quality.</li>
            <li>Large portion of the brushes are smaller sized&lt;br</li>
            <li>Which I suppose is the only thing that really matters.... not recommended for a professional.</li>
            <li>but I got them because they were pink and when I got them they were more beige than pink</li>
            <li>Brushes are so soft.</li>
            <li>SHE LOVES THEM AND TOSSED HER OLD ONES.</li>
            <li>Do recommend if you do not want to spend $30.00 on just ONE brush and need something soft and luxurious for your makeup routine.</li>
            <li>A PROFESSIONAL SET WOULD</li>
            <li>Each brush comes wrapped in plastic, and the hairs of the brushes are incredibly soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I absolutely luv em and would definitely recommend these</li>
            <li>It has a professional feel and look to it.  </li>
            <li>The only problem I&#x27;ve had is with the eyeshadow brush, it doesn&#x27;t really hold or keep eyeshadow on it</li>
            <li>so I have to use my old one.</li>
            <li>they do not kill them in a humane way they beat them and skin them alive</li>
            <li>Bought these for our 18 year old daughter</li>
            <li>but overall I really do like the brushes...</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t shed and they are soft...</li>
            <li>They do everything I want them to do as far as applying my makeup, I use nothing but brushes for 99% of that process.</li>
            <li>Really soft.</li>
            <li>NO regrets thus far.</li>
            <li>I use these brushes daily right next to my Sigma and other high end brushes.</li>
            <li>I purchased these in April and have no regrets!</li>
            <li>Finally, I searched high and low and found this set.</li>
            <li>They are soft and don&#x27;t shed I would recomed if your starting with makeup.</li>
            <li>the are not enough soft to me.</li>
            <li>I use them daily to apply my make up, the bristles feel soft on the face and do not prick at the skin.</li>
            <li>The brush is soft but the wooden handle falls off</li>
            <li>The bruushes are pretty good till the 3rd time you use them and they start falling apart, i was disappointed.</li>
            <li>Great color just disappointed in the quality.</li>
            <li>That being said, it&#x27;s still essential to wash and thoroughly dry your brushes before the first use, as well as every other week or so to remove oil and make up residue.</li>

            <li> Lip bush, bowder brush, etc).&lt;br /&gt;The case also has a magnetic closing which is nice, a lot better than velcro.</li>

            <li> aren&#x27;t good for you&#x27;re skin they carry bacteria and the hair falls out synthetic brushes work better and are safer and cruilty free</li>

            <li> Was so so so excited for this set after reading reviews and loved how cute it was.</li>

            <li> The synthetic eye shadow brushes pick up cream based eye shadows better than the powder eye shadows</li>
            <li> but I still love them.</li>
            <li> others I wish where better technique quality.</li>
            <li> I gave it three stars because I still have to buy more brushes.</li>

            <li> i love them</li>
            <li> I love them...</li>

            <li> And my order arrived on time :)</li>
            <li> and they are so cute too</li>
            <li> I read ALL reviews about many brush sets and this one had the highest</li>

            <li> Super Cute brushes!</li>
            <li> I think the strong chemical smell is the only downside of this brush set; everything else is great!</li>
            <li> If you purchase this brush set, make sure to have a tube of super glue handy.</li>
            <li> The most amazing product I have bought on here most def worth the money</li>
            <li> At first loved them besides the smell</li>

            <li> It is low price but very very good.</li>
            <li> So far they are working great.</li>
            <li> Great value product, good quality, without any odd smell.</li>
            <li> But, they broke easily.</li>
            <li> All the brushes are inside this cream leather case, easy for storage and for traveling.  </li>
            <li> The smell is so strong its nauseating.</li>
            <li> The chemical smell was so strong it gave me a migraine headache</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft, good  bristles, the synthetic ones don&#x27;t sheds  at all which I love but the brown ones</li>
            <li> Practical, effective, and pricing is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> high recommended probably not as good as mac or sigma</li>
            <li> These are beautiful and super soft.</li>
            <li> the case they come in is also pretty nice.</li>
            <li> Nice quality, and pretty.</li>
            <li> The case is nice and convenient and the color is really pretty.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li> This set of brushes is super cheap and quite lovely looking.</li>
            <li> The handles are a blush pink VERY PRETTY and the bristles are perfect.</li>
            <li> plus they&#x27;re way cute :) I would certainly recommend these.</li>
            <li> The large angled brush has become my favorite for shading/contouring -- good distribution of product and they wash out very well.</li>
            <li> The handles feel cheap and look cheap in person.</li>
            <li> and if you enjoy using brushes for make up application.</li>
            <li> Great quality for the price, I would definitely  buy them again if I needed to.</li>
            <li> the case is great the brushes came individually wrapped to keep them protected.</li>
            <li> Updated review: These brushes are cheap and almost all of them have fell apart.</li>
            <li> And cheap.</li>
            <li> I found that both professional and ladies like me loved these brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and a good quality to me.</li>
            <li> The barrel is another issue, the top near the bristles is nicely made but once it goes towards the handle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty new to makeup, but this has been a great set.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who wishes to purchase a great brush set at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these brushes and for an amazing price too.</li>
            <li> Super good quality and soft on the skin.</li>
            <li> I love the brushes they clean pretty easy, apply make up and pick up pigment quick</li>
            <li> I LOVE how these brushes are very soft and smooth, so they don&#x27;t hurt your skin when using them!</li>
            <li> Last year I bought a set for my sister and she said she loved them cause they are soft and good quality, so this this</li>
            <li> at first we wernt to sure about getting them.</li>
            <li> Got my money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li> I love it so much!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS WHOLE PACKAGE!</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, the bristles of the brushes are very soft, while the handles are made of a sturdy material in this beautiful rose pink color.</li>
            <li> brushes felt super cheap.</li>
            <li> When they finally came they were jus what I thought they would be perfect, soft</li>
            <li> This brushes are perfect I definitely recommend them they are really soft and</li>
            <li> so soft I love them !</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft, and appear to be pretty good quality.</li>
            <li> most of all very nice pouch and pretty pink brushes</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice product and soft.</li>
            <li> they are full...</li>
            <li> The hair feels super soft and they are really nice.</li>
            <li> The synthetic hair brushes are super soft and have a nice spring to them.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> First off, upon opening there is an extremely strong chemical smell that comes off of these.</li>
            <li> Other than that, great product for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy with this set for the minimal amount of money I paid for them!</li>
            <li> They make it easier to get the perfect makeup look than other brushes I have tried and they arrived within a week even when I live overseas in Europe.</li>
            <li> LOVE my new brush set!</li>
            <li> Either way, when they fall off like that I just use super glue to fix it</li>
            <li> I was super hesitant because i use mac products</li>
            <li> These are amazing brushes for this price... way better thank expected</li>
            <li> Three of the brush heads already fell off and I had to super glue</li>
            <li> but super gule does the job...</li>
            <li> and it will lose the smell rather quickly.</li>
            <li> I love that they are full sized and so soft!</li>
            <li> Really cute, super soft, and no shedding!</li>
            <li> This is my first professional set, super excited to try them out!!</li>
            <li> For me, the only reason this product received less than a perfect score is because the brush heads pop off easily.</li>
            <li> so as long as your okay with that, it seems okay otherwise.</li>
            <li> They are very soft and I love all of the options of brushes I have.  </li>
            <li> however whenever you wash them make sure you keep them brush down and use luke warm water</li>
            <li> For what it&#x27;s worth, it&#x27;s cute and the brushes are useful and soft</li>
            <li> Amazing quality for your buck and will definitely recommend them to my friends.</li>
            <li> These brushes look nice, and I enjoy the fun pink color.</li>
            <li> i cannot believed it so soft and make me sure that the price</li>
            <li> Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> main issue is with the quality of the brushes, which is super important.</li>
            <li> i just got them and i am completely and entirely satisfied with them..</li>
            <li> and there is a brush for every kind of possible application of makeup.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and there are many of them.</li>
            <li> Worth the money</li>
            <li> Brushes are soft, easy to clean and work well.</li>
            <li> I actually love them more because they aren&#x27;t pink!</li>
            <li> The eye shadow brushes hold the shadow just right.</li>
            <li> The case is a creamy white color and the brushes are a really pretty rose color.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these fabulous and affordable brushes.</li>
            <li> Great brushes after you get past the smell...</li>
            <li> The larger brushes also came with soft plastic casings that fit over the bristles which will be nice for travel.</li>
            <li> It comes in a very useful case for when you are traveling the brushes are super soft.</li>
            <li> there really are no blending brushes and they fell apart quickly.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also easy to clean which is a big plus.</li>
            <li> Very cheap, definitely get what you paid for.  </li>
            <li> There so soft and came in the mail so quick!</li>
            <li> It did smell like paint at first but after leaving it out (unwrapped)</li>
            <li> There is no comparison to my higher end makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> when first open some smell but am ok with that because the case made from PU</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> I am so glad they got these brushes back!</li>
            <li> First, ask yourself these questions:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> so pretty</li>
            <li> One of the brushes fell apart on the first use, but glue will fix it...</li>
            <li> totally recommended :)</li>
            <li> The powder brush is more like a blush brush and the blush brush is not dense enough at all.</li>
            <li> I am overall satisfied.</li>
            <li> Am in love, got them in a short period of time....</li>
            <li> The case does have smell when you first get it but leave it out</li>
            <li> ,it&#x27;s very soft and it has different kind of blending,shadow brushes...</li>
            <li> I recommend the brush set for those who are starting, but if you only need a couple brushes as a replacement such as a foundation brush or kabuki, you&#x27;re better off spending money on a good brush individually for the same price if you want a good blend.</li>
            <li> Great quality, firm and soft brushes.</li>
            <li> I would say that the product is good for the price, not very dense but soft enougth for the face</li>
            <li> pretty much looks exactly like it does in the picture.</li>
            <li> I loved that it had a good collection of brushes of different types, and was a very reasonable pricepoint(conversely, you&#x27;ll spend the same amount on a single brush from Japonesque than you would for this entire set).</li>
            <li> I love the color and the brush is long.</li>
            <li> at first I thought they were too expensive, but ooog my God it was worth, quality is good and it was shipped to my house like in 2-3 days, sooo I really liked that, not only that</li>
            <li> It includes pretty much any type of brush</li>
            <li> They are incredibly soft, easy to clean, and only a couple of hairs have fallen out of a couple of the brushes after I cleaned them.</li>
            <li> I really wanted a case that&#x27;s exactly like this one, so I went ahead and bought this brush set instead.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes, I&#x27;ve had them for a very long time now</li>
            <li> Also, super soft.</li>
            <li> Large Variety of Brushes</li>
            <li> However, I have to agree with the other reviewers who mentioned this smells very strongly of chemicals straight out of the package.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend these brushes!</li>
            <li> I am very satisified with these brushes.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loveeeee these brushes.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these brushes to anyone and everyone!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a reasonable price</li>
            <li> and I really like the pouch it comes in.</li>
            <li> I just opened it and very please that it matches the picture and everything is intact and cover in plastic.</li>
            <li> If you are a real make up user like me.</li>
            <li> I really like these.</li>
            <li> I can tell you i am glad i didnt spent 180</li>
            <li> They had very minimum shedding.</li>
            <li> The delivery of the product was extremely fast.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush set,  </li>
            <li> Buy the Real Technique brushes.  </li>
            <li> The blending brush was broken which in my opinion is the most important brush!</li>
            <li> I have had two or three that I&#x27;ve had to glue back together, but overall, I am thrilled with these.</li>
            <li> Supper fast shipping and the brushes are even nicer than pictured, the bigger brushes have plastic coverings which I really like, it keeps them clean and in correct form.</li>
            <li> Very soft and apply the makeup really well!</li>
            <li> I ordered these along with four other makeup brush sets and these are my favorite.  </li>
            <li> love that it&#x27;s pink!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about a $30 brush set but thought why not give it a try since it has good reviews!</li>
            <li> Super fluffy and accurate on my face.</li>
            <li> They are soft and very versatile!</li>
            <li> They are also not as soft as higher end brushes.</li>
            <li> The case does have a smell at first, but I&#x27;ve aired mine out and it doesn&#x27;t have a noticeable smell.</li>
            <li> when you first start using them they seem professional, not recommended.</li>
            <li> had to super glue them back on.</li>
            <li> They were super inexpensive so not a big deal.</li>
            <li> The fibers are very soft!</li>
            <li> I would HIGHLY recommend these brushes to anyone.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s normal to be smell like that&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> Wasted my money for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve washed the brushes and the only ones to shed are the natural haired one (the full brown hair) and they shed quite a bit.</li>
            <li> normally use on weekends for going out.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical but its pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li> Other then that they worked fine.</li>
            <li> It was a good deal and the PUEEN brand is greater than any other expensive brand.</li>
            <li> and she needed new ones.</li>
            <li> my girlfriend is a makeup artist and is always trying out new products.</li>
            <li> It was time to invest in a new brush set</li>
            <li> Even for someone like myself, who isn&#x27;t terribly skilled with makeup, I noticed that the overall application was much smoother and seamless than what I have achieved with other brushes.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like spending a fortune on my face, but I had reached  a point where I had watched too many youtube tutorials and purchased too many high-end cosmetics to be unhappy as I was with my makeup.</li>
            <li> Secondly, if you are vegan or are very conscious of not buying animal products make sure to read the description carefully-</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the bristles are very soft.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft.</li>
            <li> the brushes are so so so soft!</li>
            <li> Firstly,  the chemical smell that assaults your senses upon opening the kit is actually the plastic case (it is NOT leather like the description says), not the brushes themselves.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Cute but not very good quality.</li>
            <li> Large portion of the brushes are smaller sized&lt;br</li>
            <li> Which I suppose is the only thing that really matters.... not recommended for a professional.</li>
            <li> but I got them because they were pink and when I got them they were more beige than pink</li>
            <li> Brushes are so soft.</li>
            <li> SHE LOVES THEM AND TOSSED HER OLD ONES.</li>
            <li> Do recommend if you do not want to spend $30.00 on just ONE brush and need something soft and luxurious for your makeup routine.</li>
            <li> A PROFESSIONAL SET WOULD</li>
            <li> Each brush comes wrapped in plastic, and the hairs of the brushes are incredibly soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I absolutely luv em and would definitely recommend these</li>
            <li> It has a professional feel and look to it.  </li>
            <li> The only problem I&#x27;ve had is with the eyeshadow brush, it doesn&#x27;t really hold or keep eyeshadow on it</li>
            <li> so I have to use my old one.</li>
            <li> they do not kill them in a humane way they beat them and skin them alive</li>
            <li> Bought these for our 18 year old daughter</li>
            <li> but overall I really do like the brushes...</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t shed and they are soft...</li>
            <li> They do everything I want them to do as far as applying my makeup, I use nothing but brushes for 99% of that process.</li>
            <li> Really soft.</li>
            <li> NO regrets thus far.</li>
            <li> I use these brushes daily right next to my Sigma and other high end brushes.</li>
            <li> I purchased these in April and have no regrets!</li>
            <li> Finally, I searched high and low and found this set.</li>
            <li> They are soft and don&#x27;t shed I would recomed if your starting with makeup.</li>
            <li> the are not enough soft to me.</li>
            <li> I use them daily to apply my make up, the bristles feel soft on the face and do not prick at the skin.</li>
            <li> The brush is soft but the wooden handle falls off</li>
            <li> The bruushes are pretty good till the 3rd time you use them and they start falling apart, i was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great color just disappointed in the quality.</li>
            <li> That being said, it&#x27;s still essential to wash and thoroughly dry your brushes before the first use, as well as every other week or so to remove oil and make up residue.</li>
            <li> and they feel sooo soft and the hairs don&#x27;t fall apart like other brushes.</li>
            <li> I was shocked with the smell I sensed when I first opened the case as many other reviewers described.</li>
            <li> Dried them with a blow dryer and they are still very soft and get the job done!</li>
            <li> Less than $30 professional brush set, which includes all brushes needed for daily makeup use.</li>
            <li> The bag is really big and brush are firm and soft.</li>
            <li> only downside was that one of the brush handles has become loose already on my girlfriend&#x27;s set.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing make up for a long time</li>
            <li> , didn&#x27;t shed,didn&#x27;t have a strange smell,and the color</li>
            <li> no professional...</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not a professional makeup artist.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I have noticed very minimal bristle shedding and my skin does not appear sensitive to them-</li>
            <li> You will learn proper makeup application in due time.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> Hopefully after they dry they won&#x27;t keep that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really used brushes before</li>
            <li> The handles are pink, the same color in the picture, with a pale gold ferrule, and gold Pueen lettering.</li>
            <li> The smaller brushes are too small for application and blending</li>
            <li> I usually try to keep the connection between the handle and brush away from water as much as possible)</li>
            <li> + on the other &#x27;brand name&#x27; brushes.</li>
            <li> No funny smell Like some people said.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that wasn&#x27;t expensive and this brushes are ok not too firm and a little small</li>
            <li> But I just let the case and brushes air dry for a few days</li>
            <li> They do have an awkward smell at first</li>
            <li> but they broke, like a little play set.</li>
            <li> Nothing seems to be missing from the collection.  </li>
            <li> The handles have started to break off from the head after a few months of use.</li>
            <li> I use them everyday</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a waste.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not a smooth ending.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had them for about two weeks now and have had very little shedding.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> the &amp;#34;pony&amp;#34;hair shed like crazy wet or dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for at least a month</li>
            <li> THe hairs were uneven and 2 of my brushes have broken.</li>
            <li> They are poor quality.</li>
            <li> Are you tired of looking like your makeup was smeared on by a 4-year-old girl?</li>
            <li> Shed immediately, broken handles</li>
            <li> I am not happy with the brushes at all.</li>
            <li> I have to say I&#x27;m a bit skeptical buying brushes online because you can never feel the quality of them in person.</li>
            <li> The brush set look and feel so expensive</li>
            <li> So sad</li>
            <li> Oh and did i mention they smell bad.</li>
            <li> really bad quality.</li>
            <li> Just bad, bad, bad, bad, bad brushes.</li>
            <li> Completely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Why wasn&#x27;t there a stippling brush in this set?I was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Smells awful!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Was so so so excited for this set after reading reviews and loved how cute it was. The quality is not what I thought it was going to be. The blending brush was broken which in my opinion is the most important brush! The handles feel cheap and look cheap in person. Completely disappointed. The only reason I&#x27;m giving this a three star is because of the quality of the bristles. Which I suppose is the only thing that really matters.... not recommended for a professional.</li>
            <li> I ordered these along with four other makeup brush sets and these are my favorite.  They are great quality for the price</li>
            <li> I would say that the product is good for the price, not very dense but soft enougth for the face good start in kit i like it!!</li>
            <li> Brushes are so soft. It did smell like paint at first but after leaving it out (unwrapped) it went away. The case is a creamy white color and the brushes are a really pretty rose color. I actually love them more because they aren&#x27;t pink! I&#x27;ve had them for about two weeks now and have had very little shedding. Highly recommend these brushes!</li>
            <li> Cute but not very good quality. The brush started falling apart the day I used them.</li>
            <li> Smells awful! Can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I use these brushes daily right next to my Sigma and other high end brushes. Perfect for beginners or anyone in the beauty industry. Yes yes yes buy Pueen!</li>
            <li> I ordered this set for my sister in law.  The case and the brushes are beautiful.  I will be ordering a set for myself!</li>
            <li> These brushes look nice, and I enjoy the fun pink color. the case they come in is also pretty nice. The brushes are very soft, and appear to be pretty good quality. Only thing I dont like about them is how they apply makeup. There is no comparison to my higher end makeup brushes. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> These brushes were great, besides the fact some of my brush heads came off...had to super glue them back on. Other then that they worked fine.</li>
            <li> I have to say I&#x27;m a bit skeptical buying brushes online because you can never feel the quality of them in person. I am very satisified with these brushes. They are soft and very versatile! Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> when first open some smell but am ok with that because the case made from PU it&#x27;s normal to be smell like that&lt;br /&gt;but i cannot believed it so soft and make me sure that the price it&#x27;s very good with this quality.</li>
            <li> My sister uses only Macys MAC cosmetics and brushes. I can&#x27;t afford those brushes for her and she needed new ones. SHE LOVES THEM AND TOSSED HER OLD ONES.</li>
            <li> This brush set is simply AMAZING!!! The quality is beyond what I would ever expect! The leather case is beautiful and very high quality. The brush set look and feel so expensive but they are not. I love the color and the brush is long. I would recommend this to every one who&#x27;s looking for a nice set.</li>
            <li> Definitely get what you pay for. They are poor quality. Mine arrived with glue on the brushes, and falling apart! Oh and did i mention they smell bad. The smell is so strong its nauseating.</li>
            <li> Super fluffy and accurate on my face. Very soft and apply the makeup really well! I definitely like them a lot!</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it! The brushes are high quality, excellent results.&lt;br /&gt;The case is lovely. Very nice set. Would recommend</li>
            <li> Super Cute brushes! I love them. The hair feels super soft and they are really nice. I absolutely love them and I would recommend them to a friend.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like at all,  I&#x27;ve bought cheaper brushes that the hair doesn&#x27;t come off,  everytime I use them im stuck with white hairs on my fave</li>
            <li> I love them! Last year I bought a set for my sister and she said she loved them cause they are soft and good quality, so this this I bought another set but this time for myself and my sister wasn&#x27;t lying. I love the brushes they clean pretty easy, apply make up and pick up pigment quick and they feel sooo soft and the hairs don&#x27;t fall apart like other brushes.</li>
            <li> Nothing seems to be missing from the collection.  Love it!!! Definitely one of my best shopping in 2013. Thank you!</li>
            <li> my mom got me these for one of my Christmas presents. at first we wernt to sure about getting them. christmas morning when i opened them i was highly satisfied! very impressed. only the packaging the brushes came in smelled like plastic not the actual brushes. the brushes are so so so soft! only a couple of brushes had shedding but it went away after i washed them. i would definitely buy these for a gift :) very impressed</li>
            <li> I love my Pueen brushes! I received mine two days after I purchased them. No bristles have fallen out and I&#x27;ve had mine for about 3-4 months now. They are really great quality. The eye shadow brushes hold the shadow just right. I am verry happy with this purchase. Inexpensive yet great quality. Definitely deserves the 5 stars!</li>
            <li> It was very good brushes. I will give this as a gift to anyone or myself I will reconnect it to everyone :)</li>
            <li> I would have preferred if the brushes were a litte more dense, however, for the most part the brushes are of great quality.&lt;br /&gt;I am absolutely satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that wasn&#x27;t expensive and this brushes are ok not too firm and a little small but they do the job. They are soft and don&#x27;t shed I would recomed if your starting with makeup.</li>
            <li> I bought these a month ago. They arrived on time and were packaged great. At first sight the are beautiful but the stink!! there really are no blending brushes and they fell apart quickly. THe hairs were uneven and 2 of my brushes have broken. the brush fell off the stick. I dont recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Good brushes, soft and good quality :)</li>
            <li> really bad quality. brushes felt super cheap. I returned it the next day. The chemical smell was so strong it gave me a migraine headache</li>
            <li> Very soft and for the price great value. The paint chips off a bit but I do tend to wash often. Love the fan brush the most.</li>
            <li> These are beautiful and super soft. The case is amazing! They exceeded my expectations. I would recommend everyone try them!</li>
            <li> Love it!! Love the packaging, love the texture of the brushes,  love how affordable it is, love that it&#x27;s pink! I deff. Got my money&#x27;s worth! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Good package, It look beautiful, I like the color of the brushes,  good quality, but the are not enough soft to me.</li>
            <li> Great quality, firm and soft brushes. My only issue is with my lip brush. Bristle are coming out. Other than that, great product for the price.</li>
            <li> For what it&#x27;s worth, it&#x27;s cute and the brushes are useful and soft</li>
            <li> I absolutely loveeeee these brushes. Totally worth the price. The brushes are very soft. The hairs don&#x27;t fall out or anything. however whenever you wash them make sure you keep them brush down and use luke warm water so the glue does not melt otherwise the brush that is really good</li>
            <li> But, they broke easily. I kept them in their case after every use. Great color just disappointed in the quality.</li>
            <li> At first loved them besides the smell great but i would say after a few.months my brushes broke off the handles</li>
            <li> I purchased these in April and have no regrets! The fibers are very soft! This is a very good set to have, because it includes everything I need for contouring and eye makeup application. The large angled brush has become my favorite for shading/contouring -- good distribution of product and they wash out very well. The storage case is very nice to have for those times that I need to travel. Do recommend if you do not want to spend $30.00 on just ONE brush and need something soft and luxurious for your makeup routine. Practical, effective, and pricing is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I love it. It is low price but very very good. Thank you so much i love it</li>
            <li> O.M.G. I loove this brushes, at first I thought they were too expensive, but ooog my God it was worth, quality is good and it was shipped to my house like in 2-3 days, sooo I really liked that, not only that but vendor is always informing you where your product is, soobthats great..</li>
            <li> This set of brushes is super cheap and quite lovely looking. I was impressed by the huge variety of different sizes and shapes of brushes. It includes pretty much any type of brush you could want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main issue is with the quality of the brushes, which is super important. These are NOT brushes that will last for years. I&#x27;ve used mine sparingly for a couple months and some of them are already losing a lot of hair. They are also not as soft as higher end brushes. I recommend Sephora brand brushes if you&#x27;re looking for quality that lasts.</li>
            <li> The brushes shipped very quickly and we&#x27;re great quality! I love them!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about a $30 brush set but thought why not give it a try since it has good reviews! Here&#x27;s a summary of my thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Soft&lt;br /&gt;- Good Price&lt;br /&gt;- Bag for travel&lt;br /&gt;- Large Variety of Brushes&lt;br /&gt;- Color does not look as tacky as I anticipated&lt;br /&gt;- Odor went away after washes brushes and airing them out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- DO NOT BLEND LIKE A PROFESSIONAL SET WOULD&lt;br /&gt;- The smaller brushes are too small for application and blending&lt;br /&gt;- Large portion of the brushes are smaller sized&lt;br /&gt;- The larger ones started shedding here and there&lt;br /&gt;- Not the best set for eyeshadow (too thin/small)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I would give the product 4.5 stars if I could. I recommend the brush set for those who are starting, but if you only need a couple brushes as a replacement such as a foundation brush or kabuki, you&#x27;re better off spending money on a good brush individually for the same price if you want a good blend.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend, these brushes are so amazing and I love how they feel.  I am so glad they got these brushes back!</li>
            <li> I originally hesitated buying these brushes, because they didn&#x27;t have many reviews online, but I&#x27;m so glad I did!! They are incredibly soft, easy to clean, and only a couple of hairs have fallen out of a couple of the brushes after I cleaned them. They make my high-end makeup go on so much better and smoother, and they are beautiful to boot! I highly recommend these brushes to anyone and everyone! The case does have a smell at first, but I&#x27;ve aired mine out and it doesn&#x27;t have a noticeable smell. I&#x27;m sure if I put it up to my nose, I might still smell it...nope! Just did that, and it doesn&#x27;t smell :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing make up for a long time but I recently decided I wanted to step my routine up. I&#x27;ve never really used brushes before but I do know how to use them. I would definitely recommend this for a starter set and figuring out which brushes are which and if you enjoy using brushes for make up application. Firstly,  the chemical smell that assaults your senses upon opening the kit is actually the plastic case (it is NOT leather like the description says), not the brushes themselves. That being said, it&#x27;s still essential to wash and thoroughly dry your brushes before the first use, as well as every other week or so to remove oil and make up residue. Secondly, if you are vegan or are very conscious of not buying animal products make sure to read the description carefully- although the title says &#x27;synthetic&#x27; some of these brushes are made with animal hair. For me, the only reason this product received less than a perfect score is because the brush heads pop off easily. If you purchase this brush set, make sure to have a tube of super glue handy. Other than that, I have noticed very minimal bristle shedding and my skin does not appear sensitive to them- plus they&#x27;re way cute :) I would certainly recommend these.</li>
            <li> Great brushes after you get past the smell...one good wash and they&#x27;re fine. The handles have started to break off from the head after a few months of use. So sad</li>
            <li> Are you tired of looking like your makeup was smeared on by a 4-year-old girl? First, ask yourself these questions:&lt;br /&gt;1. Are you a 4-year-old girl? If so, don&#x27;t worry about it. You will learn proper makeup application in due time.&lt;br /&gt;2. Are you using good quality products? If you see the words \\&quot;Urban Decay\\&quot; and \\&quot;MAC\\&quot; on your vanity, you&#x27;re good to go.&lt;br /&gt;3. Are you using good quality tools? I&#x27;m not saying you need to run out and buy Sigma brushes, but this question was what led me to buy this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like spending a fortune on my face, but I had reached  a point where I had watched too many youtube tutorials and purchased too many high-end cosmetics to be unhappy as I was with my makeup. Finally, I searched high and low and found this set. I loved that it had a good collection of brushes of different types, and was a very reasonable pricepoint(conversely, you&#x27;ll spend the same amount on a single brush from Japonesque than you would for this entire set). When my set arrived, I was thrilled when I opened the box. Each brush comes wrapped in plastic, and the hairs of the brushes are incredibly soft and silky. I didn&#x27;t notice any shedding, and they are all just so pretty!&lt;br /&gt;These brushes feel wonderful on my skin, and pick up a nice amount of product. They blend beautifully, too. Even for someone like myself, who isn&#x27;t terribly skilled with makeup, I noticed that the overall application was much smoother and seamless than what I have achieved with other brushes. I would recommend this set to anyone looking for an affordable, good-quality brush kit, and am so glad I bought them.</li>
            <li> The most amazing product I have bought on here most def worth the money so soft I love them !</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t wait to get these.When they finally came they were jus what I thought they would be perfect, soft, didn&#x27;t shed,didn&#x27;t have a strange smell,and the color so pretty I absolutely luv em and would definitely recommend these</li>
            <li> Not as dense as I wanted the brushes to be, but for the price, it gets the job done. Also, super soft.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a makeup brush kit for some time now and this product came up. It&#x27;s a reasonable price and I really like the pouch it comes in. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because some of the brushes have fallen off the handle. (I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I wash my brushes weekly? I usually try to keep the connection between the handle and brush away from water as much as possible) Either way, when they fall off like that I just use super glue to fix it LOL and then it&#x27;s not an issue. I think it&#x27;s an awesome product!</li>
            <li> This is my first professional set, super excited to try them out!! I just opened it and very please that it matches the picture and everything is intact and cover in plastic.</li>
            <li> I just received my Pueen brush set and I&#x27;m already in love with it, the case included too! It has a professional feel and look to it.  I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who wishes to purchase a great brush set at a reasonable price. Great job.</li>
            <li> One of the brushes fell apart on the first use, but glue will fix it...so as long as your okay with that, it seems okay otherwise.</li>
            <li> Great value product, good quality, without any odd smell. The bag is really big and brush are firm and soft. I love it so much!</li>
            <li> Have had this set of brushes for about 5 months now and I&#x27;m extremely happy with them. They don&#x27;t shed and they leave my make-up feeling flawless. They&#x27;re also easy to clean which is a big plus. You won&#x27;t be sorry if u purchase this set :).</li>
            <li> Shed immediately, broken handles</li>
            <li> Does the job. Great case but needs a good blending brush. The synthetic eye shadow brushes pick up cream based eye shadows better than the powder eye shadows so just an FYI in case your applying your eye shadows and you don&#x27;t see the results you want.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these brushes!!! and super cheap great value!! yes they do smell alittle but just wash them and leave them out for a day and you will forget about it! I was super hesitant because i use mac products but when i received them in the mail i was not disappointed at all! i can say i am a fan of pueen and the package was there within 2 days!! can say i was impressed! I was super excited !!!!</li>
            <li> It was a good deal and the PUEEN brand is greater than any other expensive brand. I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> These are amazing brushes for this price... way better thank expected and they cover it all if you are into makeup.. totally recommended :)</li>
            <li> The bruushes are pretty good till the 3rd time you use them and they start falling apart, i was disappointed. the work they were doing was amazing but they broke, like a little play set. when you first start using them they seem professional, not recommended.</li>
            <li> This product did not come with everything listed. Wasted my money for sure. I am not happy with the brushes at all. If you are a real make up user like me. This is not the set for you!!!!</li>
            <li> Wow! For this price point, these brushes are awesome! I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Love these! I&#x27;m pretty new to makeup, but this has been a great set. They are soft and the variety is great! I have had two or three that I&#x27;ve had to glue back together, but overall, I am thrilled with these.</li>
            <li> They are very soft and I love all of the options of brushes I have.  They do have an awkward smell at first but I still love them.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice product and soft. Thank you Amazon. It won&#x27;t be the last order from you.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes, I&#x27;ve had them for a very long time now and they all work well and have not fallen apart on me. I use them daily to apply my make up, the bristles feel soft on the face and do not prick at the skin. They are great after washing them as well, they hold up to soap and hot water, they do not fall apart or lose their bristles. Great quality for the price, I would definitely  buy them again if I needed to.</li>
            <li> I think these brushes are nice. However, most of the brushes are good and others I wish where better technique quality. Why wasn&#x27;t there a stippling brush in this set?I was very disappointed.  The powder brush is more like a blush brush and the blush brush is not dense enough at all. The rest of the brushes A+. I gave it three stars because I still have to buy more brushes.</li>
            <li> Amazing quality for a great price.  Equal to the brushes I&#x27;ve purchased at sephora!</li>
            <li> I really like these. So far they are working great. The only problem I&#x27;ve had is with the eyeshadow brush, it doesn&#x27;t really hold or keep eyeshadow on it so I have to use my old one.</li>
            <li> I also gave these as a gift to my make-up artist grand niece. She loves having these.</li>
            <li> the case is great the brushes came individually wrapped to keep them protected. The brushes are built great. I am going to buy one for a friend as well.</li>
            <li> The brush is soft but the wooden handle falls off so I just glued them back on. Good product for good price</li>
            <li> I was shocked with the smell I sensed when I first opened the case as many other reviewers described. But I just let the case and brushes air dry for a few days and it went away. I love love these brushes. They make it easier to get the perfect makeup look than other brushes I have tried and they arrived within a week even when I live overseas in Europe.</li>
            <li> LOVE my new brush set! There so soft and came in the mail so quick! I would recommend this to anyone who is wanting good quality brushes for a very reasonable price! So happy with them :)</li>
            <li> Three of the brush heads already fell off and I had to super glue them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fanned brush is not usable since the hairs all keep falling out.&lt;br /&gt;However, the bristles are very soft.</li>
            <li> You people that are buying this product disgust me it has horse hair in it they do not kill them in a humane way they beat them and skin them alive just watch some videos on youtube when you buy these brushes you are killing a horse if u don&#x27;t buy these brushes then you are making it so that they don&#x27;t have a reason to kill more animals and animal hair brushes aren&#x27;t good for you&#x27;re skin they carry bacteria and the hair falls out synthetic brushes work better and are safer and cruilty free</li>
            <li> Bought these for our 18 year old daughter and she just LOVES them!&lt;br /&gt;Great price, great products!</li>
            <li> This brushes are perfect I definitely recommend them they are really soft and plus they&#x27;re cute i love them</li>
            <li> First off, upon opening there is an extremely strong chemical smell that comes off of these. Luckily it really only comes off of the case and doesn&#x27;t linger around the brushes. I&#x27;ve washed the brushes and the only ones to shed are the natural haired one (the full brown hair) and they shed quite a bit. I&#x27;ll still try to use them until they have no hair.  Lol. The synthetic hair brushes are super soft and have a nice spring to them.&lt;br /&gt;My fan brush came deformed, it moved in the case to where the bristles were into a crease and folded. Hopefully after they dry they won&#x27;t keep that shape.&lt;br /&gt;Everything else pretty much looks exactly like it does in the picture. The handles are pink, the same color in the picture, with a pale gold ferrule, and gold Pueen lettering. The brushes don&#x27;t say on the side what they do (ie. Lip bush, bowder brush, etc).&lt;br /&gt;The case also has a magnetic closing which is nice, a lot better than velcro. It&#x27;s also a creamy color, an off white. The larger brushes also came with soft plastic casings that fit over the bristles which will be nice for travel. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use the case though because of the smell.</li>
            <li> It was good.  I got them on time and they work good. I like the way they feel and look.</li>
            <li> Nice quality, and pretty. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I Love them! i just got them and i am completely and entirely satisfied with them.. Super good quality and soft on the skin. I was considering buying some Bobbi Brown ones bt i came across these and they seemed legit so i bought them.. I can tell you i am glad i didnt spent 180+ on the other &#x27;brand name&#x27; brushes. Totally recommend them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an affordable brush set with quality brushes and I found them! It comes in a very useful case for when you are traveling the brushes are super soft. They also came on time, I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li> Supper fast shipping and the brushes are even nicer than pictured, the bigger brushes have plastic coverings which I really like, it keeps them clean and in correct form.The best part of these brushes is how they feel on your face, they are soooo incredibly SOFT!! and there is a brush for every kind of possible application of makeup. The case is nice and convenient and the color is really pretty.</li>
            <li> Nicely done pueen!....No brush fall ,it&#x27;s very soft and it has different kind of blending,shadow brushes...most of all very nice pouch and pretty pink brushes it&#x27;s so cute! So grab your&#x27;s now!</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing. I ordered them on the 3rd and they arrived on the 7th. As soon as I got them, I washed them. They had very minimum shedding. Dried them with a blow dryer and they are still very soft and get the job done! I would HIGHLY recommend these brushes to anyone. Good job, Pueen!</li>
            <li> my girlfriend is a makeup artist and is always trying out new products. she loved this set because of the amount of brushes you were getting the price. she was very satisfied with the brushes and she said they are comparable to sigma brushes. her coworker liked them as well and had me order her a set. only downside was that one of the brush handles has become loose already on my girlfriend&#x27;s set.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome set if you want a variety of brushes at your disposal. However, I have to agree with the other reviewers who mentioned this smells very strongly of chemicals straight out of the package. I&#x27;m currently airing it out by placing it by my living room window before I wash the brushes and add them in my makeup kit. Nevertheless, the bristles of the brushes are very soft, while the handles are made of a sturdy material in this beautiful rose pink color. The leather case is also extremely soft to the touch and is the perfect cream color that I absolutely love! I was debating between this set and this purple/black satin vegan brush set being sold here on amazon. I really wanted a case that&#x27;s exactly like this one, so I went ahead and bought this brush set instead. And, I&#x27;m not disappointed by my choice at all! I think the strong chemical smell is the only downside of this brush set; everything else is great!</li>
            <li> I gave these brushes 4 stars...only cause two of them broke...but super gule does the job...now im no professional...but overall I really do like the brushes...they are full...they don&#x27;t shed and they are soft...I love them...perfect starting brushes and for the price...they can&#x27;t be beat I don&#x27;t regret buying them</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive my brushes today! I love that they are full sized and so soft! My only comment is that I wish they came with a guide as to which brush is which and what they are used for :)</li>
            <li> This brush set is amazing. Amazing quality in all aspects. No shedding. No funny smell Like some people said. The bristles are very soft. They hold and distributE the product nicely all in all I would recommend them to a friend even gift them, which I already have done!</li>
            <li> Very cheap, definitely get what you paid for.  And I got a rash from them even after washing before use.  Tossed them all.</li>
            <li> These makeup brushes are so cute and they are amazing. I use them everyday and I have cleaned them twice and the brushes stay in tack. No shedding. My husband gave these beautiful brushes for Christmas. I&#x27;m so impressed by them. Also, the cream leather case is amazing. I only use it if I&#x27;m traveling though. I highly recommend these brushes and for an amazing price too.</li>
            <li> Less than $30 professional brush set, which includes all brushes needed for daily makeup use. All the brushes are inside this cream leather case, easy for storage and for traveling.  I LOVE how these brushes are very soft and smooth, so they don&#x27;t hurt your skin when using them! Amazing quality for your buck and will definitely recommend them to my friends.</li>
            <li> Very nice product for the price. The brushes are soft and there are many of them. The carrying tote is very nice for when you are traveling. The delivery of the product was extremely fast. I am very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush set,  I&#x27;ve had it for at least a month and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the brushes.  I am overall satisfied.</li>
            <li> I loved them they&#x27;re great quality! And my order arrived on time :) high recommended probably not as good as mac or sigma but they just do the work perfectly</li>
            <li> Really cute, super soft, and no shedding! Perfect for beginners.  Updated review: These brushes are cheap and almost all of them have fell apart. Don&#x27;t wast your money. Buy the Real Technique brushes.  Affordable and they don&#x27;t fall apart.</li>
            <li> These brushes are awesome all of them really soft good great quality. Ive had them over a year and they are still great and they are so cute too</li>
            <li> Am in love, got them in a short period of time.... ❤️❤️❤️❤️ Worth the money</li>
            <li> so far so good, impressed!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS WHOLE PACKAGE! But the brush tops ended up breaking on me. They were super inexpensive so not a big deal.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these fabulous and affordable brushes. The case does have smell when you first get it but leave it out and it will lose the smell rather quickly. I read ALL reviews about many brush sets and this one had the highest so I purchased them.NO regrets thus far. They do everything I want them to do as far as applying my makeup, I use nothing but brushes for 99% of that process. I went to beauty school but I&#x27;m not a professional makeup artist. I found that both professional and ladies like me loved these brushes. I now know why. I have not had many bristles fall off either. The handles are a blush pink VERY PRETTY and the bristles are perfect. GET THEM!!!!</li>
            <li> I just got these and couldn&#x27;t wait to open the box. The brushes are soft and a good quality to me. I ordered these because of the color; which I love even more in person. This is the second item I have purchased from Pueen and I must say I just adore the way they present their products.</li>
            <li> I have been using my brushes for 6 months now and I am still in love with them. The bristles have not fallen out and the makeup adheres to the brushes well.</li>
            <li> I am super happy and surprised that my brushes came in two days, so that&#x27;s great. When I received them the fan brush was disfigured, the bristles where bent and not in the &amp;#34;fan&amp;#34; shape. The brushes are soft, good  bristles, the synthetic ones don&#x27;t sheds  at all which I love but the brown ones the &amp;#34;pony&amp;#34;hair shed like crazy wet or dry. There&#x27;s only three of them but it&#x27;s a waste. The barrel is another issue, the top near the bristles is nicely made but once it goes towards the handle it wasn&#x27;t sealed it&#x27;s not a smooth ending. Over all the brushes are nice looking, I hope they work well.</li>
            <li> Brushes are cute but the hair fall off!!! :/</li>
            <li> This Makeup brushes are good. And cheap. I like it.&lt;br /&gt;I normally use on weekends for going out. So for me it is very nice.</li>
            <li> All my brushes are all great &amp; of good quality. Really soft. Only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that all the bristles came out for the eyebrow comb after a month. Didn&#x27;t like that at all.</li>
            <li> Great quality ..I love them ..but I got them because they were pink and when I got them they were more beige than pink but I so recommend them!</li>
            <li> Was skeptical but its pretty good for the price. And its my favorite color. Brushes are ok n get the job done for the most part</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving 4 stars for now because I have not used these brushes with makeup. But the brush case is extremely nice and the brushes feel good and have some weight to them. I&#x27;m extremely happy with this set for the minimal amount of money I paid for them!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like these brushes, would not repurchase these brushes. Gave two stars because I still use the blush brush. The rest fell apart and do not hold product at all. Just bad, bad, bad, bad, bad brushes.</li>
            <li> This is the second set I bought as a gift.  Both girls love them</li>
            <li> It was time to invest in a new brush set and I didn&#x27;t want to spend $160 on a \\&quot;brand name\\&quot;. After browsing over 20+ sets, I came across this one which includes all the must have brushes at an amazing price. My order shipped on a Sunday and got it on Tuesday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brushes and case look actually as the photos displayed. Brushes are soft, easy to clean and work well. Definitely happy with purchase.</li>
