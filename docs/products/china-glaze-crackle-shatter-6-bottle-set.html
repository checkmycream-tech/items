            <li>I absolutely love this set of colors.</li>
            <li>but I use a shiny top coat on my nails anyway.</li>
            <li>and I still love this product.</li>
            <li>I got it in the mail &amp; tried all the colors on in the span of a month &amp; everything was ok.</li>
            <li>I hear they crackle better anyway.</li>
            <li>In regards to this particular brand, however, it works great for me.</li>
            <li>A light layer will be perfect and you can see the effect instantly.</li>
            <li>The Crackle &amp;#34;trend&amp;#34; is about over, but it&#x27;s still a very cool look.</li>
            <li>I was really excited when I bought this set as I LOVE to crackle</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great for an accent nail, or easy to have every nail with something different to look at.</li>
            <li>The colour selections of this package are great- the black and white are all purpose, and the teal has a very bright colour.</li>
            <li>First of all, crackle&#x27;s are a top coat.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so much fun!</li>
            <li>I love this crackle, it goes on smooth and crackles fast..</li>
            <li>I love the range of colors that&#x27;s why I bought this particular set!</li>
            <li>The purple looks good over lighter colours (currently wearing it on a gold colour).</li>
            <li>and I really recommend it to others that love crackle.</li>
            <li>I am super bummed about it</li>
            <li>I love them and HIGHLY RECOMMEND them</li>
            <li>I was a little worried they might be unusable as this is an older china glaze collection, but it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>My favorite color is the concrete.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more china glaze crackle colors!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love crackle polish, and I have always liked the china glaze polishes because they are the closest you can get to OPI, but half the price</li>
            <li>Avon sold nail products similar to this which I liked but was discontinued.</li>
            <li>The price was fabulous for 5 full size bottles and like I said this is the only place where you can buy these colors as a bundle!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I ordered this as my first crackle set</li>
            <li>Thank you so much, I would so order from you once again!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>After your crackle is dry, apply plenty of top coat to make it shine, as it will leave bumps and ridges.</li>
            <li>it brings all old and new polishes and crackles all back to its original state like when u first purchased it !!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s where crackle really shines (though sometimes nice similar colours adds depth and such).</li>
            <li>This polish is loads of fun, and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it thus far, compared to the \\&quot;quality\\&quot; brands.</li>
            <li>Purple doesn&#x27;t crack much, but I may have applied it incorrectly.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>I expected better quality from China Glaze.</li>
            <li>and when she showed me how to use them it came out really neat.</li>
            <li>Wanted a cool way to create eggs on my nails for Easter, the only thing I suggest is to pick a color that will show up and make the crackle stand out.</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t work with it decently</li>
            <li>It is very easy to do even for me that I usually dont have time or patience.</li>
            <li>I will point out that it does tend to clump near the top when you brush off excess, so be sure to push that down a little and watch the build up.</li>
            <li>My least favorite is the light blue!</li>
            <li>I already had the white and gold, but I really wanted black, so I could apply it over a bright red.</li>
            <li>When a product is being advertised it must live up to its name.</li>
            <li>I bought this nail polish since I heard about the new crackle effect.</li>
            <li>They last long and dont chip easy.</li>
            <li>first let me say it was packaged with extra care none were oped or leaked!</li>
            <li>Seems like the nail polishes were old.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, China Glaze is not as good.  </li>
            <li>I liked this nail polish when I first got it, and since than I&#x27;ve only used the black color and occasionally the green.  </li>
            <li>Two thick coats of top coat is usually enough.</li>
            <li>The only hint I will give is to make sure the crackle layer is not too thick or the effect will not work.</li>
            <li>these go on incredibly easily and smoothly and are very easy to work with - you can go thick or thin layer and if you do thin, it still doesn&#x27;t dry so wicked fast</li>
            <li>The green, pink &amp; grey are ok....</li>
            <li>i bought it because i really loved the crackle effect the halloween nail polish gave , but this was a big disappointment.</li>
            <li>Not worth the $$$ when u can go 2 Walpart &amp; buy the Pure Ice crackle 4 abt $2.99 or $3.99 a pop.</li>

            <li> I read a few of the complaints here, and I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s an accurate review of this product.</li>
            <li> But NOW, the black, white &amp; purple are clumpy &amp; obviously not usable.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t played with the pink much, but the one time I did use it on a black base it was stunning.</li>
            <li> So you want to pick a nice base coat (like a dark colour) and then apply a contrasting crackle (like white).</li>
            <li> Make sure your base coats are completely dry before applying crackle glaze, or it won&#x27;t separate properly.</li>
            <li> I PUT THE PINK ON</li>
            <li> Give yourself some time to practice, because it requires a different application than usual polish.</li>
            <li> I was extremely dissappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received several compliments this past weekend on how I did my nail polish.</li>
            <li> Along with other reviewers I also found this nail polish to be clumpy.</li>
            <li> China glaze crackle and any other branded shatter or crackle</li>
            <li> When using this polish, make sure your base is completely dried before applying.</li>
            <li> However this nail polish goes bad quickly.  </li>
            <li> The polish simply looked like it was poorly applied.</li>
            <li> I tried to paint my nails and it dried in patches.</li>
            <li> this nail polish was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Crackle polish gives a crackle effect because it dries much faster than other polishes, causing it to seize up and leave cracks to show the base coat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for about a year and all of the bottles have dried up (including the ones I&#x27;ve never opened)!</li>
            <li> Such a waste of money :(</li>
            <li> You can do a thin layer or a thick layer depending on the type of crackle you desire.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift and my daughter was not happy.</li>
            <li> When putting the crackle coat on, you want to brush one side off and use thin strokes to go across.</li>
            <li> To get a different look, you can paint from side to side, instead of base to tip.</li>
            <li> Using a clear base coat, then a colour base coat, gives plenty for the crackle to sit on.</li>
            <li> such a variety of base colors that will stand out!</li>
            <li> I was thoroughly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Horrible quality!</li>

            <li> Wanted a cool way to create eggs on my nails for Easter, the only thing I suggest is to pick a color that will show up and make the crackle stand out.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift and my daughter was not happy. 1 out of 6 colors worked correctly. And the color that worked only lasted about 2 days.  I would not recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> This product is not as advertised. It does not crackle. When a product is being advertised it must live up to its name. I need to be refunded!!!</li>
            <li> This crackles awesome!!!!</li>
            <li> I read a few of the complaints here, and I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s an accurate review of this product. First of all, crackle&#x27;s are a top coat. So you want to pick a nice base coat (like a dark colour) and then apply a contrasting crackle (like white). That&#x27;s where crackle really shines (though sometimes nice similar colours adds depth and such). When using this polish, make sure your base is completely dried before applying. When putting the crackle coat on, you want to brush one side off and use thin strokes to go across. Crackle polish gives a crackle effect because it dries much faster than other polishes, causing it to seize up and leave cracks to show the base coat. Give yourself some time to practice, because it requires a different application than usual polish. If I miss stripes or sides, I don&#x27;t worry though- crackle covers it. In regards to this particular brand, however, it works great for me. I&#x27;ve used it numerous times. Using a clear base coat, then a colour base coat, gives plenty for the crackle to sit on. After your crackle is dry, apply plenty of top coat to make it shine, as it will leave bumps and ridges. Two thick coats of top coat is usually enough. The colour selections of this package are great- the black and white are all purpose, and the teal has a very bright colour. I haven&#x27;t played with the pink much, but the one time I did use it on a black base it was stunning. The purple looks good over lighter colours (currently wearing it on a gold colour). Remember, crackles appear in the direction your brush is used. To get a different look, you can paint from side to side, instead of base to tip. This polish is loads of fun, and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it thus far, compared to the \\&quot;quality\\&quot; brands. I will point out that it does tend to clump near the top when you brush off excess, so be sure to push that down a little and watch the build up. I plan on buying the metallic set for my birthday!</li>
            <li> I purchased all 12 bottles of the China Glaze Crackle collection. I was extremely dissappointed. The polish simply looked like it was poorly applied. Not the crackle effect I was expecting. There is no \\&quot;knock off\\&quot; when wanting the crackle effect of OPI. the cheaper versions are just that.</li>
            <li> The nail polishes were cakey.  I tried to paint my nails and it dried in patches. Seems like the nail polishes were old.  I don&#x27;t have the time to return the item so I lost my 18 bucks.  I will never order from that vendor again.</li>
            <li> I put he&#x27;d this item and it came today in the mail first let me say it was packaged with extra care none were oped or leaked! The colors were exactly like the picture and the colors go on beautifully! I love the range of colors that&#x27;s why I bought this particular set! The price was fabulous for 5 full size bottles and like I said this is the only place where you can buy these colors as a bundle! I love them and HIGHLY RECOMMEND them plus the price is FABULOUS! I&#x27;m in heaven</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Purple doesn&#x27;t crack much, but I may have applied it incorrectly. My favorite color is the concrete. My least favorite is the light blue! I will definitely be buying more china glaze crackle colors!</li>
            <li> This nail polish is amazing!!! When I don&#x27;t have time to run and get a pedi I can just do it myself now and my toe nails look fabulous! I&#x27;ve received several compliments this past weekend on how I did my nail polish. Love love love!</li>
            <li> I love these polishes! They&#x27;re great for an accent nail, or easy to have every nail with something different to look at. This is a great price to get so many colors. So far I have used the pink and teal. They&#x27;re so much fun! I was a little worried they might be unusable as this is an older china glaze collection, but it works perfectly. Make sure your base coats are completely dry before applying crackle glaze, or it won&#x27;t separate properly.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as my first crackle set and I have to say I&#x27;m in love.lol. My order came two days after I ordered it. It did arrive before it was suppose to be delivered. It was packaged well with no spills or damaged. Each color is wonderful n works as it is suppose to. I will be ordering this crackle set again when I run out and I really recommend it to others that love crackle. You get more bang for ur buck. As each bottle in stores are about 5 to 6 $ each. I hope this is helpful to those that are looking to buy this I deff recommend it.</li>
            <li> these go on incredibly easily and smoothly and are very easy to work with - you can go thick or thin layer and if you do thin, it still doesn&#x27;t dry so wicked fast you can&#x27;t work with it decently</li>
            <li> I liked this nail polish when I first got it, and since than I&#x27;ve only used the black color and occasionally the green.  However this nail polish goes bad quickly.  I&#x27;ve had it for about a year and all of the bottles have dried up (including the ones I&#x27;ve never opened)! I am super bummed about it so I only recommend buying one crackle nail polish at a time since it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> Loved the colors and it stays on pretty good, you do need a top coat though since it&#x27;s not shiny</li>
            <li> Excellent product and price. Thanks</li>
            <li> Its not as good as I exected.  Avon sold nail products similar to this which I liked but was discontinued. Unfortunately, China Glaze is not as good.  The colors are great, but the end result is not that &#x27;beautiful&#x27; on the nails.</li>
            <li> Now my fingernails and turquoise rings will match! Love the crackly concept!  More MOre!  such a variety of base colors that will stand out!</li>
            <li> I bought this nail polish since I heard about the new crackle effect. It is very easy to do even for me that I usually dont have time or patience. You just apply any color and then apply a coat of the crackle nail polish. The only hint I will give is to make sure the crackle layer is not too thick or the effect will not work. A light layer will be perfect and you can see the effect instantly. I bought this set and I like the different ways it can be combined.</li>
            <li> this nail polish was a waste of my money. it does not crackle at all. i bought it because i really loved the crackle effect the halloween nail polish gave , but this was a big disappointment. NO CRACKLE EFFECT AT ALL.</li>
            <li> Love this kit! So affordable and great quality polish! Would recommend to anyone looking for  a great nail design that&#x27;s super easy.</li>
            <li> I love this crackle, it goes on smooth and crackles fast.. I would recommend this crackle to everyone. Would buy it again</li>
            <li> Along with other reviewers I also found this nail polish to be clumpy. I have not even used it yet! But it was a good price is you get what you pay for I guess</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE COLORS IN THE KIT I GOT FOR CRACKLE NAIL POLISH. I PUT THE PINK ON AND IT LOOKS SO GOOD,THAT I WORE IT THREW THE HOLIDAY SEASON. THANKS</li>
            <li> It came very quickly  and in great condition.  Thank you so much, I would so order from you once again! Some amazing overlays for those nail polish enthusiasts out there!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this set of colors. I use them almost every day. You can do a thin layer or a thick layer depending on the type of crackle you desire. They have a matte finish but I use a shiny top coat on my nails anyway. They last long and dont chip easy.</li>
            <li> China glaze crackle and any other branded shatter or crackle nail polishes clumps up after getting exposed to air so many times ! you have to go to a sally&#x27;s beauty supply or order off here , buy whats called a nail polish thinner ... it brings all old and new polishes and crackles all back to its original state like when u first purchased it !! this is a bargain to get all 6 of these for 19 dollars !! stop complaining and do your research !!</li>
            <li> I loved it!!! It came today and I was very glad since I couldn&#x27;t wait for it to get here!!! The thing I like about this was that it works great and I love the colors!!!! Just wanted to say that I&#x27;ve had this product for awhile and I still love this product.</li>
            <li> The Crackle &amp;#34;trend&amp;#34; is about over, but it&#x27;s still a very cool look. I already had the white and gold, but I really wanted black, so I could apply it over a bright red. All of these are really nice and I look forward to using them.</li>
            <li> I was really excited when I bought this set as I LOVE to crackle/shatter my nails! I got it in the mail &amp; tried all the colors on in the span of a month &amp; everything was ok. The colors crackled really nice &amp; I thought all was well. But NOW, the black, white &amp; purple are clumpy &amp; obviously not usable. The green, pink &amp; grey are ok....4 now. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these. Not worth the $$$ when u can go 2 Walpart &amp; buy the Pure Ice crackle 4 abt $2.99 or $3.99 a pop. I hear they crackle better anyway. I even stored it in a room temperature setting but it still clumped up! YouTube it to double check though. I was thoroughly disappointed. I expected better quality from China Glaze.</li>
            <li> My nails are so important to me and crackles are very popular and china glaze is a good quality name brand and their crackle line is no exception these work great and I have no complaints!</li>
            <li> I took these to my local nail tech where I get my nails done because I have never used these  before and when she showed me how to use them it came out really neat.She loved playing with them too.</li>
            <li> Horrible quality! Such a waste of money :(</li>
            <li> I absolutely love crackle polish, and I have always liked the china glaze polishes because they are the closest you can get to OPI, but half the price ;) I have never tried the china glaze crackles, til now, I LOVE THEM! They are so bright, vivid and crack perfectly!</li>
