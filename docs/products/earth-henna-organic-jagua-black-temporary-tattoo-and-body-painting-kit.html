            <li>The fine needle applicator was awesome too.</li>

            <li>It does take a good 24 hours to darken, but works well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve wanted a good henna kit but</li>

            <li>Loved it.  </li>

            <li>absolutely loved this product.  </li>

            <li>Good to use as a guide to whether you would like a permanent tat......</li>
            <li>Super impressed with this product.</li>
            <li>It was great and it had a lot more henna than I thought.</li>
            <li>All of the items advertised were included and useful for creating the best product.</li>
            <li>I bought for my eyebrow and it is great :)</li>
            <li>The transfers were very easy to use and had some good designs.</li>
            <li>She would love to do this!</li>
            <li>Enjoy!!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, great color and texture.</li>
            <li>The kit works amazingly well.  </li>
            <li>it takes a couple hours to darken but the end result is amazing.</li>
            <li>The jagua itself is nice, the tool used for application sucked.</li>
            <li>The product was nice and dark,deep</li>
            <li>I have used this product many times - always with good results.</li>
            <li>Also use the gloves that come with the kit or get your own.</li>
            <li>It dries, forms a kind of crust.</li>
            <li>and i liked the way it came out.</li>
            <li>The company with the best most consistent product I have found is called FreshJagua dot com.</li>
            <li>LOL I guess my face is just special.</li>
            <li>The applicator was a good size and it was easy to mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Loved reading this book and all of the pictures where nice and detailed with design.</li>
            <li>very easy to put it together and very easy to apply on skin.</li>
            <li>very easy to mixl</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very strong smell when you&#x27;re applying it, but after it dries you can&#x27;t smell anything.</li>
            <li>Love it and for sure will purchase this item again!</li>
            <li>and I loved how my very first attempt came out!</li>
            <li>I own a henna tattoo business and many people are asking about Jagua.</li>
            <li>so i could do lots of good sized and detailed designs.  </li>
            <li>It found that I was able to print my own designs, and if I applied them (using the eucalyptus)</li>
            <li>applicator is very fine point to allow for precision  detail.</li>
            <li>But over all good fun product!</li>
            <li>Pretty great stuff.</li>
            <li>It was kinda chunky at first, but it still worked great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was a great deal for something that lasts as long as it does and I was happy.</li>
            <li>were not to my liking, but it&#x27;s easy to make your own.</li>
            <li>I love the product and have purchased this kit 5 times now.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>got so many compliments on it.  </li>
            <li>Love her</li>
            <li>so I will try to get this item elsewhere for a better price.</li>
            <li>If you make a mistake, make sure you scrub that area well immediately</li>
            <li>She has used it many times and still has plenty of liquid to make many more.  </li>
            <li>from what I could salvage I was still able to use it and it does work well.</li>
            <li>Just dissapointed that most of the product was ruined and ruined my things.</li>
            <li>I purchased this brand because of the free shipping and the &amp;#34;freshness&amp;#34; of mixing my own jagua, but after my frustration I don&#x27;t think I will be buying it again.</li>
            <li>Works great but its only good for one medium design.</li>
            <li>I love the eucalyptus oil too.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>Just wish it had more tips and more henna powder for the price.</li>
            <li>it arrived in two days :)</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>many uses.</li>
            <li>I used it on my eyebrows as I read many reviewers had...</li>
            <li>Love how it looks on the skin.</li>
            <li>The templates they gave were okay</li>
            <li>it does hold for more that 2 weeks</li>
            <li>I got so many compliments and it lasted for about a week</li>
            <li>I would love to be able to refer my customers to your product if it works well.</li>
            <li>She was able to do intricate art with it.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>One more thing - this is not Henna.</li>
            <li>Looks authentic too.</li>
            <li>Good alternative to a tattoo and a great way to experiment with possible tattoo ideas and placements!</li>
            <li>My daughter has used this kit I bought many times.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Leftover just goes in Refrigerator and able to use again.&lt;br /&gt;Would</li>
            <li>actually better than henna,</li>
            <li>please reply asap :)</li>
            <li>The tattoos lasted up to 10-11 days, with the darkest and most pronounced color on days 3-5 before fading.</li>
            <li>Smaller/thinner lines fade quicker but the thicker, more substantive tattoos lasted the longest.</li>
            <li>More packaging than product.</li>
            <li>It was an okay product.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really wasn&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li>love it and read the directions unlike me and messed it up a bit</li>
            <li>I rate this 3 stars because it did arrive on time, and the amount of product for the cost is definitely worthwhile.</li>
            <li>i absolutely love this product, and so do my customers.</li>
            <li>My 14 yo niece enjoyed using this with her mom....</li>
            <li>and I was extremely  pleased with my results,</li>
            <li>so that made using  the product more appeasing  as well.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>like are you going to provide more or not.</li>
            <li>I am planning to order more when I finish what I have.</li>
            <li>Oh and the smell is quite potent.</li>
            <li>but make sure u wash it well</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, it has lasted about a week now.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall LOVELY product.</li>
            <li>Does as promised, BETTER than henna for tattoo experimentation.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to get this</li>
            <li>And the applicator tip is very fine and makes it easy to make intricate designs.</li>
            <li>It looked really good and many mistaken the tattoo for a real one !</li>
            <li>Worked very well, instructions were easy and looked great for the time it lasted :)</li>
            <li>Love this product is very cool...</li>
            <li>Good price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll also add that I&#x27;m a hairstylist with my hands in water all day so for it to day that long was awesome!</li>
            <li>Loved this product so much!</li>
            <li>it says best results is on clean bare skin).</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!!</li>
            <li>I was really excited to receive this product!</li>
            <li>kind of messy but awesome product</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and clean up  </li>
            <li>Product came early, and in great condition.</li>
            <li>(Or be a wayyy better free hand artist than my boyfriend was)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product I have sensitive skin to some things</li>
            <li>Loved it works we&#x27;ll sipping was fast 👍👍👍</li>
            <li>My whole family tried it and loved it.  </li>
            <li>i honestly didn&#x27;t think this product was worth buying at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s go on easy and</li>
            <li>Easy to mix and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Easy instructions.</li>
            <li>The instructions were easy to read and understand.</li>
            <li>It has easy to follow instructions and the henna lasted a while.  </li>
            <li>It lasted about the two weeks, and was relatively easy to set up.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>The gel is easy to prepare.</li>
            <li>She is very artistic and kept drawing on herself.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting a lot more from this product especially since I read nothing but great reviews</li>
            <li>and once you get the hang of it its easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Comes out  faded and smudges easily.  </li>
            <li>Lol had spots on my hands where it accidentally touched while I was doing it and it totally showed so wear gloves! :-)</li>
            <li>easy to mix and apply.</li>
            <li>It smudges easily.</li>
            <li>If you do decide to purchase this item, I strongly suggest rubber gloves and to use/mix the product on a surface that either can&#x27;t stain, or that you wouldn&#x27;t mind staining.</li>
            <li>Better then real tattoos honestly</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very deep and beautiful.</li>
            <li>I did full hand designs every two weeks:)</li>
            <li>hands down one of the best henna kits I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li>follow the directions, and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>Also it says it shows better on darker skin, this is true because my boyfriend is slightly more tan than I am and his came out very clear and nice.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s very easy to get exactly the design you want with the applicator tip they give you.</li>
            <li>It comes exactly as described and is very easy to mis all together.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great product.</li>
            <li>Overall great product.</li>
            <li>Works great and actually stays on even after swimming and showers  </li>
            <li>The kit was cheap and the tip broke while I was drawing my tattoo.</li>
            <li>It would be great for ancient celt or tribal looking tattoos, like South American tradition tattoo art.</li>
            <li>family fun :)</li>
            <li>it was relatively easy to clean up.</li>
            <li>My only suggestion is that if you make a chest tattoo, like I did, you should put a shirt on at night because I slept on my hand and the tattoo transferred from my chest to my hand - lol.  </li>
            <li>Such a great Christmas gift for an artistically minded person.</li>
            <li>easy clean up of tools.</li>
            <li>Great buying experience, especially around the holidays.</li>
            <li>it may be a bit pricey, but it is worth what you spend for sure.</li>
            <li>I cant get enough of this temporary tattoo ,  its a great product.</li>
            <li>I figured that&#x27;s what I get for buying cheap henna off</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works great and last for a week or two.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s safe which I love, looks like a real tatoo.</li>
            <li>So much fun and super easy to use!</li>
            <li>Wonderful product although a bit messy for over excited teenagers..</li>
            <li>very fun product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, I&#x27;m able to do many &amp;#34;tattoos&amp;#34; many times, they last about 2 weeks</li>
            <li>Super easy to make, and the kit comes with reallly well written instructions.</li>
            <li>Make sure you have a steady hand because this stuff stays on!!</li>
            <li>I love it so much !</li>
            <li>I love this product my first time using it when it peels</li>
            <li>Lots of fun for my daughter!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to start using this.</li>
            <li>great condition instructions were not clear-</li>
            <li>It DOES darken significantly over 24</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well priced and totally worth it!</li>
            <li>but yeah my extra product is frozern now :P i will be ordering another one soon.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not so clean looking.  </li>
            <li>you can clean up mistakes 😄😄</li>
            <li>So it was a great product and worth your money but definitely use a stencil.</li>
            <li>Extremely pigmented, easy to work with, easy intructions, and a good shelf life.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I like tattoos and wanted to get one but didn&#x27;t want the commitment to it, so this is an awesome way to have a tattoo and not have to live with it when you get old, haha.</li>
            <li>You probably could print out your own designs to give yourself more options, unless you are artistic enough to draw it by yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The ink is a blackish-blue instead of the normal brown which was fine by me, I just wished I had purchased a better product.</li>
            <li>Earth Henna really knows their stuff :)</li>
            <li>I loved designing with this type of temporary tattoo, I just wish it came in a bigger bottle</li>
            <li>I prefer to pay more if everything was ready.</li>
            <li>Granted, it does look really cool after you let it set.</li>
            <li>I did expect the result to be a darker color, but overall a good product.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s so light, I could draw all over myself for fun and</li>
            <li>overall it&#x27;s a good product but not a lot of the product and the stencils</li>
            <li>The product itself is not bad.</li>
            <li>pretty easy to use, even for the beginner</li>
            <li>The applicator is pretty easy to use.</li>
            <li>The instructions are pretty easy to follow.</li>
            <li>It works amazing and super easy to use is the second time I got this kit</li>
            <li>The first time it worked fine.  </li>
            <li>I might use this about 3 times, 4 if I&#x27;m lucky.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different inks, and this is the best.  </li>
            <li>You definitely need to wear to the gloves and make sure you do it on top of some news paper or towels</li>
            <li>I love this product, but you definitely cannot use it more than once, and it looks faded immediately.</li>
            <li>&amp; I am artistic.</li>
            <li>The product was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>This stuff is okay but is not as realistic as they claim.  </li>
            <li>Ok first things first, this is not henna.</li>
            <li>Really great product if you&#x27;re looking for &amp;#34;black henna&amp;#34; (even though this isn&#x27;t true black henna, which is supposed to be toxic).</li>
            <li>Lasted about ten days, very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>This tattoo kit was overall pretty good.</li>
            <li>The tip got really clogged though so make sure you clean everything really well.</li>
            <li>It is also good to apply to dry skin.</li>
            <li>Works absolutely amazing, easy to mix the solutions, easy to apply and stayed on for almost a week and half!</li>
            <li>practice on paper first!</li>
            <li>This is safe, really looks cool but is very noticeable.  </li>
            <li>Nice black colour:)</li>
            <li>This company sent me a whole sample assortment a while ago for free, guess they were marketing to the Henna Tattoo artists.</li>
            <li>I also experienced some trouble using the stencils.</li>
            <li>This was a gift and the girl who received it has had so much fun with it.  </li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t worth it for me.</li>
            <li>With the defects I had, it&#x27;s not even worth looking into buying anything else from this company.</li>
            <li>Fun to use and can experiment since it is temporary.</li>
            <li>This is a fun thing to do for kids or to practice the placement ofa tattoo.  </li>
            <li>My girls and I had a fun time with it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it was worth the money and was a fun activity over the summer.</li>
            <li>Because I swim in a pool daily it starts fading after a week, but honestly when I don&#x27;t swim it lasts longer.</li>
            <li>This stuff was a lot of fun.</li>
            <li>They do worn about this if it is fresh</li>
            <li>and I know what color it should come out when fresh.</li>
            <li>Most henna, or at least good henna lasts anywhere between 3-4 weeks.</li>
            <li>but it is worth it because it comes with everything you need.  </li>
            <li>I was able to get 3 designs out of it so far</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was bummed, but it was still fun.</li>
            <li>worth 3 dollars not fifteen</li>
            <li>This kit is easy to use and includes high quality ingredients.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I would change about this kit would be to make the tip finer, for a more detailed design, because after it dries the design is much more bolder, as u can see in my last pic.</li>
            <li>My wife and I love trying new designs without the permanence of a real tattoo.</li>
            <li>Will not look likea real tattoo but is super fun</li>
            <li>Apparently I slept on my hand at some point because I woke up with the tattoo transferred onto my face:)</li>
            <li>It lasts a while, as long as you don&#x27;t scrub it, and it turns out really nice</li>
            <li>I absolutely  loved  how dark the product  showed up.</li>
            <li>Once I get the hang of using the little bottle with needle to trace my drawing, and learn to squirt it out evenly, I will like it better and better.  </li>
            <li>Even if you lightly put the prduct on and wipe completely away, in a matter of hours the exact design you wiped away appears!</li>
            <li>this is certainly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>This was the longest lasting henna we have ever had which is great if your expecting it to last for 2 weeks before it starts to fade and another 2 weeks before its gone so plan ahead.</li>
            <li>The directions are clear and easy to follow</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, the eucalyptus smells amazing, and the henna goes on nice and dark, and this came less than three days from when I ordered it.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>but the design came out as a very light navy blue, ghost level stuff.</li>
            <li>Luckily it came out easily but all of the power and actual tattoo mix is gone.</li>
            <li>However, most recently I purchased this from Vitamin Answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was discouraged at first when i was peeling it off</li>
            <li>but like the box says WAIT 24HOURS, and sure enough i did</li>
            <li>Also my first test tattoo, it is getting darker by the hour</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I paid for.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Did exactly what it said it would do.</li>
            <li>Would you be interested in sending a sample for my sisters salon?</li>
            <li>As a first timer, I didn&#x27;t know what to expect based on the reviews.</li>
            <li>The set up wasn&#x27;t as simple as it seemed, and it&#x27;s more like a goo that stains your skin than henna</li>
            <li>However, I did get some on my foot and it definitely dyed it:)</li>
            <li>I love it and am on my 2nd package!</li>
            <li>I ordered this for a arts and crafts project during summer school and we were able to make about 15 tattoos and some were pretty big and the kids did make mistakes that they wiped off.</li>
            <li>Love the product last a l</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>At first it seemed to not be staining but after a while it worked</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>my overall experience was ok...</li>
            <li>and I still have enough for probably one more.  </li>
            <li>and she could try them out first before making permanent decisions.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Works really well!</li>
            <li>Currently searching for a new kind of product.</li>
            <li>The formula is kind of thick and doesn&#x27;t squeeze out of the bottle easily.</li>
            <li>A great idea if you&#x27;re looking to get a tattoo but not sure about the placement or size because you can try it out with this!</li>
            <li>such a good product, at first i didnt mix it properly and didnt work as well as it was meant too..</li>
            <li>The color ended up being a greenish blue, i loved it!The box says it last a month</li>
            <li>I was wary of ordering any of the henna online, because I wanted to be sure I was getting a good product-</li>
            <li>Luckily the face and neck are more oily then other parts of the body which is why it faded fast 😅</li>
            <li>I knew there was a chance that it wouldn&#x27;t apply well as i pretty much bought it out of haste.</li>
            <li>What bothered me more about the product is that the instructions are not clear; they include 2 sets of them that vary in the steps and don&#x27;t even explain why the 2 instructions  have differences.</li>
            <li>I will absolutely buy this again, and I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>A nice, dark, blue-black.</li>
            <li>this is the best temporary tatto kit on the market the color is very dark, at first when it dries and than you peel it off you see nothing but within an hour the color starts to really devolop and gets really dark.</li>
            <li>Skin prep is very important, make sure you wash and exfoliate first and use the oil that comes with to open pores.&lt;br /&gt;During the first few days people thought it was a real tattoo.</li>
            <li>Instead of a reddish tint like henna, it&#x27;s kind of a bluish black tint.  </li>
            <li>it preserves fine as long as it is sealed and not in direct light.</li>
            <li>The color develops overnight and is nice and black.  </li>
            <li>The trick is to take your time applying it, try not to be hasty :) The bottle was able to finisih 3 henna designs, and only half of it was used.</li>
            <li>you might think someone got from a back alley tat parlor, but if that is the look you&#x27;re going for it is fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The henna does last 2 weeks, however, after the first week it faded about 1/3 the original darkness.</li>
            <li>As a quick summary, the jagua tattoo is basically like henna, except for this ink is black, giving it a more realistic look.</li>
            <li>So this stuff works pretty decent.</li>
            <li>Not for a little Henna tattoo that you can kind of hide at work.  </li>
            <li>The kit comes with a decently fine tip (not EXTREMELY fine, but finer than I had expected), and it&#x27;s a good consistency.</li>
            <li>It turned into a huge rash that has now SCARRED my back in the pattern of the tattoo.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>This stuff keeps very well in the fridge for months</li>
            <li>Be careful if you order the kit to make sure there&#x27;s no holes.</li>
            <li>For this price I expected more than one application, that&#x27;s why 3 stars.</li>
            <li>The whole thing had to go straight to the trash.</li>
            <li>I created a free hand Mhendhi design on the back of my hand.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping..</li>
            <li>Looks almost like a real tattoo.  </li>
            <li>absolutely su#*s&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>When I put it on everyone thought I had a real tattoo.  </li>
            <li>It held for a while and it looks like a real tattoo.</li>
            <li>That being said, if you plan on wearing this for just one night and having it look like a real tattoo than maybe this is the product for you.</li>
            <li>The henna stays really, really well.</li>
            <li>it looks granular and fades away fast.</li>
            <li>I actually hand drew a design and filled it in, worked well.</li>
            <li>Faded after about a week, then at about 2 weeks was very faded, 2 1/2 weeks gone.</li>
            <li>Highly recommened!</li>
            <li>so it shows up very well on my skin tone</li>
            <li>I knew absolutely nothing about how to do it or what to buy, but I found this kit recommended in a youtube video.  </li>
            <li>Like a real tattoo.  </li>
            <li>no one will really notice.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t much of a fan of it</li>
            <li>immediately after printing, when the ink was still wet from the printer, it provided an okay stencil for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I was very please with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Purchase henna– much easier to work with.</li>
            <li>make it very light.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Vitamin Answer, however, clearly does not care about their customers; They only care about how many kits they can sell.</li>
            <li>A few of my friends have told me that the product works pretty good, I would personally like to try it out first before I purchase the whole kit.</li>
            <li>so I worked as fast as possible to clean it up to avoid staining.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants temporary tattoos that are dark colored and resemble real tattoos the most.</li>
            <li>The jagua worked very well, had a good consistency once mixed and came out very dark.</li>
            <li>and the tattoo is light grey.</li>
            <li>Anyway, for 15-17 dollars (price fluctuated in my cart for some reason), to me, it&#x27;s not worth it; I love temporarily inking my hands</li>
            <li>Mixed it up, drew a sweet design, let it sit, peeled it off, saw practically nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Figured, &amp;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that it gives off the impression of a real tattoo, but it DOES NOT last 2-3 like normal henna does, it lasted only a week for me.</li>
            <li>it looks really nice, but it is very messy</li>
            <li>and I love that it&#x27;s black and not brown like</li>
            <li>This is the second time my 14 year old daughter has purchased this kit and it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I obviously got more than my finger tips, this happened because I applied to my finger tips and decided to put on gloves which smeared it up my hand leaving it in a patchy application above the knuckle.</li>
            <li>The second time my grand daughter put a second one on her leg.  </li>
            <li>would highly recommend</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this kit if you are looking for a semipermanent way to add art to your body.</li>
            <li>highly recommended</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>i would highly recommend it to anyone looking into it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend exfoliating the area you intend to ink a couple of days before to help ink stay put.  </li>
            <li>Super easy to use, however stains REALLY fast so be careful, I got some on my face for 10 seconds and ended up with a huge dark blue patch.</li>
            <li>Just so its clear, this is a powder that has to be mixed, but if you take a few minutes to do it right, its super easy.</li>
            <li>WAIT UNTIL ITS COMPLETELY FADED!!</li>
            <li>I also noticed a spot I had messed up on and completely wiped clean was back and darker than ever.</li>
            <li>Once it is dry, you can remove the application my rubbing it off while dry or running it under warm water and rubbing it off somewhat vigorously with your hand and patting it with a rag.</li>
            <li>When I first rinsed off the henna, it was super light on my skin but after a few hours, it got SUPER dark!</li>
            <li>It squeezed out all over my hand and wasted even more of the product.</li>
            <li>I guess it would hold well if I would get a chance to use it normally.</li>
            <li>and i am genuinely satisfied with this and will definitely buy it again in the near future.</li>
            <li>This is because washing the area frequently or vigorously will make the stain fade much quicker than when washed gently and not as frequent.</li>
            <li>Especially if you fall asleep with a freshly peeled tattoo, it will transfer to your skin.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re using this on a well used part of your body like hands or feet it might wear off quicker than normal.</li>
            <li>Actually lasts a long time and is easy to use, almost like a real tattoo</li>
            <li>Next morning it is easy to wash any left over crust.</li>
            <li>henna ink is easy to mix and turns into a dark blue/black color which lasts about two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I liked this product and the actual tattoos last for a long time.</li>
            <li>I just reordered a new box.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m always into trying new products.</li>
            <li>The color actually turns out black, so it looks 20x&#x27;s more real.</li>
            <li>They give you templates so it&#x27;s easy to apply and it stayed for about a week and a half to two weeks.  </li>
            <li>I have if you&#x27;re not confident in freehanding it is to draw it on the desired area in pen first (lightly); this has never had an adverse effect on my brown henna or this one (even tho</li>
            <li>I use it primarily on my hands and it lasts only about a week, but hands get a lot of wear and tear with washing and dishes and such</li>
            <li>It works very well and stays on a pretty long time.</li>
            <li>I would recommend using a stencil because trying to free hand is way more complicated than you would think.</li>
            <li>Stains quickly and takes foreverrrr to dry.</li>
            <li>There was only one slight problem and it was how it stained very fast and easily.</li>
            <li>Easy and long lasting.</li>
            <li>but overall it did the job pretty well</li>
            <li>I personally  think the trick is to leave it on and let it peel of naturally for the first 24 hours.</li>
            <li>and it made a huge mess all over the floor and my hands.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve used this kit for 3 rounds on one side of my forearm (about 4&amp;#34; x 11&amp;#34;) and I still have nearly 2/3 of a bottle left.</li>
            <li>and yes it takes longer (about 1 to 2 hrs) to dry completely but it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li>After about an hour or so, peel the jagua off and your skin will be clear.</li>
            <li>After the first day, it gets dark and looks like a real tattoo and lasts for about 6 days or so.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>and they are gone completely in about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>This kit provides everything that you need to apply professional looking henna</li>
            <li>My 12 year old wanted henna tatoos like at Ceda Point Amusement park.</li>
            <li>However, theres so much product in here that it&#x27;ll last you</li>
            <li>Also, once your tattoo is on, dried, and removed don&#x27;t be surprise if the tattoo is light.</li>
            <li>I purchased this kit for my 13 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>so people actually thought it was real</li>
            <li>My18year old daughter wanted to see if a temperary tatoo worked,it turned out awesome,and lasts a couple weeks</li>
            <li>I work in a near by saloon</li>
            <li>Definitely stains your skin very well</li>
            <li>I suggest applying them to an area of your body that you will not need to vigorously or frequently wash.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my 11 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my 17 year old granddaughter</li>
            <li>but of course I went to a professional</li>
            <li>When I was finally able to get it back into the bottle, after feeling like I wasted a lot from spills, the cap that they give you for the applicator leaked as I was applying the tattoo.</li>
            <li>This can easily be remedied by using a small ziplock bag.</li>
            <li>But even though I am artistic this really takes practice and I highly recommend that you youtube tricks and tips to using this dye as it spreads out as it oxidizes and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I just puchased another kit although i still have some left, it last for a long time in the refirgerator i have already did 3 designs from the one kit and still have some left for maybe two more.</li>
            <li>It is very different on everyone&#x27;s skin as well, and different parts of the skin are more or less absorbent.</li>
            <li>It ends up really dark like a navy blue if you&#x27;re using it free hand.</li>
            <li>A little surprised how quickly it is used up though.</li>
            <li>The clear bag where you are supposed to mix the ingredients had wholes and resulted in ink spilling all over my table, then the new applicator was clogged and that was the second ink-everywhere accident.</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have at all is that there isn&#x27;t enough eucalyptus oil in the package and we have to use our own.</li>
            <li>It will be VERY light (almost a yellow color initially) when you first wash off the &amp;#34;ink&amp;#34; after letting it dry fully for at least 2-3 hours.</li>
            <li>It was super easy to apply, the tip that was included was perfectly small (no more guessing on where to cut the tip of the bag that some kits have).</li>
            <li>Fun to mess with.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so sad that I won&#x27;t be able to use this again!</li>
            <li>It comes in a really nice black, with dark grey and bluish undertones, after about 18-24 hours (note the instructions do say for some people it may take up to 48 hours to darken fully).</li>
            <li>However, there was a small hole in my mixing bag which allowed for a large mess when mixing the ingredients, and this product stains VERY easily VERY quickly.</li>
            <li>Plus it isnt black, it is dark blue, better than Henna brown, But definatly not Black.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t get a dark pretty color...</li>
            <li>I think I would appreciate it much more if the plastic beg wouldn&#x27;t be broken.</li>
            <li>The ink was easy to make by mixing a few things and although the bottle is tiny, it went a long way.</li>
            <li>It looks like henna looks after a week long except it&#x27;s brand new.</li>
            <li>It is blue, not black.</li>
            <li>It was a hot mess.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a decent amount, as long as you&#x27;re only using it for smaller designs.</li>
            <li>I wanted a safe way to stain my fingertips black, not sure</li>
            <li>It got very dark after the first 24 hours..</li>
            <li>It stores well in the fridge so far, and it goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I free-drew my tattoos they stained perfectly fine and came out dark in the end, but when I use a stencil, they turned out faded and went away within a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but a few hours later it comes up really dark easy to apply a</li>
            <li>I got a small blotch on my fingers and although I was able to wash the gunk off, within a few hours the stain started to appear.</li>
            <li>The best advice is just to go slow and try not to make any mistakes at all because they are nearly impossible to remove.  </li>
            <li>I mixed the whole thing but just use little bits at a time as I needed it.</li>
            <li>I wanted to fade mine after a couple of days to put a fresh one on and was a bit shocked at how light it became after scrubbing with a washcloth.</li>
            <li>it barely did anything, in fact it made it more of an issue to wear liner because I had a faint grey shadow around my eyebrows...</li>

            <li> The fine needle applicator was awesome too.</li>
            <li> everyone loved the design i did and it was like a conversation starter everywhere</li>
            <li> It does take a good 24 hours to darken, but works well.  </li>

            <li> Loved it.  </li>

            <li> Super impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> It was great and it had a lot more henna than I thought.</li>
            <li> All of the items advertised were included and useful for creating the best product.</li>
            <li> I bought for my eyebrow and it is great :)</li>
            <li> The transfers were very easy to use and had some good designs.</li>
            <li> She would love to do this!</li>
            <li> Enjoy!!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, great color and texture.</li>
            <li> The kit works amazingly well.  </li>
            <li> it takes a couple hours to darken but the end result is amazing.</li>
            <li> The jagua itself is nice, the tool used for application sucked.</li>
            <li> The product was nice and dark,deep</li>
            <li> I have used this product many times - always with good results.</li>
            <li> Also use the gloves that come with the kit or get your own.</li>
            <li> It dries, forms a kind of crust.</li>
            <li> and i liked the way it came out.</li>
            <li> The company with the best most consistent product I have found is called FreshJagua dot com.</li>
            <li> LOL I guess my face is just special.</li>
            <li> The applicator was a good size and it was easy to mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Loved reading this book and all of the pictures where nice and detailed with design.</li>
            <li> very easy to put it together and very easy to apply on skin.</li>
            <li> very easy to mixl</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very strong smell when you&#x27;re applying it, but after it dries you can&#x27;t smell anything.</li>
            <li> Love it and for sure will purchase this item again!</li>
            <li> and I loved how my very first attempt came out!</li>
            <li> I own a henna tattoo business and many people are asking about Jagua.</li>
            <li> so i could do lots of good sized and detailed designs.  </li>
            <li> It found that I was able to print my own designs, and if I applied them (using the eucalyptus)</li>
            <li> applicator is very fine point to allow for precision  detail.</li>
            <li> But over all good fun product!</li>
            <li> Pretty great stuff.</li>
            <li> It was kinda chunky at first, but it still worked great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was a great deal for something that lasts as long as it does and I was happy.</li>
            <li> were not to my liking, but it&#x27;s easy to make your own.</li>
            <li> I love the product and have purchased this kit 5 times now.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> got so many compliments on it.  </li>
            <li> Love her</li>
            <li> so I will try to get this item elsewhere for a better price.</li>
            <li> If you make a mistake, make sure you scrub that area well immediately</li>
            <li> She has used it many times and still has plenty of liquid to make many more.  </li>
            <li> from what I could salvage I was still able to use it and it does work well.</li>
            <li> Just dissapointed that most of the product was ruined and ruined my things.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brand because of the free shipping and the &amp;#34;freshness&amp;#34; of mixing my own jagua, but after my frustration I don&#x27;t think I will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Works great but its only good for one medium design.</li>
            <li> I love the eucalyptus oil too.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff</li>
            <li> Just wish it had more tips and more henna powder for the price.</li>
            <li> it arrived in two days :)</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> many uses.</li>
            <li> I used it on my eyebrows as I read many reviewers had...</li>
            <li> Love how it looks on the skin.</li>
            <li> The templates they gave were okay</li>
            <li> it does hold for more that 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I got so many compliments and it lasted for about a week</li>
            <li> I would love to be able to refer my customers to your product if it works well.</li>
            <li> She was able to do intricate art with it.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> One more thing - this is not Henna.</li>
            <li> Looks authentic too.</li>
            <li> Good alternative to a tattoo and a great way to experiment with possible tattoo ideas and placements!</li>
            <li> My daughter has used this kit I bought many times.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Leftover just goes in Refrigerator and able to use again.&lt;br /&gt;Would</li>
            <li> actually better than henna,</li>
            <li> please reply asap :)</li>
            <li> The tattoos lasted up to 10-11 days, with the darkest and most pronounced color on days 3-5 before fading.</li>
            <li> Smaller/thinner lines fade quicker but the thicker, more substantive tattoos lasted the longest.</li>
            <li> More packaging than product.</li>
            <li> It was an okay product.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really wasn&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li> love it and read the directions unlike me and messed it up a bit</li>
            <li> I rate this 3 stars because it did arrive on time, and the amount of product for the cost is definitely worthwhile.</li>
            <li> i absolutely love this product, and so do my customers.</li>
            <li> My 14 yo niece enjoyed using this with her mom....</li>
            <li> and I was extremely  pleased with my results,</li>
            <li> so that made using  the product more appeasing  as well.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> like are you going to provide more or not.</li>
            <li> I am planning to order more when I finish what I have.</li>
            <li> Oh and the smell is quite potent.</li>
            <li> but make sure u wash it well</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it has lasted about a week now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall LOVELY product.</li>
            <li> Does as promised, BETTER than henna for tattoo experimentation.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get this</li>
            <li> And the applicator tip is very fine and makes it easy to make intricate designs.</li>
            <li> It looked really good and many mistaken the tattoo for a real one !</li>
            <li> Worked very well, instructions were easy and looked great for the time it lasted :)</li>
            <li> Love this product is very cool...</li>
            <li> Good price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll also add that I&#x27;m a hairstylist with my hands in water all day so for it to day that long was awesome!</li>
            <li> Loved this product so much!</li>
            <li> it says best results is on clean bare skin).</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to receive this product!</li>
            <li> kind of messy but awesome product</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and clean up  </li>
            <li> Product came early, and in great condition.</li>
            <li> (Or be a wayyy better free hand artist than my boyfriend was)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product I have sensitive skin to some things</li>
            <li> Loved it works we&#x27;ll sipping was fast 👍👍👍</li>
            <li> My whole family tried it and loved it.  </li>
            <li> i honestly didn&#x27;t think this product was worth buying at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s go on easy and</li>
            <li> Easy to mix and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Easy instructions.</li>
            <li> The instructions were easy to read and understand.</li>
            <li> It has easy to follow instructions and the henna lasted a while.  </li>
            <li> It lasted about the two weeks, and was relatively easy to set up.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> The gel is easy to prepare.</li>
            <li> She is very artistic and kept drawing on herself.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting a lot more from this product especially since I read nothing but great reviews</li>
            <li> and once you get the hang of it its easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Comes out  faded and smudges easily.  </li>
            <li> Lol had spots on my hands where it accidentally touched while I was doing it and it totally showed so wear gloves! :-)</li>
            <li> easy to mix and apply.</li>
            <li> It smudges easily.</li>
            <li> If you do decide to purchase this item, I strongly suggest rubber gloves and to use/mix the product on a surface that either can&#x27;t stain, or that you wouldn&#x27;t mind staining.</li>
            <li> Better then real tattoos honestly</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very deep and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I did full hand designs every two weeks:)</li>
            <li> hands down one of the best henna kits I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> follow the directions, and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> Also it says it shows better on darker skin, this is true because my boyfriend is slightly more tan than I am and his came out very clear and nice.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s very easy to get exactly the design you want with the applicator tip they give you.</li>
            <li> It comes exactly as described and is very easy to mis all together.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a great product.</li>
            <li> Overall great product.</li>
            <li> Works great and actually stays on even after swimming and showers  </li>
            <li> The kit was cheap and the tip broke while I was drawing my tattoo.</li>
            <li> It would be great for ancient celt or tribal looking tattoos, like South American tradition tattoo art.</li>
            <li> family fun :)</li>
            <li> it was relatively easy to clean up.</li>
            <li> My only suggestion is that if you make a chest tattoo, like I did, you should put a shirt on at night because I slept on my hand and the tattoo transferred from my chest to my hand - lol.  </li>
            <li> Such a great Christmas gift for an artistically minded person.</li>
            <li> easy clean up of tools.</li>
            <li> Great buying experience, especially around the holidays.</li>
            <li> it may be a bit pricey, but it is worth what you spend for sure.</li>
            <li> I cant get enough of this temporary tattoo ,  its a great product.</li>
            <li> I figured that&#x27;s what I get for buying cheap henna off</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works great and last for a week or two.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s safe which I love, looks like a real tatoo.</li>
            <li> So much fun and super easy to use!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product although a bit messy for over excited teenagers..</li>
            <li> very fun product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, I&#x27;m able to do many &amp;#34;tattoos&amp;#34; many times, they last about 2 weeks</li>
            <li> Super easy to make, and the kit comes with reallly well written instructions.</li>
            <li> Make sure you have a steady hand because this stuff stays on!!</li>
            <li> I love it so much !</li>
            <li> I love this product my first time using it when it peels</li>
            <li> Lots of fun for my daughter!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to start using this.</li>
            <li> great condition instructions were not clear-</li>
            <li> It DOES darken significantly over 24</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well priced and totally worth it!</li>
            <li> but yeah my extra product is frozern now :P i will be ordering another one soon.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not so clean looking.  </li>
            <li> you can clean up mistakes 😄😄</li>
            <li> So it was a great product and worth your money but definitely use a stencil.</li>
            <li> Extremely pigmented, easy to work with, easy intructions, and a good shelf life.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I like tattoos and wanted to get one but didn&#x27;t want the commitment to it, so this is an awesome way to have a tattoo and not have to live with it when you get old, haha.</li>
            <li> You probably could print out your own designs to give yourself more options, unless you are artistic enough to draw it by yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The ink is a blackish-blue instead of the normal brown which was fine by me, I just wished I had purchased a better product.</li>
            <li> Earth Henna really knows their stuff :)</li>
            <li> I loved designing with this type of temporary tattoo, I just wish it came in a bigger bottle</li>
            <li> I prefer to pay more if everything was ready.</li>
            <li> Granted, it does look really cool after you let it set.</li>
            <li> I did expect the result to be a darker color, but overall a good product.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s so light, I could draw all over myself for fun and</li>
            <li> overall it&#x27;s a good product but not a lot of the product and the stencils</li>
            <li> The product itself is not bad.</li>
            <li> pretty easy to use, even for the beginner</li>
            <li> The applicator is pretty easy to use.</li>
            <li> The instructions are pretty easy to follow.</li>
            <li> It works amazing and super easy to use is the second time I got this kit</li>
            <li> The first time it worked fine.  </li>
            <li> I might use this about 3 times, 4 if I&#x27;m lucky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different inks, and this is the best.  </li>
            <li> You definitely need to wear to the gloves and make sure you do it on top of some news paper or towels</li>
            <li> I love this product, but you definitely cannot use it more than once, and it looks faded immediately.</li>
            <li> &amp; I am artistic.</li>
            <li> The product was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> This stuff is okay but is not as realistic as they claim.  </li>
            <li> Ok first things first, this is not henna.</li>
            <li> Really great product if you&#x27;re looking for &amp;#34;black henna&amp;#34; (even though this isn&#x27;t true black henna, which is supposed to be toxic).</li>
            <li> Lasted about ten days, very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> This tattoo kit was overall pretty good.</li>
            <li> The tip got really clogged though so make sure you clean everything really well.</li>
            <li> It is also good to apply to dry skin.</li>
            <li> Works absolutely amazing, easy to mix the solutions, easy to apply and stayed on for almost a week and half!</li>
            <li> practice on paper first!</li>
            <li> This is safe, really looks cool but is very noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Nice black colour:)</li>
            <li> This company sent me a whole sample assortment a while ago for free, guess they were marketing to the Henna Tattoo artists.</li>
            <li> I also experienced some trouble using the stencils.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and the girl who received it has had so much fun with it.  </li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t worth it for me.</li>
            <li> With the defects I had, it&#x27;s not even worth looking into buying anything else from this company.</li>
            <li> Fun to use and can experiment since it is temporary.</li>
            <li> This is a fun thing to do for kids or to practice the placement ofa tattoo.  </li>
            <li> My girls and I had a fun time with it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it was worth the money and was a fun activity over the summer.</li>
            <li> Because I swim in a pool daily it starts fading after a week, but honestly when I don&#x27;t swim it lasts longer.</li>
            <li> This stuff was a lot of fun.</li>
            <li> They do worn about this if it is fresh</li>
            <li> and I know what color it should come out when fresh.</li>
            <li> Most henna, or at least good henna lasts anywhere between 3-4 weeks.</li>
            <li> but it is worth it because it comes with everything you need.  </li>
            <li> I was able to get 3 designs out of it so far</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was bummed, but it was still fun.</li>
            <li> worth 3 dollars not fifteen</li>
            <li> This kit is easy to use and includes high quality ingredients.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I would change about this kit would be to make the tip finer, for a more detailed design, because after it dries the design is much more bolder, as u can see in my last pic.</li>
            <li> My wife and I love trying new designs without the permanence of a real tattoo.</li>
            <li> Will not look likea real tattoo but is super fun</li>
            <li> Apparently I slept on my hand at some point because I woke up with the tattoo transferred onto my face:)</li>
            <li> It lasts a while, as long as you don&#x27;t scrub it, and it turns out really nice</li>
            <li> I absolutely  loved  how dark the product  showed up.</li>
            <li> Once I get the hang of using the little bottle with needle to trace my drawing, and learn to squirt it out evenly, I will like it better and better.  </li>
            <li> Even if you lightly put the prduct on and wipe completely away, in a matter of hours the exact design you wiped away appears!</li>
            <li> this is certainly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> This was the longest lasting henna we have ever had which is great if your expecting it to last for 2 weeks before it starts to fade and another 2 weeks before its gone so plan ahead.</li>
            <li> The directions are clear and easy to follow</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, the eucalyptus smells amazing, and the henna goes on nice and dark, and this came less than three days from when I ordered it.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> but the design came out as a very light navy blue, ghost level stuff.</li>
            <li> Luckily it came out easily but all of the power and actual tattoo mix is gone.</li>
            <li> However, most recently I purchased this from Vitamin Answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was discouraged at first when i was peeling it off</li>
            <li> but like the box says WAIT 24HOURS, and sure enough i did</li>
            <li> Also my first test tattoo, it is getting darker by the hour</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I paid for.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Did exactly what it said it would do.</li>
            <li> Would you be interested in sending a sample for my sisters salon?</li>
            <li> As a first timer, I didn&#x27;t know what to expect based on the reviews.</li>
            <li> The set up wasn&#x27;t as simple as it seemed, and it&#x27;s more like a goo that stains your skin than henna</li>
            <li> However, I did get some on my foot and it definitely dyed it:)</li>
            <li> I love it and am on my 2nd package!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for a arts and crafts project during summer school and we were able to make about 15 tattoos and some were pretty big and the kids did make mistakes that they wiped off.</li>
            <li> Love the product last a l</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> At first it seemed to not be staining but after a while it worked</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> my overall experience was ok...</li>
            <li> and I still have enough for probably one more.  </li>
            <li> and she could try them out first before making permanent decisions.  </li>
            <li> It is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Works really well!</li>
            <li> Currently searching for a new kind of product.</li>
            <li> The formula is kind of thick and doesn&#x27;t squeeze out of the bottle easily.</li>
            <li> A great idea if you&#x27;re looking to get a tattoo but not sure about the placement or size because you can try it out with this!</li>
            <li> such a good product, at first i didnt mix it properly and didnt work as well as it was meant too..</li>
            <li> The color ended up being a greenish blue, i loved it!The box says it last a month</li>
            <li> I was wary of ordering any of the henna online, because I wanted to be sure I was getting a good product-</li>
            <li> Luckily the face and neck are more oily then other parts of the body which is why it faded fast 😅</li>
            <li> I knew there was a chance that it wouldn&#x27;t apply well as i pretty much bought it out of haste.</li>
            <li> What bothered me more about the product is that the instructions are not clear; they include 2 sets of them that vary in the steps and don&#x27;t even explain why the 2 instructions  have differences.</li>
            <li> I will absolutely buy this again, and I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> A nice, dark, blue-black.</li>
            <li> this is the best temporary tatto kit on the market the color is very dark, at first when it dries and than you peel it off you see nothing but within an hour the color starts to really devolop and gets really dark.</li>
            <li> Skin prep is very important, make sure you wash and exfoliate first and use the oil that comes with to open pores.&lt;br /&gt;During the first few days people thought it was a real tattoo.</li>
            <li> Instead of a reddish tint like henna, it&#x27;s kind of a bluish black tint.  </li>
            <li> it preserves fine as long as it is sealed and not in direct light.</li>
            <li> The color develops overnight and is nice and black.  </li>
            <li> The trick is to take your time applying it, try not to be hasty :) The bottle was able to finisih 3 henna designs, and only half of it was used.</li>
            <li> you might think someone got from a back alley tat parlor, but if that is the look you&#x27;re going for it is fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The henna does last 2 weeks, however, after the first week it faded about 1/3 the original darkness.</li>
            <li> As a quick summary, the jagua tattoo is basically like henna, except for this ink is black, giving it a more realistic look.</li>
            <li> So this stuff works pretty decent.</li>
            <li> Not for a little Henna tattoo that you can kind of hide at work.  </li>
            <li> The kit comes with a decently fine tip (not EXTREMELY fine, but finer than I had expected), and it&#x27;s a good consistency.</li>
            <li> It turned into a huge rash that has now SCARRED my back in the pattern of the tattoo.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> This stuff keeps very well in the fridge for months</li>
            <li> Be careful if you order the kit to make sure there&#x27;s no holes.</li>
            <li> For this price I expected more than one application, that&#x27;s why 3 stars.</li>
            <li> The whole thing had to go straight to the trash.</li>
            <li> I created a free hand Mhendhi design on the back of my hand.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping..</li>
            <li> Looks almost like a real tattoo.  </li>
            <li> absolutely su#*s&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> When I put it on everyone thought I had a real tattoo.  </li>
            <li> It held for a while and it looks like a real tattoo.</li>
            <li> That being said, if you plan on wearing this for just one night and having it look like a real tattoo than maybe this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> The henna stays really, really well.</li>
            <li> it looks granular and fades away fast.</li>
            <li> I actually hand drew a design and filled it in, worked well.</li>
            <li> Faded after about a week, then at about 2 weeks was very faded, 2 1/2 weeks gone.</li>
            <li> Highly recommened!</li>
            <li> so it shows up very well on my skin tone</li>
            <li> I knew absolutely nothing about how to do it or what to buy, but I found this kit recommended in a youtube video.  </li>
            <li> Like a real tattoo.  </li>
            <li> no one will really notice.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t much of a fan of it</li>
            <li> immediately after printing, when the ink was still wet from the printer, it provided an okay stencil for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I was very please with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Purchase henna– much easier to work with.</li>
            <li> make it very light.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Vitamin Answer, however, clearly does not care about their customers; They only care about how many kits they can sell.</li>
            <li> A few of my friends have told me that the product works pretty good, I would personally like to try it out first before I purchase the whole kit.</li>
            <li> so I worked as fast as possible to clean it up to avoid staining.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants temporary tattoos that are dark colored and resemble real tattoos the most.</li>
            <li> The jagua worked very well, had a good consistency once mixed and came out very dark.</li>
            <li> and the tattoo is light grey.</li>
            <li> Anyway, for 15-17 dollars (price fluctuated in my cart for some reason), to me, it&#x27;s not worth it; I love temporarily inking my hands</li>
            <li> Mixed it up, drew a sweet design, let it sit, peeled it off, saw practically nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Figured, &amp;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that it gives off the impression of a real tattoo, but it DOES NOT last 2-3 like normal henna does, it lasted only a week for me.</li>
            <li> it looks really nice, but it is very messy</li>
            <li> and I love that it&#x27;s black and not brown like</li>
            <li> This is the second time my 14 year old daughter has purchased this kit and it is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I obviously got more than my finger tips, this happened because I applied to my finger tips and decided to put on gloves which smeared it up my hand leaving it in a patchy application above the knuckle.</li>
            <li> The second time my grand daughter put a second one on her leg.  </li>
            <li> would highly recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this kit if you are looking for a semipermanent way to add art to your body.</li>
            <li> highly recommended</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> i would highly recommend it to anyone looking into it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend exfoliating the area you intend to ink a couple of days before to help ink stay put.  </li>
            <li> Super easy to use, however stains REALLY fast so be careful, I got some on my face for 10 seconds and ended up with a huge dark blue patch.</li>
            <li> Just so its clear, this is a powder that has to be mixed, but if you take a few minutes to do it right, its super easy.</li>
            <li> WAIT UNTIL ITS COMPLETELY FADED!!</li>
            <li> I also noticed a spot I had messed up on and completely wiped clean was back and darker than ever.</li>
            <li> Once it is dry, you can remove the application my rubbing it off while dry or running it under warm water and rubbing it off somewhat vigorously with your hand and patting it with a rag.</li>
            <li> When I first rinsed off the henna, it was super light on my skin but after a few hours, it got SUPER dark!</li>
            <li> It squeezed out all over my hand and wasted even more of the product.</li>
            <li> I guess it would hold well if I would get a chance to use it normally.</li>
            <li> and i am genuinely satisfied with this and will definitely buy it again in the near future.</li>
            <li> This is because washing the area frequently or vigorously will make the stain fade much quicker than when washed gently and not as frequent.</li>
            <li> Especially if you fall asleep with a freshly peeled tattoo, it will transfer to your skin.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re using this on a well used part of your body like hands or feet it might wear off quicker than normal.</li>
            <li> Actually lasts a long time and is easy to use, almost like a real tattoo</li>
            <li> Next morning it is easy to wash any left over crust.</li>
            <li> henna ink is easy to mix and turns into a dark blue/black color which lasts about two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I liked this product and the actual tattoos last for a long time.</li>
            <li> I just reordered a new box.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m always into trying new products.</li>
            <li> The color actually turns out black, so it looks 20x&#x27;s more real.</li>
            <li> They give you templates so it&#x27;s easy to apply and it stayed for about a week and a half to two weeks.  </li>
            <li> I have if you&#x27;re not confident in freehanding it is to draw it on the desired area in pen first (lightly); this has never had an adverse effect on my brown henna or this one (even tho</li>
            <li> I use it primarily on my hands and it lasts only about a week, but hands get a lot of wear and tear with washing and dishes and such</li>
            <li> It works very well and stays on a pretty long time.</li>
            <li> I would recommend using a stencil because trying to free hand is way more complicated than you would think.</li>
            <li> Stains quickly and takes foreverrrr to dry.</li>
            <li> There was only one slight problem and it was how it stained very fast and easily.</li>
            <li> Easy and long lasting.</li>
            <li> but overall it did the job pretty well</li>
            <li> I personally  think the trick is to leave it on and let it peel of naturally for the first 24 hours.</li>
            <li> and it made a huge mess all over the floor and my hands.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve used this kit for 3 rounds on one side of my forearm (about 4&amp;#34; x 11&amp;#34;) and I still have nearly 2/3 of a bottle left.</li>
            <li> and yes it takes longer (about 1 to 2 hrs) to dry completely but it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> After about an hour or so, peel the jagua off and your skin will be clear.</li>
            <li> After the first day, it gets dark and looks like a real tattoo and lasts for about 6 days or so.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> and they are gone completely in about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> This kit provides everything that you need to apply professional looking henna</li>
            <li> My 12 year old wanted henna tatoos like at Ceda Point Amusement park.</li>
            <li> However, theres so much product in here that it&#x27;ll last you</li>
            <li> Also, once your tattoo is on, dried, and removed don&#x27;t be surprise if the tattoo is light.</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit for my 13 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> so people actually thought it was real</li>
            <li> My18year old daughter wanted to see if a temperary tatoo worked,it turned out awesome,and lasts a couple weeks</li>
            <li> I work in a near by saloon</li>
            <li> Definitely stains your skin very well</li>
            <li> I suggest applying them to an area of your body that you will not need to vigorously or frequently wash.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my 11 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my 17 year old granddaughter</li>
            <li> but of course I went to a professional</li>
            <li> When I was finally able to get it back into the bottle, after feeling like I wasted a lot from spills, the cap that they give you for the applicator leaked as I was applying the tattoo.</li>
            <li> This can easily be remedied by using a small ziplock bag.</li>
            <li> But even though I am artistic this really takes practice and I highly recommend that you youtube tricks and tips to using this dye as it spreads out as it oxidizes and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I just puchased another kit although i still have some left, it last for a long time in the refirgerator i have already did 3 designs from the one kit and still have some left for maybe two more.</li>
            <li> It is very different on everyone&#x27;s skin as well, and different parts of the skin are more or less absorbent.</li>
            <li> It ends up really dark like a navy blue if you&#x27;re using it free hand.</li>
            <li> A little surprised how quickly it is used up though.</li>
            <li> The clear bag where you are supposed to mix the ingredients had wholes and resulted in ink spilling all over my table, then the new applicator was clogged and that was the second ink-everywhere accident.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have at all is that there isn&#x27;t enough eucalyptus oil in the package and we have to use our own.</li>
            <li> It will be VERY light (almost a yellow color initially) when you first wash off the &amp;#34;ink&amp;#34; after letting it dry fully for at least 2-3 hours.</li>
            <li> It was super easy to apply, the tip that was included was perfectly small (no more guessing on where to cut the tip of the bag that some kits have).</li>
            <li> Fun to mess with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sad that I won&#x27;t be able to use this again!</li>
            <li> It comes in a really nice black, with dark grey and bluish undertones, after about 18-24 hours (note the instructions do say for some people it may take up to 48 hours to darken fully).</li>
            <li> However, there was a small hole in my mixing bag which allowed for a large mess when mixing the ingredients, and this product stains VERY easily VERY quickly.</li>
            <li> Plus it isnt black, it is dark blue, better than Henna brown, But definatly not Black.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t get a dark pretty color...</li>
            <li> I think I would appreciate it much more if the plastic beg wouldn&#x27;t be broken.</li>
            <li> The ink was easy to make by mixing a few things and although the bottle is tiny, it went a long way.</li>
            <li> It looks like henna looks after a week long except it&#x27;s brand new.</li>
            <li> It is blue, not black.</li>
            <li> It was a hot mess.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a decent amount, as long as you&#x27;re only using it for smaller designs.</li>
            <li> I wanted a safe way to stain my fingertips black, not sure</li>
            <li> It got very dark after the first 24 hours..</li>
            <li> It stores well in the fridge so far, and it goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I free-drew my tattoos they stained perfectly fine and came out dark in the end, but when I use a stencil, they turned out faded and went away within a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but a few hours later it comes up really dark easy to apply a</li>
            <li> I got a small blotch on my fingers and although I was able to wash the gunk off, within a few hours the stain started to appear.</li>
            <li> The best advice is just to go slow and try not to make any mistakes at all because they are nearly impossible to remove.  </li>
            <li> I mixed the whole thing but just use little bits at a time as I needed it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to fade mine after a couple of days to put a fresh one on and was a bit shocked at how light it became after scrubbing with a washcloth.</li>
            <li> it barely did anything, in fact it made it more of an issue to wear liner because I had a faint grey shadow around my eyebrows...</li>
            <li> But this stuff really did turn black (bluish when it fades) and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The price is a little high</li>
            <li> We watched a whole movie (1hr 56min long) while it dried.</li>
            <li> You have to rinse it off and it will look completely faded, by the next day it will look dark.  </li>
            <li> The color fade to blue, and doesn&#x27;t exactly last as long as I was wanting, but it worked.</li>
            <li> I ordered the tattoo kit, and when I received it, the main part of the &#x27;solution&#x27; for the tattoo was missing, I would not recommend a product that is shipped incomplete.</li>
            <li> Not too messy and decent quality.</li>
            <li> I re-applied the henna and it completely renewed the dark color, so it was no problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got a reaction on my skin to the product, but the reaction did not become apparent until later in the week, not right away.</li>
            <li> Black henna is natural henna with dyes added.</li>
            <li> I wore shoes 6 hours later and the ink smudged and now I have giant blotches of dark blue stain all over my foot.</li>
            <li> so now onto why I only gave it 3 stars first of all they give you so little, like a tiny amount one small bottle worth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like that the plastic bag had a tear, made the mixture a huge mess everywhere, but as for it leaving the design, it fades a little faster than henna and takes a little longer to dry.</li>
            <li> And they are right when they say it lasts for at least a week!  </li>
            <li> It stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li> An ounce actually makes quite a few tattoos, enough to cover an entire arm</li>
            <li> so strange.</li>
            <li> Lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> 2oz goes a long way</li>
            <li> Its a bit lighter of a color than I expected, kindof like a pen blue color.</li>
            <li> Be careful it is very messy and really stains.</li>
            <li> It does take a long time to dry but it lasts and lasts.</li>
            <li> The chunkiness makes the henna come out faster sometimes, so it might mess up your design if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> Storage lasts a long time too!</li>
            <li> On other parts of the body it can last 3 weeks, but it will be faded over 50% by week three.</li>
            <li> I have used other jagua  product and did not have the same problem with them.</li>
            <li> In fact if you don&#x27;t wash off the henna quickly/well enough, your mistakes will show up, so be careful!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying this for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I would probably write a better review if I didn&#x27;t have such a bad experience with it.  </li>
            <li> Too much to do and wait to get everything ready is crazy.</li>
            <li> after the design has been applied and waited the time to have it dry (</li>
            <li> and you have to wait until it is completely dry.</li>
            <li> Once you apply it, it should take about 20-45 mins to dry depending on the thickness of your application.</li>
            <li> It takes awhile to dry</li>
            <li> wait for it to dry.  </li>
            <li> It takes longer to dry, and stains the HELL out of everything.</li>
            <li> There is no such thing as natural black henna, because henna is a plant that is green.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very black and looks a little too intense.</li>
            <li> Ink is dark and looks like an old black paint tattoo.</li>
            <li> When it started peeling off, I was shocked to see a very faded light green looking stain.</li>
            <li> It is now a dark blue color.</li>
            <li> It was pretty easy to use the applicator bottle due to its thin needle-like tube, just be careful with very thin lines.</li>
            <li> I left the dye on overnight before wiping it off and the design stayed dark black for over a week before starting to fade.</li>
            <li> dries almost black and i am african ameican</li>
            <li> The needle is to thick to make small designs and the ink absorbed a lot into the skin which distorded the design.</li>
            <li> Just put it on today, So i will update on how long it lasted and if there was any other problems.</li>
            <li> Messy, doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I have never seen black henna and have been told it was dangerous, but I read on the box it is completely safe.  </li>
            <li> no matter how little time you left it</li>
            <li> little did i know when i received it i had to prepare the mixture myself and the amount of jagua given wasn&#x27;t even sufficient enough.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a before and after picture (before is when it&#x27;s still a little wet, after is two hours later).</li>
            <li> tattoo is a very dark blue.</li>
            <li> Be careful when using this.</li>
            <li> No mark will be left whatsoever, but after a few hours it starts to show up again where you put it.</li>
            <li> I carefully drew my design and removed any mistakes along the way to ensure they wouldn&#x27;t stain (they didn&#x27;t, thank god)</li>
            <li> Oh and also, the tattoo can still bleed after that so BE CAREFUL .  </li>
            <li> so I think that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> was not really what I expected</li>
            <li> You must be careful where you place the ink because it starts staining the skin quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> Its just what i expected.</li>
            <li> It got to me soon than expected</li>
            <li> The product itself stains everything on your body unless you&#x27;re really careful to wash it off.</li>
            <li> I know that comes with being careful about using the product.</li>
            <li> Stains even darker than I expected so be careful of smudges.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s to be expected.  </li>
            <li> Regrets.</li>
            <li> For one there is barely enough for one henna tattoo and two it didn&#x27;t even stay on my skin after I cleaned it and three please don&#x27;t waste your money on this you will regret it....</li>
            <li> Making the whole thing look so sloppy.</li>
            <li> If you go over the same tattoo a couple of times it is a little darker, but it&#x27;s definitely not worth the money I paid.  </li>
            <li> Just let it develop and try not to rest the developing area on other skin as it can transfer (I did mine at night, washed it off before going to bed, and woke up with it about halfway through the darkening process -</li>
            <li> I usually use the regular henna in the tubes.</li>
            <li> This product should be used with extreme caution.</li>
            <li> The ink never really got that dark, Not like pictured.</li>
            <li> (Be careful when applying though because wherever it touches it WILL dye!</li>
            <li> I liked it, but was very disappointed that I only got two uses out of it before the applicator started leaking.  </li>
            <li> but 12 hours later it was a very dark green and JUST what I had expected!</li>
            <li> You have to mix this stuff carefully, they don&#x27;t give you much, the designs are useless (to me), and it&#x27;s time consuming to prepare.</li>
            <li> I got this for a friend, she loves henna, so I thought that this would be something different since it is black and not the red-orange color you usually get with henna.</li>
            <li> My &amp;#34;tattoos&amp;#34; got to the expected dark black color within 12 hours and lasted 2 weeks before fading.</li>
            <li> The product was easy to use however, immediately after I applied my tattoo, I felt sick and began vomiting.</li>
            <li> I was a little sad when I first applied it ,it sort of peeled off and nothing was on the skin ....</li>
            <li> It was hard to do it by myself on my foot, and I will look for someone to help me with it the next time.  </li>
            <li> I did have go look up some more instructions online for the setup, but maybe thats just because I&#x27;m stupid</li>
            <li> Not worth the money I paid.</li>
            <li> and it showed up really dark.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pre-mixed and has enough for at least 5 uses.</li>
            <li> so just this small kit goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really hoping the splatters come off my chest, neck and arms sooner than 10 days, all my scrubbing seems useless.</li>
            <li> Not only did the mixture go to waste, but the spillage stained past the newspaper I laid out since it started spilling profusely.</li>
            <li> Leaves a dark purple stain, stronger an darker than Henna.  </li>
            <li> Well it was not worth it.</li>
            <li> Not worth my money.</li>
            <li> After it is dry we cover the dried part with plastic wrap so the little pieces don&#x27;t flake off on the bed.</li>
            <li> Applying is the hard part, I made a big mess all over.</li>
            <li> I washed my hands and wiped them down with vinegar to remove any excess oil.</li>
            <li> Oh and be careful with your mistakes!!</li>
            <li> Also be very careful and go slow as you apply it because it only takes a few seconds of contact for the henna to hold.</li>
            <li> I might purchase again after experimenting with a few other ways of staining.</li>
            <li> Starts out as a faint blue mark and later gets really dark.  </li>
            <li> You have to be very careful after applying the henna because once it messes up it will stay that way once it&#x27;s dried.</li>
            <li> Black henna, with 2 pages of stencils.</li>
            <li> As a previous buyer stated the bag has a tear in it which causes the henna to spill out so BEWEAR.</li>
            <li> If you get this, wear gloves while doing it because I didn&#x27;t and almost went into a job interview with bluish black</li>
            <li> It dries black</li>
            <li> the black would not order again.</li>
            <li> black all over my face for a while.</li>
            <li> It is black paint.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look any less pigmented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I knew that henna would be a mess</li>
            <li> I made a mess and got it all over my hands so consider gloves when using this product.</li>
            <li> nothing small and precise enough so essentially, this was a terrible experience and a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I usually have a hard time with &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; tattoo stuff like henna, because I have a very deep tan (I am Hispanic).</li>
            <li> but I give it three stars because there is so little to work with.</li>
            <li> where I had a medium sized tattoo) started to become a little bumpy and itchy.</li>
            <li> The little triangle bag came with little holes at the bottom</li>
            <li> I got a little on my fingers and they were dark purple for 2 weeks!  </li>
            <li> The little bag that you&#x27;re supposed to mix the powder and gel in HAD A HOLE IN IT</li>
            <li> it takes it off a little bit at a time.</li>
            <li> I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t be very dark, but it&#x27;s GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL!!!</li>
            <li> but I had trouble peeling the gel off</li>
            <li> The mixing cone had quite a few holes in it which of course I didn&#x27;t find out until after I dumped everything in it.</li>
            <li> There is prepping required, and not all of the items listed on the box came (gloves were missing, but no biggie.</li>
            <li> Even after you wipe, in a few hours that smudge will be there.</li>
            <li> I received my kit opened and missing the gel and the stencils</li>
            <li> It became worse through the day and by that night the entire tattoo was like the damn rocky mountains, and itchy as hell.</li>
            <li> Just a few applications.</li>
            <li> It will darken up after a few hour.</li>
            <li> I was looking like Mike Tyson for a few days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It lasted for a while (a few weeks), but if you wanna get it off, it takes a lot of elbow grease.</li>
            <li> After an hour it dried.</li>
            <li> maybe I was just heavy handed</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> but it had been washed and dried for hours.  </li>
            <li> The kit is messy and the solution is watery.</li>
            <li> It lasted a few months</li>
            <li> Therefore it was a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Very messy and dark.</li>
            <li> The ink does stay a long time and it was very hard to take it off.</li>
            <li> Not easy to use</li>
            <li> At this point it will look like it&#x27;s just a faint greenish tint to your skin, barely noticeable, but within a few hours it will start to rapidly darken.ag.</li>
            <li> At this point it will look like it&#x27;s just a faint greenish tint to your skin, barely noticeable, but within a few hours it will start to rapidly darken.</li>
            <li> These were a little disappointing and did not apply onto the skin that well, but worked enough to get a rough design.</li>
            <li> Only thing bad about it is that it stains ANY part of your skin it touches even if it&#x27;s just for a second.</li>
            <li> Very little product.  </li>
            <li> Small bottle.</li>
            <li> Hope it will fade but not really sure it will</li>
            <li> It lasted way longer than your usual red/brown henna.</li>
            <li> I usually put it on my wife at night.</li>
            <li> The mix was like mixing Oil and water, the ink and the gel weren&#x27;t mixing together at all, it felt like I was applying Vaseline and Vicks on my skin :/</li>
            <li> The simple tools they provide to prepare the mix utterly failed on me.</li>
            <li> Came with some templates, the usual tribal stuff, a butterfly, spider and so on.</li>
            <li> the set up process in general was ridiculous and by the time i got to set everything up in the baggie to begin use in the dispenser , the black coloring leaked everywhere and didn&#x27;t mix properly with the gel base after vigorous mixing.</li>
            <li> Not as I ex very messy</li>
            <li> The dye for me was not easy to get off, of course!</li>
            <li> The ink was in a small portion, almost impossible to make clear lines.</li>
            <li> Makes it hard to create a henna tattoo.</li>
            <li> the tip needs to be thinner because it&#x27;s hard to get the detail drawn.</li>
            <li> Nope, you get these little dinky stencils that are way too thin for you to even try to trace with the Henna.</li>
            <li> They refused rudely, saying that I NEEDED a picture.</li>
            <li> Would you have let ink sit on your countertop so that you could &amp;#34;prove&amp;#34; to a rude company that it was faulty?</li>
            <li> This henna is confusing.</li>
            <li> Not too runny or thick</li>
            <li> I read all the poor ratings and they all did not read the instructions or wait until it dried.</li>
            <li> but I had slept with the new/developing design pressed up against other skin and there was some faint transfer from that which won&#x27;t just wash away).</li>
            <li> but a little cheesy.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed just because to me it looks like I just used a marker, It also is not very dark.</li>
            <li> The only thing that kinda irked me (but not too badly) was trying to mix all the stuff together.</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t as bad as I initially thought.</li>
            <li> Really bad my heena tattoo came out blue instead of</li>
            <li> It will look ugly if you smudge and the tube where the product comes out is to big for me</li>
            <li> CHECK THE LITTLE BAG FOR A HOLE BEFORE YOU PUT ANYTHING IN IT!!!</li>
            <li> Ugh wish I could get my money back :(</li>
            <li> You may still see it in 3 weeks, but it starts looking terrible within the first week of application.</li>
            <li> The stain is VERY DARK AND STAYS!!!</li>
            <li> I drew all over myself and peeled it off to see only VERY faint faint blue/black remnants.</li>
            <li> Crappy quality, the bag that comes in the kit for mixing the gel and the ink was broken and spilled all over the place and</li>
            <li> That was really frustrating.</li>
            <li> i always get it confused as tattoos</li>
            <li> This stuff looks drawn on with a sharpie marker and it is impossible to take off, dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> A terrible product, sorry potential buyers... :/</li>
            <li> It smelled really bad, I feel like I just wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Poor quality henna and difficult to use.</li>
            <li> My $$$ totally wasted!!!!</li>
            <li> every time I buy the expensive one it doesn&#x27;t meet my standards.</li>
            <li> and I thought I did it wrong</li>
            <li> even if it appears faintly.</li>
            <li> You put oil on your arm, press on the template, it leaves a faint image of the design</li>
            <li> Not that dangerous &amp;#34;black henna&amp;#34; stuff.  </li>
            <li> I ended up rocking a horrible disaster for a few days...</li>
            <li> Plain awful</li>
            <li> At this point the henna was very faint</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t fade too bad.</li>
            <li> It is actually an ugly turquoise color &amp; spreads out as it dries which ruined my design.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use it if you&#x27;re prone to feeling sick when you smell fumes.</li>
            <li> ; which is what this may be, often contains a very dangerous chemical called Para-Phenylenediamine (Pare-a fee-null dye-a-mean) that can cause scarring and painful rashes.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> So disappointed with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This stuff is crazy!  </li>
            <li> So I went to bed disappointed</li>
            <li> This was not the case for me, as it took wayyy longer than two hours to appear, but I am disappointed that it didn&#x27;t mention this on the box</li>
            <li> …..so stupid.</li>
            <li> It itches and its soooo annoying but now that the tattoo is fading, the rash is as well.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how bad it looked!</li>
            <li> VERY disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Awful.</li>
            <li> However, everything they gave me to mix in was awful.</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible.</li>
            <li> It was awful.</li>
            <li> Terrible product.</li>
            <li> This product was horrible and didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love the product and have purchased this kit 5 times now. However, most recently I purchased this from Vitamin Answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT PURCHASE FROM VITAMIN ANSWER&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mixing cone I received had a hole, which resulted in Jagua ink spilling/staining ALL OVER my countertop and hands! Obviously, I wasn&#x27;t going to let the stain set so I worked as fast as possible to clean it up to avoid staining. Then, I contacted them to explain the situation and ask for a replacement. They refused rudely, saying that I NEEDED a picture. They sell Jagua ink, so they should understand that it is a pigmented liquid consistency that stains everything it touches. Would you have let ink sit on your countertop so that you could &amp;#34;prove&amp;#34; to a rude company that it was faulty? Probably not. This problem has occured once before with a different seller, and after explaining the situation, they promptly send me another one. No problem. Vitamin Answer, however, clearly does not care about their customers; They only care about how many kits they can sell.</li>
            <li> Very good product, you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> The ink was in a small portion, almost impossible to make clear lines. Not worth the money I paid. This product should only be 10$ max. Awful. Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT. got so many compliments on it.  I was discouraged at first when i was peeling it off but like the box says WAIT 24HOURS, and sure enough i did and it showed up really dark. everyone loved the design i did and it was like a conversation starter everywhere i went. I just reordered a new box. I will keep repurchasing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s go on easy and it&#x27;s safe which I love, looks like a real tatoo. I YouTubed how to put it on if course Chrissy from YouTube recommended it. Love her</li>
            <li> I do like this item but I give it three stars because there is so little to work with. I get 2 dollar reg. brown henna from my local store and it&#x27;s pre-mixed and has enough for at least 5 uses. I might use this about 3 times, 4 if I&#x27;m lucky. You have to mix this stuff carefully, they don&#x27;t give you much, the designs are useless (to me), and it&#x27;s time consuming to prepare. One tip I have if you&#x27;re not confident in freehanding it is to draw it on the desired area in pen first (lightly); this has never had an adverse effect on my brown henna or this one (even tho it says best results is on clean bare skin). Anyway, for 15-17 dollars (price fluctuated in my cart for some reason), to me, it&#x27;s not worth it; I love temporarily inking my hands so I will try to get this item elsewhere for a better price.</li>
            <li> Really great product if you&#x27;re looking for &amp;#34;black henna&amp;#34; (even though this isn&#x27;t true black henna, which is supposed to be toxic). It comes in a really nice black, with dark grey and bluish undertones, after about 18-24 hours (note the instructions do say for some people it may take up to 48 hours to darken fully). It will be VERY light (almost a yellow color initially) when you first wash off the &amp;#34;ink&amp;#34; after letting it dry fully for at least 2-3 hours. Just let it develop and try not to rest the developing area on other skin as it can transfer (I did mine at night, washed it off before going to bed, and woke up with it about halfway through the darkening process - but I had slept with the new/developing design pressed up against other skin and there was some faint transfer from that which won&#x27;t just wash away). Also be very careful and go slow as you apply it because it only takes a few seconds of contact for the henna to hold. If you make a mistake, make sure you scrub that area well immediately or you will likely have all of your mistakes show up a day later once it&#x27;s all darkened. The best advice is just to go slow and try not to make any mistakes at all because they are nearly impossible to remove.  My designs have been lasting about 2 weeks before they fade and they are gone completely in about 3 weeks. So far, I&#x27;ve used this kit for 3 rounds on one side of my forearm (about 4&amp;#34; x 11&amp;#34;) and I still have nearly 2/3 of a bottle left. This stuff keeps very well in the fridge for months so just this small kit goes a LONG way. Definitely worth the money!!</li>
            <li> This was a gift and the girl who received it has had so much fun with it.  She has used it many times and still has plenty of liquid to make many more.  Would definitely recommend and buy again,</li>
            <li> It stays on for a long time. I was disappointed just because to me it looks like I just used a marker, It also is not very dark.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different inks, and this is the best.  Instead of a reddish tint like henna, it&#x27;s kind of a bluish black tint.  It does take a good 24 hours to darken, but works well.  Last about two weeks.</li>
            <li> Amazing!!! Love it and for sure will purchase this item again! Easy to mix and easy to apply. Nice black colour:)</li>
            <li> Great delivery,  as advertised.</li>
            <li> Loved reading this book and all of the pictures where nice and detailed with design. Very good read.</li>
            <li> it says you get stencils but it doesnt say which ones, you expect to atleast get what they show in the picture. Nope, you get these little dinky stencils that are way too thin for you to even try to trace with the Henna. Plus it isnt black, it is dark blue, better than Henna brown, But definatly not Black. Just put it on today, So i will update on how long it lasted and if there was any other problems. for now 2 stars</li>
            <li> I was a little sad when I first applied it ,it sort of peeled off and nothing was on the skin ....until the next day ! It looked really good and many mistaken the tattoo for a real one !</li>
            <li> Really great effect on body I deff recommend.</li>
            <li> If this is henna as the description says, notice how on the box it says &amp;#34;henna&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I want to warn you that &amp;#34;Black Henna&amp;#34; which is what this may be, often contains a very dangerous chemical called Para-Phenylenediamine (Pare-a fee-null dye-a-mean) that can cause scarring and painful rashes. Just a warning. There is no such thing as natural black henna, because henna is a plant that is green. Black henna is natural henna with dyes added.</li>
            <li> The gel is a perfect consistency! Not too runny or thick so it&#x27;s very easy to get exactly the design you want with the applicator tip they give you. A great idea if you&#x27;re looking to get a tattoo but not sure about the placement or size because you can try it out with this! The price is great for all of the stuff it comes with! Earth Henna really knows their stuff :)</li>
            <li> Is it possible to sample this product? I&#x27;ve wanted a good henna kit but every time I buy the expensive one it doesn&#x27;t meet my standards. Will definitely buy if standards are met</li>
            <li> This tattoo kit was overall pretty good. very easy to put it together and very easy to apply on skin. I loved how it included stencils to trace over. There was only one slight problem and it was how it stained very fast and easily. Overall this is a great product.</li>
            <li> Unknowingly to me there was a hole in my plastic cone that contains the gel inside so when I was doing the step where you had to massage everything in the cone the henna dye went everywhere and stained everything. Be careful if you order the kit to make sure there&#x27;s no holes. from what I could salvage I was still able to use it and it does work well. Just dissapointed that most of the product was ruined and ruined my things.</li>
            <li> It lasts longer than henna and alot darker. Be careful it is very messy and really stains. But over all good fun product!</li>
            <li> I would probably write a better review if I didn&#x27;t have such a bad experience with it.  The plastic cone bag for mixing had a hole in the tip already so when I was mixing it, it sprayed all over myself, and it&#x27;s only getting darker on my skin and the clothes I was wearing at the time.  Also my first test tattoo, it is getting darker by the hour but I had trouble peeling the gel off so it&#x27;s not so clean looking.  I&#x27;m really hoping the splatters come off my chest, neck and arms sooner than 10 days, all my scrubbing seems useless.</li>
            <li> The jagua worked very well, had a good consistency once mixed and came out very dark. However, everything they gave me to mix in was awful. The mixing cone had quite a few holes in it which of course I didn&#x27;t find out until after I dumped everything in it. When I was finally able to get it back into the bottle, after feeling like I wasted a lot from spills, the cap that they give you for the applicator leaked as I was applying the tattoo. It squeezed out all over my hand and wasted even more of the product. I ended up switching to an applicator cap I already had and it finally worked. I purchased this brand because of the free shipping and the &amp;#34;freshness&amp;#34; of mixing my own jagua, but after my frustration I don&#x27;t think I will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Very little product.  Works great but its only good for one medium design.</li>
            <li> Works great. I left the dye on overnight before wiping it off and the design stayed dark black for over a week before starting to fade.</li>
            <li> Came out great . Follow the INSTRUCTIONS. Stencils were well done.  Had enough for my hand foot and chest. Let drt for 30 minutes. Let sit 3-4 hrs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that it gives off the impression of a real tattoo, but it DOES NOT last 2-3 like normal henna does, it lasted only a week for me. idk why it only lasted a week, but for around $20 a bottle it wasn&#x27;t worth it for me. I feel like it should be $10-$15 a bottle. but that&#x27;s my opinion.</li>
            <li> Crappy quality, the bag that comes in the kit for mixing the gel and the ink was broken and spilled all over the place and the water dropper did not create a vaccum (read: couldn&#x27;t suck up water)</li>
            <li> It gave me a rash and spots even after I did a skin test. It came off within 4-5 days. The colour did not even come through properly and there was not a lot of it as I only did 3 very simple designs. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Makes it hard to create a henna tattoo. The formula is kind of thick and doesn&#x27;t squeeze out of the bottle easily.</li>
            <li> Loved it works we&#x27;ll sipping was fast 👍👍👍</li>
            <li> Pretty great stuff. There is prepping required, and not all of the items listed on the box came (gloves were missing, but no biggie. I had extras). Be careful when using this. If you make a mistake, fix it asap! Even after you wipe, in a few hours that smudge will be there. Basically, when you put this on your skin it dries up and gets crackly. After about an hour or so, peel the jagua off and your skin will be clear. No mark will be left whatsoever, but after a few hours it starts to show up again where you put it. After the first day, it gets dark and looks like a real tattoo and lasts for about 6 days or so. I provided pictures of my experience.</li>
            <li> Lasted way longer than it says. I had it in my fridge for months and it still works. The tip got really clogged though so make sure you clean everything really well. Definitely buying again.</li>
            <li> I received my kit opened and missing the gel and the stencils</li>
            <li> I loved designing with this type of temporary tattoo, I just wish it came in a bigger bottle lol</li>
            <li> This kit provides everything that you need to apply professional looking henna designs.&lt;br /&gt;The henna ink is easy to mix and turns into a dark blue/black color which lasts about two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;The applicator is very fine point to allow for precision  detail. Designs also included.</li>
            <li> The product itself is not bad. I think I would appreciate it much more if the plastic beg wouldn&#x27;t be broken. I found out about the hall in the middle AFTER my hands turn black-blue...That was really frustrating. Since that blue inc is still on my hands I guess it would hold well if I would get a chance to use it normally.</li>
            <li> Too much to do and wait to get everything ready is crazy. I prefer to pay more if everything was ready.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t not work at all. Plugged up. Horrible.</li>
            <li> States Henna in name but specifically states that it&#x27;s not henna on box. Would not have purchased if I knew it was not Henna.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I paid for. It was great and it had a lot more henna than I thought. An ounce actually makes quite a few tattoos, enough to cover an entire arm and then some (speaking from experience, ha). Didn&#x27;t know it was going to be blue but it&#x27;s very deep and beautiful. All of the instructions and tips and even templates were incredibly helpful. I&#x27;m keeping all of it for future use! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Horrible.Never buying from here again.</li>
            <li> Black henna, with 2 pages of stencils. Easy instructions. This is great for the beginner.</li>
            <li> it was a very good product</li>
            <li> I recommend you not buy this item.</li>
            <li> Did exactly what it said it would do. Served it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping. Very messy and dark.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible. It is actually an ugly turquoise color &amp; spreads out as it dries which ruined my design.</li>
            <li> It was awful. Plain awful</li>
            <li> Super easy to use, however stains REALLY fast so be careful, I got some on my face for 10 seconds and ended up with a huge dark blue patch. Started fading after about a week on my hand.</li>
            <li> I liked this product and the actual tattoos last for a long time. The instructions were easy to read and understand. Overall great product.</li>
            <li> I got this for a friend, she loves henna, so I thought that this would be something different since it is black and not the red-orange color you usually get with henna. It was super easy to apply, the tip that was included was perfectly small (no more guessing on where to cut the tip of the bag that some kits have). It lasts a while, as long as you don&#x27;t scrub it, and it turns out really nice</li>
            <li> pretty easy to use, even for the beginner</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get this but while I was mixing it together, which I was under the impression you did not have to do, and there was a hole in the bag causing all of the mix to be spilled all over me. Luckily it came out easily but all of the power and actual tattoo mix is gone. Would not recommend this</li>
            <li> I was going to give this 5 stars. It has a beautiful color and is very interesting to work with. However, after a day, I noticed my back (where I had a medium sized tattoo) started to become a little bumpy and itchy. It became worse through the day and by that night the entire tattoo was like the damn rocky mountains, and itchy as hell. It turned into a huge rash that has now SCARRED my back in the pattern of the tattoo.&lt;br /&gt;In the product&#x27;s defense, I will say I have used this on my wrist. lower arm, and thigh with no issue. Infact, I had re-purchased this after those trials because I was so happy with the results. But after this incident? No way. I&#x27;ll go back to henna.</li>
            <li> Great product! Actually lasts a long time and is easy to use, almost like a real tattoo</li>
            <li> Would you be interested in sending a sample for my sisters salon? She would love to do this!</li>
            <li> The kit requires some mixing of two liquids and it&#x27;s meant for one application. For this price I expected more than one application, that&#x27;s why 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Great. Easy and long lasting.</li>
            <li> So disappointed with my purchase. I&#x27;ve purchased this product 3 times, recommended it to my friends, and have shared the link. This year that I bought it, while making the solution I discovered that the cone bag had a hole, and all of the mixture started spilling out. Not only did the mixture go to waste, but the spillage stained past the newspaper I laid out since it started spilling profusely. I would like a replacement package because this is unacceptable. The whole thing had to go straight to the trash.</li>
            <li> I usually use the regular henna in the tubes. didn&#x27;t like that the plastic bag had a tear, made the mixture a huge mess everywhere, but as for it leaving the design, it fades a little faster than henna and takes a little longer to dry. Granted, it does look really cool after you let it set. I love the eucalyptus oil too.</li>
            <li> The henna came out very nicely.  It has easy to follow instructions and the henna lasted a while.  You have to be very careful after applying the henna because once it messes up it will stay that way once it&#x27;s dried.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff I will definitely buy it again soon for a party or something looks like a reel tattoo as well!</li>
            <li> Fun to mess with. Just wish it had more tips and more henna powder for the price.</li>
            <li> My 12 year old wanted henna tatoos like at Ceda Point Amusement park. Bought this set and it works great. Very easy to use and clean up  would highly recommend</li>
            <li> Amazing! I love it so much ! I ordered it Sunday evening and received it on Tuesday evening! I didn&#x27;t even pay for expedited shipping it arrived in two days :)</li>
            <li> So much fun and super easy to use! Storage lasts a long time too!</li>
            <li> It was great I love it</li>
            <li> There was a hole in the bag. I got a refund because I couldn&#x27;t even use it. …..so stupid.</li>
            <li> As a first timer, I didn&#x27;t know what to expect based on the reviews. I washed my hands and wiped them down with vinegar to remove any excess oil. I carefully drew my design and removed any mistakes along the way to ensure they wouldn&#x27;t stain (they didn&#x27;t, thank god) I let it peel off after 2-3 hours. At this point the henna was very faint but 12 hours later it was a very dark green and JUST what I had expected! Very impressed with this product! I will continue to buy!,</li>
            <li> it looks really nice, but it is very messy</li>
            <li> The set up wasn&#x27;t as simple as it seemed, and it&#x27;s more like a goo that stains your skin than henna but overall it did the job pretty well</li>
            <li> The jagua itself is nice, the tool used for application sucked. It was too big and made lines that were too big. However, theres so much product in here that it&#x27;ll last you many uses. It also shows up great on darker skin tones too.</li>
            <li> I used it on my eyebrows as I read many reviewers had... it barely did anything, in fact it made it more of an issue to wear liner because I had a faint grey shadow around my eyebrows... so strange. However, I did get some on my foot and it definitely dyed it:) LOL I guess my face is just special.</li>
            <li> I love this product my first time using it when it peels I couldn&#x27;t see the color and I thought I did it wrong but a few hours later it comes up really dark easy to apply a you can clean up mistakes 😄😄</li>
            <li> I really love this product !! Good price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Worked well and took about 2 weeks to come out of my skin. The applicator is pretty easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very good! Products works just like i need it to! I will buy again</li>
            <li> Love how it looks on the skin. A little surprised how quickly it is used up though. Small bottle. Just a few applications.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product. The instructions are pretty easy to follow. The only reason I&#x27;m giving it four stars instead of five is for the plastic bag used to mix the ingredients in. As a previous buyer stated the bag has a tear in it which causes the henna to spill out so BEWEAR. This can easily be remedied by using a small ziplock bag. Also, once your tattoo is on, dried, and removed don&#x27;t be surprise if the tattoo is light. It will darken up after a few hour. Oh and also, the tattoo can still bleed after that so BE CAREFUL .  After all the steps were completed I went to bed. Apparently I slept on my hand at some point because I woke up with the tattoo transferred onto my face:) I was looking like Mike Tyson for a few days. Luckily the face and neck are more oily then other parts of the body which is why it faded fast 😅</li>
            <li> The little triangle bag came with little holes at the bottom so I couldn&#x27;t use it properly and even the needle tip cap was defected, having holes which didn&#x27;t allow the henna to flow properly, I had to find a bottle from a craft store but nothing small and precise enough so essentially, this was a terrible experience and a waste of my money. With the defects I had, it&#x27;s not even worth looking into buying anything else from this company.</li>
            <li> When I first rinsed off the henna, it was super light on my skin but after a few hours, it got SUPER dark! The only thing that kinda irked me (but not too badly) was trying to mix all the stuff together. It was kinda chunky at first, but it still worked great. The chunkiness makes the henna come out faster sometimes, so it might mess up your design if you&#x27;re not careful. The henna comes out bluish black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasted for a while (a few weeks), but if you wanna get it off, it takes a lot of elbow grease. If you get this, wear gloves while doing it because I didn&#x27;t and almost went into a job interview with bluish black hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, there is a LOT of henna. I&#x27;ve done both of my feet and still have plenty left. Not to mention that it lasts for months too. This stuff is great and I totally recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Great temporary tatto stain love it!!</li>
            <li> This stuff looks drawn on with a sharpie marker and it is impossible to take off, dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I mixed the whole thing but just use little bits at a time as I needed it. Directions say it keeps for 2 weeks, but even after a month post-mix it still worked. I use it primarily on my hands and it lasts only about a week, but hands get a lot of wear and tear with washing and dishes and such so I think that is to be expected. On other parts of the body it can last 3 weeks, but it will be faded over 50% by week three. It is very different on everyone&#x27;s skin as well, and different parts of the skin are more or less absorbent. Skin prep is very important, make sure you wash and exfoliate first and use the oil that comes with to open pores.&lt;br /&gt;During the first few days people thought it was a real tattoo.</li>
            <li> The product was nice and dark,deep but I had an allergic reaction, blistered skin. I have used other jagua  product and did not have the same problem with them.</li>
            <li> I ordered the tattoo kit, and when I received it, the main part of the &#x27;solution&#x27; for the tattoo was missing, I would not recommend a product that is shipped incomplete.</li>
            <li> It was really simple to make the ink and it came with everything that I needed. My &amp;#34;tattoos&amp;#34; got to the expected dark black color within 12 hours and lasted 2 weeks before fading. I love it and am on my 2nd package!</li>
            <li> I mixed the solution, As written in the booklet. Put on skin. After an hour it dried. And Peeled off to nothing but to where I started. Terrible product. Currently searching for a new kind of product. This isn&#x27;t henna</li>
            <li> This product was horrible and didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> Loved it.  Lots of fun for my daughter!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to receive this product! I created a free hand Mhendhi design on the back of my hand. The product was easy to use however, immediately after I applied my tattoo, I felt sick and began vomiting. Just an FYI this product does produce a noxious smell! I wouldn&#x27;t use it if you&#x27;re prone to feeling sick when you smell fumes. I&#x27;m so sad that I won&#x27;t be able to use this again!</li>
            <li> Once I get the hang of using the little bottle with needle to trace my drawing, and learn to squirt it out evenly, I will like it better and better.  It was hard to do it by myself on my foot, and I will look for someone to help me with it the next time.  But was happy with the result.  It got very dark after the first 24 hours.. and I like the look even as it was fading.  Fun to use and can experiment since it is temporary.</li>
            <li> very fun product. I only wish that the pen point was a bit finer. maybe I was just heavy handed</li>
            <li> This is a fun thing to do for kids or to practice the placement ofa tattoo.  Will not look likea real tattoo but is super fun</li>
            <li> This worked well. It lasted about the two weeks, and was relatively easy to set up. You definitely need to wear to the gloves and make sure you do it on top of some news paper or towels so you don&#x27;t stain anything else</li>
            <li> I ordered this for a arts and crafts project during summer school and we were able to make about 15 tattoos and some were pretty big and the kids did make mistakes that they wiped off. It does take a long time to dry but it lasts and lasts. I have had my hand covered for over a week and it didn&#x27;t fade too bad. The templates they gave were okay but a little cheesy. The applicator was a good size and it was easy to mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note: It did wash out of clothes if you don&#x27;t let it set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a great deal for something that lasts as long as it does and I was happy.</li>
            <li> the applicator plugs up and is straining on the hand to squeeze the bottle while painting on the design.  after the design has been applied and waited the time to have it dry (which sometimes is longer that the desired 30minutes) it does hold for more that 2 weeks</li>
            <li> This is the second time my 14 year old daughter has purchased this kit and it is fantastic. The ink stays on for weeks. The only complaint I have at all is that there isn&#x27;t enough eucalyptus oil in the package and we have to use our own. Also to keep the ink from staining your hands wear latex gloves when applying. I&#x27;d highly recommend this kit if you are looking for a semipermanent way to add art to your body.</li>
            <li> kind of messy but awesome product</li>
            <li> does it come with a bottle to squeeze the stuff out with???</li>
            <li> Lasts for a long time. Stayed on for a good 2 weeks but still has a bit of shade after 3. I will definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.. Love the product last a l</li>
            <li> The color ended up being a greenish blue, i loved it!The box says it last a month but i made it last 2 1/2! I did full hand designs every two weeks:) Im definitely ordering again!</li>
            <li> was not really what I expected</li>
            <li> I used this for experimentation. I wanted a safe way to stain my fingertips black, not sure why but when I saw it on someone else I needed it to happen. I obviously got more than my finger tips, this happened because I applied to my finger tips and decided to put on gloves which smeared it up my hand leaving it in a patchy application above the knuckle. The color fade to blue, and doesn&#x27;t exactly last as long as I was wanting, but it worked. I might purchase again after experimenting with a few other ways of staining.</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit for my 13 year old daughter.  This kit is easy to use and includes high quality ingredients.  The only area it falls short in is that there is not enough eucalyptus oil.</li>
            <li> Works great and actually stays on even after swimming and showers  I have used it 3 x&#x27;s and stays well in the refrigerator</li>
            <li> I loved it! I got so many compliments and it lasted for about a week</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  My girls and I had a fun time with it.  The transfers were very easy to use and had some good designs.</li>
            <li> It will look ugly if you smudge and the tube where the product comes out is to big for me I would like a thiner tube</li>
            <li> Purchased for teenage daughter.  She loved it!  Not too messy and decent quality.</li>
            <li> Poor quality henna and difficult to use. VERY disappointed.</li>
            <li> The color actually turns out black, so it looks 20x&#x27;s more real.</li>
            <li> At first it seemed to not be staining but after a while it worked</li>
            <li> recommend it it lasted on me for over a week</li>
            <li> The kit was cheap and the tip broke while I was drawing my tattoo. BIG DISASTER AND FAIL.I would not recommend this kit to anyone.</li>
            <li> Jagua is great as a temporary tattoo.  Ink is dark and looks like an old black paint tattoo. great to freak out your friends.</li>
            <li> The ink looks so faded after application. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This stuff is crazy!  I got a little on my fingers and they were dark purple for 2 weeks!  Wear gloves!  Leaves a dark purple stain, stronger an darker than Henna.  Looks almost like a real tattoo.  Starts out as a faint blue mark and later gets really dark.  Not that dangerous &amp;#34;black henna&amp;#34; stuff.  Stay away from that stuff.  This is safe, really looks cool but is very noticeable.  Not for a little Henna tattoo that you can kind of hide at work.  It would be great for ancient celt or tribal looking tattoos, like South American tradition tattoo art.</li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL!!! my entire foot is stained!!! Even if you lightly put the prduct on and wipe completely away, in a matter of hours the exact design you wiped away appears! even if it appears faintly. It still appears! Making the whole thing look so sloppy. And there is no scrubbing this off once it sets in. I wore shoes 6 hours later and the ink smudged and now I have giant blotches of dark blue stain all over my foot. And my hands from using a towel to wipe away. This product should be used with extreme caution. Definately not something you should practice with! The stain is VERY DARK AND STAYS!!! Ugh wish I could get my money back :(</li>
            <li> I love this product, but you definitely cannot use it more than once, and it looks faded immediately.</li>
            <li> As a quick summary, the jagua tattoo is basically like henna, except for this ink is black, giving it a more realistic look. The ink was easy to make by mixing a few things and although the bottle is tiny, it went a long way. It lasts for about 2 weeks but can be scrubbed off if needed. The tattoo templates are just printed onto a white piece of paper; which look like you could have printed them out at home. These were a little disappointing and did not apply onto the skin that well, but worked enough to get a rough design. You probably could print out your own designs to give yourself more options, unless you are artistic enough to draw it by yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it was worth the money and was a fun activity over the summer.</li>
            <li> Great product! It dries black so people actually thought it was real lol.  You must be careful where you place the ink because it starts staining the skin quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Great family fun :)</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Great instructions. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Is it possible to get a sample of your product?  I own a henna tattoo business and many people are asking about Jagua. I would love to be able to refer my customers to your product if it works well.</li>
            <li> I reeived the package on time however the squeeze bottle from which you apply the henna absolutely su#*s&lt;br /&gt;All I could make was a tiny heart. And the henna stopped coming out of it. And started leaking from the bottle of the needle. My $$$ totally wasted!!!!</li>
            <li> I usually have a hard time with &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; tattoo stuff like henna, because I have a very deep tan (I am Hispanic). But this stuff really did turn black (bluish when it fades) and it lasts a long time. Because I swim in a pool daily it starts fading after a week, but honestly when I don&#x27;t swim it lasts longer. Very happy. The &amp;#34;stencils&amp;#34; were nothing to write home about, but I free-style my drawings so I didn&#x27;t care. Just so its clear, this is a powder that has to be mixed, but if you take a few minutes to do it right, its super easy. The fine needle applicator was awesome too.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t get a dark pretty color... kinda looked like a faded pen</li>
            <li> this is the best temporary tatto kit on the market the color is very dark, at first when it dries and than you peel it off you see nothing but within an hour the color starts to really devolop and gets really dark. very easy to mixl although i messed up it didnt effect the outcome. I have a youtube channel and plan on doing a review and demotration on how to mix and before and after. I just puchased another kit although i still have some left, it last for a long time in the refirgerator i have already did 3 designs from the one kit and still have some left for maybe two more.</li>
            <li> It works great. The gel is easy to prepare. And the applicator tip is very fine and makes it easy to make intricate designs. My designs on my arms mostly last about 10-12 days. Check out my instagram @glamorousgia for my jagua creations. I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants temporary tattoos that are dark colored and resemble real tattoos the most. ;)</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these.  The first time it worked fine.  The second time my grand daughter put a second one on her leg.  She was burned or something.  She still has the mark/burn weeks later.  Hope it will fade but not really sure it will</li>
            <li> I buy this on a regular basis for my daughter.  She is very artistic and kept drawing on herself.  I finally got this for her and all my children ended up with tattoos everywhere.  She was able to do intricate art with it.  And it lasted forever.  I&#x27;ll be buying this for a very long time.</li>
            <li> very nice kit. follow the directions, and you&#x27;ll be fine. dont get worried when you rinse it off because it looks like it went away. it&#x27;ll show up!! lasted about 2 weeks even with shaving and showers. highly recommended</li>
            <li> I was so excited to start using this. When it came I started following the instructions. The little bag that you&#x27;re supposed to mix the powder and gel in HAD A HOLE IN IT so the mixture kept leaking out whenever I picked it up and it made a huge mess all over the floor and my hands. Thank goodness it was relatively easy to clean up. CHECK THE LITTLE BAG FOR A HOLE BEFORE YOU PUT ANYTHING IN IT!!!</li>
            <li> I was expecting a lot more from this product especially since I read nothing but great reviews but now I am left with mixed feelings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the story: I had nothing on my skin, followed all the instructions in the box to a T, did freehand henna on my mom and then on myself. We watched a whole movie (1hr 56min long) while it dried. When it started peeling off, I was shocked to see a very faded light green looking stain. It looks like henna looks after a week long except it&#x27;s brand new. So I went to bed disappointed BUT when I woke up, the faint/faded henna transformed. It is now a dark blue color. I also noticed a spot I had messed up on and completely wiped clean was back and darker than ever. This henna is confusing. It looks as if you never did any henna and then appears about 8 hours later. I did some research and on their website they mention that it takes two hours for it to appear. This was not the case for me, as it took wayyy longer than two hours to appear, but I am disappointed that it didn&#x27;t mention this on the box AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my overall experience was ok...Don&#x27;t think I will buy it again because I don&#x27;t like the color of the blue/green but it isn&#x27;t as bad as I initially thought. Oh and be careful with your mistakes!! THEY WILL SHOW UP (8 hours later) no matter how little time you left it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a before and after picture (before is when it&#x27;s still a little wet, after is two hours later).</li>
            <li> It works amazing and super easy to use is the second time I got this kit and I love it. I get a million compliments. I&#x27;m ordering a bigger set for tattoo party</li>
            <li> This stuff was a lot of fun. I don&#x27;t care for the reddish-brown of henna, so I gave this a try. It works and stays for almost two weeks just like it says.</li>
            <li> This henna is blue/black, looks almost tattoo like. It lasted way longer than your usual red/brown henna. It was pretty easy to use the applicator bottle due to its thin needle-like tube, just be careful with very thin lines. The trick is to take your time applying it, try not to be hasty :) The bottle was able to finisih 3 henna designs, and only half of it was used. The rest can be stored in the fridge for about 3 months I believe. I definitely would buy this again, especially for this price. Enjoy!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product many times - always with good results. I read all the poor ratings and they all did not read the instructions or wait until it dried. You have to mix it well and you have to wait until it is completely dry. I usually put it on my wife at night. After it is dry we cover the dried part with plastic wrap so the little pieces don&#x27;t flake off on the bed. Next morning it is easy to wash any left over crust. The design takes about 8-12 hours to show. You have to wait! Also use the gloves that come with the kit or get your own. Wherever you get it on your skin will be there for about 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt; One more thing - this is not Henna. The company&#x27;s name is Earth Henna. They sell this Jagua and Henna. Used correctly it is great stuff!</li>
            <li> My18year old daughter wanted to see if a temperary tatoo worked,it turned out awesome,and lasts a couple weeks and then you have the option of change, whereas with a &amp;#34;real&#x27;tatoo you are confined to one option.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.  When I put it on everyone thought I had a real tattoo.  My only suggestion is that if you make a chest tattoo, like I did, you should put a shirt on at night because I slept on my hand and the tattoo transferred from my chest to my hand - lol.  They do worn about this if it is fresh but it had been washed and dried for hours.  Just an FYI.</li>
            <li> the tip needs to be thinner because it&#x27;s hard to get the detail drawn.</li>
            <li> This company sent me a whole sample assortment a while ago for free, guess they were marketing to the Henna Tattoo artists. The ink never really got that dark, Not like pictured. I have been using Jagua for 5 years and I know what color it should come out when fresh.A lot of these companies that seel the stuff seem to be hit or miss. The company with the best most consistent product I have found is called FreshJagua dot com.</li>
            <li> Worked very well, instructions were easy and looked great for the time it lasted :)</li>
            <li> I bought this because I like tattoos and wanted to get one but didn&#x27;t want the commitment to it, so this is an awesome way to have a tattoo and not have to live with it when you get old, haha. It works very well and stays on a pretty long time. Looks authentic too. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I did expect the result to be a darker color, but overall a good product. Good alternative to a tattoo and a great way to experiment with possible tattoo ideas and placements!</li>
            <li> My daughter has used this kit I bought many times.&lt;br /&gt;Leftover just goes in Refrigerator and able to use again.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Henna seems to last a week, no problem.</li>
            <li> Really bad my heena tattoo came out blue instead of the black would not order again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product&lt;br /&gt;Its actually better than henna, and yes it takes longer (about 1 to 2 hrs) to dry completely but it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> Messy, doesn&#x27;t last very long. Not easy to use &amp; I am artistic. The company I got this from took FOREVER to mail it out too. I recommend buying the water tattoos instead. Cheaper &amp; last longer.</li>
            <li> I got the packet on time. But when I mixed everything the henna didn&#x27;t give off any color. It smelled really bad, I feel like I just wasted my money. I was looking forward to doing this henna for a friends wedding but I couldn&#x27;t. The mix was like mixing Oil and water, the ink and the gel weren&#x27;t mixing together at all, it felt like I was applying Vaseline and Vicks on my skin :/</li>
            <li> May I sample this product? I work in a near by saloon and we do everything from eyebrow waxing to body massages and I think henna tattoos would be a perfect fit! please reply asap :)</li>
            <li> The product was delivered quickly. All of the items advertised were included and useful for creating the best product. The tattoos lasted up to 10-11 days, with the darkest and most pronounced color on days 3-5 before fading. Smaller/thinner lines fade quicker but the thicker, more substantive tattoos lasted the longest.</li>
            <li> Its just what i expected. It comes with a thicker and thinner tips. It&#x27;s darkest on palms and the bottom of feet. 2oz goes a long way so i could do lots of good sized and detailed designs.  it preserves fine as long as it is sealed and not in direct light. It got to me soon than expected and i am genuinely satisfied with this and will definitely buy it again in the near future.</li>
            <li> Not a lot of product. More packaging than product. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It held for a while and it looks like a real tattoo. Very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> A terrible product, sorry potential buyers... :/</li>
            <li> This kit is awesome!! Such a great Christmas gift for an artistically minded person. The kit comes with all you need to make awesome temporary tattoos.</li>
            <li> The product itself stains everything on your body unless you&#x27;re really careful to wash it off. I touched my face, there was no visible ink and then a day later... black all over my face for a while. I know that comes with being careful about using the product. Secondly, it fades as blue and it looks like I just sharpied my skin. It&#x27;s a good product with some things I didn&#x27;t appreciate.</li>
            <li> It was an okay product.  Nothing impressive.  easy clean up of tools.</li>
            <li> Product came early, and in great condition. I would definitely reorder from this seller in the future. Great buying experience, especially around the holidays.</li>
            <li> This stuff really wasn&#x27;t that great. I knew there was a chance that it wouldn&#x27;t apply well as i pretty much bought it out of haste. It seemed to me like I was looking forever in all my local craft stores and even the bigger stores for this stuff and I just couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere so I bought it here. Well it was not worth it. The kit is messy and the solution is watery. Most henna, or at least good henna lasts anywhere between 3-4 weeks. This stuff lasted days.. On my 3rd day wearing it I went in a store to purchase a dress and the cashier actually asked me if I was having a tattoo removed! That&#x27;s how bad it looked! That being said, if you plan on wearing this for just one night and having it look like a real tattoo than maybe this is the product for you. The ink is a blackish-blue instead of the normal brown which was fine by me, I just wished I had purchased a better product.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product. I did have go look up some more instructions online for the setup, but maybe thats just because I&#x27;m stupid lol. The henna stays really, really well. Its a bit lighter of a color than I expected, kindof like a pen blue color.</li>
            <li> Definitely stains your skin very well so I would use it moderation. My sister and I used it to replace actual henna and it&#x27;s very black and looks a little too intense.</li>
            <li> Worked well. In fact if you don&#x27;t wash off the henna quickly/well enough, your mistakes will show up, so be careful!</li>
            <li> love it and read the directions unlike me and messed it up a bit</li>
            <li> Wonderful product although a bit messy for over excited teenagers..lol  Worked great, stayed on for almost 2 weeks and once you get the hang of it its easy to use.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It is blue, not black.</li>
            <li> misrepresented. This is not Henna.  It is black paint.  If I knew that, I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it.</li>
            <li> This product is not what it&#x27;s advertised. the tattoo will never look with the resolution that they show in the package. it looks granular and fades away fast. You may still see it in 3 weeks, but it starts looking terrible within the first week of application. I got a reaction on my skin to the product, but the reaction did not become apparent until later in the week, not right away. It looked like a bug bite in the shape of the tattoo. What bothered me more about the product is that the instructions are not clear; they include 2 sets of them that vary in the steps and don&#x27;t even explain why the 2 instructions  have differences. The simple tools they provide to prepare the mix utterly failed on me. The clear bag where you are supposed to mix the ingredients had wholes and resulted in ink spilling all over my table, then the new applicator was clogged and that was the second ink-everywhere accident. Not worth my money.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, great color and texture. Images came out great.</li>
            <li> So this stuff works pretty decent. Came with some templates, the usual tribal stuff, a butterfly, spider and so on. All pretty small - maybe 2&amp;#34; by 2&amp;#34; and a couple 4&amp;#34; x 2&amp;#34;. You put oil on your arm, press on the template, it leaves a faint image of the design and then you fill in by hand with the ink dispenser. It dries, forms a kind of crust. You rinse off and it is looks faded, then the next day it looks better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tat comes out blackish blue color similar to ink you might think someone got from a back alley tat parlor, but if that is the look you&#x27;re going for it is fine. It worked for me. I actually hand drew a design and filled it in, worked well. Faded after about a week, then at about 2 weeks was very faded, 2 1/2 weeks gone.</li>
            <li> This stuff is okay but is not as realistic as they claim.  Comes out  faded and smudges easily.  If you go over the same tattoo a couple of times it is a little darker, but it&#x27;s definitely not worth the money I paid.  Might as well use the cheaper Henna tattoos.</li>
            <li> I was delighted with this kit.  I have never seen black henna and have been told it was dangerous, but I read on the box it is completely safe.  I look forward to using it on my husband.  (wink, wink)</li>
            <li> Not as I ex very messy it does not look the same after drying</li>
            <li> I would order it again as it was a very good product.  This was the longest lasting henna we have ever had which is great if your expecting it to last for 2 weeks before it starts to fade and another 2 weeks before its gone so plan ahead.</li>
            <li> great condition instructions were not clear-</li>
            <li> Super impressed with this product. Extremely pigmented, easy to work with, easy intructions, and a good shelf life. Highly recommened!</li>
            <li> This is just awesome.</li>
            <li> So I was definetly ripped off . None of what I received met with the measurements described in the description . MABY enough for ONE desighn .</li>
            <li> I rate this 3 stars because it did arrive on time, and the amount of product for the cost is definitely worthwhile. However, there was a small hole in my mixing bag which allowed for a large mess when mixing the ingredients, and this product stains VERY easily VERY quickly. If you do decide to purchase this item, I strongly suggest rubber gloves and to use/mix the product on a surface that either can&#x27;t stain, or that you wouldn&#x27;t mind staining. I got a small blotch on my fingers and although I was able to wash the gunk off, within a few hours the stain started to appear. I also experienced some trouble using the stencils. When I free-drew my tattoos they stained perfectly fine and came out dark in the end, but when I use a stencil, they turned out faded and went away within a few days.&lt;br /&gt;If applied correctly and taken care of properly, the tattoos have lasted me about a week or two. I suggest applying them to an area of your body that you will not need to vigorously or frequently wash. This is because washing the area frequently or vigorously will make the stain fade much quicker than when washed gently and not as frequent. It is also good to apply to dry skin. Try to avoid moisturizing your hand until after you have the desired stain.&lt;br /&gt;This product came with everything as described. It had two sheets of stencils, 4 or 5 toothpick-like objects to help shape the tattoo during application, a needle cap and storage cap, a mixing bag, eucalyptus sample, and thorough instructions.&lt;br /&gt;The tattoo is a very dark blue. The longer you leave it on, and the thicker you apply it, the darker the tattoo appears and the longer it lasts. It takes about 24 hours to reach it&#x27;s peak darkness. Once you apply it, it should take about 20-45 mins to dry depending on the thickness of your application. Once it is dry, you can remove the application my rubbing it off while dry or running it under warm water and rubbing it off somewhat vigorously with your hand and patting it with a rag. At this point it will look like it&#x27;s just a faint greenish tint to your skin, barely noticeable, but within a few hours it will start to rapidly darken.ag.

            <li> i absolutely love this product, and so do my customers. it may be a bit pricey, but it is worth what you spend for sure. I&#x27;ve already bought three orders of this stuff, and i plan to keep purchases. i would highly recommend it to anyone looking into it.</li>
            <li> My 14 yo niece enjoyed using this with her mom.... birthday gift.</li>
            <li> Second time purchasing this. It&#x27;s easy to use, I&#x27;m able to do many &amp;#34;tattoos&amp;#34; many times, they last about 2 weeks and they look real, I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This ink definitely lasts about two weeks.  The color develops overnight and is nice and black.  I use it on my eyebrows.  I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a disaster.  I bought it for my 11 year old daughter.  I knew that henna would be a mess but this went above and beyond. The problem is that it basically becomes invisible for a while then shows up 24-28 hours later.  When it revealed itself, it was everywhere!  The instructions tell you to scrape off the extra henna with your fingernails so it was all over my daughter&#x27;s fingers.  It was also on her face and her chest, and my sister&#x27;s fingers, face and neck (she was helping). It&#x27;s like they had taken a bath in the stuff, but you couldn&#x27;t see it until the next day. And they are right when they say it lasts for at least a week!  Ugh.  I threw it out.</li>
            <li> I opened the package to find the jagua powder spilled everywhere and it stained my table. I had to throw away the package because the powder was everywhere.</li>
            <li> I cant get enough of this temporary tattoo ,  its a great product.</li>
            <li> great product. dries almost black and i am african ameican so it shows up very well on my skin tone</li>
            <li> Great product! Stains even darker than I expected so be careful of smudges.</li>
            <li> LOVE this kit!! I was looking to get into henna.  I knew absolutely nothing about how to do it or what to buy, but I found this kit recommended in a youtube video.  The price is a little high but it is worth it because it comes with everything you need.  I was able to get 3 designs out of it so far and I still have enough for probably one more.  The directions are clear and easy to follow and I loved how my very first attempt came out!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 17 year old granddaughter so her tattoos would be temporary and she could try them out first before making permanent decisions.  The kit works amazingly well.  My granddaughter was really happy with it.</li>
            <li> Works absolutely amazing, easy to mix the solutions, easy to apply and stayed on for almost a week and half! I&#x27;ll also add that I&#x27;m a hairstylist with my hands in water all day so for it to day that long was awesome! (Be careful when applying though because wherever it touches it WILL dye! Lol had spots on my hands where it accidentally touched while I was doing it and it totally showed so wear gloves! :-)</li>
            <li> This product met my expectations. My wife and I love trying new designs without the permanence of a real tattoo.</li>
            <li> It comes exactly as described and is very easy to mis all together. Applying is the hard part, I made a big mess all over. I would recommend using a stencil because trying to free hand is way more complicated than you would think. Also if you make a mistake wipe it away IMMEDIATELY because any mark will stain.  Also it says it shows better on darker skin, this is true because my boyfriend is slightly more tan than I am and his came out very clear and nice. It lasted for about 3 weeks. So it was a great product and worth your money but definitely use a stencil. (Or be a wayyy better free hand artist than my boyfriend was)</li>
            <li> The needle is to thick to make small designs and the ink absorbed a lot into the skin which distorded the design. The ink does stay a long time and it was very hard to take it off.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the delivery suck&#x27;s</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I was looking for. But even though I am artistic this really takes practice and I highly recommend that you youtube tricks and tips to using this dye as it spreads out as it oxidizes and a little goes a long way. I ended up rocking a horrible disaster for a few days... The dye for me was not easy to get off, of course! It was a hot mess. practice on paper first!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, the eucalyptus smells amazing, and the henna goes on nice and dark, and this came less than three days from when I ordered it. I will absolutely buy this again, and I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful all in all. Only thing bad about it is that it stains ANY part of your skin it touches even if it&#x27;s just for a second. Especially if you fall asleep with a freshly peeled tattoo, it will transfer to your skin. (Hope it doesn&#x27;t get on your face) it lasts a good while and I love that it&#x27;s black and not brown like henna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad part, I&#x27;m a doof and didn&#x27;t thoroughly read the instructions. I reapplied the gel over my existing tattoo as it was starting to get too faded and my skin broke out and raised. It itches and its soooo annoying but now that the tattoo is fading, the rash is as well. WAIT UNTIL ITS COMPLETELY FADED!!</li>
            <li> I wanted to try temporary tattoos and I found this.  They give you templates so it&#x27;s easy to apply and it stayed for about a week and a half to two weeks.  It takes awhile to dry but that&#x27;s to be expected.  Once you put it on you wait for it to dry.  If I recall correctly the drying time is about 2-3 hours.  Once it dries the ink will start to crack and come off.  You have to rinse it off and it will look completely faded, by the next day it will look dark.  Like a real tattoo.  It lasted a few months so it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely loved this product.  My whole family tried it and loved it.  I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Color comes out great! It&#x27;s a very strong smell when you&#x27;re applying it, but after it dries you can&#x27;t smell anything. Super easy to make, and the kit comes with reallly well written instructions. Had no problems making the mixture.</li>
            <li> I absolutely  loved  how dark the product  showed up. I personally  think the trick is to leave it on and let it peel of naturally for the first 24 hours. That&#x27;s what I did and I was extremely  pleased with my results, but of course I went to a professional so that made using  the product more appeasing  as well. The only thing I would change about this kit would be to make the tip finer, for a more detailed design, because after it dries the design is much more bolder, as u can see in my last pic.</li>
            <li> Mixed it up, drew a sweet design, let it sit, peeled it off, saw practically nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Figured, &amp;#34;Eh, it&#x27;s so light, I could draw all over myself for fun and no one will really notice.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I did. I drew all over myself and peeled it off to see only VERY faint faint blue/black remnants. I was bummed, but it was still fun. I figured that&#x27;s what I get for buying cheap henna off amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Woke up the next day looking like I just got out of a 10 year prison term for murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great and last for a week or two. I took a star off for the humiliation I felt at work the next day.</li>
            <li> The application bottles nib can not be replaced for the smaller nib that comes with it. It&#x27;s glued on there good.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t much of a fan of it</li>
            <li> This henna is awesome! I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t be very dark, but it&#x27;s GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to mix and apply. The kit comes with a decently fine tip (not EXTREMELY fine, but finer than I had expected), and it&#x27;s a good consistency. Color is midnight; A nice, dark, blue-black. IT TAKES 24 HOURS TO DARKEN. Do not get discouraged when you rinse the henna off and the tattoo is light grey. It DOES darken significantly over 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The henna does last 2 weeks, however, after the first week it faded about 1/3 the original darkness. I re-applied the henna and it completely renewed the dark color, so it was no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a decent amount, as long as you&#x27;re only using it for smaller designs. I&#x27;ve already gotten 3 applications from it, and I still have plenty left. It stores well in the fridge so far, and it goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stencils the kit comes with were not to my liking, but it&#x27;s easy to make your own. It found that I was able to print my own designs, and if I applied them (using the eucalyptus) immediately after printing, when the ink was still wet from the printer, it provided an okay stencil for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I was very please with this purchase. I was wary of ordering any of the henna online, because I wanted to be sure I was getting a good product- this is certainly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT &amp;#60;3&lt;br /&gt;I just want to ask as I just noticed that there is only one left !!!! like are you going to provide more or not. I am planning to order more when I finish what I have.</li>
            <li> Lasted about ten days, very satisfied with the product. I would purchase again. Good to use as a guide to whether you would like a permanent tat......</li>
            <li> I liked it, but was very disappointed that I only got two uses out of it before the applicator started leaking.  For some reason, it wouldn&#x27;t screw on properly and the Jagua gel squeezed out the sides.  Therefore it was a waste of money.  I highly recommend exfoliating the area you intend to ink a couple of days before to help ink stay put.  I wanted to fade mine after a couple of days to put a fresh one on and was a bit shocked at how light it became after scrubbing with a washcloth.</li>
            <li> Ehh. It smudges easily. Stains quickly and takes foreverrrr to dry. Regrets. Purchase henna– much easier to work with. Oh and the smell is quite potent.</li>
            <li> Love this product is very cool...but make sure u wash it well it does transfer if u dont</li>
            <li> Great product. I wish it has a narrower pen point. It stays about a week or longer.</li>
            <li> Works really well! Make sure you have a steady hand because this stuff stays on!! Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it has lasted about a week now. Doesn&#x27;t look any less pigmented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, it is not henna, so don&#x27;t buy this if you want henna. It is not a paste, it is a gel. It takes longer to dry, and stains the HELL out of everything. Hence why I should have listened and wrapped my hand...I may or may have gotten it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall LOVELY product. Does as promised, BETTER than henna for tattoo experimentation.</li>
            <li> hands down one of the best henna kits I&#x27;ve ever purchased. it takes a couple hours to darken but the end result is amazing. i always get it confused as tattoos</li>
            <li> Loved this product so much! It&#x27;s well priced and totally worth it! Better then real tattoos honestly</li>
            <li> such a good product, at first i didnt mix it properly and didnt work as well as it was meant too.. then i watched a video and got it all sorted.. but yeah my extra product is frozern now :P i will be ordering another one soon. thank you</li>
            <li> I bought for my eyebrow and it is great :)</li>
            <li> i honestly didn&#x27;t think this product was worth buying at all. I saw someone use it on youtube and i liked the way it came out. little did i know when i received it i had to prepare the mixture myself and the amount of jagua given wasn&#x27;t even sufficient enough. the set up process in general was ridiculous and by the time i got to set everything up in the baggie to begin use in the dispenser , the black coloring leaked everywhere and didn&#x27;t mix properly with the gel base after vigorous mixing. and not to mention that the color won&#x27;t develop for 24-48 hours is a big turnoff. Overall i won&#x27;t recommend this product, maybe if they began selling it pre mixed then i would give it a second chance.</li>
            <li> A few of my friends have told me that the product works pretty good, I would personally like to try it out first before I purchase the whole kit. I give henna tattoos often, &amp; I&#x27;ve made a lot of money doing so, but I&#x27;m always into trying new products. Is there any way I can try out the product before I purchase it?</li>
            <li> Ok first things first, this is not henna. If you want henna this isn&#x27;t it. It&#x27;s a great product I have sensitive skin to some things and it did not activate my sensitivity. I made a mess and got it all over my hands so consider gloves when using this product. It ends up really dark like a navy blue if you&#x27;re using it free hand. If you&#x27;re using this on a well used part of your body like hands or feet it might wear off quicker than normal. I know the smudges on my hands came off within 4 days. Some of them were dark.&lt;br /&gt;Ok so now onto why I only gave it 3 stars first of all they give you so little, like a tiny amount one small bottle worth.&lt;br /&gt;I tried one of the tattoo design on my ankle and it was such a help to have an outline but the design came out as a very light navy blue, ghost level stuff. In the picture is my second attempt and I went over the design to try and make it darker. Hopefully it&#x27;ll be darker but I do not know.&lt;br /&gt;So overall it&#x27;s a good product but not a lot of the product and the stencils make it very light.&lt;br /&gt;If you rub your tattoo repeatedly with make up remover it takes it off a little bit at a time.</li>
            <li> For one there is barely enough for one henna tattoo and two it didn&#x27;t even stay on my skin after I cleaned it and three please don&#x27;t waste your money on this you will regret it....worth 3 dollars not fifteen</li>
