            <li>A good tool to help get knots out of your muscles</li>
            <li>Of course, i did not even give it a fair chance I think.</li>
            <li>In order to get good results you have to keep this up and take the pain.</li>
            <li>--I wish you good luck.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even know what good it would be for.  </li>
            <li>good buy</li>
            <li>and it is still in good shape.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because of the good reviews it received on this site</li>

            <li>Truly good quality.</li>
            <li>This would be a good roller</li>
            <li>Good for exfoliating, don&#x27;t think it assists with reducing cellulite.</li>
            <li>but it feels good as an exfoliator and for sore muscles.</li>

            <li>This is a very economical and good product.&lt;br</li>

            <li>Love love love this item!</li>
            <li>I love love love this product!</li>
            <li>I bought this mitten, is quite gentle but yet effective, works great</li>
            <li>Hurts to use it for about the first wk after that the massage feels great.</li>
            <li>but once I read all the great reviews I was willing to give it a try.</li>
            <li>My skin is getting very smooth too.</li>
            <li>The Mitt is very comfortable on hand.</li>
            <li>With this combination I&#x27;m seeking superior results with eating healthy, exercising using neoprene pants and good nature&#x27;s supplementation daily for over all good health and adding fiber etc.</li>
            <li>i can now walk around in shorts and feel comfortable !</li>
            <li>My boyfriend can&#x27;t stop touching my legs</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had lots of improvement, my skin looks smoother and has a much better texture.</li>
            <li>My skin feels and looks so much better.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll get results :)</li>
            <li>and I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>In combination, they work fantastic!</li>
            <li>However I have been also eating healthy and going on walks.</li>
            <li>I used it every day for 10 minuets in the day and night with soap in the shower in morning and night , I really notice a great differences,</li>
            <li>I love this tool.</li>
            <li>But the cellulite was better.</li>
            <li>the more vigorously you do, the sooner you notice results.</li>
            <li>And leaves my skin so smooth!</li>
            <li>Nothing more.</li>
            <li>so i don&#x27;t no anything about this product once so ever, but i think the person i bought it for likes it and is satisfied.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;handle&amp;#34; needs to be more flexible (perhaps sizable?)</li>
            <li>As a massager, it is okay, but i am not convinced that it does anything for cellulite.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for one month in conjunction with a work out routine and try to eat as healthy  as I can.</li>
            <li>The appearance of cellulite is not gone but is MUCH better.</li>
            <li>what the top review of this product says-</li>
            <li>If you watch your diet, drinks lots of water and be sure to flush out the toxins you release with the massage mitt.  </li>
            <li>It sure hurt..</li>
            <li>It does leave you bruised, but after the bruising fades, everything started to look great and has really made a difference.</li>
            <li>It worked better for me when I didn&#x27;t use it in circular motions.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li>So, it may also be beneficial for more than just cellulite.</li>
            <li>O give the mitt one star because you can give yourself a massage with it better than with a sponge or loofah mitt.  </li>
            <li>I love this mitt because it has an elastic band for you to have greater grip on it while rubbing it on your legs in a circular motion.</li>
            <li>and my legs look better but</li>
            <li>even if its not I still love the way it feels.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But of course this mitt isn&#x27;t magic or else it wouldn&#x27;t be $12.50</li>
            <li>I have been using with anti-cellulite cream and it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li>I do not use it any more.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it, because if nothing else, it helps the cellulite creams/lotions work better.</li>
            <li>not so sure I thinking working out &amp; doing yoga has worked better</li>
            <li>I love this to even out/tone out my legs, butt, thighs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure with continued use it will work better.</li>
            <li>will keep using this and hope for lots more improvement.</li>
            <li>Having used all kinds of gadgets and wonder creams this is showing the most promise.</li>
            <li>I have also been walking more along with using this.  </li>
            <li>love it , I bought two</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>So if you are looking to lose the cellulite, check your diet, and make sure you are exercising.</li>
            <li>am glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>gets the blood flowing and it feels like i have more energy throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even sure if I&#x27;m using it correctly because I don&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
            <li>Like many things now a days made in china</li>
            <li>, the quality could be much better.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I end up buying more for my family and friends.</li>
            <li>My skin looks much better now.</li>
            <li>It was more pain than gain for me.</li>
            <li>I love goofy beauty products.</li>
            <li>I am healthy, but would like to be about 10 pounds lighter.</li>
            <li>My skin feels more plumped up and fuller</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I use a firming skin lotion (one of the cheapest on the market) in conjunction, but also a healthy diet and exercise.</li>
            <li>Many people state, reports/</li>
            <li>The cream seems to be working better when used with this massage mitt.</li>
            <li>but I love this thing.</li>
            <li>glad I did.</li>
            <li>The product itself is ok.</li>
            <li>I order the bliss machine and it&#x27;s much better than this.</li>
            <li>i love this mitt</li>
            <li>I have now noticed more smoothness.</li>
            <li>I just received this massage mitt and I like it better than the type that I had years ago.  </li>
            <li>I feel a bit more confident now in my bathing suit.</li>
            <li>Please and thank you:)</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re anything like me then cellulite has been a nightmare since I was about 15, but like most people say I just got used to it.</li>
            <li>and it works better with cellulite cream.</li>
            <li>This method saves me a lot of money because I don&#x27;t go through as many Nivea tubes as I used to plus</li>
            <li>, I do not use this in the shower, I don&#x27;t know if it works better that way or not.</li>
            <li>but this one is better fits on my hand better to thank you</li>
            <li>I love ❤</li>
            <li>When the bruising disappeared a smoother, cellulite free and toned areas remained!</li>
            <li>I would definitely look into getting another for her because together they do an awesome job in doing what it is meant to do...control cellulite and tighten and tone desired parts of the body!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure given a couple more weeks that will improve as well.</li>
            <li>I want to love this, but, it broke the first time I went to use it!!!</li>
            <li>The first time!!!</li>
            <li>and i can notice great improvement on the appearance of my skin, mainly in my tights.</li>
            <li>but I bought it for myself as I have some minor cellulite, after trying it once I was actually really impressed</li>
            <li>Although so many types of remedies are available, women have to constantly keep trying procedures until they find what works best for them.</li>
            <li>Still there- but significant improvement!</li>
            <li>The product is easy to hold but creates very significant and patterned bruising on my thighs.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels more toned and smooth.</li>
            <li>I am a fit, healthy girl</li>
            <li>If they made the strap handle stronger or more secure</li>
            <li>so i am happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li>Really satisfied with the product and the people who shipped it:) and definitely hoping to win that 3 month supply on finulite.</li>
            <li>I do like this thing, it really does feel good.</li>
            <li>It really seems to be good for getting into the dimples and helping to bring circulation to &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; areas.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery, easy to handle mitt!!</li>
            <li>I have used other massaging mitts that have also worked, but this one is the best I&#x27;ve used yet.</li>
            <li>Fabulous works amazing my legs are super smooth, I recommend using vitamin e oil as lubricant.</li>
            <li>Bruises easily.</li>
            <li>The handle makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li>if your anything like me and bruise easily..</li>
            <li>My skin turned a nice flush pink and it felt great to massage it over my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I cant really tell if it works of not because the strap ripped after 3 uses.&lt;br /&gt;While I was able to use it, I liked it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I&#x27;m very impressed and happy with this new little beauty tool!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s seems logical that anything that might break up the tissue &amp;#34;pockets&amp;#34; that are holding the fat together under the skin might be effective.</li>
            <li>Getting rid of cellulite would be  a miracle but for what it&#x27;s supposed to do it works just fine.  </li>
            <li>I like the flexible handle, makes it easy to grip and feels secure.</li>
            <li>Its also less than $10 which is a great deal!</li>
            <li>I like it fine</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is light and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I can grip it just fine without needing the strap.</li>
            <li>Light and easy to pack and store.</li>
            <li>I know that many have stated they have worked on this situation, with no results, while others have seen tremendous results.</li>
            <li>Finulite Cellulite brush is pretty good feels good like an instant massage.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to work on my thighs and tush, I have mild cellulite and of course would love to look smooth for the spring and summer.</li>
            <li>So far pretty good!</li>
            <li>This is great, very simple, easy to use, clean and strong.</li>
            <li>and I already see a huge difference.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean as well.</li>
            <li>I am amazed at how effective this item really is.</li>
            <li>to allow for a comfortable fit.</li>
            <li>Great quality and definitely will not fall apart.</li>
            <li>it just helps to break up the fat cells and smooth out the puckering while the cellulite still lingers underneath the skin.</li>
            <li>It is also important to use lotion or soap on the area, to allow the mitt to move smoothly.</li>
            <li>and although the lotions fell short of what I was expecting, the massage mitt works great.</li>
            <li>I will completely be free of cellulite in my thighs.  </li>
            <li>Makes your legs feel smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li>almost cellulite free.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to primarily get rid of cellulite</li>
            <li>really enjoy using the product as I am losing weight.</li>
            <li>I have experienced a smoothing effect, after merely 12 short days.</li>
            <li>Got this free with the soap.</li>
            <li>Can say enough about how great this product it.</li>
            <li>The price is amazingly affordable &amp; I truly appreciate the fast delivery....</li>
            <li>Fortunately, the mitt fits in the palm of my hand</li>
            <li>&quot; so the thought came to mind that maybe this tool has such great reviews just for a \\&quot;prize\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It feels good to have a direct task to do for myself.  </li>
            <li>I really like it will give update soon on results doesn&#x27;t hurt at all lovely :)</li>
            <li>and really noticed a difference!!!</li>
            <li>and I will be as confident as ever with my new legs :)</li>
            <li>but all in all i looove this item and do recommend it to people wanting fast results! :)</li>
            <li>Also drink a lot of water, do cardio and all that fun stuff!</li>
            <li>When I first started using the product, I massaged in circular motions but I wasn&#x27;t sure what I was doing.</li>
            <li>This one is totally worth it!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it so much that I am giving it to all my friends for Christmas!  </li>
            <li>BUY THIS PRODUCT, ITS WORTH IT!</li>
            <li>so far I haven&#x27;t seen any results for a month, maybe it takes more time I will give it one more chance</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to keep using it a few times a week, but it keeps my legs and butt smooth!!! :)</li>
            <li>Easy to do right out of shower.</li>
            <li>Product quality is great, it&#x27;s easy to hold even in the shower, and the massagers are deep but not too intense.</li>
            <li>and I can give a true description of how well it works.</li>
            <li>I love this product it actually took inches off,my clothes fit better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s true</li>
            <li>and I can tell it is definitely creating good circulation.  </li>
            <li>I really like this tool I bought two more for my daughters</li>
            <li>I can feel it really getting the finulite products to work their magic.</li>
            <li>Full on cottage cheese.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know which theory is true or not</li>
            <li>it gives a true workout for her arms as well.</li>
            <li>My leg is much darker in the right picture because I had a spray tan (Fake Bake Flawless is an amazing self tanner by the way!).</li>
            <li>Fair warning, it does hurt if you use it on dry and unmoisturized skin, but otherwise, this product is very useful</li>
            <li>and the other is greatly improved.</li>
            <li>After washing your hair - massage the legs, hips, belly, even arms.&lt;br /&gt;The Mitt is great for other reasons like blood flow and achy muscles.  </li>
            <li>My kids also like to do it for me, it&#x27;s fun for them ( as long as I am guiding them to do it right lol).</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok i need to use it on a more regular basics.</li>
            <li>Super excelent product!&lt;br /&gt;Work</li>
            <li>super well!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Besides the mild bruising, I noticed a difference within a day of using it.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>Seems to be helping tremendously.</li>
            <li>yes, lucky me.</li>
            <li>The sort of tingle you get from a quick jog around the block on a brisk winter day.</li>
            <li>Item as described quick shipping</li>
            <li>The product was shipped and delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>I have gotten light bruising when doing the massaging very vigorously, but nothing like I did when I tried those suction cups!</li>
            <li>I was also surprised and extremely impressed to find that Saponified oils of Palm, Coconut, Olive and Palm Kernel are included in the soap, these combined oils are extremely helpful for the body, as well as Sea Salt.</li>
            <li>I was also surprised and extremely impressed to find that Saponified oils of Palm, Coconut, Olive and Palm Kernel are included in the soap, these combined oils are extremely helpful for the body, as well as Sea Salt.</li>
            <li>This Massage Mitt works greatly to help break down the diabolic cellulite together with the Finulite lotions.</li>
            <li>The new design is much better, the handle is a lot thicker</li>
            <li>This product is also good for getting rid of any skin irritation - the skin on the back of my thighs is a bit drier than the rest of my skin - the exfoliation this product offers cleared that issue right up :)</li>
            <li>My first reaction with this thing: &amp;#34;OUCHY&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend and was able to purchase this discreetly via mail instead of in public.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li>It does cause mild bruising when first using, but it works fantastic if you remain consistent.  </li>
            <li>This thing really does smooth out my skin.</li>
            <li>and I am pleased with the results thus far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Plus, those areas have been more sensitive.</li>
            <li>I love it so far it makes my skin smoother feeling looks</li>
            <li>This is really powerful.</li>
            <li>This Cellulite Massager Mitt I have already had success with.</li>
            <li>and I am pleased so far.</li>
            <li>Worth the $10.</li>
            <li>It is actually pretty cool.</li>
            <li>its not the most comfortable and will make your legs red right after using...</li>
            <li>It does leave mild bruising after first couple uses but the end result is worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rate it higher except the strap broke so quickly.  </li>
            <li>right?  </li>
            <li>So worth the money (though I wish I&#x27;d ordered it so much sooner!)</li>
            <li>More apparent and had dimply holes</li>
            <li>ultimately exercise and eating right are your best bet...and staying hydrated, but I do think this gives a nicer smoother look and helps the circulation and sloughing off dead skin.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure it might take a little more scrubbing.</li>
            <li>This is very useful and a nice little gift as well.</li>
            <li>and yes it does hurt because this awesome device reaches deep inside your trouble areas, all over the body, not just the thighs...</li>
            <li>So far so good... only been using it for a bit</li>
            <li>I was also impressed that the outside of the envelope was marked “FRAGILE,” which is very helpful to alert Carriers when handling and delivering packages.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product arrive very fast.  </li>
            <li>It really does help to minimize cellulite!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect miracles, you have to really WORK and commit!</li>
            <li>This is the first cellulite massage mitt for the shower that I have ever purchased.  </li>
            <li>It bruised at first</li>
            <li>All the spongy lumps I would feel under my thighs are smoothed out after using this consistently for a week.</li>
            <li>When I first started using this product, yes my thigh did bruise</li>
            <li>This is my first time using this type of product</li>
            <li>As for the cellulite, I&#x27;m still working on it along with excersie &amp; lots of water ;)</li>
            <li>Very helpful!</li>
            <li>At first I didnt want to use based on some reviews but you have to just try things for yourself.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Vendor delivered exactly the product that was promised.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It really does reduce the appearance of cellulite!</li>
            <li>if you know you can be consistent</li>
            <li>What a torture a woman go through to look pretty....  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I have used it daily for more than a year</li>
            <li>Some results, very smoothing!  </li>
            <li>You must combine the use of the mitt with a healthy fitness and nutrition regimen to actually get rid of the cellulite</li>
            <li>However, do be aware of the strength you use this mitt.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>with this routine, I incorporate 8 glasses of water back into my diet and started working out about 2-3 days a week to get the most out of this product and what it has to offer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this item for 3 weeks now consistently</li>
            <li>I use mine several times a week and love it.</li>
            <li>Must be consistent to see results.  </li>
            <li>This Massage Mitt really circulates the blood flow!</li>
            <li>I was surprised when I opened the package to find that it was the Finulite Cellulite Smoothing Massage Mitt with the FREE Exfoliating Bar Soap that was offered with the order.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get a lot of bruising after the first day like others have said.</li>
            <li>I think I  actually like the Zoom Groom better.</li>
            <li>Broke after using it the first time.  </li>
            <li>and it has my tights and butt looking better than they have looked in the last 5 years</li>
            <li>*sigh, leg days*).</li>
            <li>The first day I used this product I noticed an increase in urination.</li>
            <li>I use the mitt in the shower with my favorite body wash and immediately I can feel it working in my deep tissues.</li>
            <li>It got here so fast!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used so many different cellulite creams</li>
            <li>I used this on my thighs with the Finulite cream and in the shower with regular body soap and it made my skin super smooth.</li>
            <li>One more thing--the strap is extremely sturdy and you actually do not have to put your hand through the hole to use it effectively.</li>
            <li>I recommend Arnica gel to rub on after use, if you have tender spots that might turn into a bruise: I think it really helps prevent them from forming when applied right after massaging.</li>
            <li>Many pure skin oils work well for this, as do some of the anticellulite gels or lotions, (though I am uncertain if the latter work without the massage as well).</li>
            <li>I had some St. Ives cellulite lotion that I used but probably need to look for something a little more advanced.</li>
            <li>but my thighs slimmed down from the swelling and looked much better!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s an ingenious design that did what even daily lymphatic drainage with the dry skin brush hadn&#x27;t been able to do in a year.</li>
            <li>She says the positive reviews on here were probably from the makers or something.</li>
            <li>and even I am seeing positive results in the smoothness of her skin and that the cellulite is becoming smaller...</li>
            <li>First off, I dieted very strictly...</li>
            <li>Still on the hunt for a solution, I searched high and low, read more reviews than I care to admit, and landed on this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple and easy.</li>
            <li>(I find it easy to use while watching TV) and alternate legs each day.</li>
            <li>and I felt like it would be less effective for whatever reason.</li>
            <li>I recently started drinking a lot of water too, more than normal, and I think that has also helped.  </li>
            <li>my carbs came from my fruits and veggies, carbs has insulin which actually maintains or increases cellulite appearance), wasn&#x27;t easy</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the time I decided to place my order; they were also offering a limited-time ONLY Special, allowing customers to receive a FREE EXFOLIATING BAR SOAP with the order, provided you met the requirements.</li>
            <li>I still had abnormally large fat deposits and bat wings.</li>
            <li>But certainly the mitt can&#x27;t hurt and is not an ongoing investment</li>
            <li>This item is easy to use and does a nice job of massaging my legs and behind.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen a huge improvement in my skin yet, but I&#x27;m only two weeks into it.</li>
            <li>Thanking the Seller for a great offer, and I will definitely leave an update in a few weeks about my experience using the Finulite Massager Mitt and Exfoliating Bar Soap simultaneously.livering</li>
            <li>Thanking the Seller for a great offer, and I will definitely leave an update in a few weeks about my experience using the Finulite Massager Mitt and Exfoliating Bar Soap simultaneously.</li>
            <li>I use it for a few minutes on each leg a night and it feels amazing.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really help cellulite.</li>
            <li>; at around 8:30PM to massage my WHOLE body before I get in the shower with a body scrub.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know if the mitt works.</li>
            <li>Another reviewer recommended the Kong Zoom Groom, which would be a much cheaper alternative, though I haven&#x27;t tried it.</li>
            <li>This has really helped break up the cellulite.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even realize I had that much cellulite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m noticing a real improvement.</li>
            <li>(Those require a LOT of time, as there is a *real* learning curve.)</li>
            <li>/&gt;It really does work ladies</li>
            <li>I try to drink as much water as I can</li>
            <li>I like it so much that I have bought one for my sister and one for friend.</li>
            <li>You have to do this twice a day for about six to eight weeks to really see results.</li>
            <li>I cannot really say since I just started using.&lt;br /&gt;CO</li>
            <li>You can really feel it working.</li>
            <li>but I am very upset with this product.</li>
            <li>It doesnt even hurt really.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>and there is plenty of room for a larger hand to fit into the hand-strap.</li>
            <li>You have to stay consisted with it if you want real results.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about the creams, but this this thing really great.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really notice much of a difference.</li>
            <li>Really works to get your blood circulating.</li>
            <li>Skin feels and looks much smoother.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as I thought it would.</li>
            <li>but with much improvement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I dont even use it anymore because to bruised me too much.</li>
            <li>REally Feel It</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t notice anything and irritates the skin so much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s now an indispensable part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li>I really do like this product</li>
            <li>if used as instructed you can really feel an increase in blood circulation which is supposed to help reduce the appearance of cellulite.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>IT took about 2 months to really become a believer.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This mitt is very durable.</li>
            <li>and I am really seeing results.</li>
            <li>but the cream dries really fast and gets sticky.</li>
            <li>each item wrapped visibly, securely, and individually.</li>
            <li>each item wrapped visibly, securely, and individually.</li>
            <li>It really helps to improve the circulation in the desired area.</li>
            <li>I only paid about $13 for mine with free shipping</li>
            <li>It looks like it would really hurt</li>
            <li>With perseverance, I think it really works.</li>
            <li>gentle...</li>
            <li>I am very picky when it comes to purchases online</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li>but you have to hold the whole mitt in your hand to use it.</li>
            <li>The straps come off and the whole thing comes apart.  </li>
            <li>you can really tell that blood flows to the area after massaging.</li>
            <li>this can really make a difference in your fat distribution.</li>
            <li>I had one bruise early on, but have learned to avoid the sensitive areas (near a tendon on the side of my knee) and stick to the more cushiony areas of my thighs.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend getting the massage mitt if you are purchasing the lotions!</li>
            <li>I use it rather gently</li>
            <li>This really does help push away cellulite.</li>
            <li>It will really help you alot.</li>
            <li>IT REALLY DOES DO WHAT IS SAYS MY CELLULITE IN MY BELLY IS ALMOST DISSAPEARES</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t care too much for it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have as much.</li>
            <li>And really that&#x27;s what i&#x27;m trying to achieve.  </li>
            <li>Also even though it kinda hurts I really have been digging in when I use the mitt</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own without a heavy residue.  </li>
            <li>I have even read that natural castor oil (bought in a health store) actually works better</li>
            <li>, it felt really cool on my hips, legs and glutes, the mentioned areas were really red and hot</li>
            <li>I have used this product before from a different company and have been satisfied so far with this one too.</li>
            <li>My doctor told me that I had developed tendonitis in my right arm.  </li>
            <li>I was very optimistic after reading reviews of this and many other brands.</li>
            <li>I got even more results doing leglifts and plow pose, as well as other yoga poses like it.</li>
            <li>I go to Mexico at Xmas every year and find that if I start using this brush and Nivea daily for 6 wks in advance, the cellulite diminishes significantly.</li>
            <li>one.&lt;br /&gt;You will need some kind of oil to use for this to glide across your skin and not rub it raw.  </li>
            <li>Expect some bruising at first, this goes away as skin gets more  firm.</li>
            <li>I do not normal bruise easy.</li>
            <li>I have to say most things I order never live up to the hype or reviews, but this one has far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>You can try re-attaching the strap, but it doesn&#x27;t stay; also you have to pry the edges apart to get it re-attached in the first place, which runs the considerable risk of cracking the plastic.</li>
            <li>I am not sure what it contains to be so crazily effective</li>
            <li>I love this mitt so much, its not even expensive like most creams and cellulite remedies are and it works so well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first fewtimes, my skinwas really sensitive to the touch</li>
            <li>but i think i will have to break down and buy some cellulite creme to make it work better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of weeks, good massage tool but no significant difference.</li>
            <li>You still have to watch your diet and eat less fat and drink more water.</li>
            <li>Without lotion, I just push with less intensity and it feels more like a massage/brush.  </li>
            <li>after a couple of times I did notice my skin looking more taut and less dimply.</li>
            <li>and I tend to bruise QUICK, but that is only prove that this thing is doing it&#x27;s work!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve notice that it leaves my thighs &amp; back of my legs really smooth &amp; soft.</li>
            <li>After a fairly rigorous massage before bedtime, the next morning you should notice a *substantial* diminishment of bumpy, \\&quot;lunar surface\\&quot; skin, and see a smoother, firmer appearance in the trouble spots.</li>
            <li>Mostly &amp;#34;orange peel&amp;#34; looking cellulite (back legs, butt), but a couple deep dimples on my sides...</li>
            <li>What I like to do is get a decent amount of lotion, put some on my skin (not rubbing it in) and let the massager do the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is useful and strong enough to do something and soft enough not to break the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and plan on buying one for my daughter.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the massage mitt to anyone that has issues with stubborn cellulite.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this prodcut.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what else to add, but I hope this little tool helps you as it has me, or even more</li>
            <li>I love this little mitt.</li>
            <li>I get little bruises but it works faster and more efficiently that way.</li>
            <li>So far, I haven&#x27;t seen much (if any improvement).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li>Thank you for creating such a useful product.</li>
            <li>is a few dollars more than this</li>
            <li>so i wasn&#x27;t able to use it long enough to see results.</li>
            <li>suggest you put more of the shower gel on the pad and rub it vigorously all over your legs firmly .</li>
            <li>I will update after more use as I am not sure how much it is working just yet.  </li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t think the extra 2 minutes it takes me to use this thing would help by much, but after 3 weeks of using it together with the finulite cream</li>
            <li>I am sure customers receive these offers when they order various products from different Sellers.  </li>
            <li>I am sure customers receive these offers when they order various products from different Sellers.  </li>
            <li>But there is NO Doubt in my mind that this product works as a stand-alone product because with consistency you will be moving the fatty deposits to make a smoother and more defined appearance on the skin surface.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t normally leave comments.  </li>
            <li>I saw result within a few weeks :).  </li>
            <li>Havent been using very long, but in about two weeks, I have noticed some more smoothness when used daily in the shower and with the AM/PM lotions.  </li>
            <li>The picture on the left was taken 02/18/15 and the picture on the right was taken 03/02/15.</li>
            <li>The strap on the mitt has held up fine but is definitely on the larger size.</li>
            <li>I recommend buying this if you try any cellulite reducing product, at least then, you will be able to see if the product being used with the mitt is being utilized to its full potential.</li>
            <li>When I use this \\&quot;mitt\\&quot;, I massage firmly --hard enough to know I&#x27;ve done some good.</li>
            <li>This item should last a very long time and bought more soap to keep it busy.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it removes cellulite, but will keep using good massage tool after a long workout.</li>
            <li>Am v self conscious about my cellulite as you get older</li>
            <li>I may try using it again very softly, but I don&#x27;t know if it will work without pressure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve still been using it, only very gently for some added massaging to my bumpy thighs.</li>
            <li>Be careful though, I have left several small brusies on my thighs, which aren&#x27;t very attractive!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Aside from that, a design flaw which is not inconsiderable, this little massage tool does a LOT right!!</li>
            <li>I believe this is the same product that is sold in a kit with other products, and it is definitely more affordable this way.  </li>
            <li>(maybe more only if cellulite is \\&quot;ubiquitous\\&quot;), you should notice enough improvement to raise your spirits big time!</li>
            <li>This item actually worked on my thighs and arms with the first usage.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I have stage three cellulite with some deep indentations; have had it for over 20 years and know that it will take continuous and consistent use and that the results are gradual but</li>
            <li>not much to say other than its constructed nicely</li>
            <li>At first I was only using the cream and that progress also work</li>
            <li>This is EXACTLY what I needed for that last step.</li>
            <li>so, I am not sure seems okay and working .</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure if it is this or the creams that is helping more.  </li>
            <li>Any improvement I&#x27;ve seen is most likely due to the workouts I&#x27;ve been doing (</li>
            <li>i like this , it seems to work pretty , but ive only used it a couple of times</li>
            <li>Starting using a few weeks ago, Don&#x27;t see or feel much difference, May need to use longer to see better results</li>
            <li>Typically, these types of mitts are made of a soft rubber that glide over you easily.</li>
            <li>This is not an equivalent to a swedish massage, this mitt breaks down the cellulite and allows your skin to look smooth.  </li>
            <li>This works, as long as you eat right, go to the gym and drink a lot of water.</li>
            <li>I am a light skinned black woman.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I&#x27;ve loved the results and the new proportionate shape.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect, it&#x27;s less expensive, and it has Prime shipping.</li>
            <li>me tell you, I was using the Nivea Serum on its own, I rubbed and massaged with my hands very hard for 15 minutes twice a day for two weeks</li>
            <li>but here is my scoop on how I rid myself of my most obvious bumps in as little as one week.</li>
            <li>Just be sure not to press too hard when massaging or you may bruise yourself.</li>
            <li>WOW  </li>
            <li>I used this along with NuElle Triple Action Anti-Cellulite Concentrate</li>
            <li>It looks as though with the basic concept, they&#x27;re really onto something.</li>
            <li>My cellulite problem started when I developed circulatory issues.</li>
            <li>I used it several times and did not like how it really hurts</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised by this product.  </li>
            <li>shipping was  timely and professionally packaged</li>
            <li>So far, I have not had any problems with the handle coming off.</li>
            <li>As far as cellulite ummmmm</li>
            <li>Would recommend it&#x27;s long as you are consistent with its use.</li>
            <li>Wow, what a difference.</li>
            <li>I am a professional massage therapist</li>
            <li>If YOu Have Sensitive Skin&lt;br</li>
            <li>my thighs are about 90% improved ... and SO SMOOTH and FIRM ...  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t seem to matter how much I worked out at this stage of my life, I could not lose the cellulite on the back of my legs and stomach.</li>
            <li>If we were to take a poll/voting inquiry or survey most women would admit this is common in women of all sizes, shapes, and ethnicity.</li>
            <li>so far no complaints</li>
            <li>But my cellulite is almost completely gone.</li>
            <li>I like it, so far.</li>
            <li>It has been over 30 days now, and wow what a difference in the appearance of my legs, butt and stomach.</li>
            <li>so I will have to come back and tell you if it really works.</li>
            <li>Try eating foods with few or no additives, and be sure to exercise regularly if you want faster results.</li>
            <li>and I honestly think the cellulite is worse.</li>
            <li>Seller  has advertised accurately about the Finulite Cellulite Smoothing Massage Mitt which is extremely easy to handle, can be rinsed easily as not get filled with soap scum, residue from liquid soaps, or other oils.</li>
            <li>I love this product only giving it a four because this is my second time purchasing after the band broke on my first from regular use, but it was after a year and a half.</li>
            <li>My cellulite was mild in some places, average in others.</li>
            <li>it breaks way easy but its not a huge deal because i can use the item without the strap anyway!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit uncomfortable and may cause bruising and redness at first, but once that irritation goes down, your legs feel pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>Mostly my hands though trying to apply that much force and twisting at the same time is no good.</li>
            <li>I lost quite a bit of progress by not using much once it became such a hassle, so now  I have to start again, but it does seem as though the new one is slightly different, with a stronger strap.</li>
            <li>This is a miracle cellulite product if there ever was one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I scrubbed the heck out of my upper legs the first day I got it using a regular body wash.</li>
            <li>With this band you won&#x27;t drop it in the shower and it is such a high quality rubber</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s been a problem since the 7th grade when the boy sitting next to me in jr high school asked why I had dimples in my thighs...</li>
            <li>do get tired when using the mitt (even though my arms are quite strong), but I think it&#x60;s a plus (everybody wants to burn some calories).&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>This is easy to use in the shower daily and not a huge commitment.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this little mitt in the shower with a basic cheap body wash.  </li>
            <li>And, if you do feel some tender areas after the first use, don&#x27;t be a wimp: remember you should become way less sensitive with frequent treatments; just keep in mind you do need a lubricant while massaging.</li>
            <li>When I woke up the first thing I did was check on my leg and SURPRISINGLY my cellulite had almost vanished (all except this one stubborn Mount Everest which went from terrible to mild).</li>
            <li>I have noticed a huge difference in only a few weeks with this product.</li>
            <li>For months I have been considering an alternate procedure to work on the little cellulite I have, through exercising and eating correctly, it has not completely diminished, somewhat improved, with more work needed to reach a satisfactory resolution for myself.</li>
            <li>At first glance, it seems that it will be very rough and coarse, but actually is quite gentle.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure if it&#x27;s the Mitt that prevents/reduces cellulite that well, because I also have a healthy diet (no added sugar, moderate salt and low fat) and do yoga, pilates and spin.</li>
            <li>I would buy it again, no regrets!</li>
            <li>The mild spots went away almost immediately, the worse areas took a few more days</li>
            <li>While reading what contents were in the EXFOLIATING SOAP, I was surprised to see that it has Peppermint &amp; Green Tea with Crushed Green Coffee Beans (Arabica), 100% natural, preservative free, no artificial color or fragrance in the soap.</li>
            <li>While reading what contents were in the EXFOLIATING SOAP, I was surprised to see that it has Peppermint &amp; Green Tea with Crushed Green Coffee Beans (Arabica), 100% natural, preservative free, no artificial color or fragrance in the soap.</li>
            <li>The top half where you put your hand broke off from the massaging bottom half.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a tad painful on dry skin but in the shower when your skin is wet, it glides very smoothly and feels really nice.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it religiously, so I can&#x27;t comment adamantly, but I do feel like</li>
            <li>I also use it on my stomach ,butt , arms, also my back as far as I can reach.  </li>
            <li>The nibs on it are harder than I thought it would be, but it works really well.</li>
            <li>and WOW I can totally see and feel a difference!</li>
            <li>18 yrs old and have cellulite on the back of my thighs.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as torturous as I expected though it does leave your legs pretty red.</li>
            <li>Maybe I am doing it wrong, but honestly you just need to work out.  </li>
            <li>Ok, I&#x27;m on the thin side, but being over 60, my skin is thinner that it use to be and shows every bump.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m doing this method in half the time as the hands-no-mitt way and yet the results are so much quicker!</li>
            <li>The trick is using it daily or at first then backing off to every other day when you are where you want to be.  </li>
            <li>I will post an update if I see a substantial improvement in the design, but I do wish I had tried to return the old one as soon as it broke, because I was planning to use it as my \\&quot;travel\\&quot; massager, the one to keep packed, but I realized the first time I tried it when away, I should have just gotten 2 new ones because using it is such a pain, (awkward to fit within the distance you can open your hand to grasp by the edges)</li>
            <li>Must say that this product got to me very quickly, much sooner than expected!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be alarmed when your thighs look a dimpled mess when you first use this product.</li>
            <li>Anyway, after about a week of use (5-15min, sometimes twice a day depending on how much time I have) I must say I do notice a difference, its not much, but it is noticeable!</li>
            <li>we use for our dog is designed on exactly the same principle:  soft but firm rubbery tips that massage and stimulate circulation.</li>
            <li>Just stay broad and don&#x27;t press down to the bone too much.</li>
            <li>On the positive side I think it gets the blood flowing because I would feel a slight tingling in some places.</li>
            <li>This was my second time purchasing this product and based on my previous satisfaction with my first use, I ordered again.</li>
            <li>It absorbs into the skin quickly and helps with breaking down some fat, gives you asmoother and softer appearance and works well with this tool seeing as it is rough on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now that they&#x27;ve finally been fixed, I can focus on the smaller problem resulting from the bigger one.</li>
            <li>Not sure it is worth it, however I am not using it as often as recommended.</li>
            <li>As some have stated, it caused some bruising the first few times I used it</li>
            <li>Then I dialed down to gentle rub.</li>
            <li>Usually mitts will glide right off when soapy and fall.  </li>
            <li>First few days, I left marks on my thighs.</li>
            <li>Just be careful if you have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It makes a huge difference!&lt;br /&gt;You have to be dedicated &amp; use it daily for as long as you can &amp; rub fairly hard...</li>
            <li>and I really believe it does break down the fat!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> massage mitt might be a great &amp;#34;quick fix&amp;#34; if you&#x27;re going to be wearing shorts or bathing suit and want your legs to looks smoother</li>
            <li> My legs get a great massage and it does break cellulite cells.</li>

            <li> it would be great.</li>
            <li> It works great with soap or even cream.</li>
            <li> I like to use this product, it feels great, but I have the impression that it doesn&#x27;t help to improve the effects of my anti-cellulite cream.</li>
            <li> Great product and great</li>

            <li> The workouts were divided evenly for the best results and in a safe manner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good product, I believe I have noticed a difference with my cellulite..</li>
            <li> A good tool to help get knots out of your muscles</li>
            <li> Of course, i did not even give it a fair chance I think.</li>
            <li> In order to get good results you have to keep this up and take the pain.</li>
            <li> --I wish you good luck.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know what good it would be for.  </li>
            <li> good buy</li>
            <li> and it is still in good shape.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because of the good reviews it received on this site</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s recommended with the Finulite creams but you can do as good a job with your hands.  </li>

            <li> Truly good quality.</li>
            <li> This would be a good roller</li>
            <li> Good for exfoliating, don&#x27;t think it assists with reducing cellulite.</li>
            <li> but it feels good as an exfoliator and for sore muscles.</li>
            <li> Good buying.</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s own magic.</li>
            <li> This is a very economical and good product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (i bruise easily!)</li>
            <li> Easy to hold and maneuver!</li>

            <li> Love love love this item!</li>
            <li> I love love love this product!</li>
            <li> I bought this mitten, is quite gentle but yet effective, works great</li>
            <li> Hurts to use it for about the first wk after that the massage feels great.</li>
            <li> but once I read all the great reviews I was willing to give it a try.</li>
            <li> My skin is getting very smooth too.</li>
            <li> The Mitt is very comfortable on hand.</li>
            <li> With this combination I&#x27;m seeking superior results with eating healthy, exercising using neoprene pants and good nature&#x27;s supplementation daily for over all good health and adding fiber etc.</li>
            <li> i can now walk around in shorts and feel comfortable !</li>
            <li> My boyfriend can&#x27;t stop touching my legs</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had lots of improvement, my skin looks smoother and has a much better texture.</li>
            <li> My skin feels and looks so much better.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll get results :)</li>
            <li> and I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> In combination, they work fantastic!</li>
            <li> However I have been also eating healthy and going on walks.</li>
            <li> I used it every day for 10 minuets in the day and night with soap in the shower in morning and night , I really notice a great differences,</li>
            <li> I love this tool.</li>
            <li> But the cellulite was better.</li>
            <li> the more vigorously you do, the sooner you notice results.</li>
            <li> And leaves my skin so smooth!</li>
            <li> Nothing more.</li>
            <li> so i don&#x27;t no anything about this product once so ever, but i think the person i bought it for likes it and is satisfied.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;handle&amp;#34; needs to be more flexible (perhaps sizable?)</li>
            <li> As a massager, it is okay, but i am not convinced that it does anything for cellulite.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for one month in conjunction with a work out routine and try to eat as healthy  as I can.</li>
            <li> The appearance of cellulite is not gone but is MUCH better.</li>
            <li> what the top review of this product says-</li>
            <li> If you watch your diet, drinks lots of water and be sure to flush out the toxins you release with the massage mitt.  </li>
            <li> It sure hurt..</li>
            <li> It does leave you bruised, but after the bruising fades, everything started to look great and has really made a difference.</li>
            <li> It worked better for me when I didn&#x27;t use it in circular motions.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li> So, it may also be beneficial for more than just cellulite.</li>
            <li> O give the mitt one star because you can give yourself a massage with it better than with a sponge or loofah mitt.  </li>
            <li> I love this mitt because it has an elastic band for you to have greater grip on it while rubbing it on your legs in a circular motion.</li>
            <li> and my legs look better but</li>
            <li> even if its not I still love the way it feels.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But of course this mitt isn&#x27;t magic or else it wouldn&#x27;t be $12.50</li>
            <li> I have been using with anti-cellulite cream and it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li> I do not use it any more.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it, because if nothing else, it helps the cellulite creams/lotions work better.</li>
            <li> not so sure I thinking working out &amp; doing yoga has worked better</li>
            <li> I love this to even out/tone out my legs, butt, thighs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure with continued use it will work better.</li>
            <li> will keep using this and hope for lots more improvement.</li>
            <li> Having used all kinds of gadgets and wonder creams this is showing the most promise.</li>
            <li> I have also been walking more along with using this.  </li>
            <li> love it , I bought two</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> So if you are looking to lose the cellulite, check your diet, and make sure you are exercising.</li>
            <li> am glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> gets the blood flowing and it feels like i have more energy throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even sure if I&#x27;m using it correctly because I don&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
            <li> Like many things now a days made in china</li>
            <li> , the quality could be much better.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I end up buying more for my family and friends.</li>
            <li> My skin looks much better now.</li>
            <li> It was more pain than gain for me.</li>
            <li> I love goofy beauty products.</li>
            <li> I am healthy, but would like to be about 10 pounds lighter.</li>
            <li> My skin feels more plumped up and fuller</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I use a firming skin lotion (one of the cheapest on the market) in conjunction, but also a healthy diet and exercise.</li>
            <li> Many people state, reports/</li>
            <li> The cream seems to be working better when used with this massage mitt.</li>
            <li> but I love this thing.</li>
            <li> glad I did.</li>
            <li> The product itself is ok.</li>
            <li> I order the bliss machine and it&#x27;s much better than this.</li>
            <li> i love this mitt</li>
            <li> I have now noticed more smoothness.</li>
            <li> I just received this massage mitt and I like it better than the type that I had years ago.  </li>
            <li> I feel a bit more confident now in my bathing suit.</li>
            <li> Please and thank you:)</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re anything like me then cellulite has been a nightmare since I was about 15, but like most people say I just got used to it.</li>
            <li> and it works better with cellulite cream.</li>
            <li> This method saves me a lot of money because I don&#x27;t go through as many Nivea tubes as I used to plus</li>
            <li> , I do not use this in the shower, I don&#x27;t know if it works better that way or not.</li>
            <li> but this one is better fits on my hand better to thank you</li>
            <li> I love ❤</li>
            <li> When the bruising disappeared a smoother, cellulite free and toned areas remained!</li>
            <li> I would definitely look into getting another for her because together they do an awesome job in doing what it is meant to do...control cellulite and tighten and tone desired parts of the body!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure given a couple more weeks that will improve as well.</li>
            <li> I want to love this, but, it broke the first time I went to use it!!!</li>
            <li> The first time!!!</li>
            <li> and i can notice great improvement on the appearance of my skin, mainly in my tights.</li>
            <li> but I bought it for myself as I have some minor cellulite, after trying it once I was actually really impressed</li>
            <li> Although so many types of remedies are available, women have to constantly keep trying procedures until they find what works best for them.</li>
            <li> Still there- but significant improvement!</li>
            <li> The product is easy to hold but creates very significant and patterned bruising on my thighs.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels more toned and smooth.</li>
            <li> I am a fit, healthy girl</li>
            <li> If they made the strap handle stronger or more secure</li>
            <li> so i am happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li> Really satisfied with the product and the people who shipped it:) and definitely hoping to win that 3 month supply on finulite.</li>
            <li> I do like this thing, it really does feel good.</li>
            <li> It really seems to be good for getting into the dimples and helping to bring circulation to &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; areas.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery, easy to handle mitt!!</li>
            <li> I have used other massaging mitts that have also worked, but this one is the best I&#x27;ve used yet.</li>
            <li> Fabulous works amazing my legs are super smooth, I recommend using vitamin e oil as lubricant.</li>
            <li> Bruises easily.</li>
            <li> The handle makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li> if your anything like me and bruise easily..</li>
            <li> My skin turned a nice flush pink and it felt great to massage it over my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I cant really tell if it works of not because the strap ripped after 3 uses.&lt;br /&gt;While I was able to use it, I liked it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m very impressed and happy with this new little beauty tool!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s seems logical that anything that might break up the tissue &amp;#34;pockets&amp;#34; that are holding the fat together under the skin might be effective.</li>
            <li> Getting rid of cellulite would be  a miracle but for what it&#x27;s supposed to do it works just fine.  </li>
            <li> I like the flexible handle, makes it easy to grip and feels secure.</li>
            <li> Its also less than $10 which is a great deal!</li>
            <li> I like it fine</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is light and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I can grip it just fine without needing the strap.</li>
            <li> Light and easy to pack and store.</li>
            <li> I know that many have stated they have worked on this situation, with no results, while others have seen tremendous results.</li>
            <li> Finulite Cellulite brush is pretty good feels good like an instant massage.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to work on my thighs and tush, I have mild cellulite and of course would love to look smooth for the spring and summer.</li>
            <li> So far pretty good!</li>
            <li> This is great, very simple, easy to use, clean and strong.</li>
            <li> and I already see a huge difference.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean as well.</li>
            <li> I am amazed at how effective this item really is.</li>
            <li> to allow for a comfortable fit.</li>
            <li> Great quality and definitely will not fall apart.</li>
            <li> it just helps to break up the fat cells and smooth out the puckering while the cellulite still lingers underneath the skin.</li>
            <li> It is also important to use lotion or soap on the area, to allow the mitt to move smoothly.</li>
            <li> and although the lotions fell short of what I was expecting, the massage mitt works great.</li>
            <li> I will completely be free of cellulite in my thighs.  </li>
            <li> Makes your legs feel smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li> almost cellulite free.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to primarily get rid of cellulite</li>
            <li> really enjoy using the product as I am losing weight.</li>
            <li> I have experienced a smoothing effect, after merely 12 short days.</li>
            <li> Got this free with the soap.</li>
            <li> Can say enough about how great this product it.</li>
            <li> The price is amazingly affordable &amp; I truly appreciate the fast delivery....</li>
            <li> Fortunately, the mitt fits in the palm of my hand</li>
            <li> &quot; so the thought came to mind that maybe this tool has such great reviews just for a \\&quot;prize\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It feels good to have a direct task to do for myself.  </li>
            <li> I really like it will give update soon on results doesn&#x27;t hurt at all lovely :)</li>
            <li> and really noticed a difference!!!</li>
            <li> and I will be as confident as ever with my new legs :)</li>
            <li> but all in all i looove this item and do recommend it to people wanting fast results! :)</li>
            <li> Also drink a lot of water, do cardio and all that fun stuff!</li>
            <li> When I first started using the product, I massaged in circular motions but I wasn&#x27;t sure what I was doing.</li>
            <li> This one is totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it so much that I am giving it to all my friends for Christmas!  </li>
            <li> BUY THIS PRODUCT, ITS WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> so far I haven&#x27;t seen any results for a month, maybe it takes more time I will give it one more chance</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to keep using it a few times a week, but it keeps my legs and butt smooth!!! :)</li>
            <li> Easy to do right out of shower.</li>
            <li> Product quality is great, it&#x27;s easy to hold even in the shower, and the massagers are deep but not too intense.</li>
            <li> and I can give a true description of how well it works.</li>
            <li> I love this product it actually took inches off,my clothes fit better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s true</li>
            <li> and I can tell it is definitely creating good circulation.  </li>
            <li> I really like this tool I bought two more for my daughters</li>
            <li> I can feel it really getting the finulite products to work their magic.</li>
            <li> Full on cottage cheese.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know which theory is true or not</li>
            <li> it gives a true workout for her arms as well.</li>
            <li> My leg is much darker in the right picture because I had a spray tan (Fake Bake Flawless is an amazing self tanner by the way!).</li>
            <li> Fair warning, it does hurt if you use it on dry and unmoisturized skin, but otherwise, this product is very useful</li>
            <li> and the other is greatly improved.</li>
            <li> After washing your hair - massage the legs, hips, belly, even arms.&lt;br /&gt;The Mitt is great for other reasons like blood flow and achy muscles.  </li>
            <li> My kids also like to do it for me, it&#x27;s fun for them ( as long as I am guiding them to do it right lol).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok i need to use it on a more regular basics.</li>
            <li> Super excelent product!&lt;br /&gt;Work</li>
            <li> super well!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Besides the mild bruising, I noticed a difference within a day of using it.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> Seems to be helping tremendously.</li>
            <li> yes, lucky me.</li>
            <li> The sort of tingle you get from a quick jog around the block on a brisk winter day.</li>
            <li> Item as described quick shipping</li>
            <li> The product was shipped and delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> I have gotten light bruising when doing the massaging very vigorously, but nothing like I did when I tried those suction cups!</li>
            <li> I was also surprised and extremely impressed to find that Saponified oils of Palm, Coconut, Olive and Palm Kernel are included in the soap, these combined oils are extremely helpful for the body, as well as Sea Salt.</li>

            <li> This Massage Mitt works greatly to help break down the diabolic cellulite together with the Finulite lotions.</li>
            <li> The new design is much better, the handle is a lot thicker</li>
            <li> This product is also good for getting rid of any skin irritation - the skin on the back of my thighs is a bit drier than the rest of my skin - the exfoliation this product offers cleared that issue right up :)</li>
            <li> My first reaction with this thing: &amp;#34;OUCHY&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend and was able to purchase this discreetly via mail instead of in public.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> It does cause mild bruising when first using, but it works fantastic if you remain consistent.  </li>
            <li> This thing really does smooth out my skin.</li>
            <li> and I am pleased with the results thus far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Plus, those areas have been more sensitive.</li>
            <li> I love it so far it makes my skin smoother feeling looks</li>
            <li> This is really powerful.</li>
            <li> This Cellulite Massager Mitt I have already had success with.</li>
            <li> and I am pleased so far.</li>
            <li> Worth the $10.</li>
            <li> It is actually pretty cool.</li>
            <li> its not the most comfortable and will make your legs red right after using...</li>
            <li> It does leave mild bruising after first couple uses but the end result is worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rate it higher except the strap broke so quickly.  </li>
            <li> right?  </li>
            <li> So worth the money (though I wish I&#x27;d ordered it so much sooner!)</li>
            <li> More apparent and had dimply holes</li>
            <li> ultimately exercise and eating right are your best bet...and staying hydrated, but I do think this gives a nicer smoother look and helps the circulation and sloughing off dead skin.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure it might take a little more scrubbing.</li>
            <li> This is very useful and a nice little gift as well.</li>
            <li> and yes it does hurt because this awesome device reaches deep inside your trouble areas, all over the body, not just the thighs...</li>
            <li> So far so good... only been using it for a bit</li>
            <li> I was also impressed that the outside of the envelope was marked “FRAGILE,” which is very helpful to alert Carriers when handling and delivering packages.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product arrive very fast.  </li>
            <li> It really does help to minimize cellulite!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect miracles, you have to really WORK and commit!</li>
            <li> This is the first cellulite massage mitt for the shower that I have ever purchased.  </li>
            <li> It bruised at first</li>
            <li> All the spongy lumps I would feel under my thighs are smoothed out after using this consistently for a week.</li>
            <li> When I first started using this product, yes my thigh did bruise</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this type of product</li>
            <li> As for the cellulite, I&#x27;m still working on it along with excersie &amp; lots of water ;)</li>
            <li> Very helpful!</li>
            <li> At first I didnt want to use based on some reviews but you have to just try things for yourself.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> Vendor delivered exactly the product that was promised.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It really does reduce the appearance of cellulite!</li>
            <li> if you know you can be consistent</li>
            <li> What a torture a woman go through to look pretty....  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have used it daily for more than a year</li>
            <li> Some results, very smoothing!  </li>
            <li> You must combine the use of the mitt with a healthy fitness and nutrition regimen to actually get rid of the cellulite</li>
            <li> However, do be aware of the strength you use this mitt.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> with this routine, I incorporate 8 glasses of water back into my diet and started working out about 2-3 days a week to get the most out of this product and what it has to offer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this item for 3 weeks now consistently</li>
            <li> I use mine several times a week and love it.</li>
            <li> Must be consistent to see results.  </li>
            <li> This Massage Mitt really circulates the blood flow!</li>
            <li> I was surprised when I opened the package to find that it was the Finulite Cellulite Smoothing Massage Mitt with the FREE Exfoliating Bar Soap that was offered with the order.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get a lot of bruising after the first day like others have said.</li>
            <li> I think I  actually like the Zoom Groom better.</li>
            <li> Broke after using it the first time.  </li>
            <li> and it has my tights and butt looking better than they have looked in the last 5 years</li>
            <li> *sigh, leg days*).</li>
            <li> The first day I used this product I noticed an increase in urination.</li>
            <li> I use the mitt in the shower with my favorite body wash and immediately I can feel it working in my deep tissues.</li>
            <li> It got here so fast!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many different cellulite creams</li>
            <li> I used this on my thighs with the Finulite cream and in the shower with regular body soap and it made my skin super smooth.</li>
            <li> One more thing--the strap is extremely sturdy and you actually do not have to put your hand through the hole to use it effectively.</li>
            <li> I recommend Arnica gel to rub on after use, if you have tender spots that might turn into a bruise: I think it really helps prevent them from forming when applied right after massaging.</li>
            <li> Many pure skin oils work well for this, as do some of the anticellulite gels or lotions, (though I am uncertain if the latter work without the massage as well).</li>
            <li> I had some St. Ives cellulite lotion that I used but probably need to look for something a little more advanced.</li>
            <li> but my thighs slimmed down from the swelling and looked much better!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s an ingenious design that did what even daily lymphatic drainage with the dry skin brush hadn&#x27;t been able to do in a year.</li>
            <li> She says the positive reviews on here were probably from the makers or something.</li>
            <li> and even I am seeing positive results in the smoothness of her skin and that the cellulite is becoming smaller...</li>
            <li> First off, I dieted very strictly...</li>
            <li> Still on the hunt for a solution, I searched high and low, read more reviews than I care to admit, and landed on this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple and easy.</li>
            <li> (I find it easy to use while watching TV) and alternate legs each day.</li>
            <li> and I felt like it would be less effective for whatever reason.</li>
            <li> I recently started drinking a lot of water too, more than normal, and I think that has also helped.  </li>
            <li> my carbs came from my fruits and veggies, carbs has insulin which actually maintains or increases cellulite appearance), wasn&#x27;t easy</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the time I decided to place my order; they were also offering a limited-time ONLY Special, allowing customers to receive a FREE EXFOLIATING BAR SOAP with the order, provided you met the requirements.</li>
            <li> I still had abnormally large fat deposits and bat wings.</li>
            <li> But certainly the mitt can&#x27;t hurt and is not an ongoing investment</li>
            <li> This item is easy to use and does a nice job of massaging my legs and behind.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a huge improvement in my skin yet, but I&#x27;m only two weeks into it.</li>
            <li> Thanking the Seller for a great offer, and I will definitely leave an update in a few weeks about my experience using the Finulite Massager Mitt and Exfoliating Bar Soap simultaneously.livering</li>
            <li> Thanking the Seller for a great offer, and I will definitely leave an update in a few weeks about my experience using the Finulite Massager Mitt and Exfoliating Bar Soap simultaneously.</li>
            <li> I use it for a few minutes on each leg a night and it feels amazing.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really help cellulite.</li>
            <li> ; at around 8:30PM to massage my WHOLE body before I get in the shower with a body scrub.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know if the mitt works.</li>
            <li> Another reviewer recommended the Kong Zoom Groom, which would be a much cheaper alternative, though I haven&#x27;t tried it.</li>
            <li> This has really helped break up the cellulite.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even realize I had that much cellulite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m noticing a real improvement.</li>
            <li> (Those require a LOT of time, as there is a *real* learning curve.)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It really does work ladies</li>
            <li> I try to drink as much water as I can</li>
            <li> I like it so much that I have bought one for my sister and one for friend.</li>
            <li> You have to do this twice a day for about six to eight weeks to really see results.</li>
            <li> I cannot really say since I just started using.&lt;br /&gt;CO</li>
            <li> You can really feel it working.</li>
            <li> but I am very upset with this product.</li>
            <li> It doesnt even hurt really.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> and there is plenty of room for a larger hand to fit into the hand-strap.</li>
            <li> You have to stay consisted with it if you want real results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about the creams, but this this thing really great.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really notice much of a difference.</li>
            <li> Really works to get your blood circulating.</li>
            <li> Skin feels and looks much smoother.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> but with much improvement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I dont even use it anymore because to bruised me too much.</li>
            <li> REally Feel It</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice anything and irritates the skin so much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now an indispensable part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li> I really do like this product</li>
            <li> if used as instructed you can really feel an increase in blood circulation which is supposed to help reduce the appearance of cellulite.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> IT took about 2 months to really become a believer.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This mitt is very durable.</li>
            <li> and I am really seeing results.</li>
            <li> but the cream dries really fast and gets sticky.</li>
            <li> each item wrapped visibly, securely, and individually.</li>
            <li> each item wrapped visibly, securely, and individually.</li>
            <li> It really helps to improve the circulation in the desired area.</li>
            <li> I only paid about $13 for mine with free shipping</li>
            <li> It looks like it would really hurt</li>
            <li> With perseverance, I think it really works.</li>
            <li> gentle...</li>
            <li> I am very picky when it comes to purchases online</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> but you have to hold the whole mitt in your hand to use it.</li>
            <li> The straps come off and the whole thing comes apart.  </li>
            <li> you can really tell that blood flows to the area after massaging.</li>
            <li> this can really make a difference in your fat distribution.</li>
            <li> I had one bruise early on, but have learned to avoid the sensitive areas (near a tendon on the side of my knee) and stick to the more cushiony areas of my thighs.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend getting the massage mitt if you are purchasing the lotions!</li>
            <li> I use it rather gently</li>
            <li> This really does help push away cellulite.</li>
            <li> It will really help you alot.</li>
            <li> IT REALLY DOES DO WHAT IS SAYS MY CELLULITE IN MY BELLY IS ALMOST DISSAPEARES</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t care too much for it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have as much.</li>
            <li> And really that&#x27;s what i&#x27;m trying to achieve.  </li>
            <li> Also even though it kinda hurts I really have been digging in when I use the mitt</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own without a heavy residue.  </li>
            <li> I have even read that natural castor oil (bought in a health store) actually works better</li>
            <li> , it felt really cool on my hips, legs and glutes, the mentioned areas were really red and hot</li>
            <li> I have used this product before from a different company and have been satisfied so far with this one too.</li>
            <li> My doctor told me that I had developed tendonitis in my right arm.  </li>
            <li> I was very optimistic after reading reviews of this and many other brands.</li>
            <li> I got even more results doing leglifts and plow pose, as well as other yoga poses like it.</li>
            <li> I go to Mexico at Xmas every year and find that if I start using this brush and Nivea daily for 6 wks in advance, the cellulite diminishes significantly.</li>
            <li> one.&lt;br /&gt;You will need some kind of oil to use for this to glide across your skin and not rub it raw.  </li>
            <li> Expect some bruising at first, this goes away as skin gets more  firm.</li>
            <li> I do not normal bruise easy.</li>
            <li> I have to say most things I order never live up to the hype or reviews, but this one has far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> You can try re-attaching the strap, but it doesn&#x27;t stay; also you have to pry the edges apart to get it re-attached in the first place, which runs the considerable risk of cracking the plastic.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what it contains to be so crazily effective</li>
            <li> I love this mitt so much, its not even expensive like most creams and cellulite remedies are and it works so well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first fewtimes, my skinwas really sensitive to the touch</li>
            <li> but i think i will have to break down and buy some cellulite creme to make it work better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of weeks, good massage tool but no significant difference.</li>
            <li> You still have to watch your diet and eat less fat and drink more water.</li>
            <li> Without lotion, I just push with less intensity and it feels more like a massage/brush.  </li>
            <li> after a couple of times I did notice my skin looking more taut and less dimply.</li>
            <li> and I tend to bruise QUICK, but that is only prove that this thing is doing it&#x27;s work!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve notice that it leaves my thighs &amp; back of my legs really smooth &amp; soft.</li>
            <li> After a fairly rigorous massage before bedtime, the next morning you should notice a *substantial* diminishment of bumpy, \\&quot;lunar surface\\&quot; skin, and see a smoother, firmer appearance in the trouble spots.</li>
            <li> Mostly &amp;#34;orange peel&amp;#34; looking cellulite (back legs, butt), but a couple deep dimples on my sides...</li>
            <li> What I like to do is get a decent amount of lotion, put some on my skin (not rubbing it in) and let the massager do the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is useful and strong enough to do something and soft enough not to break the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Highly recommend and plan on buying one for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the massage mitt to anyone that has issues with stubborn cellulite.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this prodcut.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what else to add, but I hope this little tool helps you as it has me, or even more</li>
            <li> I love this little mitt.</li>
            <li> I get little bruises but it works faster and more efficiently that way.</li>
            <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t seen much (if any improvement).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li> Thank you for creating such a useful product.</li>
            <li> is a few dollars more than this</li>
            <li> so i wasn&#x27;t able to use it long enough to see results.</li>
            <li> suggest you put more of the shower gel on the pad and rub it vigorously all over your legs firmly .</li>
            <li> I will update after more use as I am not sure how much it is working just yet.  </li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think the extra 2 minutes it takes me to use this thing would help by much, but after 3 weeks of using it together with the finulite cream</li>

            <li> But there is NO Doubt in my mind that this product works as a stand-alone product because with consistency you will be moving the fatty deposits to make a smoother and more defined appearance on the skin surface.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t normally leave comments.  </li>
            <li> I saw result within a few weeks :).  </li>
            <li> Havent been using very long, but in about two weeks, I have noticed some more smoothness when used daily in the shower and with the AM/PM lotions.  </li>
            <li> The picture on the left was taken 02/18/15 and the picture on the right was taken 03/02/15.</li>
            <li> The strap on the mitt has held up fine but is definitely on the larger size.</li>
            <li> I recommend buying this if you try any cellulite reducing product, at least then, you will be able to see if the product being used with the mitt is being utilized to its full potential.</li>
            <li> When I use this \\&quot;mitt\\&quot;, I massage firmly --hard enough to know I&#x27;ve done some good.</li>
            <li> This item should last a very long time and bought more soap to keep it busy.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it removes cellulite, but will keep using good massage tool after a long workout.</li>
            <li> Am v self conscious about my cellulite as you get older</li>
            <li> I may try using it again very softly, but I don&#x27;t know if it will work without pressure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve still been using it, only very gently for some added massaging to my bumpy thighs.</li>
            <li> Be careful though, I have left several small brusies on my thighs, which aren&#x27;t very attractive!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Aside from that, a design flaw which is not inconsiderable, this little massage tool does a LOT right!!</li>
            <li> I believe this is the same product that is sold in a kit with other products, and it is definitely more affordable this way.  </li>
            <li> (maybe more only if cellulite is \\&quot;ubiquitous\\&quot;), you should notice enough improvement to raise your spirits big time!</li>
            <li> This item actually worked on my thighs and arms with the first usage.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I have stage three cellulite with some deep indentations; have had it for over 20 years and know that it will take continuous and consistent use and that the results are gradual but</li>
            <li> not much to say other than its constructed nicely</li>
            <li> At first I was only using the cream and that progress also work</li>
            <li> This is EXACTLY what I needed for that last step.</li>
            <li> so, I am not sure seems okay and working .</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if it is this or the creams that is helping more.  </li>
            <li> Any improvement I&#x27;ve seen is most likely due to the workouts I&#x27;ve been doing (</li>
            <li> i like this , it seems to work pretty , but ive only used it a couple of times</li>
            <li> Starting using a few weeks ago, Don&#x27;t see or feel much difference, May need to use longer to see better results</li>
            <li> Typically, these types of mitts are made of a soft rubber that glide over you easily.</li>
            <li> This is not an equivalent to a swedish massage, this mitt breaks down the cellulite and allows your skin to look smooth.  </li>
            <li> This works, as long as you eat right, go to the gym and drink a lot of water.</li>
            <li> I am a light skinned black woman.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I&#x27;ve loved the results and the new proportionate shape.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect, it&#x27;s less expensive, and it has Prime shipping.</li>
            <li> me tell you, I was using the Nivea Serum on its own, I rubbed and massaged with my hands very hard for 15 minutes twice a day for two weeks</li>
            <li> but here is my scoop on how I rid myself of my most obvious bumps in as little as one week.</li>
            <li> Just be sure not to press too hard when massaging or you may bruise yourself.</li>
            <li> WOW  </li>
            <li> I used this along with NuElle Triple Action Anti-Cellulite Concentrate</li>
            <li> It looks as though with the basic concept, they&#x27;re really onto something.</li>
            <li> My cellulite problem started when I developed circulatory issues.</li>
            <li> I used it several times and did not like how it really hurts</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised by this product.  </li>
            <li> shipping was  timely and professionally packaged</li>
            <li> So far, I have not had any problems with the handle coming off.</li>
            <li> As far as cellulite ummmmm</li>
            <li> Would recommend it&#x27;s long as you are consistent with its use.</li>
            <li> Wow, what a difference.</li>
            <li> I am a professional massage therapist</li>
            <li> If YOu Have Sensitive Skin&lt;br</li>
            <li> my thighs are about 90% improved ... and SO SMOOTH and FIRM ...  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to matter how much I worked out at this stage of my life, I could not lose the cellulite on the back of my legs and stomach.</li>
            <li> If we were to take a poll/voting inquiry or survey most women would admit this is common in women of all sizes, shapes, and ethnicity.</li>
            <li> so far no complaints</li>
            <li> But my cellulite is almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> I like it, so far.</li>
            <li> It has been over 30 days now, and wow what a difference in the appearance of my legs, butt and stomach.</li>
            <li> so I will have to come back and tell you if it really works.</li>
            <li> Try eating foods with few or no additives, and be sure to exercise regularly if you want faster results.</li>
            <li> and I honestly think the cellulite is worse.</li>
            <li> Seller  has advertised accurately about the Finulite Cellulite Smoothing Massage Mitt which is extremely easy to handle, can be rinsed easily as not get filled with soap scum, residue from liquid soaps, or other oils.</li>
            <li> I love this product only giving it a four because this is my second time purchasing after the band broke on my first from regular use, but it was after a year and a half.</li>
            <li> My cellulite was mild in some places, average in others.</li>
            <li> it breaks way easy but its not a huge deal because i can use the item without the strap anyway!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit uncomfortable and may cause bruising and redness at first, but once that irritation goes down, your legs feel pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> Mostly my hands though trying to apply that much force and twisting at the same time is no good.</li>
            <li> I lost quite a bit of progress by not using much once it became such a hassle, so now  I have to start again, but it does seem as though the new one is slightly different, with a stronger strap.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle cellulite product if there ever was one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I scrubbed the heck out of my upper legs the first day I got it using a regular body wash.</li>
            <li> With this band you won&#x27;t drop it in the shower and it is such a high quality rubber</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s been a problem since the 7th grade when the boy sitting next to me in jr high school asked why I had dimples in my thighs...</li>
            <li> do get tired when using the mitt (even though my arms are quite strong), but I think it&#x60;s a plus (everybody wants to burn some calories).&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> This is easy to use in the shower daily and not a huge commitment.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this little mitt in the shower with a basic cheap body wash.  </li>
            <li> And, if you do feel some tender areas after the first use, don&#x27;t be a wimp: remember you should become way less sensitive with frequent treatments; just keep in mind you do need a lubricant while massaging.</li>
            <li> When I woke up the first thing I did was check on my leg and SURPRISINGLY my cellulite had almost vanished (all except this one stubborn Mount Everest which went from terrible to mild).</li>
            <li> I have noticed a huge difference in only a few weeks with this product.</li>
            <li> For months I have been considering an alternate procedure to work on the little cellulite I have, through exercising and eating correctly, it has not completely diminished, somewhat improved, with more work needed to reach a satisfactory resolution for myself.</li>
            <li> At first glance, it seems that it will be very rough and coarse, but actually is quite gentle.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if it&#x27;s the Mitt that prevents/reduces cellulite that well, because I also have a healthy diet (no added sugar, moderate salt and low fat) and do yoga, pilates and spin.</li>
            <li> I would buy it again, no regrets!</li>
            <li> The mild spots went away almost immediately, the worse areas took a few more days</li>
            <li> While reading what contents were in the EXFOLIATING SOAP, I was surprised to see that it has Peppermint &amp; Green Tea with Crushed Green Coffee Beans (Arabica), 100% natural, preservative free, no artificial color or fragrance in the soap.</li>

            <li> The top half where you put your hand broke off from the massaging bottom half.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tad painful on dry skin but in the shower when your skin is wet, it glides very smoothly and feels really nice.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it religiously, so I can&#x27;t comment adamantly, but I do feel like</li>
            <li> I also use it on my stomach ,butt , arms, also my back as far as I can reach.  </li>
            <li> The nibs on it are harder than I thought it would be, but it works really well.</li>
            <li> and WOW I can totally see and feel a difference!</li>
            <li> 18 yrs old and have cellulite on the back of my thighs.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as torturous as I expected though it does leave your legs pretty red.</li>
            <li> Maybe I am doing it wrong, but honestly you just need to work out.  </li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;m on the thin side, but being over 60, my skin is thinner that it use to be and shows every bump.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m doing this method in half the time as the hands-no-mitt way and yet the results are so much quicker!</li>
            <li> The trick is using it daily or at first then backing off to every other day when you are where you want to be.  </li>
            <li> I will post an update if I see a substantial improvement in the design, but I do wish I had tried to return the old one as soon as it broke, because I was planning to use it as my \\&quot;travel\\&quot; massager, the one to keep packed, but I realized the first time I tried it when away, I should have just gotten 2 new ones because using it is such a pain, (awkward to fit within the distance you can open your hand to grasp by the edges)</li>
            <li> Must say that this product got to me very quickly, much sooner than expected!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be alarmed when your thighs look a dimpled mess when you first use this product.</li>
            <li> Anyway, after about a week of use (5-15min, sometimes twice a day depending on how much time I have) I must say I do notice a difference, its not much, but it is noticeable!</li>
            <li> we use for our dog is designed on exactly the same principle:  soft but firm rubbery tips that massage and stimulate circulation.</li>
            <li> Just stay broad and don&#x27;t press down to the bone too much.</li>
            <li> On the positive side I think it gets the blood flowing because I would feel a slight tingling in some places.</li>
            <li> This was my second time purchasing this product and based on my previous satisfaction with my first use, I ordered again.</li>
            <li> It absorbs into the skin quickly and helps with breaking down some fat, gives you asmoother and softer appearance and works well with this tool seeing as it is rough on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now that they&#x27;ve finally been fixed, I can focus on the smaller problem resulting from the bigger one.</li>
            <li> Not sure it is worth it, however I am not using it as often as recommended.</li>
            <li> As some have stated, it caused some bruising the first few times I used it</li>
            <li> Then I dialed down to gentle rub.</li>
            <li> Usually mitts will glide right off when soapy and fall.  </li>
            <li> First few days, I left marks on my thighs.</li>
            <li> Just be careful if you have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It makes a huge difference!&lt;br /&gt;You have to be dedicated &amp; use it daily for as long as you can &amp; rub fairly hard...</li>
            <li> and I really believe it does break down the fat!</li>
            <li> but I mean, thats not even a lot oftime and your barely spending that much money on it!</li>
            <li> I decided to rotate the mitt slowly without lifting it which was right on point because it definitely lessened the pain.</li>
            <li> I have only used this a few times mainly because I don&#x27;t have 5-20 minutes to rub it into my skin twice a day.</li>
            <li> I also received two other offers from the company when I opened the package.</li>
            <li> I also received two other offers from the company when I opened the package.</li>
            <li> So I use this product starting on my lower thighs with long strokes until I hit my upper thigh, promoting proper lymph and blood circulation.</li>
            <li> but now there is a flat spot going through the middle could never rub or even it out and believe me I tried.</li>
            <li> The Zoom Groom is technically for animals with long fur, but it looks the same as the mitt and the rubber nubs are flexible.</li>
            <li> It feels sturdy and I think it should last a long time with extensive use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be sure to drink lots of water because you&#x27;ll want to help flush the broken down fat.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable to hold while massaging and working on cellulite areas, the grooves are not too hard, yet firm enough to help with the process.</li>
            <li> though I work out daily and eat and clean/healthy diet, it wasn&#x27;t until I started using the mitt that I noticed the puckering on my outer thighs and behind my legs was becoming less noticeable, especially the morning after use.</li>
            <li> You will notice lighter skin in just the first night; but you gotta keep doing it, every night or at least 2 times a week.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is helping my cellulite so much</li>
            <li> I have not been using it long enough to see results.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to know if it will truly reduce cellulite</li>
            <li> my inner thighs had the fatty cottage cheese look with stretch marks from having my son and not only is the texture and apprerence considerably improved, but</li>
            <li> You will bruise at first because the tissue is thick and toxic.  </li>
            <li> &quot; long; the bigger nubbins are about 1/4\\&quot; long.</li>
            <li> The rubber tips on this little contraption are firm, yet pliable and dig right into my lumpy imperfections.</li>
            <li> Use a good, moisturizing soap, though it will only make it slightly less painful.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t see them, but I can feel them and always get a little self conscious getting a massage.</li>
            <li> So far I see little results</li>
            <li> I saw my skin bruise a little but had no pain until actually the next day when I begin to use it on the same areas again.</li>
            <li> Obviously if your cellulite is bad, you should spend about 20 minutes doing it and definitely do it twice a day, it works better.</li>
            <li> My experience with the brush and the gel is that you need to start using them at least 6 weeks before you really need to see results.</li>
            <li> I like this scrubber, it seems effective in reducing the ugly orange peel, and I decided to order another to put in my travel bag.</li>
            <li> If you have one of the old design ones, and it falls apart, try to return it, because after just a few uses, it should not fall apart like that, and you be out your 10 bucks--</li>
            <li> My cellulite &amp;#34;seems&amp;#34; to be improving, but I still have a long way to go.  </li>
            <li> It has diminished some cellulite but not much of my problem areas on back of thighs.</li>
            <li> I just put body wash on my cellulite areas and rub for awhile or as long as i want.  </li>
            <li> I did all my research on how long I should workout, how I should and when to stop.</li>
            <li> Because of another minor surgery.</li>
            <li> Sounds funny, but I have my boyfriend use on behind and the back of my legs because I can&#x27;t seem to reach those areas</li>
            <li> My skin is definitely smoother and less dimpled - the last couple of smoothing mitts went to friends when they saw the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But the smoother overall tone makes the cellulite appear less obvious.</li>
            <li> I have extremely stubborn cellulite all over my back legs, buttocks, and hips.</li>
            <li> Also I have been doing speed walking and other exercises.&lt;br /&gt;Happy to report that this is working as the back of my legs are looking firmer and also smoother!</li>
            <li> and I got hives due to the soap and the chemically wall spray mixed.</li>
            <li> I use the product with Eveline&#x27;s Slim Extreme 3D after the shower as well useing it in the shower with regular gel soap.</li>
            <li> using Slim Extreme 3D has made my stretch marks practically vanish (the white ones)!</li>
            <li> and I came across something called dry brushing.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using it dry or with some leftover almond oil.</li>
            <li> The reason I continue to use it is because your not supposed to use the mitt on dry skin</li>
            <li> After a few sessions of regular use, only 5 -10 minutes for *</li>
            <li> This makes it more difficult to maintain a firm group and affects the quality of use.  </li>
            <li> Definitely notice a difference if only slight!</li>
            <li> all thanks to hormones, stress from work, and the 30 pounds I have gained in the past year and a half.</li>
            <li> It may be my imagination, but I also seem to have less swelling in my legs when standing for long periods of time when I use it daily.</li>
            <li> However, there have been two lingering unusual hard fatty tissue deposits that never went away, one on each arm in different places.</li>
            <li> I bought one a few months ago, and after not that many uses, the hand strap got detached on one end, so I was left with an awkward, hold-by-one-end, strap.</li>
            <li> I did bruise a lot, so be prepared to be black and blue after using it.</li>
            <li> Using this item was the only difference for me in a typical day to have caused this I did start to see improvement in what I would describe as &amp;#34;dimpling&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Though the first few times I used it, I scrubbed so hard, I made bruises on my legs, so be careful.</li>
            <li> My problem areas are now not only smoother but also more supple and less painful to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I wish I had known about this simple little product years</li>
            <li> Be quiet and take a little bruising.  </li>
            <li> Even using in the shower with soap to lubricate the mitt, the glove still leaves lots and lots of little bruises all over the back of my thigh.</li>
            <li> It hurts a little, but seriously it only took a couple times to start seeing results.</li>
            <li> You do have to scrub hard which left my legs quite red</li>
            <li> Yes, there are still dimples, but what was the rolling hills with deep valleys is no more like minor grooves in the road.</li>
            <li> I only use my organic cleanser and firmly rub this mitt on my thighs.  </li>
            <li> I have also increased my workouts, eating a low fat/low carb organic diet, plenty of water, and I sweat everyday.  </li>
            <li> Keep it in your shower so you see it everyday and you will use it in your daily routine.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be rough on my skin</li>
            <li> Just what I&#x27;m expected.</li>
            <li> It is harder to use that way.</li>
            <li> With this baby, not really.</li>
            <li> Be careful though, don&#x27;t be rough with it...</li>
            <li> If you go with this product please be careful and don&#x27;t overwork your hand.  </li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times</li>
            <li> I hope to continue this with vigorous exercise to see results in the next few months.  </li>
            <li> Not much effort needed.</li>
            <li> so not much is going to work for me (120 lbs.</li>
            <li> Your skin should be wet or oiled.</li>
            <li> advise there really is not a “written in stone” procedure to rid you of cellulite permanently.</li>
            <li> I see a big difference, but you must use it everyday and with a cellulite cream to see a change.</li>
            <li> Be careful with this caused bruising to my legs.</li>
            <li> I can feel the lotion actually working after I&#x27;ve massaged my problem areas for a few minutes each.</li>
            <li> After only a few days, i noticed improvements.</li>
            <li> Not too rough.  </li>
            <li> Week one not much had happened but it now has been two weeks</li>
            <li> You know what they say: &amp;#34;No pain - no gain&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Leaving to Europe after a few weeks, even though there is not much space in my luggage, I will definitely take this thing with me.</li>
            <li> I have spent a lot of bucks on products over the last few years, hoping to find something that worked.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m in the process of getting fit, but I have a hard time getting rid of the puckering on my outer thighs as well as behind my legs due to stubborn cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Again, I&#x27;m not really large anywhere else.</li>
            <li> This thing scratches your skin pretty badly if you have sensitive skin like me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done EVERYTHING to get rid of cellulite!&lt;br /&gt;Drastically cutting back on carbs in favour of fresh veg, significantly increasing my water intake, daily dry skin brushing before showers, rinsing with freezing water after showers and exercising on an elliptical trainer 3 times a week - that got me from having terrible cellulite, with dimples, bumps and what looked like Giant&#x27;s Causeway when you pinched the skin, to skin and muscle tone</li>
            <li> i had cellulite with the help of this mitt and slim extreme 3d</li>
            <li> Been using this every to every other day.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the appearance of cellulite is lessened only by this mitt...</li>
            <li> I use this 3 times a week, the other days I use my bliss machine.</li>
            <li> Although it takes a little work like arm strength &amp; a little patience, this actually works.</li>
            <li> I give this item a three due to the fact that the strap started to tear three weeks into treatment.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give at all like the ones made by Bliss or other companies.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this happens to other customers</li>
            <li> I am using the mitt every other day in the shower.  </li>
            <li> The next day there were a few bruises but guess what!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any bruises either but that could be because I know how to apply pressure due to my profession.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to other people, including Amazon Customers.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to other people, including Amazon Customers.</li>
            <li> In the daylight I am beginning to see the difference in my skin texture along with using the other products.</li>
            <li> I noticed after about a week of use small red spider veins on the areas where I used it.</li>
            <li> other reviewers said this takes patience and hardwork, they were not kidding.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of hard to use and a bit painful.  </li>
            <li> I thought losing weight would do the trick, but alas, 20 pounds and countless miles ran later, I weighed 120 pounds and still, like a face tattoo</li>
            <li> It definitely helped blend a few trouble spots.</li>
            <li> I usually add 6-8 drops of lemon essential oil to a table spoon of coconut oil or any other carrier oil and massage it into my thighs with circular motion (working out my arms along the way!).</li>
            <li> the bristles are very hard if you are looking for a soft one</li>
            <li> and I seriously feel like I pulled all my muscles and can barely walk.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little harder to hold now, but I can still use it.</li>
            <li> i used 3 times a week my skin feels little bit smoother than it was, not what i was expected</li>
            <li> I use it 1-2 a day and make circular motions on my thighs, but perhaps I&#x27;m not pressing hard enough (?)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s moderately hard and doesn&#x27;t hurt you but at the same time you can feel the pressure.</li>
            <li> The only thing is the strap sucks..</li>
            <li> Not fun.</li>
            <li> Not worth what I paid for it.  </li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s not worth it, get one from the dollar store and try it out.  </li>
            <li> I have seen some improvement of my cellulite, however, I have been doing a lot of squats and lunges lately, so that is probably what is actually helping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a week but have seen no results so far, not too painful but does turn my skin red.</li>
            <li> Now that i am almost recovered, no more excuse.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried dry brushing to little effect and that would take weeks!</li>
            <li> It exfoliates the skin and breaks down cellulite.  </li>
            <li> I use it with lipogel.it breaks down the fat in your stomach.</li>
            <li> Now that summer is winding down</li>
            <li> You Can Feel It Breaking Down The Cellulite</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually down a size in my jeans.</li>
            <li> Broke down way too soon</li>
            <li> By the end of the night I looked down on my beaten leg, bruised and throbbing, and cried.</li>
            <li> The little nubs are somewhat sharp and scratch the skin.  </li>
            <li> I think if it wasnt sharp!  </li>
            <li> Can be sharp, as the knobs are a little pointy-</li>
            <li> I just put the cream on dry skin until its slick and supple feeling, then massage the mitt very roughly over the areas for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> People should be very careful!</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a little painful, but very worth it.</li>
            <li> And my skin feels tigh and with less visible cellulite.</li>
            <li> After using the mitt, I was covered in black and purple bruises.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin smoother and helps with slight cellulite.</li>
            <li> Use about once a week or less to maintain.</li>
            <li> There is less of it.</li>
            <li> That being said, I think if you were diligent and used it everyday and have a average amount of cellulite, that it would help to minimize the appearance of it.</li>
            <li> unfortunately I haven&#x27;t really noticed any changes in my cellulite over the past 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Maybe I have use it a little longer</li>
            <li> I use it with a little body oil in the shower.</li>
            <li> Does Bruise You Up A Little</li>
            <li> Not worth the money!</li>
            <li> To give a little background, I&#x27;m a certified web designer, online marketer and a nutritionist (combining all skills).</li>
            <li> My butt though is a little tougher</li>
            <li> it is hard and rough..</li>
            <li> did not like to rough on the skin prongs hard on the skin, will not recommend it.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s likely because you&#x27;re afraid to use it vigorously enough!</li>
            <li> Been using it  just over a week and have definitely seen improvement, I use it with any old cream, I am bruised, it is painful</li>
            <li> I also have been body brushing everyday too.  </li>
            <li> I started using this product everyday in the beginning of February.</li>
            <li> Swollen, bruised, and sore fatty deposit legs and butt</li>
            <li> It removes dead skin and you can see it on the massage mitt.</li>
            <li> My legs feel firm after every usuage.</li>
            <li> Of course, you need to aid in the tissues&#x27; ridding themselves of trapped toxins and cellular waste products by drinking plenty of water.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work and it was just a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the Finulite Cellulite Smoothing Massage Mitt after reading a few reviews.  </li>
            <li> I think it was a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> It took about two weeks (and thank goodness for the review saying there would be redness) but it disappears in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I have been using this everyday for almost one month.  </li>
            <li> I work out everyday</li>
            <li> nibs are firm yet flexible.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> The brush itself is harsh</li>
            <li> waste of money.</li>
            <li> I think about this cellulite product almost everyday.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your $12 on this product.</li>
            <li> waste of time and discomfort and don&#x27;t have the patience to bug myself with it</li>
            <li> a few days after using.</li>
            <li> And in the direct sunlight it is downright scary looking.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this item at first</li>
            <li> EVERYDAY</li>
            <li> It must be too harsh.</li>
            <li> read some reviews that gave this product one star because of the bruises, or how harsh it is.</li>
            <li> I had to stop using the Finulite for a few few weeks.</li>
            <li> So instead I would press very hard and drag the massager up and down the length of my thighs.  </li>
            <li> It seems as though the makers have improved the quality of this little \\&quot;mitt\\&quot; in the past few months.</li>
            <li> After 6 weeks of using it on a regular basis, I can tell you the results have been dramatic.</li>
            <li> There was a small amount of bruising in spots but nothing that didn&#x27;t disappear in a few hours if not a day or two.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, there were still some dimples, saddlebags and what looked like cottage cheese when I sat down!!</li>
            <li> and I saw very little improvement.</li>
            <li> I been using this massager for months (I am lazy...), once a week.</li>
            <li> usually have my &amp;#34;me time&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Assuming you can get past this...</li>
            <li> and it gets off dead skin!</li>
            <li> Use it everyday!</li>
            <li> Overall, I get the feeling that if I use this thingy regularly for 6 weeks or so, cellulite will become an ex-problem; then if I stick with it, the nasty stuff won&#x27;t be coming back.</li>
            <li> but I got lazy and stopped using it.</li>
            <li> The only problem with this mitt is that it is difficult to use in the shower.</li>
            <li> The item is shown as listed, just not really sure if it works</li>
            <li> Pointless-</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure if they&#x27;ll heal up completely--it&#x27;s been awhile now.</li>
            <li> My small hand holds it well</li>
            <li> This is not a magic cure that will cure you of those yucky bumps.</li>
            <li> Dropped this in the shower and a small piece of it broke off.  </li>
            <li> a scale if 1-10, 10 being the most horrific (think cover of trashy celeb magazine)</li>
            <li> When I received my order, I was wondering what could be packed so neatly and in a small package.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it works</li>
            <li> I exercised excessively.</li>
            <li> After two shoulder injuries, one back injuries, and physical therapy that spanned over 5 years, i came to the sudden cruel realization of the word cellulite on the day i restarted my workout routine.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it will take away cellulite</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to say which is working or by how much.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It says you have to rub hard to break up the fat deposits which sounds like it makes sense</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use it hard on my legs.</li>
            <li> It doesnt hurt my skin at all even when rubbing hard.</li>
            <li> But in order for it to work you have to press hard.</li>
            <li> The problem was that it wrecked my arm because I had to press so hard while making circular motions across my legs.  </li>
            <li> This thing is hard.</li>
            <li> It is made well and is constructed out of a hard rubber which can be used in the shower.</li>
            <li> The strap handle broke after a month of using it, so now it&#x27;s hard to use.  </li>
            <li> I hardly use it.  </li>
            <li> but I think it may be so hard for my skin ...</li>
            <li> I have had some bruising but it could be that im using it a bit too hard.</li>
            <li> I actually do it so hard</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s hardly any cellulite</li>
            <li> so do not press too hard.</li>
            <li> I have a diagnosis for what is called Cataplexy and my pain has been crazy prior to using this mitt.</li>
            <li> and if you can put in the work to massage each of your body areas for at least 20 mins.</li>
            <li> Especially if your cellulite isn&#x60;t awful (like mine), it should help get rid of it completely.</li>
            <li> Finulite Cellulite Smoothing Massage Mitt looks scary but when I used it it was not too rough.</li>
            <li> I use it 5 days a week for at least 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> The negative for me was that it intensified the couple of varicose veins I have on my legs.</li>
            <li> I drank plenty of water and didn&#x27;t late night snack or give into just a bite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower when I&#x27;m all lathered up with soap and go slow</li>
            <li> Skinny cream is thick and you dont have to use alot</li>
            <li> I mean it worked</li>
            <li> First, I must say I have VERY bad cellulite.</li>
            <li> seriously works</li>
            <li> seriously works wonders.</li>
            <li> Seriously?</li>
            <li> Im not fair.</li>
            <li> Only 4 stars because it is a bit painful.</li>
            <li> I worked this tool vigorously into my right leg (worst one) for 35 minutes.</li>
            <li> I massage my thighs for at least 12 minutes a day and have started seeing results after 3 weeks!</li>
            <li> Must use it at least twice a day for effect!</li>
            <li> , I rub the serum on and then massage VERY HARD into the skin with this mitt.</li>
            <li> but the results was very very very slow.</li>
            <li> got a couple of small bruises that to me it means it works !!</li>
            <li> I mean look at those spikes!</li>
            <li> I am 52 and because of age and hormonal weight gain, the cellulite has been getting worse in my thighs.  </li>
            <li> I think it made one of my dimples worse</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s the mitt that stimulates the blood flow and helps the healing of broken cells.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this massage mitt a chance, I do have poor circulation in my legs</li>
            <li> I am just 20 and skinny and athletic, but I&#x60;ve had my cellulite since I was 14, and it&#x60;s been getting worse.</li>
            <li> But I still had these bumps on my tighs and butt, you can even see it if I wear thin leggings.</li>
            <li> Not great at all.</li>
            <li> The Finulite does well, but my arms get tired.</li>
            <li> During Winter months I don&#x27;t wear shorts and fall behind in treating cellulite with vela, so I tried using the massage mitt.  </li>
            <li> So I know how to do online research and the science behind health products.</li>
            <li> cellulite spread and looked worse than before.</li>
            <li> This ensures a lot of circulation so the fat deposits can be broken up.</li>
            <li> After all, you shouldn&#x27;t have to be afraid to do it fairly hard:</li>
            <li> its a littler uncomfortable feeling</li>
            <li> I did, but it didn&#x27;t render it useless</li>
            <li> This is useless to remove cellulite.</li>
            <li> BUT after using this mitt for just 2 days twice a day I can see improvement that I used to get with a month of rubbing some useless cellulite cream all over my body.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> I had read and heard about this beauty tool and was skeptical on the results.</li>
            <li> It is uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Causes terrible bruising and just flat out doesn&#x27;t work....</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t go crazy either, 3 minutes on each leg...</li>
            <li> call me crazy</li>
            <li> use my hands all day at work and trying to apply a lot of pressure with this handle is awkward and painful for my legs and hands.</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to use without handle</li>
            <li> I went to bed a VERY sad girl.</li>
            <li> It bruised me so bad  </li>
            <li> It hurt so bad that I gave up my experiment.</li>
            <li> I read the bad reviews and ignored them.  </li>
            <li> Looks bad.</li>
            <li> Immediately, the cellulite looks as bad as before.</li>
            <li> Just applying pressure using it is painful.  </li>
            <li> Actually painful to use as directed...</li>
            <li> but nonetheless I have ugly cellulite on my thighs.  </li>
            <li> Painful.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day along with the Finulite creams as suggested and was disappointed at the quality of the strap.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Hate it.  </li>
            <li> I have very bad cellulite on my thighs</li>
            <li> but I was very disappointed after using it for a month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had horrible cellulite on my thighs.</li>
            <li> BAD IDEA!!!  </li>
            <li> Horrible cellulite!</li>
            <li> I have horrible cellulite</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good product, I believe I have noticed a difference with my cellulite.. Would recommend!!</li>
            <li> feels great use it with body shape cellulite cream for best results</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work but great for massage.</li>
            <li> i had cellulite with the help of this mitt and slim extreme 3d i am cellulite free.i recommend giving this a try</li>
            <li> received this two days ago and used it only twice for about 10 15 minutes and i already am seeing improvements! i can now walk around in shorts and feel comfortable ! i am excited to see the results in a month!! will update my review in a month. The only thing is the strap sucks.. it breaks way easy but its not a huge deal because i can use the item without the strap anyway! i also got bruising but that always depends on the person! (i bruise easily!) but all in all i looove this item and do recommend it to people wanting fast results! :)</li>
            <li> I used this with the cellulite serums. I think it helps massage it into your skin. A good tool to help get knots out of your muscles</li>
            <li> perfect skin massage and perfect designed for Cellulite.</li>
            <li> Seen improvement in 2 wks great for cellulite and too get thighs and butt firmer could b used in shower or out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week and I really believe it does break down the fat! I say go for it.</li>
            <li> Fabulous works amazing my legs are super smooth, I recommend using vitamin e oil as lubricant. My boyfriend can&#x27;t stop touching my legs</li>
            <li> I been using this massager for months (I am lazy...), once a week. And my skin feels tigh and with less visible cellulite. Love it. Yes, it is a little painful, but very worth it.</li>
            <li> I believe this is the same product that is sold in a kit with other products, and it is definitely more affordable this way.  I haven&#x27;t seen a huge improvement in my skin yet, but I&#x27;m only two weeks into it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really help cellulite.</li>
            <li> your skin feels soooo much better after you use the two together!!!</li>
            <li> It really does help to minimize cellulite! WOW  I use this in addition to taking free-form L-Lysine, exercise and eating healthy.&lt;br /&gt;The cellulite is almost non existent and I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s.  I tell myself,  &amp;#34;You go girl&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> You need to buy it but not have to.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my finulite AM and PM lotion for best result. After 7 days of massage mitt along with finulite lotions, I am starting to see result on my thighs!</li>
            <li> My first reaction with this thing: &amp;#34;OUCHY&amp;#34;! and yes it does hurt because this awesome device reaches deep inside your trouble areas, all over the body, not just the thighs... I am pasty white and I tend to bruise QUICK, but that is only prove that this thing is doing it&#x27;s work! I love it!&lt;br /&gt;I usually have my &amp;#34;me time&amp;#34; at around 8:30PM to massage my WHOLE body before I get in the shower with a body scrub. After I get out of the shower I apply body oil, whichever your skin likes and wont react to it. You will notice lighter skin in just the first night; but you gotta keep doing it, every night or at least 2 times a week. Also drink a lot of water, do cardio and all that fun stuff! Don&#x27;t expect miracles, you have to really WORK and commit!</li>
            <li> After using the mitt, I was covered in black and purple bruises. It looked like someone beat me with a mallet. Assuming you can get past this... I really don&#x27;t know if the mitt works. I&#x27;ve been using this in conjunction with cardio and weight training. I&#x27;ve had lots of improvement, my skin looks smoother and has a much better texture. It&#x27;s hard to say which is working or by how much.&lt;br /&gt;The smaller nubbins are about 1/8\\&quot; long; the bigger nubbins are about 1/4\\&quot; long. The strap on the mitt has held up fine but is definitely on the larger size. You have to hold onto the mitt (I use it in the shower with lots of body wash) to not drop it. Another reviewer recommended the Kong Zoom Groom, which would be a much cheaper alternative, though I haven&#x27;t tried it. The Zoom Groom is technically for animals with long fur, but it looks the same as the mitt and the rubber nubs are flexible. If you go with the Finulite massage mitt, I&#x27;d say be prepared for bruising. But if you use it with an exercise program, why not?</li>
            <li> This is the first cellulite massage mitt for the shower that I have ever purchased.  I love it!  I am 52 and because of age and hormonal weight gain, the cellulite has been getting worse in my thighs.  This has really helped break up the cellulite.  I also have been body brushing everyday too.  My skin feels and looks so much better.  I only use my organic cleanser and firmly rub this mitt on my thighs.  I do not use a cellulite shower cream because I don&#x27;t believe they work.  It works nicely with my organic cleanser.  I have also increased my workouts, eating a low fat/low carb organic diet, plenty of water, and I sweat everyday.  Highly recommend and plan on buying one for my daughter.</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL TOOL! seriously works</li>
            <li> Been using this every to every other day. Have not seen any difference.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting this product to be as great as it is. seriously works wonders. its a littler uncomfortable feeling but i can see changes already and its only been two weeks. great product.</li>
            <li> The product is easy to hold but creates very significant and patterned bruising on my thighs.  I do not take blood thinners so I have no idea why.  It does not have any warning that this would be a possible effect.  People should be very careful!</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower when I&#x27;m all lathered up with soap and go slow deep turning  up. It bruised at first yes but I see a difference and it gets off dead skin!</li>
            <li> It did nothing for me. Of course, i did not even give it a fair chance I think. Tried it for a week and gave up on it.</li>
            <li> Loving this mitt so far so good!! I use it daily in the shower with my body wash and occasionally with a home made coffee scrub. Only used for couple weeks but I can see a difference. Skin is smoother and I can tell it&#x27;s starting to help with the cellulite on the back of my thighs. Deffently recommend this mitt to anyone with problem areas.</li>
            <li> This thing really does smooth out my skin. All the spongy lumps I would feel under my thighs are smoothed out after using this consistently for a week. It&#x27;s a bit uncomfortable and may cause bruising and redness at first, but once that irritation goes down, your legs feel pretty amazing. Not sure if the appearance of cellulite is lessened only by this mitt...You probably wanna get some sort of firming lotions n potions to use alongside this. I&#x27;ve used Weleda birch oil with this, and it worked wonders for me. I got even more results doing leglifts and plow pose, as well as other yoga poses like it. Stick with it and you&#x27;ll get results :)</li>
            <li> I used it for several times on my stomach, but it hurts my skin even with body wash on. Maybe I have use it a little longer but I can&#x27;t stand the pain so it&#x27;s my daughter&#x27;s toy now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had horrible cellulite on my thighs. So I actually purchased this item back in 2013 and forgot about it in one of my beauty drawers and rediscovered it this year in 2015. I didn&#x27;t use it because I didn&#x27;t think of using it in the shower like some people mentioned in the reviews. Keep it in your shower so you see it everyday and you will use it in your daily routine. I started using this product everyday in the beginning of February. The picture on the left was taken 02/18/15 and the picture on the right was taken 03/02/15. My leg is much darker in the right picture because I had a spray tan (Fake Bake Flawless is an amazing self tanner by the way!). When I first started using this product, yes my thigh did bruise but eventually they fade away. When I first started using the product, I massaged in circular motions but I wasn&#x27;t sure what I was doing. I did some research on how to properly use this product and I came across something called dry brushing. So I use this product starting on my lower thighs with long strokes until I hit my upper thigh, promoting proper lymph and blood circulation. I&#x27;m not a doctor, but this massage method works for me and I am seeing results. I will continue to use this product in conjunction with exercise and a low carbohydrate diet and I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> This item works,but handle snapped two weeks after receiving. I was using every night. It is very difficult to use without handle which is why I only gave it two stars. I did notice some change in cellulite after that two weeks though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller sent me a replacement as soon as they noticed at my review of item&lt;br /&gt;handle snapping. The new design is much better, the handle is a lot thicker&lt;br /&gt;Material.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok i need to use it on a more regular basics. the bristles are very hard if you are looking for a soft one</li>
            <li> It does cause mild bruising when first using, but it works fantastic if you remain consistent.  I have had it for about a month and I have noticed a difference.  I used this along with NuElle Triple Action Anti-Cellulite Concentrate and I am pleased with the results thus far.</li>
            <li> Must say that this product got to me very quickly, much sooner than expected! Product quality is great, it&#x27;s easy to hold even in the shower, and the massagers are deep but not too intense. This is my first time using this type of product and I&#x27;ve just started to use it so I don&#x27;t have any results of how well it works but it feels great. Will update once I&#x27;ve used this product and I can give a true description of how well it works.</li>
            <li> Really great product ! Good for massage on legs !</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be alarmed when your thighs look a dimpled mess when you first use this product. I didn&#x27;t even realize I had that much cellulite. OMG tears!!! Swollen, bruised, and sore fatty deposit legs and butt... I wanted to die! But after I went to bed and woke up the next day the bruising was still there but my thighs slimmed down from the swelling and looked much better! I was amazed!  Be sure to drink lots of water because you&#x27;ll want to help flush the broken down fat. But it works!!! I use mine in the shower. It exfoliates the skin and breaks down cellulite.  SCORE!  You might get winded while using it but that&#x27;s great! Your in the shower raising your heartrate and giving your body a healthy detox!! Don&#x27;t hesitate make the purchase! Your body will thank you!!</li>
            <li> Great for circulation and cellulite.  Use it everyday!</li>
            <li> Not sure it is worth it, however I am not using it as often as recommended.</li>
            <li> Super excelent product!&lt;br /&gt;Work super well!&lt;br /&gt;The words can&#x27;t describe how wonderful ist!&lt;br /&gt;I recomended this massage tool!&lt;br /&gt;Use it!</li>
            <li> I Definitely felt the circulation in my legs.  Bruises easily. The handle makes it easy to use. This product helps.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t do this.... I was very optimistic after reading reviews of this and many other brands. It says you have to rub hard to break up the fat deposits which sounds like it makes sense and yes it does leave bruises. I think it made one of my dimples worse I do think it broke up the deposit of fat but now there is a flat spot going through the middle could never rub or even it out and believe me I tried. I used this is in the shower and out with a cellulite gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use my hands all day at work and trying to apply a lot of pressure with this handle is awkward and painful for my legs and hands. Mostly my hands though trying to apply that much force and twisting at the same time is no good.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a difference in using this . It&#x27;s simple and easy. I used it every day for 2 weeks and saw a noticeable difference. It&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I use this 3 times a week, the other days I use my bliss machine. In combination, they work fantastic! After 6 weeks of using it on a regular basis, I can tell you the results have been dramatic. However I have been also eating healthy and going on walks.</li>
            <li> Received this product in the mail today! Before I got in the shower, I rubbed coconut oil on the areas I wanted my cellulite gone (thighs and buttocks). I did each leg. 5 minutes a piece and really noticed a difference!!! My thighs and buttocks area started hurting and turned really red! It&#x27;s normal. In order to get good results you have to keep this up and take the pain. Beauty doesn&#x27;t come easy!! I have already recommend this product to my mother and sister!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use it hard on my legs. it is hard and rough.. if your anything like me and bruise easily.. I do not recommend this for you..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s help a lot in conjunction with squats and infulite lotions, I see the blood circulating when I use it.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be rough on my skin but it does not leave marks and with the finality lotion it works miracles. You still have to watch your diet and eat less fat and drink more water.</li>
            <li> So far so good... only been using it for a bit so we will see on the results and I have great expectations.</li>
            <li> Although it takes a little work like arm strength &amp; a little patience, this actually works. I use it just about each time I shower (2x) a day and scrub with it for about 5 to 10 minutes on each side (thighs,butt,legs). I&#x27;ve notice that it leaves my thighs &amp; back of my legs really smooth &amp; soft. As for the cellulite, I&#x27;m still working on it along with excersie &amp; lots of water ;) I&#x27;ve only had this for about 3 weeks so I&#x27;m sure it might take a little more scrubbing. Overall I reccomanded it especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I used this on my thighs with the Finulite cream and in the shower with regular body soap and it made my skin super smooth. It removes dead skin and you can see it on the massage mitt. It&#x27;s easy to clean as well. It&#x27;s a tad painful on dry skin but in the shower when your skin is wet, it glides very smoothly and feels really nice.</li>
            <li> I used it every day for 10 minuets in the day and night with soap in the shower in morning and night , I really notice a great differences,</li>
            <li> Very helpful! Use in consistenly in conjunction with the coffee scrub soap and voila!</li>
            <li> I works great! I use this along with Skinny cream. Skinny cream is thick and you dont have to use alot so it lasts longer. This massage mitt works well with it. I use it twice per day. It doesnt hurt my skin at all even when rubbing hard. If you apply the amount of cream you need to marinate into the skin using the massage, there is no pain. My legs feel firm after every usuage. I have always had cellulite even though im not a big person. It has been a week and I already see results. Keep in mind in order to keep up to see if its working. You can measure your thighs or where ever you are applyiing it and also watch it daily. At first I didnt want to use based on some reviews but you have to just try things for yourself.</li>
            <li> I cant really tell if it works of not because the strap ripped after 3 uses.&lt;br /&gt;While I was able to use it, I liked it. got a couple of small bruises that to me it means it works !!&lt;br /&gt;Wish I could still use it. ;-(</li>
            <li> I love this tool. It&#x27;s been making a big difference to my cellulite. I use it every day in the shower and in conjunction with the great cellulite creams I got advice on from http://bestcellulitetreatmentcreams.com/ I&#x27;m noticing a real improvement. My skin feels more toned and smooth. This is very useful and a nice little gift as well.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any difference at all when using this. I have used it for 3 months. All it does if get my skin red and causes bruises.</li>
            <li> Great product. Just what I&#x27;m expected. I can perform an effective massage that help my circulation and the appearance of cellulite.</li>
            <li> Could tell a difference after two uses!!  I didn&#x27;t go crazy either, 3 minutes on each leg... each morning!!!  LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  I have no complaints about the seller. I can say that it does work but you have to choose between wanting bruises or cellulite. It bruised me so bad  my husband said I looked like I had been in an accident. LOL  But the cellulite was better. BTW Im not fair. I am a light skinned black woman. I do not normal bruise easy. But in order for it to work you have to press hard.</li>
            <li> It seems as though the makers have improved the quality of this little \\&quot;mitt\\&quot; in the past few months. I bought one a few months ago, and after not that many uses, the hand strap got detached on one end, so I was left with an awkward, hold-by-one-end, strap. It is harder to use that way. I finally had enough and bought another one, thinking, it&#x27;s only a $10 investment. I lost quite a bit of progress by not using much once it became such a hassle, so now  I have to start again, but it does seem as though the new one is slightly different, with a stronger strap. I will post an update if I see a substantial improvement in the design, but I do wish I had tried to return the old one as soon as it broke, because I was planning to use it as my \\&quot;travel\\&quot; massager, the one to keep packed, but I realized the first time I tried it when away, I should have just gotten 2 new ones because using it is such a pain, (awkward to fit within the distance you can open your hand to grasp by the edges) thus, no use to me. If you have one of the old design ones, and it falls apart, try to return it, because after just a few uses, it should not fall apart like that, and you be out your 10 bucks--made me feel like I got burned. You can try re-attaching the strap, but it doesn&#x27;t stay; also you have to pry the edges apart to get it re-attached in the first place, which runs the considerable risk of cracking the plastic. I did, but it didn&#x27;t render it useless--only the strap issue did that for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that, a design flaw which is not inconsiderable, this little massage tool does a LOT right!! It looks as though with the basic concept, they&#x27;re really onto something. My cellulite problem started when I developed circulatory issues. Now that they&#x27;ve finally been fixed, I can focus on the smaller problem resulting from the bigger one. When I use this \\&quot;mitt\\&quot;, I massage firmly --hard enough to know I&#x27;ve done some good. I have gotten light bruising when doing the massaging very vigorously, but nothing like I did when I tried those suction cups! (Those require a LOT of time, as there is a *real* learning curve.) With this baby, not really. Your technique will likely become \\&quot;just right\\&quot; after 2 or 3 uses. I recommend Arnica gel to rub on after use, if you have tender spots that might turn into a bruise: I think it really helps prevent them from forming when applied right after massaging. After all, you shouldn&#x27;t have to be afraid to do it fairly hard: the more vigorously you do, the sooner you notice results. After a fairly rigorous massage before bedtime, the next morning you should notice a *substantial* diminishment of bumpy, \\&quot;lunar surface\\&quot; skin, and see a smoother, firmer appearance in the trouble spots. After a few sessions of regular use, only 5 -10 minutes for *all* problem areas, (maybe more only if cellulite is \\&quot;ubiquitous\\&quot;), you should notice enough improvement to raise your spirits big time! If you don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s likely because you&#x27;re afraid to use it vigorously enough! Of course, you need to aid in the tissues&#x27; ridding themselves of trapped toxins and cellular waste products by drinking plenty of water. Try eating foods with few or no additives, and be sure to exercise regularly if you want faster results. And, if you do feel some tender areas after the first use, don&#x27;t be a wimp: remember you should become way less sensitive with frequent treatments; just keep in mind you do need a lubricant while massaging. Many pure skin oils work well for this, as do some of the anticellulite gels or lotions, (though I am uncertain if the latter work without the massage as well). Overall, I get the feeling that if I use this thingy regularly for 6 weeks or so, cellulite will become an ex-problem; then if I stick with it, the nasty stuff won&#x27;t be coming back. I don&#x27;t know what else to add, but I hope this little tool helps you as it has me, or even more--I wish you good luck.</li>
            <li> I have been using every night for a week for about 5 minutes on my thighs and I am so excited with the results!!  This cellulite is diminishing!  And leaves my skin so smooth!</li>
            <li> I am amazed at how effective this item really is. I read so many reviews about the product to include both good and not so good and decided that the pros outweighed the cons. And omg I am soooo happy that I did. This item actually worked on my thighs and arms with the first usage. I am not sure what it contains to be so crazily effective but Wow! I saw my skin bruise a little but had no pain until actually the next day when I begin to use it on the same areas again. I decided to rotate the mitt slowly without lifting it which was right on point because it definitely lessened the pain. The pain is the kind just so you know--that you would feel after a track meet from running. Nothing more. I also used it with Trader Joe&#x27;s Organic Virgin Coconut Oil. I bought 3 jars for $5 a piece for something entirely different. Today was day 4 and my thighs and arms are firmer and I pinched to evaluate the cellulite and was thoroughly impressed. It also help my circulation in both legs allowing me to walk around with a friend for 5-6 hours. I have a diagnosis for what is called Cataplexy and my pain has been crazy prior to using this mitt. Thank you for creating such a useful product. One more thing--the strap is extremely sturdy and you actually do not have to put your hand through the hole to use it effectively.</li>
            <li> not for me so i don&#x27;t no anything about this product once so ever, but i think the person i bought it for likes it and is satisfied. but forget about this review...</li>
            <li> I use this even without the Finulite lotion and it&#x27;s already making a difference. You have to stay on top of it, but I can notice dimples in my skin are almost gone!</li>
            <li> I love this product it actually took inches off,my clothes fit better. Thank you finulite.I give you five stars.&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up.</li>
            <li> I mean it worked but I got lazy and stopped using it. I have resulted to squats and lunges. Lol</li>
            <li> This Massage Mitt works greatly to help break down the diabolic cellulite together with the Finulite lotions. &#x27;I&#x27;ve been using religiously with the lotions for a week and i can notice great improvement on the appearance of my skin, mainly in my tights. My skin is getting very smooth too.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work but hurts like hell.</li>
            <li> I do like this thing, it really does feel good. Be careful though, don&#x27;t be rough with it...it&#x27;ll definitely kick your butt.</li>
            <li> This worked quite well for removing cellulite.  I was very impressed with the results I was getting and used it a lot for the first two weeks.  The problem was that it wrecked my arm because I had to press so hard while making circular motions across my legs.  My doctor told me that I had developed tendonitis in my right arm.  That ended my anti-cellulite crusade.  Now I&#x27;m looking for something that won&#x27;t cause tendonitis or carpal tunnel.  If you go with this product please be careful and don&#x27;t overwork your hand.  The price was great but I&#x27;m still paying for my efforts earlier this summer with an arm brace.  Not fun.</li>
            <li> Vendor delivered exactly the product that was promised.  I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it religiously, so I can&#x27;t comment adamantly, but I do feel like when I use it, it does begin to make a difference.  The key is consistency.  (And getting rid of sugar from your diet:)!)</li>
            <li> This shouldn&#x27;t even be sold. Causes terrible bruising and just flat out doesn&#x27;t work....at all. I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> The only problem with this mitt is that it is difficult to use in the shower. The &amp;#34;handle&amp;#34; needs to be more flexible (perhaps sizable?) to allow for a comfortable fit. As a massager, it is okay, but i am not convinced that it does anything for cellulite.</li>
            <li> I love this little mitt. I have had cellulite for about 25 years so I thought I was stuck with it...but I have had this mitt for 3 weeks now &amp; my cellulite has reduced by about 80% so I am thrilled!!! It makes a huge difference!&lt;br /&gt;You have to be dedicated &amp; use it daily for as long as you can &amp; rub fairly hard...I had bruises for quite some time. But who cares, bruises fade &amp; so it appears does the cellulite. I wish I had known about this simple little product years ago!&lt;br /&gt;It really does work ladies, I promise you....but do be consistent with it &amp; know that the only thing that is going to give you results is the amount of elbow grease you put into it, so be firm!</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome and works well! I saw results in one week and works well paired with lotion that has caffeine in it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to work on my thighs and tush, I have mild cellulite and of course would love to look smooth for the spring and summer. I have only used it a few times so I cannot attest to those results, HOWEVER it did amazing things for my arms! About four years ago, I had liposuction done on my upper arms. I am a fit, healthy girl but no matter what I did I still had abnormally large fat deposits and bat wings. My Dr. removed what he measured as, &amp;#34;two soda cans worth&amp;#34; of fat from EACH arm. Again, I&#x27;m not really large anywhere else. Needless to say, I&#x27;ve loved the results and the new proportionate shape. However, there have been two lingering unusual hard fatty tissue deposits that never went away, one on each arm in different places. I used this once, ONCE for about two minutes on my arms and one is COMPLELTELY gone and the other is greatly improved. I have used massagers, self massage- you name it to lessen these. You can&#x27;t see them, but I can feel them and always get a little self conscious getting a massage. Plus, those areas have been more sensitive. I&#x27;m so stoked that they are leaving!! So impressed with this mitt. Excited to see the results on my legs!!!!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work and it was just a waste of money.  Not worth what I paid for it.  I don&#x27;t even know what good it would be for.  Maybe to bathe your dog with?</li>
            <li> I have used this for a year it kinda ruff but overall a A+smooth out dimples and all</li>
            <li> This thing scratches your skin pretty badly if you have sensitive skin like me.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Finulite Cellulite Smoothing Massage Mitt after reading a few reviews.  I used it several times and did not like how it really hurts and I saw results.  Just applying pressure using it is painful.  I think it was a waste of money.  Pain and no visible results.</li>
            <li> I give this item a three due to the fact that the strap started to tear three weeks into treatment. I use it twice a day along with the Finulite creams as suggested and was disappointed at the quality of the strap. I am now ordering a second  mitt because the strap is hanging by a thread.&lt;br /&gt;In terms of how affective the product is I would say it appears to work well in combination with the creams. I have been using it for one month in conjunction with a work out routine and try to eat as healthy  as I can. I try to drink as much water as I can plus I take vitamins. I have stage three cellulite with some deep indentations; have had it for over 20 years and know that it will take continuous and consistent use and that the results are gradual but attainable.&lt;br /&gt;I would say that after one month there is a 15 to 20% reduction. Do not rely solely on the products you need to work out the affected areas as well.</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised by this product.  I have used it in the shower regularly for about a month.  The appearance of cellulite is not gone but is MUCH better.</li>
            <li> Works best with the Fat Girl Slim cellulite cream! Most effective combo for me to remove cellulite. I massage my thighs for at least 12 minutes a day and have started seeing results after 3 weeks!</li>
            <li> This is a great massager. Does NOT get rid of cellulite! However it&#x27;s great at penetrating product into your skin!</li>
            <li> I bought this sometime ago after reading about the Bliss cellulite massager -which is a few dollars more than this one.&lt;br /&gt;You will need some kind of oil to use for this to glide across your skin and not rub it raw.  I used almond oil which the body soaks in on it&#x27;s own without a heavy residue.  I have even read that natural castor oil (bought in a health store) actually works better but I have not tried that.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s true what the top review of this product says- This thing hurts like heck when used correctly. It does give you a bruised feeling but it does goes away.  You do have to press pretty firmly and your hands and arms will get tired-but don&#x27;t give up!  Sounds funny, but I have my boyfriend use on behind and the back of my legs because I can&#x27;t seem to reach those areas effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really does reduce the appearance of cellulite! If you watch your diet, drinks lots of water and be sure to flush out the toxins you release with the massage mitt.  Drinking apple cider vinegar with water or drinking milk thistle tea will help improve the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good buy if you know you can be consistent and if you can put in the work to massage each of your body areas for at least 20 mins.</li>
            <li> I saw an improvement after the second use.  I will continue use and hopefully rid myself of all the cellulite on my thighs.</li>
            <li> What can I say... It&#x27;s not for me.... My wife using this and make her legs blcks of patches.. What a torture a woman go through to look pretty....  She tried t on my fat tummy... It sure hurt.. LOL....</li>
            <li> This works great.  It does leave you bruised, but after the bruising fades, everything started to look great and has really made a difference.</li>
            <li> The item is shown as listed, just not really sure if it works</li>
            <li> This is useless to remove cellulite.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve purchased 5 or 6 of these now. I have them in every bathroom and use them during and after every shower. I use my regular body wash in the shower and Clarins Cellulite Firming Creme outside of the shower and can definitely see results. It took about two weeks (and thank goodness for the review saying there would be redness) but it disappears in a few minutes. My skin is definitely smoother and less dimpled - the last couple of smoothing mitts went to friends when they saw the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller shipped superfast and I got them faster than promised. If one disappears I&#x27;ll immediately replace it. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have been using this everyday for almost one month.  My cellulite &amp;#34;seems&amp;#34; to be improving, but I still have a long way to go.  It worked better for me when I didn&#x27;t use it in circular motions.  That did nothing to improve my lumps and bumps.  So instead I would press very hard and drag the massager up and down the length of my thighs.  That seems to work best and I started to see some improvement.  It does hurt a bit, but no pain no gain right?  I did bruise a lot, so be prepared to be black and blue after using it.</li>
            <li> I have used it daily for more than a year and it is still in good shape. I like it so much that I have bought one for my sister and one for friend. Even my husband uses it! Great massager to help keep away cellulitis.</li>
            <li> Product works as it should, however the handle broke off of it within about 2 weeks.  Will look for a replacement elsewhere! Must use it at least twice a day for effect!</li>
            <li> My wife says this thing doesn&#x27;t work. It is now just a shower decoration. She says the positive reviews on here were probably from the makers or something. Maybe will possibly work as a dog hair thing.</li>
            <li> USE it everyday in the shower - -  really helps cellulite - walk and watch you diet, too.</li>
            <li> This too is very good. It also increases the&lt;br /&gt;circulation in your stomach. I use it with lipogel.it breaks down the fat in your stomach. Great investment. I&#x27;m glad I bought it.  :-D</li>
            <li> Some results, very smoothing!  Getting rid of cellulite would be  a miracle but for what it&#x27;s supposed to do it works just fine.  I use this in the shower with either sea salt body wash or Shea butter wash and I can tell it is definitely creating good circulation.  I hope to continue this with vigorous exercise to see results in the next few months.  Great quality and definitely will not fall apart.</li>
            <li> I bought this with the finulite AM &amp; PM cream... unfortunately I haven&#x27;t really noticed any changes in my cellulite over the past 3 weeks. I&#x27;m going to keep it up and hopefully I see a change soon.</li>
            <li> This Mitt definitely increases blood flow to massaged areas. Not much effort needed. I usually add 6-8 drops of lemon essential oil to a table spoon of coconut oil or any other carrier oil and massage it into my thighs with circular motion (working out my arms along the way!). I am not sure if it&#x27;s the Mitt that prevents/reduces cellulite that well, because I also have a healthy diet (no added sugar, moderate salt and low fat) and do yoga, pilates and spin.</li>
            <li> This works. Only 4 stars because it is a bit painful. You have to do this twice a day for about six to eight weeks to really see results. Use a good, moisturizing soap, though it will only make it slightly less painful. If you can tolerate the pain and have the patience, this product works much better than the expensive creams. It may be my imagination, but I also seem to have less swelling in my legs when standing for long periods of time when I use it daily. So, it may also be beneficial for more than just cellulite.</li>
            <li> Very Pleased with Mitt</li>
            <li> I use the massage mitt in the shower then follow-up with the Finulite Cream afterwards.  I have used the mitt on my thighs as well as my arms.  Both appear to be getting firmer.  The cellulite is disappearing from my thighs.  I highly recommend the massage mitt to anyone that has issues with stubborn cellulite.</li>
            <li> I cannot really say since I just started using.&lt;br /&gt;CO</li>
            <li> I love this product only giving it a four because this is my second time purchasing after the band broke on my first from regular use, but it was after a year and a half.</li>
            <li> Pointless- I have been using this for almost two weeks and I honestly think the cellulite is worse.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this brand by accident. I thought I was buying the one made by Bliss. I don&#x27;t know how I made this error. When it got here I was reluctant to use it but what was done, was done. I thought I might as well try to see if it was any good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big mistake. This thing is hard. It doesn&#x27;t give at all like the ones made by Bliss or other companies. Typically, these types of mitts are made of a soft rubber that glide over you easily. However, this one felt like it was made out of petrified wood. It hurt so bad that I gave up my experiment. I want to massage my body not bruise and torture myself.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because of the good reviews it received on this site but I was very disappointed after using it for a month. O give the mitt one star because you can give yourself a massage with it better than with a sponge or loofah mitt.  However in the second week of use the strap broke. This makes it more difficult to maintain a firm group and affects the quality of use.  I did not detect any difference in the cellulite appearance. I do not recommend this product</li>
            <li> I work out everyday and I&#x27;m in the process of getting fit, but I have a hard time getting rid of the puckering on my outer thighs as well as behind my legs due to stubborn cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;I started using the Finulite massage mitt in combination with coconut oil every night for 30-60 minutes (I find it easy to use while watching TV) and alternate legs each day. Besides the mild bruising, I noticed a difference within a day of using it.&lt;br /&gt;Even though I work out daily and eat and clean/healthy diet, it wasn&#x27;t until I started using the mitt that I noticed the puckering on my outer thighs and behind my legs was becoming less noticeable, especially the morning after use. My problem areas are now not only smoother but also more supple and less painful to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;This massage mitt might be a great &amp;#34;quick fix&amp;#34; if you&#x27;re going to be wearing shorts or bathing suit and want your legs to looks smoother *** BUT IT DOES NOT GET RID OF CELLULITE *** it just helps to break up the fat cells and smooth out the puckering while the cellulite still lingers underneath the skin. You must combine the use of the mitt with a healthy fitness and nutrition regimen to actually get rid of the cellulite + I&#x27;ve read that drinking lots of water also helps to eliminate the toxins released from the massage.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m very impressed and happy with this new little beauty tool!</li>
            <li> not much to say other than its constructed nicely and it works!  shipping was  timely and professionally packaged</li>
            <li> my legs felt perky after i used it,i like it</li>
            <li> Seemed to work well but the handle broke after about a month so i wasn&#x27;t able to use it long enough to see results.</li>
            <li> This is great, very simple, easy to use, clean and strong. My legs get a great massage and it does break cellulite cells. For sure a great product.</li>
            <li> I forget to use it a lot but when I do, I like the way it works. You can really feel it working.</li>
            <li> I love this mitt because it has an elastic band for you to have greater grip on it while rubbing it on your legs in a circular motion. Usually mitts will glide right off when soapy and fall.  With this band you won&#x27;t drop it in the shower and it is such a high quality rubber it won&#x27;t break if it falls in the tub.</li>
            <li> I love it so far it makes my skin smoother feeling looks like it&#x27;s diminishing cellulites I use it every day in the shower&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest you put more of the shower gel on the pad and rub it vigorously all over your legs firmly . I also use it on my stomach ,butt , arms, also my back as far as I can reach.  my arms and on my chest&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something like this for a while to use on my legs. This one is totally worth it! I feel like it is working and my legs look better but even if its not I still love the way it feels. It itches and massages and feels wonderful.</li>
            <li> I have premature sign of cellulite and thus here is this anti-aging tool. The Mitt is very comfortable on hand. However, do be aware of the strength you use this mitt. First few days, I left marks on my thighs. Then I dialed down to gentle rub. Now it&#x27;s been about a month. When I look at my back thigh, the sign of cellulite has gone. I think it&#x27;s the mitt that stimulates the blood flow and helps the healing of broken cells.</li>
            <li> I want to love this, but, it broke the first time I went to use it!!! I am so disappointed. The top half where you put your hand broke off from the massaging bottom half. The first time!!! Seriously? I don&#x27;t know if this happens to other customers but I am very upset with this product. I am still waiting to hear back from the seller about returning it.</li>
            <li> Nice to use and helps with cellulite would recommend</li>
            <li> I have extremely stubborn cellulite all over my back legs, buttocks, and hips. Mostly &amp;#34;orange peel&amp;#34; looking cellulite (back legs, butt), but a couple deep dimples on my sides... all thanks to hormones, stress from work, and the 30 pounds I have gained in the past year and a half. NOTHING seemed to make it go away, no firming lotions, not even their finullite products could save me from the embarrassment of this cottage cheese looking skin. I decided to give this massage mitt a chance, I do have poor circulation in my legs so I figured this would def get the blood rushing again, I mean look at those spikes! Anyway, after about a week of use (5-15min, sometimes twice a day depending on how much time I have) I must say I do notice a difference, its not much, but it is noticeable! I have no bruising (and I apply quite a bit of pressure) so I guess if you bruise like a peach, this product isn&#x27;t for you. I used this product in the shower as suggested by some reviewies but I didn&#x27;t like how lack of control I had, it was too slippery and I felt like it would be less effective for whatever reason. What I like to do is get a decent amount of lotion, put some on my skin (not rubbing it in) and let the massager do the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But of course this mitt isn&#x27;t magic or else it wouldn&#x27;t be $12.50 ;) It requires dedication.&lt;br /&gt;Along with this routine, I incorporate 8 glasses of water back into my diet and started working out about 2-3 days a week to get the most out of this product and what it has to offer.</li>
            <li> It really seems to be good for getting into the dimples and helping to bring circulation to &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; areas.  Easy to do right out of shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of weeks, good massage tool but no significant difference. Not sure if it removes cellulite, but will keep using good massage tool after a long workout.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helping me get rid of cellulite. It also helps with circulation. I would buy it again, no regrets! I have been using with anti-cellulite cream and it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li> I have been going to an anti aging weight loss clinic to do endermologie and Vaccuum therapy for cellulite and when I tell you that the finulite Massage mitt did the same thing at a fraction of a cost I am not lying.  This mitt does excatly the same thing that going to the clinic did for me.  I absolutely love it so much that I am giving it to all my friends for Christmas!  Trust me they will thank me for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes you get bruises and red blotches, no pain no gain.  This is not an equivalent to a swedish massage, this mitt breaks down the cellulite and allows your skin to look smooth.  You want beauty yet have cellulite?  Be quiet and take a little bruising.  It doesnt even hurt really.  Thanks Finulite!  Product well made.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s recommended with the Finulite creams but you can do as good a job with your hands.  I do not use it any more.</li>
            <li> I use this in the shower for circulation on my legs. Just be sure not to press too hard when massaging or you may bruise yourself. It is also important to use lotion or soap on the area, to allow the mitt to move smoothly. So far, I have not had any problems with the handle coming off. All in all, no complaints from me!</li>
            <li> This is really powerful. It broke a number of veins on my legs and I&#x27;m not sure if they&#x27;ll heal up completely--it&#x27;s been awhile now. I may try using it again very softly, but I don&#x27;t know if it will work without pressure.</li>
            <li> Does what it claims to do.  It does leave mild bruising after first couple uses but the end result is worth it.</li>
            <li> Bought this several weeks ago along w the finulite am and pm lotions and although the lotions fell short of what I was expecting, the massage mitt works great. I use it when I shower after working out. Use the mitt to massage in coconut oil, and your skin will not only be smoother, it will also improve your cellulite. Coconut oil has amazing properties that help w cellulite. Invest in the mitt, but not the finulite lotion.</li>
            <li> First, I must say I have VERY bad cellulite. I am just 20 and skinny and athletic, but I&#x60;ve had my cellulite since I was 14, and it&#x60;s been getting worse. I tried creams, self massage with hands.. But I still had these bumps on my tighs and butt, you can even see it if I wear thin leggings. BUT after using this mitt for just 2 days twice a day I can see improvement that I used to get with a month of rubbing some useless cellulite cream all over my body.&lt;br /&gt;I do get tired when using the mitt (even though my arms are quite strong), but I think it&#x60;s a plus (everybody wants to burn some calories).&lt;br /&gt;This mitt is definitely a must buy. Especially if your cellulite isn&#x60;t awful (like mine), it should help get rid of it completely.</li>
            <li> For the price it helps. I have very bad cellulite on my thighs so not much is going to work for me (120 lbs. and 5&#x27;7). That being said, I think if you were diligent and used it everyday and have a average amount of cellulite, that it would help to minimize the appearance of it. As some have stated, it caused some bruising the first few times I used it but once my legs got used to it, the bruising stopped. It is made well and is constructed out of a hard rubber which can be used in the shower. I had some St. Ives cellulite lotion that I used but probably need to look for something a little more advanced. I will continue to use it, because if nothing else, it helps the cellulite creams/lotions work better.</li>
            <li> Now that summer is winding down and I know winter will soon come which means I need to proactively seek out exercise, I am working on getting into shape for the summer season. This Cellulite Massager Mitt I have already had success with. What I do is massage in sesame oil and then use this mitt three times a day for about 8 minutes each. Also I have been doing speed walking and other exercises.&lt;br /&gt;Happy to report that this is working as the back of my legs are looking firmer and also smoother!</li>
            <li> its ok I don&#x27;t see any thing feels good on skin</li>
            <li> Its a good massage tool for my legs. Does feel good with light pressure. As far as cellulite ummmmm not so sure I thinking working out &amp; doing yoga has worked better</li>
            <li> I love this to even out/tone out my legs, butt, thighs. It&#x27;s great to use with the peppermint soap. Otherwise I use regular body wash.</li>
            <li> The handle feels like it will break soon have had it two days. It has diminished some cellulite but not much of my problem areas on back of thighs.I&#x27;m sure with continued use it will work better. Over all ignoring the bruising it works well.</li>
            <li> Been using it  just over a week and have definitely seen improvement, I use it with any old cream, I am bruised, it is painful but you do get used to it. Am v self conscious about my cellulite as you get older it just seems to spread so will keep using this and hope for lots more improvement. Having used all kinds of gadgets and wonder creams this is showing the most promise. Fast delivery, easy to handle mitt!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product in conjunction with the Finulite Anti Cellulite Treatment Skin Exfoliating Soap Bar and I am pleased so far. It is made from a plastic-like material, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt to use. I am using the mitt every other day in the shower.  I use it how the directions stated, massaging it over my thighs and I have noticed the areas on my thighs looking smoother and dimples are starting to  fade away.  I have also been walking more along with using this.  I feel with continued use I will completely be free of cellulite in my thighs.  I would definitely recommend this product along with the Finulite Anti Cellulite Treatment Skin Exfoliating Soap Bar and along with some form of exercise ton ensure you get the results that you want.</li>
            <li> love it , I bought two</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this item for 3 weeks now consistently and I have no noticeable improvement in my cellulites.  For the price it&#x27;s not worth it, get one from the dollar store and try it out.  It also was not sealed properly and water got in it.  I did get a replacement from the seller without any issues.</li>
            <li> Just got it in the mail and used it immediately.  My skin turned a nice flush pink and it felt great to massage it over my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nibs are firm yet flexible. The disc is about 4.5 inches in diameter.  My small hand holds it well and there is plenty of room for a larger hand to fit into the hand-strap. It feels sturdy and I think it should last a long time with extensive use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it both with lotion and without.  It glides easier with a lotion.  Without lotion, I just push with less intensity and it feels more like a massage/brush.  I love how it feels!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I literally just got it, so I cannot speak of its effect on my cellulite but I can say...it feels awesome and I see the increased circulation occurring.</li>
            <li> So I bought cellulite cream with it also and I see the progress within a month. At first I was only using the cream and that progress also work but the results was very very very slow. You have to stay consisted with it if you want real results. For me that was twice a day!!</li>
            <li> Fastest shipping ever...,the product is really good!</li>
            <li> I liked it when I could use it.  The strap handle broke after a month of using it, so now it&#x27;s hard to use.  If they made the strap handle stronger or more secure it would be great.</li>
            <li> Unreal thing! Bought it with two finulite (day &amp; night) creams. I don&#x27;t know about the creams, but this this thing really great.&lt;br /&gt;My skin becomes really red after scrubbing it. You know what they say: &amp;#34;No pain - no gain&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Leaving to Europe after a few weeks, even though there is not much space in my luggage, I will definitely take this thing with me. Love it!</li>
            <li> I use mine several times a week and love it. Your skin should be wet or oiled. I used mine after I put on my coconut oil after the shower.</li>
            <li> Even using in the shower with soap to lubricate the mitt, the glove still leaves lots and lots of little bruises all over the back of my thigh. I&#x27;ve still been using it, only very gently for some added massaging to my bumpy thighs. I have seen some improvement of my cellulite, however, I have been doing a lot of squats and lunges lately, so that is probably what is actually helping. So if you are looking to lose the cellulite, check your diet, and make sure you are exercising. This is not a magic cure that will cure you of those yucky bumps.</li>
            <li> This is useful and strong enough to do something and soft enough not to break the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  I haven&#x27;t seen a difference.  Maybe I am doing it wrong, but honestly you just need to work out.  There are no shortcuts.  I knew that, but thought maybe this would help &amp;#34;short term.&amp;#34;  But it hasn&#x27;t done anything at all.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really notice much of a difference. Makes your legs feel smooth afterwards. The brush itself is harsh so I recommend putting a lot of lotion on your legs before you use it. It helps it brush smoother.</li>
            <li> So far I see little results but I have only been using for two weeks. Must be consistent to see results.  So far pretty good!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this was for the shower.  It works great with soap or even cream. Would recommend it&#x27;s long as you are consistent with its use.</li>
            <li> Finulite Cellulite Smoothing Massage Mitt looks scary but when I used it it was not too rough. I just started using it so no updates at this time.</li>
            <li> if i use this i can tell it works.  gets the blood flowing and it feels like i have more energy throughout the day. the key is consistant use</li>
            <li> Not great at all. Actually painful to use as directed...</li>
            <li> time consuming and hurts for not any visible results that I can see. Company is great though!</li>
            <li> I read the bad reviews and ignored them.  I shouldn&#x27;t have.  I have bruises all over my legs/arms/belly from just two uses and I seriously feel like I pulled all my muscles and can barely walk.  BAD IDEA!!!  I have heard that massage is supposed to help, but this is NOT the tool to use to get those results!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for months now. I&#x27;m not even sure if I&#x27;m using it correctly because I don&#x27;t see a difference. My strap never fell off as others have claimed. waste of money.</li>
            <li> It does work!  Seen improvement in a couple of days!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in a month.  I&#x27;m still trying it out.</li>
            <li> Dropped this in the shower and a small piece of it broke off.  Like many things now a days made in china, the quality could be much better.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle cellulite product if there ever was one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I scrubbed the heck out of my upper legs the first day I got it using a regular body wash. The next day there were a few bruises but guess what! My legs looked beautiful!! I used the Finulite Cellulite cream afterwards. Wow, what a difference. Coming from someone who has suffered w/ unsightly cellulite (and I&#x27;m 105lbs 5&#x27;4\\&quot; - must be genetic), I would say this WORKS. Perfect timing for a week in the Bahamas!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply pressure and scrub in a circular motion for best results.</li>
            <li> I think about this cellulite product almost everyday.  It feels good to have a direct task to do for myself.  thank you</li>
            <li> Really works to get your blood circulating. Skin feels and looks much smoother. I like the flexible handle, makes it easy to grip and feels secure. Expect some bruising at first, this goes away as skin gets more  firm. Worth the $10.</li>
            <li> Good product, just make sure you don&#x27;t mix it with anything else but what you are using and keep cleaning product away from it. I was spray cleaning my walls in my shower and by mistake it hit this brush. The next day I had forgotten that happened and I got hives due to the soap and the chemically wall spray mixed. Well every one makes mistakes but besides that the hand Finulite Cellulite brush is pretty good feels good like an instant massage.</li>
            <li> Broke after the second use. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Good massager to use in the shower or with lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Sturdy, won&#x27;t break, good quality. Just be careful if you have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My cellulite is severe- it&#x27;s been a problem since the 7th grade when the boy sitting next to me in jr high school asked why I had dimples in my thighs... Can you say mortified? #someoneshootmeplease&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;20 years later- I&#x27;m a personal trainer, athlete, lean and toned (5&#x27;3 about 110 lbs) - and guess what??? Horrible cellulite! Even with a six pack... Still cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decided to try this and I am very impressed.  Quality is good. Doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as I thought it would. Seems to be helping tremendously. I&#x27;ve been using it in conjunction with Finulite anti- cellulite Am/Pm creams for about a month now. Celulite is noticeably reduced. Still there, but with much improvement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a scale if 1-10, 10 being the most horrific (think cover of trashy celeb magazine) cellulite you&#x27;ve ever seen, and 1 being virtually none, I&#x27;d say prior to this product I was an 8/9. Now I&#x27;d give myself a 3/4. Still there- but significant improvement! Especially on the sides of my thighs where I had orange slice sized craters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t need to be perfect- just want to feel like the rest of my body matches my legs somewhat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product. Will buy again. Been wearing shorts- feeling sexy!</li>
            <li> I has helped me a lot to reduce my cellulite, fat and stretchmarks on my belly. I had my baby 3 months ago. And I have been using this for 2 weeks, the results are amazing. I use it 5 days a week for at least 20 minutes. I put on my belly rosemary oil.</li>
            <li> Love this. I end up buying more for my family and friends. Takes about a week to start to see results.</li>
            <li> Absolutelty LOVEEEEEE!!!!</li>
            <li> I can see improvement! Works!</li>
            <li> It is actually pretty cool. I am a professional massage therapist but I bought it for myself as I have some minor cellulite, after trying it once I was actually really impressed, it felt really cool on my hips, legs and glutes, the mentioned areas were really red and hot and I definitely felt improved blood circulation. I didn&#x27;t have any bruises either but that could be because I know how to apply pressure due to my profession. Just stay broad and don&#x27;t press down to the bone too much. My skin looks much better now. I am actually thinking about integrating this into my regular slimming massage sessions. Really good, thank you.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a huge difference in only a few weeks with this product. Have been using it with Niveas serum</li>
            <li> It has taken awhile but I do actually notice a difference in the cellulite.  I recently started drinking a lot of water too, more than normal, and I think that has also helped.  So yes, I&#x27;d recommend this product but also I recommend drinking a lot of water to flush out your system.</li>
            <li> I dont even use it anymore because to bruised me too much. It was more pain than gain for me.</li>
            <li> I have only used this a few times mainly because I don&#x27;t have 5-20 minutes to rub it into my skin twice a day.</li>
            <li> I love goofy beauty products. There is just something that feels good about treating yourself. I bought this one and I like it. The nibs on it are harder than I thought it would be, but it works really well. I use it with a little body oil in the shower.</li>
            <li> This Massaging Brush Is AWSOME!&lt;br /&gt;You REally Feel It Working I Use With Regular&lt;br /&gt;Soap While I am In The Shower&lt;br /&gt;It Does Bruise You Up A Little If YOu Have Sensitive Skin&lt;br /&gt;But You Can Feel It Breaking Down The Cellulite&lt;br /&gt;This And The Finulite Creams Work Wonders!</li>
            <li> Havent been using very long, but in about two weeks, I have noticed some more smoothness when used daily in the shower and with the AM/PM lotions.  Going to keep using and see what happens</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your $12 on this product. I used it for a week, daily, and then the strap broke. The negative for me was that it intensified the couple of varicose veins I have on my legs. You do have to scrub hard which left my legs quite red but that was temporary. On the positive side I think it gets the blood flowing because I would feel a slight tingling in some places.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice anything and irritates the skin so much. waste of time and discomfort and don&#x27;t have the patience to bug myself with it</li>
            <li> I bought this mitten, is quite gentle but yet effective, works great and I can feel immediately my skin smoother, I love it!!</li>
            <li> did not like to rough on the skin prongs hard on the skin, will not recommend it.</li>
            <li> My cellulite problem happened rapidly after turning 25. I have been using this product for about a week and I am already noticing a difference in how my thighs look. This product is also good for getting rid of any skin irritation - the skin on the back of my thighs is a bit drier than the rest of my skin - the exfoliation this product offers cleared that issue right up :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done EVERYTHING to get rid of cellulite!&lt;br /&gt;Drastically cutting back on carbs in favour of fresh veg, significantly increasing my water intake, daily dry skin brushing before showers, rinsing with freezing water after showers and exercising on an elliptical trainer 3 times a week - that got me from having terrible cellulite, with dimples, bumps and what looked like Giant&#x27;s Causeway when you pinched the skin, to skin and muscle tone I wasn&#x27;t ashamed to show on the beach.&lt;br /&gt;However, there were still some dimples, saddlebags and what looked like cottage cheese when I sat down!! When I started using the Finulite massage mitt, all this started clearing up within days - even the saddlebags are disappearing! This is EXACTLY what I needed for that last step. I&#x27;m not dreading my summer holiday anymore.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an ingenious design that did what even daily lymphatic drainage with the dry skin brush hadn&#x27;t been able to do in a year. It&#x27;s now an indispensable part of my daily routine. I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like to use this product, it feels great, but I have the impression that it doesn&#x27;t help to improve the effects of my anti-cellulite cream.</li>
            <li> This Massage Mitt really circulates the blood flow! I love it!</li>
            <li> Truly good quality. I really like it will give update soon on results doesn&#x27;t hurt at all lovely :)</li>
            <li> Love love love this item! Hurts to use it for about the first wk after that the massage feels great. Excellent seller very fast delivery</li>
            <li> The Finulite does well, but my arms get tired. I have seen some improvement in my thighs and butt area.</li>
            <li> I really do like this product if used as instructed you can really feel an increase in blood circulation which is supposed to help reduce the appearance of cellulite. Its also less than $10 which is a great deal!</li>
            <li> I have not seen a difference but I am still using.</li>
            <li> Nice massage when in the shower, nothing else.</li>
            <li> This left bruises on my thighs so I had to discontinue using it.  Perhaps it would work for others, but not for me.</li>
            <li> I really like this tool I bought two more for my daughters I saw improvements  a few days after using. I have made it part of my daily routing while bathing.</li>
            <li> Works very well. I use it in combo with a Nivea product. I work out almost every day. I am healthy, but would like to be about 10 pounds lighter. Nevertheless, with working out daily and using this product every couple of days, there is a difference in the appearance of cellulite.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m always looking for an inexpensive way to fight cellulite.  AT 48 yrs of age, I&#x27;ve been a vellashape user for years which works wonders.  During Winter months I don&#x27;t wear shorts and fall behind in treating cellulite with vela, so I tried using the massage mitt.  It works!!! it has kept my legs almost cellulite free.  The trick is using it daily or at first then backing off to every other day when you are where you want to be.  You will bruise at first because the tissue is thick and toxic.  Once you work through that phase, the cells are depleted, the colalgen rebuilds, and you get results.  IT took about 2 months to really become a believer.  Keep a bottle of bath oil in shower and make it part of routine or you will give up.  After washing your hair - massage the legs, hips, belly, even arms.&lt;br /&gt;The Mitt is great for other reasons like blood flow and achy muscles.  Get it and be patient with results.</li>
            <li> I have only just started using this product, but it seems like it works.  I will update after more use as I am not sure how much it is working just yet.  I like using the product.  Product just as described.  Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This works, as long as you eat right, go to the gym and drink a lot of water. I have seen an improvement with using this and cellulite cream every day.</li>
            <li> Great product and great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this in the shower about 3-4 times a week and WOW I can totally see and feel a difference! At first I didn&#x27;t think the extra 2 minutes it takes me to use this thing would help by much, but after 3 weeks of using it together with the finulite cream my thighs are about 90% improved ... and SO SMOOTH and FIRM ...  I am so HAPPY I tried it!!!&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------</li>
            <li> i like this mit. i think it breaks up the toxins in the skin before appling finulite am and pm. i have only been using my mitt about a week so far so good anything brushing the skin is excellent to break up toxins.</li>
            <li> very good quality and does the job.</li>
            <li> The little nubs are somewhat sharp and scratch the skin.  This would be a good roller I think if it wasnt sharp!  Is it supposed to leave scratches?  I thought it was just supposed to help massage the skin without damaging it...</li>
            <li> Great tool in the shower</li>
            <li> Good for exfoliating, don&#x27;t think it assists with reducing cellulite.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as torturous as I expected though it does leave your legs pretty red. I have not been using it long enough to see results. It recommends 5-20 minutes of use at a time and after about a minute on each leg it&#x27;s kind of a workout in itself!</li>
            <li> This mitt is very durable. I can feel it really getting the finulite products to work their magic. I have not had any bruising, but I am not using it until it hurts. I recommend buying this if you try any cellulite reducing product, at least then, you will be able to see if the product being used with the mitt is being utilized to its full potential.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mitt (with coconut oil) for over two weeks now and I see and feel a difference in my skin firmness and texture. My skin feels more plumped up and fuller (especially the buttocks area) after using this. I bought this to primarily get rid of cellulite and I am really seeing results. I experienced bruising (I bruise VERY easily anyway) but I continued using the mitt and I&#x27;m glad I did. The bruising will go away!</li>
            <li> I purchased this in conjuntion with revitol cream but the cream dries really fast and gets sticky. So I use it in the shower with body wash. I am not sure if it is helping my cellulite so much but it feels good as an exfoliator and for sore muscles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it all-- the diets, the creams, the scrubs, the brushes. Nothin&#x27; doin. I thought losing weight would do the trick, but alas, 20 pounds and countless miles ran later, I weighed 120 pounds and still, like a face tattoo, cellulite made my thighs look like something you need to put honey or peaches on in order to stomach. Full on cottage cheese. Still on the hunt for a solution, I searched high and low, read more reviews than I care to admit, and landed on this. 5 days. FIVE DAYS in and I already see a huge difference. Yes, there are still dimples, but what was the rolling hills with deep valleys is no more like minor grooves in the road. I use a firming skin lotion (one of the cheapest on the market) in conjunction, but also a healthy diet and exercise. Maybe that&#x27;s what&#x27;s made the improvement? All I know is, the only alteration to my routine is this. I am wowed beyond belief. So worth the money (though I wish I&#x27;d ordered it so much sooner!)</li>
            <li> I have been using this smoothing mitt for over a year now, along with Nivea cellulite gel and I think I can give it an honest review. It works! I have used other massaging mitts that have also worked, but this one is the best I&#x27;ve used yet. I never had cellulite issues till I was in my 40&#x27;s... yes, lucky me. It didn&#x27;t seem to matter how much I worked out at this stage of my life, I could not lose the cellulite on the back of my legs and stomach. My experience with the brush and the gel is that you need to start using them at least 6 weeks before you really need to see results. I go to Mexico at Xmas every year and find that if I start using this brush and Nivea daily for 6 wks in advance, the cellulite diminishes significantly. I also combine this with a regular workout routine, which helps. However, as I mentioned earlier, workout routines alone do not seem to change the cellulite problem.</li>
            <li> For months I have been considering an alternate procedure to work on the little cellulite I have, through exercising and eating correctly, it has not completely diminished, somewhat improved, with more work needed to reach a satisfactory resolution for myself. Many people state, reports/articles I have read advise there really is not a “written in stone” procedure to rid you of cellulite permanently. I know that many have stated they have worked on this situation, with no results, while others have seen tremendous results. If we were to take a poll/voting inquiry or survey most women would admit this is common in women of all sizes, shapes, and ethnicity. Although so many types of remedies are available, women have to constantly keep trying procedures until they find what works best for them. I decided to order the Finulite Cellulite Smoothing Massage Mitt, after having it in my cart “save for later” order, and reading numerous helpful reviews. I was surprised at the time I decided to place my order; they were also offering a limited-time ONLY Special, allowing customers to receive a FREE EXFOLIATING BAR SOAP with the order, provided you met the requirements. I thought this was a GREAT OFFER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Seller  has advertised accurately about the Finulite Cellulite Smoothing Massage Mitt which is extremely easy to handle, can be rinsed easily as not get filled with soap scum, residue from liquid soaps, or other oils. It is comfortable to hold while massaging and working on cellulite areas, the grooves are not too hard, yet firm enough to help with the process. When I received my order, I was wondering what could be packed so neatly and in a small package. I was surprised when I opened the package to find that it was the Finulite Cellulite Smoothing Massage Mitt with the FREE Exfoliating Bar Soap that was offered with the order. I was also impressed that the outside of the envelope was marked “FRAGILE,” which is very helpful to alert Carriers when handling and delivering packages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The delivery process was excellent, packaging is neat and secure, great packaging, arriving in a secure envelope filled with a bubble wrapped lining inside the envelope, as well as each item wrapped visibly, securely, and individually. While reading what contents were in the EXFOLIATING SOAP, I was surprised to see that it has Peppermint &amp; Green Tea with Crushed Green Coffee Beans (Arabica), 100% natural, preservative free, no artificial color or fragrance in the soap. I was also surprised and extremely impressed to find that Saponified oils of Palm, Coconut, Olive and Palm Kernel are included in the soap, these combined oils are extremely helpful for the body, as well as Sea Salt. I would recommend this product to other people, including Amazon Customers. I also received two other offers from the company when I opened the package. I am sure customers receive these offers when they order various products from different Sellers.  Thanking the Seller for a great offer, and I will definitely leave an update in a few weeks about my experience using the Finulite Massager Mitt and Exfoliating Bar Soap simultaneously.livering packages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The delivery process was excellent, packaging is neat and secure, great packaging, arriving in a secure envelope filled with a bubble wrapped lining inside the envelope, as well as each item wrapped visibly, securely, and individually.

            <li> I thank my Heavenly Father God for your customer service and others who service like you do!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoy using the product as I am losing weight. My kids also like to do it for me, it&#x27;s fun for them ( as long as I am guiding them to do it right lol). I also use this massage mitt in conjunction sea buck thorn oil and a cellulite cream/lotion that I bought off of Amazon.... with an almost 5 star rating. With this combination I&#x27;m seeking superior results with eating healthy, exercising using neoprene pants and good nature&#x27;s supplementation daily for over all good health and adding fiber etc. But there is NO Doubt in my mind that this product works as a stand-alone product because with consistency you will be moving the fatty deposits to make a smoother and more defined appearance on the skin surface.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin smoother and helps with slight cellulite. Would recommend to anyone. I use it twice a week and works for me</li>
            <li> Works great to break up fat and cellulite, One of my favorite things to use to stay looking healthy. Great service</li>
            <li> so far I haven&#x27;t seen any results for a month, maybe it takes more time I will give it one more chance</li>
            <li> This massage mit by Finulite is a great item to use in the shower or even out of the shower.  It really helps to improve the circulation in the desired area.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use in conjunction with the Finulite system. The cream seems to be working better when used with this massage mitt. Be careful though, I have left several small brusies on my thighs, which aren&#x27;t very attractive!!!</li>
            <li> I was impressed with the results. It definitely helped blend a few trouble spots. I have an athletic build. I used it for my inner thigh region. I did see improvement.</li>
            <li> call me crazy but I love this thing. its not the most comfortable and will make your legs red right after using...but I put Neutrogena cellulite gel on my legs and start rubbing in a circular motion. after a couple of times I did notice my skin looking more taut and less dimply. ultimately exercise and eating right are your best bet...and staying hydrated, but I do think this gives a nicer smoother look and helps the circulation and sloughing off dead skin. I only paid about $13 for mine with free shipping so I thought i&#x27;d give it a try. glad I did.</li>
            <li> I use this with nivea goodbye cellulite gel. It seems to work well since I have been noticing a change. It looks like it would really hurt but it doesnt.</li>
            <li> I like it fine I had hoped for faster results of course, but I still use it when I remember.  I didn&#x27;t get a lot of bruising after the first day like others have said.</li>
            <li> I think is a cheap and good item. With perseverance, I think it really works. I recomend it. Good buying.</li>
            <li> Glad i bought this because the idea of trying the needle rollers is still too scary for me,&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s gentle... whether it works remains to be seen, but so far no complaints</li>
            <li> The rubber tips on this little contraption are firm, yet pliable and dig right into my lumpy imperfections. I have experienced a smoothing effect, after merely 12 short days.</li>
            <li> The handle broke several times.</li>
            <li> I think if it&#x27;s used often, it will work..&lt;br /&gt;It works for me, I feel my skin firmer&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s a way of massaging away toxins.</li>
            <li> works good. kinda hurts tho</li>
            <li> Yes it leaves bruises, yes it is tiring on the arms. But my cellulite is almost completely gone. I take it into the shower, put some soap on my thigh, then push and rub in circles. It hurts a little, but seriously it only took a couple times to start seeing results. I&#x27;ve had to keep using it a few times a week, but it keeps my legs and butt smooth!!! :)</li>
            <li> god never thought I would say this but this thing actually works.  Use it every day and you will deff see the difference...who would have thought@</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to know if it will truly reduce cellulite but it feels great to use. I use it for a few minutes on each leg a night and it feels amazing.</li>
            <li> But I think this making my body detoxifying by let all the bumps come out on my body at the beggining. It was like a rush but not itchy.&lt;br /&gt;And I had stop for awhile because soap is making my skin irritated. Then I think my thigh felt tighter(at the sametime I had bumps all over)..so, I am not sure seems okay and working . The bumps I have to figure out why it makes me do that since I have not hear anyone mentioning here.</li>
            <li> Got this free with the soap. Quality is great and so is the price. And results are phenomenal –Love it!</li>
            <li> Before I bought this item I looked at the reviews and it had a lot of good reviews with people saying it works which is the reason I bought it. I have been dealing with cellulite my entire life and have tried everything including this. I have been using it for over a month now and have not noticed any improvements just some bruising with no improvements.</li>
            <li> Does not work! Not worth the money! Been using it all the time, I do not see a difference at all</li>
            <li> This is a very economical and good product.&lt;br /&gt;It is light and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I have only just begun to use this and looking forward to results.</li>
            <li> The product arrive very fast.  The product itself is ok. It&#x27;s kind of hard to use and a bit painful.  I hardly use it.  I order the bliss machine and it&#x27;s much better than this.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful! Have used it both in the shower and out (with lotion). Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I use this with the lotions and feel my skin tingle. The sort of tingle you get from a quick jog around the block on a brisk winter day. I know it doesnt replace exercise but I feel my circilation improving.</li>
            <li> I am very picky when it comes to purchases online and I don&#x27;t normally leave comments.  But this item worked wonders for me it got rid of most of my cellulite!  I only used it once a day in the shower.  I just put body wash on my cellulite areas and rub for awhile or as long as i want.  I saw result within a few weeks :).  Not only did it get rid of my cellulites but it also feels like a message every time I came home from my workouts!  I highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> i used it one time &amp; the strap came off.  I opened it up to put the strap back on &amp; now it will not stay together.&lt;br /&gt;i can still use it but you have to hold the whole mitt in your hand to use it.</li>
            <li> I like this scrubber, it seems effective in reducing the ugly orange peel, and I decided to order another to put in my travel bag. But it doesn&#x27;t have Prime shipping &amp; wouldn&#x27;t arrive before my trip. Then I realized that the Zoom Groom scrubber [[ASIN:B0002AR19Q KONG ZoomGroom, Dog Grooming Brush, Boysenberry]] we use for our dog is designed on exactly the same principle:  soft but firm rubbery tips that massage and stimulate circulation. (In case you&#x27;re wondering, I&#x27;m not sharing with the dog. We each have our own.)  It&#x27;s perfect, it&#x27;s less expensive, and it has Prime shipping. Sorry Finulite. I think I  actually like the Zoom Groom better. And as my husband pointed out, \\&quot;The dog has NEVER had a cellulite problem.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;07 May 2013 Update:  The strap has come off from the Finulite scrubber, and I see no way to re-attach it. Ergh. It&#x27;s a little harder to hold now, but I can still use it. The Zoom Groom is not self-destructing like the Finulite scrubber.</li>
            <li> I use once a day for 15 minutes on each leg, and it smooths my skin nice. I like it, so far.</li>
            <li> Broke after using it the first time.  The straps come off and the whole thing comes apart.  I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this company.  Poor design and cheap materials.</li>
            <li> I just used it， it is really good. but I think it may be so hard for my skin ...</li>
            <li> i love this mitt but i think i will have to break down and buy some cellulite creme to make it work better. i&#x27;ve been using it dry or with some leftover almond oil. you can really tell that blood flows to the area after massaging. i think with cellulite creme and persistant use this can really make a difference in your fat distribution.</li>
            <li> I have been using the finilite for 2 weeks now. I am starting to see a difference so i am happy with the results so far. I have had some bruising but it could be that im using it a bit too hard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a week but have seen no results so far, not too painful but does turn my skin red.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not overweight but nonetheless I have ugly cellulite on my thighs.  Ugh!  Hate it.  And in the direct sunlight it is downright scary looking.  I&#x27;ve been using this little mitt in the shower with a basic cheap body wash.  It actually seems to be helping (or maybe it&#x27;s my imagination/wishful thinking?)  I had one bruise early on, but have learned to avoid the sensitive areas (near a tendon on the side of my knee) and stick to the more cushiony areas of my thighs.  I&#x27;ve also been using the Finulite am/pm creams so I&#x27;m not sure if it is this or the creams that is helping more.  But certainly the mitt can&#x27;t hurt and is not an ongoing investment so I will keep at it indefinitely.  It&#x27;s seems logical that anything that might break up the tissue &amp;#34;pockets&amp;#34; that are holding the fat together under the skin might be effective.</li>
            <li> This is a great tool with battling cellulite. I see a big difference, but you must use it everyday and with a cellulite cream to see a change.</li>
            <li> Amazingly effective. No hype. No bruises either.  Use about once a week or less to maintain. It doesn&#x27;t make me look 15 again but not ashamed to wear shorts in public!</li>
            <li> Painful. I hope it works.</li>
            <li> It gets the circulation going and can cause severe bruising so don&#x27;t get too enthusiastic. You will look like someone beat you. After several weeks of daily use I think it is helping the skin look softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> I have to say most things I order never live up to the hype or reviews, but this one has far exceeded my expectations. Ok, I&#x27;m on the thin side, but being over 60, my skin is thinner that it use to be and shows every bump. I have spent a lot of bucks on products over the last few years, hoping to find something that worked. Who knew it could be so simple as this brush. It has been over 30 days now, and wow what a difference in the appearance of my legs, butt and stomach. My legs and stomach actually look toner and not so flabby. I use this every time I shower with a body scrub and it has my tights and butt looking better than they have looked in the last 5 years and my stomach is flatter. Though the first few times I used it, I scrubbed so hard, I made bruises on my legs, so be careful. Can say enough about how great this product it. Who knew! I&#x27;m actually down a size in my jeans.</li>
            <li> Just got this and I think it is working! Time will tell. It feels good on the skin. I do this while in the shower and use the creams afterwards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mitt for about a month now. So far, I haven&#x27;t seen much (if any improvement). Any improvement I&#x27;ve seen is most likely due to the workouts I&#x27;ve been doing (*sigh, leg days*). I use it 1-2 a day and make circular motions on my thighs, but perhaps I&#x27;m not pressing hard enough (?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this could work for some people, I&#x27;m just not one of them.</li>
            <li> Excellent product to tone &amp; smooth your skin. The price is amazingly affordable &amp; I truly appreciate the fast delivery....it definitely exceeded my expectations !! Yes, I recommend this massage mitt.</li>
            <li> Broke down way too soon</li>
            <li> Be careful with this caused bruising to my legs. Looks bad. I am not sure if it works only used it two x and my legs look like I was I&#x27;m an accident</li>
            <li> The massage mitt is wonderful! The price is unbeatable, and it helps the morning and night lotion sink into your skin so well! I can feel the lotion actually working after I&#x27;ve massaged my problem areas for a few minutes each. I highly recommend getting the massage mitt if you are purchasing the lotions!</li>
            <li> The first day I used this product I noticed an increase in urination. Using this item was the only difference for me in a typical day to have caused this I did start to see improvement in what I would describe as &amp;#34;dimpling&amp;#34;.  There is less of it. I use it rather gently but I do put pressure on it to try to get through any deep cellulite. I have added in a &amp;#34;firming lotion&amp;#34; that can be purchased at any store. I have now noticed more smoothness.</li>
            <li> Easy to hold and maneuver!</li>
            <li> I just received this massage mitt and I like it better than the type that I had years ago.  This type of mitts I believe will help in reducing cellulite and healty skin because it brings the blood flow to your problem area.  I have been using it all over.</li>
            <li> i like this , it seems to work pretty , but ive only used it a couple of times</li>
            <li> Item as described quick shipping</li>
            <li> This really does help push away cellulite. I was amazed to see my cellulite literally disappear. Fair warning, it does hurt if you use it on dry and unmoisturized skin, but otherwise, this product is very useful and I recommend it for all. It will really help you alot.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month already and have found that it works great.  The massaging of this item, gives your body a relaxing sensation while at the same time getting rid of cellulite.</li>
            <li> I like the way  I feel after using it. I just got it so I will have to come back and tell you if it really works.</li>
            <li> It works awesome with the finulite cream. I saw improvement in my cellulite in about 2 weeks of using it every night in the shower for about 4-5 min! This is awesome!</li>
            <li> This item is easy to use and does a nice job of massaging my legs and behind.  I&#x27;d rate it higher except the strap broke so quickly.  Fortunately, the mitt fits in the palm of my hand and I can grip it just fine without needing the strap.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this item at first but once I read all the great reviews I was willing to give it a try. I use the mitt in the shower with my favorite body wash and immediately I can feel it working in my deep tissues. I have horrible cellulite and I can tell this will work wonders!</li>
            <li> I had read and heard about this beauty tool and was skeptical on the results. It has taken me a while to get the hang of it but now a part of my daily shower routine. In the daylight I am beginning to see the difference in my skin texture along with using the other products. Definitely recommend and was able to purchase this discreetly via mail instead of in public.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have been using this massage mitt along with an exfoliating cellulite soap and I have definitely noticed the difference.  I feel a bit more confident now in my bathing suit.</li>
            <li> WORKS AWESOME IT REALLY DOES DO WHAT IS SAYS MY CELLULITE IN MY BELLY IS ALMOST DISSAPEARES BUT I RECOMMEND IT JUST USE IT EVERYDAY</li>
            <li> This is a great product! It really helps and omg the shipping was amazing!! It got here so fast! Really satisfied with the product and the people who shipped it:) and definitely hoping to win that 3 month supply on finulite. Please and thank you:)</li>
            <li> I noticed after about a week of use small red spider veins on the areas where I used it. It must be too harsh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using this mitt recently but I already see the results. It&#x27;s moderately hard and doesn&#x27;t hurt you but at the same time you can feel the pressure. I bought some massage mitts before and this one is the best so far.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product! This was my second time purchasing this product and based on my previous satisfaction with my first use, I ordered again. I have definitely noticed a difference, especially with combined use of the Finulite cream and mitt. I highly recommend this prodcut.</li>
            <li> To give a little background, I&#x27;m a certified web designer, online marketer and a nutritionist (combining all skills). Also, I&#x27;m an extremist. So I know how to do online research and the science behind health products. If you&#x27;re anything like me then cellulite has been a nightmare since I was about 15, but like most people say I just got used to it. Until recently was I on a quest to finally rid myself of cellulite. I read the reviews and some people mentioned \\&quot;Hope I win the prize\\&quot; so the thought came to mind that maybe this tool has such great reviews just for a \\&quot;prize\\&quot;. When I received it in the mail I got a letter that mentioned it as well but I didn&#x27;t care too much for it. \\&quot;CELLULITE CELLULITE CELLULITE\\&quot; was my focus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You hear things like \\&quot;it&#x27;s toxin buildup\\&quot; \\&quot;it&#x27;s a muscle issue\\&quot; \\&quot;it&#x27;s glands stuck together\\&quot;... I&#x27;m not a scientist so I don&#x27;t know which theory is true or not but here is my scoop on how I rid myself of my most obvious bumps in as little as one week. First off, I dieted very strictly... only juices and lean meats (no carbs!!! my carbs came from my fruits and veggies, carbs has insulin which actually maintains or increases cellulite appearance), wasn&#x27;t easy but I did it. I drank plenty of water and didn&#x27;t late night snack or give into just a bite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next I exercised excessively. I worked out 6 days a week with one rest day, workouts included: swimming, stair-master, treadmill, bicycling, weight machines, lunges &amp; squats. I did all my research on how long I should workout, how I should and when to stop. The workouts were divided evenly for the best results and in a safe manner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said! I cannot say whether this product will have the same results for you if your diet is off (90% diet, 10% gym) but here&#x27;s my experience with this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it came in the mail I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it! Coconut oil is great for this. It absorbs into the skin quickly and helps with breaking down some fat, gives you asmoother and softer appearance and works well with this tool seeing as it is rough on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read some reviews that gave this product one star because of the bruises, or how harsh it is. No offense but I&#x27;ll take those bruises any day if it means no cellulite so I accepted the idea that I was going to get them... and oooooh I did (if you massage bruised area it lessens your bruise dramatically, mine went away the next day). I worked this tool vigorously into my right leg (worst one) for 35 minutes. Go ahead judge me. I did this three times that day. Morning, afternoon and evening along with massaging my legs (fat). By the end of the night I looked down on my beaten leg, bruised and throbbing, and cried. This is why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My cellulite spread and looked worse than before. More apparent and had dimply holes I didn&#x27;t have as much. I went to bed a VERY sad girl. When I woke up the first thing I did was check on my leg and SURPRISINGLY my cellulite had almost vanished (all except this one stubborn Mount Everest which went from terrible to mild). I then realized that my body was just swollen and needed time to work it&#x27;s own magic. The fight is over and now my cellulite is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a woman who doesn&#x27;t care about those side effects when it comes to ridding cellulite, I&#x27;m one VERY happy customer. I have a beach trip coming up and I will be as confident as ever with my new legs :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, don&#x27;t believe the lie that you have to accept you have cellulite and BUY this product! (With coconut oil or the creams they offer) I trust this company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.s. there will be discomfort. Beauty-pain-beauty-pain-beauty-pain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many different cellulite creams and I&#x27;ve tried dry brushing to little effect and that would take weeks! I got his product in the mail and I use it along with the Nivea cellulite serum, I rub the serum on and then massage VERY HARD into the skin with this mitt. This ensures a lot of circulation so the fat deposits can be broken up. I actually do it so hard I get little bruises but it works faster and more efficiently that way. It took me 2 days to see a difference ( I do it every morning and night for 5-10 minutes). It&#x27;s been a week and there&#x27;s hardly any cellulite left!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you, I was using the Nivea Serum on its own, I rubbed and massaged with my hands very hard for 15 minutes twice a day for two weeks and I saw very little improvement. The reason I continue to use it is because your not supposed to use the mitt on dry skin and it works better with cellulite cream. This method saves me a lot of money because I don&#x27;t go through as many Nivea tubes as I used to plus its saving me time, I&#x27;m doing this method in half the time as the hands-no-mitt way and yet the results are so much quicker! I can actually feel it working, if that makes any sense. I love this mitt so much, its not even expensive like most creams and cellulite remedies are and it works so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I do not use this in the shower, I don&#x27;t know if it works better that way or not. I can see how water might increase circulation to the area but I would think it would dilute the cellulite cream on the legs at the same time. I just put the cream on dry skin until its slick and supple feeling, then massage the mitt very roughly over the areas for a few minutes. Obviously if your cellulite is bad, you should spend about 20 minutes doing it and definitely do it twice a day, it works better. My cellulite was mild in some places, average in others. The mild spots went away almost immediately, the worse areas took a few more days but I mean, thats not even a lot oftime and your barely spending that much money on it!</li>
            <li> Starting using a few weeks ago, Don&#x27;t see or feel much difference, May need to use longer to see better results</li>
            <li> I had a smaller version of this one but this one is better fits on my hand better to thank you</li>
            <li> Great product, and I notice smoother skin when I use it regularly. Can be sharp, as the knobs are a little pointy- so do not press too hard.</li>
            <li> After two shoulder injuries, one back injuries, and physical therapy that spanned over 5 years, i came to the sudden cruel realization of the word cellulite on the day i restarted my workout routine. I guess i was so immersed in my recover and physical therapy, toning was a luxury to overlook.  Now that i am almost recovered, no more excuse. So i got on Amazon to find a tool that may help my thighs while i gradually add back my workout routines. It it no surprise i purchased the Finulite, just read the 230 some Amazon reviews. Here is how i use the Finulite. I use skin oil all over my thighs, then run Finulite in circles all over the thighs. I stop massaging the area when the skin turns red so i don&#x27;t get bruised and move onto the next area. The first fewtimes, my skinwas really sensitive to the touch but it built up tolerance gradually, After only a few days, i noticed improvements. The cellulites did not disappear overnite. That is fairy tale. But the smoother overall tone makes the cellulite appear less obvious. And really that&#x27;s what i&#x27;m trying to achieve.  Because of the effectiveness, i rate this device five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When other reviewers said this takes patience and hardwork, they were not kidding. I had to stop using the Finulite for a few few weeks. Because of another minor surgery. Immediately, the cellulite looks as bad as before. So this does take patience and hardwork. I guess i will continue to use this device since my thighs are not getting younger any day soon.</li>
            <li> I use this in the shower... Definitely notice a difference if only slight!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how this is to help with cellulite. I&#x27;ve seen zero change. It is uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> had bruises after using this product.</li>
            <li> Light and easy to pack and store. Personally, I have not seen any difference in cellulite reduction after using for over a month I was disappointed.  I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Really nice.  Not too rough.  I love ❤ it.  18 yrs old and have cellulite on the back of my thighs.  Could also be used to massage 💆 feet lol but it tickles</li>
            <li> This Massager is a great tool that my wife uses with the Anti cellulite soap and is getting GREAT results. Week one not much had happened but it now has been two weeks and even I am seeing positive results in the smoothness of her skin and that the cellulite is becoming smaller...if not disappearing!  There was a small amount of bruising in spots but nothing that didn&#x27;t disappear in a few hours if not a day or two. When the bruising disappeared a smoother, cellulite free and toned areas remained! This item should last a very long time and bought more soap to keep it busy. It this one should go I would definitely look into getting another for her because together they do an awesome job in doing what it is meant to do...control cellulite and tighten and tone desired parts of the body! Her arms are even getting firmer from the rotating of the mitt so not only does it work on the obvious...it gives a true workout for her arms as well. That is always a great bonus!</li>
            <li> I have used this product before from a different company and have been satisfied so far with this one too.</li>
            <li> I have just started using this massage mitt for the cellulite on my thighs and stomach.  At first glance, it seems that it will be very rough and coarse, but actually is quite gentle.  As I have just started using it, I don&#x27;t know the results yet, but hopefully they will be as good as the massage mitt feels.</li>
            <li> i used 3 times a week my skin feels little bit smoother than it was, not what i was expected but im going to keep using .</li>
            <li> The product was shipped and delivered quickly. I use the product with Eveline&#x27;s Slim Extreme 3D after the shower as well useing it in the shower with regular gel soap. The back of my legs only had some waving, not so much dimpling, but after using this mitt for only a few days the  back of my legs are already smoother! my inner thighs had the fatty cottage cheese look with stretch marks from having my son and not only is the texture and apprerence considerably improved, but using Slim Extreme 3D has made my stretch marks practically vanish (the white ones)! Also even though it kinda hurts I really have been digging in when I use the mitt so I think that increased my results. I would and have already reccomended this product to my friends and family, its just that impressive! I think coupled with a cellulite cream of somesort it is an effective aid to getting rid of cellulite. My butt though is a little tougher but I&#x27;m sure given a couple more weeks that will improve as well. BUY THIS PRODUCT, ITS WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> This is easy to use in the shower daily and not a huge commitment.  I use it with Dove body soap and I have seen an improvement in my skin.  Not sure if it will take away cellulite but skin is smoother and looks healthier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed with the effectiveness of this product, it really works, but keep in mind that we need a good diet and exercise, but the product solves a lot, buy.</li>
