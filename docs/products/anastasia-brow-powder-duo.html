    <ol>
            <li>Excellent product.  </li>
            <li>Color is perfect and it doesn&#x27;t flake at all.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and it is definitely an excellent products.</li>
            <li>This powder is perfect.  </li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>This is a great shade for my brows!</li>
            <li>And, guess what-they&#x27;re a perfect match.  </li>
            <li>Best I have ever used for sparse brows.</li>
            <li>eyebrows are darker and this color is PERFECT for me!  </li>
            <li>And beautifully packaged.  </li>
            <li>It looks great on.</li>
            <li>Love this product!!  </li>
            <li>I love it!!</li>
            <li>It goes on very nicely and stays all day.</li>
            <li>It came inside a plastic container that had a great brow brush attached at one end while the powder was in a removable receptacle that fit perfectly inside.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many over the counter pencils for my brows, but this compact is great.  </li>
            <li>And with the brow pencil they offer that you have an option to buy, it goes perfectly and lets you apply just the right shading.</li>
            <li>This is where I bought my first, wonderful eye brow powder.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing....</li>
            <li>The plastic one which they do not show you but send you does not have this nice ledge around it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to use it because it looks nice</li>
            <li>Honest, they are because they list their ingredients but makeup companies</li>
            <li>Best Eyebrow powder I have found so far.</li>
            <li>Eyebrow pencils just do not look natural for me, so this product was perfect.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to support a healthy, more &amp;#34;honest&amp;#34; sort of business and do both myself and a more deserving company a favor.</li>
            <li>and it provides a cool, fair tone.</li>
            <li>But the color is perfect for a blonde.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Taupe for blonde hair is perfect.  </li>
            <li>sure don&#x27;t warn you about what you&#x27;re about to use.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Fills bare spots very good plus two colors to choose from..</li>
            <li>I have light brown/dark blonde hair, and this color matches my eyebrows perfectly.</li>
            <li>Since I am so very, very fair, I have always had to color my brows and lashes--they at one time were almost white so quite invisible.  </li>
            <li>and loved the color so much.</li>
            <li>I suggest not rubbing your eyebrows during the day and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>I think that most of us who are blonde and fair have eyebrows that are really a light &#x27;taupe&#x27;</li>
            <li>I have blond hair and though I go much lighter in the summer, the Ash Blonde color is always perfect.  </li>
            <li>She was super happy with it and for how long it stayed on</li>
            <li>My hair varies from light blonde to platinum and will be silver next, and this is the perfect color for any and all between as well.</li>
            <li>It is definitely darker on your eyes than it looks in the compact, and I recommend trying it out in a store for a good match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A much cheaper pencil by Revlon does a better job.</li>
            <li>love it-easy to use-soft look of a natural brow and worth the money for sure/</li>
            <li>I like simple but effective.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply looks natural!</li>
            <li>I love the two shades to make it look more natural, so you can go as dark or as light as you&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li>This eyebrow powder is soft and goes on easy.  </li>
            <li>Love the way this brow powder goes on, smooth.&lt;br /&gt;You can make it as dark or as light as you</li>
            <li>Doesnt come with a brush - but powder is smooth &amp; looks natural..</li>
            <li>Not weird looking like over-the-counter pencils.</li>
            <li>I have relatively thin eyebrows and just use a bit of this to make them appear a bit fuller, and the impact it has on the rest of my face is incredible, IMO.</li>
            <li>Best of all, it doesn&#x27;t even look like I have anything on - which is a huge thing because what&#x27;s worse than obviously painted on eyebrows?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At $23, it was way more than I&#x27;ve ever spent on my brows but worth every penny.     </li>
            <li>I use the lighter side for the general brow and then the darker side for any spots that need filled or edges that need to be extended to even them out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m never going t buy this again and will seek a much healthier alternative than this junk.</li>
            <li>I have also brushed on the color as opposed to using a pencil because it is more natural.    </li>
            <li>Probably only &#x27;older&#x27; folks remember Woolworths and their fabulous make-up aisles.  </li>
            <li>This particular product has to much gray undertone for my coloring.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend the &#x27;Taupe&#x27; Anastasia Brow Powder.</li>
            <li>The texture is very creamy and soft.</li>
            <li>so of course I didn&#x27;t normally apply except for work and Church.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m dirty blonde and taupe is probably the best shade I could pick out to match my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They look very natural too.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The really lovely thing about this product, beyond the color match and very silky feeling of the powder, is that you just need a little bit applied with a stiffer brush for a big impact.</li>
            <li>The light for darker areas and dark for lighter areas.  </li>
            <li>I next bought 2 taupe brow shapers from Clinique and they were also perfect--lasting over two decades (where did that exact color go?).    </li>
            <li>Just right for those who want/need more subtle brows!  </li>
            <li>I expected it to be light, but it barely shows up at all.  </li>
            <li>I mean I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s safe in small amounts</li>
            <li>I just brush it on and apply clear mascara to set.    </li>
            <li>etc just do not look natural.  </li>
            <li>The picture doesn&#x27;t really match the actual product as well as it should.</li>
            <li>Natural looking powder.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using my old plastic applicator that I periodically stick in the dishwasher</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m conscious about the ingredients.</li>
            <li>what&#x27;s inside it, but I feel its worth mentioning to other buyers.</li>
            <li>I have a dark blonde to light brown hair color...</li>
            <li>Oh, how fun to wander up and down to just explore.  </li>
            <li>And I love the little mirror!!!</li>
            <li>It is high quality and will last a long time.</li>
            <li>There are so many bad chemicals and so many types of parabens--which can negatively affect or alter your hormones.</li>

            <li> You can put it on heavy and dramatic or run a spoolie through to make them more natural.</li>
            <li> This does look natural and it&#x27;s not too dark.  </li>
            <li> but why spend this kind of money for something that I know is bad?</li>
            <li> I have dark blonde hair.</li>
            <li> (I typically go into makeup stores with a very specific list to avoid spending tons of money on a whim, ha!)</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have noted, most eyebrow pencils and shadows are very unrealistic in color.</li>
            <li> She wanted this amongst some other makeup products.</li>
            <li> Everything was too dark and or powderly (in other words, powder would also fall below my eyes to my cheeks and smudge).  </li>
            <li> The pigmentation is little to none.</li>
            <li> $22 seems like an awful lot for this tiny compact, but a little bit goes a long way, and for the effect it has on the rest of my face, I think it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In terms of staying power, I do not use an eyebrow gel because they make my eyebrows stiff and uncomfortable (like hairspray on your face - gross), but this powder seems to hold up well without one.</li>
            <li> I use it with a small angle brush and it fills in all my gaps.  </li>
            <li> --it&#x27;s brow powder, not full face foundation (a lot of which has even worse ingredients btw),</li>
            <li> I randomly came across this at Ulta the other day</li>
            <li> This part of my review doesn&#x27;t effect my review rating as it&#x27;s not some forbidden secret</li>
            <li> Lame.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed with this product at all and won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love the way this brow powder goes on, smooth.&lt;br /&gt;You can make it as dark or as light as you wish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish they would provide a brow brush.  Best Eyebrow powder I have found so far.</li>
            <li> Doesnt come with a brush - but powder is smooth &amp; looks natural..</li>
            <li> love it-easy to use-soft look of a natural brow and worth the money for sure/</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  It has always come in the metal container shown.  This container will last longer and is a functional container allowing for mixture of the product around the edges. The plastic one which they do not show you but send you does not have this nice ledge around it.  Otherwise the product appears to be the same.  It goes on very nicely and stays all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many over the counter pencils for my brows, but this compact is great.  You will need need the sourcils, which is a gel that you brush on like mascara in order for the powder to adhere and stay on all day.  But the color is perfect for a blonde.  Not weird looking like over-the-counter pencils.</li>
            <li> This product tells the truth! Easy to apply looks natural! I will use forever, thank you.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Color is perfect and it doesn&#x27;t flake at all.  Love it.</li>
            <li> This eyebrow powder is soft and goes on easy.  I like it a lot.  I have very blonde eyebrows and anything with waxes etc just do not look natural.  This does look natural and it&#x27;s not too dark.  I try others but keep going back to this.  Does not look drawn on either.</li>
            <li> Fills bare spots very good plus two colors to choose from.. The light for darker areas and dark for lighter areas.  I have used this product for years and it is definitely an excellent products.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing.... Love this product!!  Taupe for blonde hair is perfect.  I use it with a small angle brush and it fills in all my gaps.  And I love the little mirror!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright.  I expected it to be light, but it barely shows up at all.  The pigmentation is little to none. Lame.</li>
            <li> My hair varies from light blonde to platinum and will be silver next, and this is the perfect color for any and all between as well. There&#x27;s zero orange or yellow and it provides a cool, fair tone. The texture is very creamy and soft. I use the lighter side for the general brow and then the darker side for any spots that need filled or edges that need to be extended to even them out. You can put it on heavy and dramatic or run a spoolie through to make them more natural.</li>
            <li> Just right for those who want/need more subtle brows!  I&#x27;ve been looking for something like this.  And the latch secures well!</li>
            <li> This particular product has to much gray undertone for my coloring. The picture doesn&#x27;t really match the actual product as well as it should.</li>
            <li> This powder is perfect.  And beautifully packaged.  My only regret is not having ordered it sooner and wasting my money on the others.  Thank you !</li>
            <li> Bought this item for my girlfriend for a stocking stuffer this last xmas. She wanted this amongst some other makeup products. She was super happy with it and for how long it stayed on</li>

I love the two shades to make it look more natural, so you can go as dark or as light as you&#x27;d like.  And with the brow pencil they offer that you have an option to buy, it goes perfectly and lets you apply just the right shading.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed with this product at all and won&#x27;t be buying again. A much cheaper pencil by Revlon does a better job.</li>
            <li> Natural looking powder. Great product! I have dark blonde hair. This is a great shade for my brows!</li>
            <li> Since I am so very, very fair, I have always had to color my brows and lashes--they at one time were almost white so quite invisible.  I&#x27;ve been using brow powder since college and that has been 40+ years (Eeek). I have also brushed on the color as opposed to using a pencil because it is more natural.    Probably only &#x27;older&#x27; folks remember Woolworths and their fabulous make-up aisles.  Oh, how fun to wander up and down to just explore.  This is where I bought my first, wonderful eye brow powder.  It came inside a plastic container that had a great brow brush attached at one end while the powder was in a removable receptacle that fit perfectly inside. I bought two and they lasted well over a decade. FYI, I was a teacher so of course I didn&#x27;t normally apply except for work and Church.  I next bought 2 taupe brow shapers from Clinique and they were also perfect--lasting over two decades (where did that exact color go?).    After reading that make-up should constantly be replaced, I threw out my almost gone powder and began a quest to find my match. Everything was too dark and or powderly (in other words, powder would also fall below my eyes to my cheeks and smudge).  I tried almost everything in my price range (I am now a retired teacher, not a retired millionaire) and almost gave up until I discovered Anastasia. At $23, it was way more than I&#x27;ve ever spent on my brows but worth every penny.     I think that most of us who are blonde and fair have eyebrows that are really a light &#x27;taupe&#x27; so, FINALLY, I found the Anastasia Brow Powder Duo - *TAUPE*.  And, guess what-they&#x27;re a perfect match.  I&#x27;m still using my old plastic applicator that I periodically stick in the dishwasher but I at last have eyebrows, again.  They look very natural too.  I just brush it on and apply clear mascara to set.    I HIGHLY recommend the &#x27;Taupe&#x27; Anastasia Brow Powder.</li>
            <li> I like this powder. It is high quality and will last a long time. It looks great on. I&#x27;m dirty blonde and taupe is probably the best shade I could pick out to match my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it&#x27;s only after I purchased it I&#x27;m conscious about the ingredients. I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it had I cared then. I didn&#x27;t know what they were. This part of my review doesn&#x27;t effect my review rating as it&#x27;s not some forbidden secret what&#x27;s inside it, but I feel its worth mentioning to other buyers. There are so many bad chemicals and so many types of parabens--which can negatively affect or alter your hormones. I&#x27;m never going t buy this again and will seek a much healthier alternative than this junk. I&#x27;m going to use it because it looks nice and I&#x27;m not wasteful, but when it&#x27;s done, so am I with this product. I mean I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s safe in small amounts--it&#x27;s brow powder, not full face foundation (a lot of which has even worse ingredients btw), but why spend this kind of money for something that I know is bad? I&#x27;m going to support a healthy, more &amp;#34;honest&amp;#34; sort of business and do both myself and a more deserving company a favor. Honest, they are because they list their ingredients but makeup companies sure don&#x27;t warn you about what you&#x27;re about to use.</li>
            <li> Best I have ever used for sparse brows. Love it.</li>
            <li> Eyebrows frame the face and can make such an impact on how you look!  I have been using Anastasia&#x27;s Brow Duo ever since I saw it on Oprah, and it is the bomb of eyebrow color out there!  I have blond hair and though I go much lighter in the summer, the Ash Blonde color is always perfect.  I appply it with the dual angled brush of the same brand, another must have.  You want tv-anchor brows? Here it is!</li>
            <li> I have a dark blonde to light brown hair color...eyebrows are darker and this color is PERFECT for me!  I love it!!</li>
