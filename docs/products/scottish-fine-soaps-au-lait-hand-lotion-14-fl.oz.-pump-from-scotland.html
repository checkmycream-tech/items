            <li>This product could not be any better.</li>
            <li>wanted to love it, but the scent is too pervasive.</li>
            <li>I love this Lotion</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pleasant scent (smells exactly like baby powder to me)</li>
            <li>It was a nice clean smell (but not too soapy or detergent-like) and does a pretty good job smoothing and softening skin.</li>
            <li>great smell, great price, excellent lotion does the job, only need a small amount</li>
            <li>I love this clean, soapy scent.</li>
            <li>And this particular size is a good value.</li>
            <li>Clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>This hand cream has a nice gentle scent, and works really well.  </li>
            <li>Even after years of being a loyal Amazon customer I have never reviewed an item, but this lotion deserves it.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave your hands slippery.  </li>

            <li>the whole family uses it.  </li>
            <li>It has a soft clean scent and makes my hands feel soft immediately.</li>
            <li>It gets absorbed quickly, just like all the other reviews said.</li>
            <li>Ultimately, I found I was only willing to use this right before bed, and I already have a heavier overnight lotion I prefer to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves you hands soft and supple.not greasy.</li>
            <li>It has a heavy, cheap, perfumed smell which does not leave you even after repeated washing.  </li>
            <li>This lotion smells so good,and makes my hands so soft.</li>
            <li>So far, two people have used the products.  </li>
            <li>It was nearly 90 degree the day.</li>
            <li>I can not say whether it makes my hands soft because I have soft hands to begin with.</li>

            <li> it makes your hands feel so soft.</li>
            <li> Sadly, this is either a cheap knock-off or a US-version which does not compare.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for a long time.  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t burn when my hands are extremely dry, like other creams do.  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t fade at all, even after the lotion is fully absorbed into the skin.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> taste my food because the baby powder scent coming from my hands is overpowering the other smells.  </li>
            <li> If I use the lotion before sitting down to a meal, I can&#x27;t fully smell/</li>
            <li> it hidden so it doesn&#x27;t disappear</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey.</li>
            <li> I find it a little on the watery side.</li>
            <li> Has helped heal a patch of skin on my husband&#x27;s hand that was frostbitten earlier this winter.  </li>
            <li> This is really bad.</li>
            <li> It does not hydrate my hands and is just a bad product.</li>
            <li> Too bad they have discontinued this lotion.</li>

            <li> This is really bad. It is mostly liquid substance, not lotion. Has no smell and whatever smell there is does not smell good at all.  It does not hydrate my hands and is just a bad product. Regret whatever I paid for it!</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion for the hands I have ever found.  The fresh scent is heaven.  Somewhat pricey, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> This hand cream has a nice gentle scent, and works really well.  It also doesn&#x27;t burn when my hands are extremely dry, like other creams do.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> love this and was happy to find it again  on Amazon.  The scent is lovely.</li>
            <li> Best I have ever tried, You have to try it ! Leaves you hands soft and supple.not greasy. wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find this lotion. Thank you Amazon.  I use it every day. It has s wonderful scent and feels great on my hands.</li>
            <li> Love this cream; smells great and drys quickly.  Great stuff</li>
            <li> This is such a lovely product.  I have purchased everything in the line.  The Scottish create the most wonderful soaps ever!</li>
            <li> great smell, great price, excellent lotion does the job, only need a small amount</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite lotions. It was a nice clean smell (but not too soapy or detergent-like) and does a pretty good job smoothing and softening skin. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Even after years of being a loyal Amazon customer I have never reviewed an item, but this lotion deserves it. It has a soft clean scent and makes my hands feel soft immediately. I wish that I could buy this and the Body Butter in bulk. This product could not be any better.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave your hands slippery.  It&#x27;s a pleasant scent (smells exactly like baby powder to me) but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t fade at all, even after the lotion is fully absorbed into the skin.  I&#x27;m not hyper-sensitive to smells, and this doesn&#x27;t give me a headache - the volume is just too high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I pet the cat, the cat smells like baby powder for a couple of days afterward.  If I use the lotion before sitting down to a meal, I can&#x27;t fully smell/taste my food because the baby powder scent coming from my hands is overpowering the other smells.  No point in wearing a fragrance either, when I have this on. Ultimately, I found I was only willing to use this right before bed, and I already have a heavier overnight lotion I prefer to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to love it, but the scent is too pervasive.</li>
            <li> It was O.K but I gave to my sister in- law</li>
            <li> This is an awesome lotion.  It has a great smell and moisturizes well.  It does not leave a greasy film.  Too bad they have discontinued this lotion.</li>
            <li> I had used this lotion (and soap) while I was visiting University of Cambridge in UK and absolutely loved it.  Sadly, this is either a cheap knock-off or a US-version which does not compare.  It has a heavy, cheap, perfumed smell which does not leave you even after repeated washing.  And the lotion does not coat or protect.  I gave it away ...</li>
            <li> This lotion smells so good,and makes my hands so soft. The only fault I have with it is the price. It is a little pricey.</li>
            <li> soft hands excellent product</li>
            <li> Good unisex smell.  Soft and mellow like fresh farm food.  Clean feeling.  Not sticky.  I put this by the kitchen and bathroom sink and the whole family uses it.  None of the men think it is &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34;.  Has helped heal a patch of skin on my husband&#x27;s hand that was frostbitten earlier this winter.  Rich formula but rubs right in without gooey feeling.  I will keep buying this.</li>
            <li> Very nice!!  I put this lotion in our spare bathroom along with the same name product pump soap.  So far, two people have used the products.  Both individuals came up to me to let me know how nice the products are.  They really liked the fragrance.  Very pleased........</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for a long time.  It is hydrating and smells great.  And this particular size is a good value.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion smells great feels great&lt;br /&gt;Gave one as a gift to my daughter who loves it&lt;br /&gt;Keep it hidden so it doesn&#x27;t disappear</li>
            <li> Everyone gave this product 5 stars so I decided to give it a try. This lotion smells really nice. I love this clean, soapy scent. Now I want to try the soap! Back to this lotion. It gets absorbed quickly, just like all the other reviews said. I find it a little on the watery side. The fact that my package was left on the steps may have something to do with it. It was nearly 90 degree the day. I can not say whether it makes my hands soft because I have soft hands to begin with. I gave it 4 stars because it is a good price to pay for a 14 oz lotion.</li>
            <li> Best smelling lotion ever</li>
            <li> I love this Lotion it makes your hands feel so soft.</li>
